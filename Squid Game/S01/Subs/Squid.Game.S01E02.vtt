Sang-woo.

01:30.715 --> 01:31.925
You helped me. Thank you.

01:37.514 --> 01:38.598
And you did too.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.227
You saved my life out there.

01:43.978 --> 01:46.397
You're alive. That is what matters.

[alarm buzzing]

01:57.200 --> 01:58.201
[door clanking]

02:00.370 --> 02:02.705
[masked manager] You have all made it
through the first game.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.040
Congratulations.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.125
-You're moving on.
-[sighs]

02:05.208 --> 02:07.961
I will now announce the results
of the first game.

02:16.594 --> 02:17.929
[sighs]

02:18.513 --> 02:22.559
[masked manager] Out of 456 players,
255 were eliminated,

02:22.642 --> 02:25.812
and 201 players successfully
completed the first game.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.147

-[woman 1] Mister, please.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.488
[sobs]
Listen. I'm so sorry.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.240
I swear I will pay what I owe.

02:37.323 --> 02:41.035
I'll do it, I'll pay it all.
[crying]

02:41.119 --> 02:43.454
Please, sir.
[sobs]

02:44.122 --> 02:45.957
I have a child.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.001
Oh! So young,

02:48.084 --> 02:52.422
I need to register,
and I still need to name my child, sir.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.840
[cries]

02:53.923 --> 02:57.719
-[woman 1] Please, sir, let me leave.
-[woman 2] Please. I'm so sorry.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.972
Sir, I'm begging you.
Let me leave and I swear

03:01.598 --> 03:03.474
I'll find a way to pay it all.

03:03.558 --> 03:04.893
-Let me go home.
-[woman 3] Me too.

03:04.976 --> 03:08.146
I can't keep going.
Sir, please, I can't go on.

03:08.229 --> 03:11.149
-[players clamor]
-[man 1] Please let me go home.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.235
[masked manager]
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

03:14.319 --> 03:17.614
We are not trying to hurt you
or collect your debts.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.826
Let me remind you
that we're here to give you a chance.

03:21.910 --> 03:22.911
[man 2] A chance?

03:23.620 --> 03:24.871
We play some kids games.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.333
And you shoot us.
You want me to choose that?

03:28.958 --> 03:30.418
That's some chance.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.795
We may be in debt, sir…
[cries]

03:32.879 --> 03:34.714
…but that doesn't justify killing us all.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.175
-[masked manager] This is just a game.
-[all murmur]

03:37.258 --> 03:38.593
Killing everyone out there was a…

03:39.302 --> 03:40.470
game to you, huh?

03:40.553 --> 03:43.514
They were simply eliminated
for breaking the rules of the game.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.808
If you just follow the rules,

03:45.892 --> 03:49.562
you can leave this place safely
with the prize money we promised.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.023
Just keep your damn money. I don't care!

03:53.566 --> 03:55.902
Let me just go home. That's all I want.

03:55.985 --> 03:58.446
-[indistinct chatter]
-[man 3] Let us leave. Let us go.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.949
[masked manager] Consent form clause 1.

04:01.032 --> 04:03.451
A player is not allowed to stop playing.

04:03.534 --> 04:06.162
Come on! You think
you'll get away with this, huh?

04:06.871 --> 04:08.373
[Player 119] The police will come.

04:08.456 --> 04:12.418
They'll bust in here any minute now.
They'll be here since we all disappeared.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.212
Yeah.

04:15.380 --> 04:19.425
And I bet they have
everybody's phones tracked here already.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.303
Look at all your hostages.
You're doomed if you don't let us go!

04:22.387 --> 04:23.304
-We're all dead!
-[gunshot]

04:23.388 --> 04:24.806

[cocking]

04:31.187 --> 04:32.480
Consent form clause 2.

04:33.064 --> 04:36.526
A player who refuses to play
will be eliminated.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.945
[Sang-woo] Consent form clause 3.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.448
If all the players agreed to stop playing,

04:43.199 --> 04:44.659
the games are allowed to end.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.327
Or am I wrong?

04:51.124 --> 04:52.417
[masked manager] You are correct.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.962
So let's vote on ending this.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.090
If the majority wishes
to leave this place,

04:59.674 --> 05:01.509
then everyone gets to go home, right?

05:05.263 --> 05:06.556
All right, as you wish.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.517
We will take a vote to decide
on the termination of the game.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.436
[players muttering]

05:13.730 --> 05:15.023
Before we vote,

05:15.106 --> 05:19.068
let me announce the prize money
for the game as previously promised.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.197

[chiptune music rises]

06:04.322 --> 06:05.573
[chiptune music stops]

06:05.656 --> 06:09.702
[masked manager] A total of 255 players
were eliminated during the first game.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.371
A hundred million won
is at stake per player.

06:12.455 --> 06:17.627
Therefore, 25.5 billion won of prize money
has been accumulated so far.

06:17.710 --> 06:21.089
If you wish to give up on playing,
the 25.5 billion won

06:21.172 --> 06:23.925
will be sent to the bereaved families
of the late players,

06:24.008 --> 06:25.384
100 million won each.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.888
However, you will all return home
empty-handed.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.058
Uh, sir…

06:33.601 --> 06:37.063
So then, if we can complete all six games,

06:37.772 --> 06:39.524
how much do we get?

06:39.607 --> 06:41.943
[masked manager]
Since there were 456 players,

06:42.026 --> 06:45.113
the total prize money is 45.6 billion won.

06:45.696 --> 06:48.574
And with that,
we will now begin the voting.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.746
As you can see,
there are two buttons in front of you.

06:53.830 --> 06:57.500
If you wish to continue playing,
press the green button with an O.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.210
If you wish to stop playing,

06:59.293 --> 07:02.088
then please press the red button
with the X instead.

07:02.171 --> 07:04.048
After you finish voting,

07:04.132 --> 07:06.676
move to the other side
of the white line and wait.

07:06.759 --> 07:10.471
Voting will be done in reverse order
of the numbers on your chests.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.808
Player 456, please cast your vote.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.721
[Player 119] Have you all gone crazy?

09:16.514 --> 09:17.640
We have to leave.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.308
We can't keep putting up
with this insanity.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.018
[Player 212] So what if we leave?

09:22.270 --> 09:23.771
Tell me, what changes?

09:24.772 --> 09:28.025
Just as bad out there
as it is in here, goddamn it.

09:28.109 --> 09:28.943
[scoffs]

09:29.026 --> 09:30.194
She's right!

09:31.153 --> 09:34.365
If we stop right now,
that only helps the ones who are dead.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.285
They'll get a 100 million won and not us.

09:37.368 --> 09:40.288
We made it through! They're out!
That money is ours.

09:40.371 --> 09:43.332
Please! Think about
what just happened out there.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.543
Come on, let's go!
[whimpers]

09:46.335 --> 09:47.795
Where am I supposed to go, huh?

09:48.796 --> 09:51.382
Out there, I don't stand a chance.
I do in here.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.176
No, I've got nothing out there.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.388
Come on, let's finish this thing!

09:57.471 --> 10:00.933
I'd rather stay and keep on trying in here
than go back to the bullshit out there.

10:01.017 --> 10:04.228
You jerk! You got some kind of death wish?
Go die alone!

10:04.312 --> 10:06.314
Don't drag everybody else
into this, you little shit!

10:06.397 --> 10:08.149
-What the hell are you doing?
-Who are you--

10:08.232 --> 10:09.567
[both gasp]

10:12.320 --> 10:14.905
[masked manager]
We will not condone any kind of act

10:14.989 --> 10:17.325
that impedes this democratic process.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.370
Now, let us resume and continue voting.

[masked manager] The majority of the
players have voted to terminate the game.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.793
Therefore, this game is now terminated.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.129
Hey! Okay, anybody who wants, they can go.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.923
But let the ones who want,
stay till the end, though.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.967
Half of us has died already!

We can't just stop here!

Please let us stay!

-[man 5] Yes! Let us continue!

12:46.348 --> 12:50.311

that we must say goodbye to you like this.

However, we will not completely
seal the door of opportunity

12:53.731 --> 12:54.607
for all of you.

12:55.274 --> 12:58.277
If the majority of you
wish to participate again,

then we will resume the game.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.073
I help untie you,

14:26.156 --> 14:28.367
then you're just gonna hassle me
for your cash again.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.244
Of course, I'm gonna hassle you.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.871
-[scoffs]
-[Gi-hun] Okay, fine.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.832
Forget the money, okay?
Untie me, I beg you.

14:34.915 --> 14:37.084
[Gi-hun quivering]

14:37.751 --> 14:38.711
Seriously?

14:39.587 --> 14:42.298
Yeah. I swear I'll forget the whole thing.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.632
How can I trust you?

14:43.716 --> 14:47.511
I swear it on my… on my own mother, okay?
[panting]

14:47.595 --> 14:48.470
Pretty please.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.514
Oh, it's freezing. Goddamn it!

14:50.598 --> 14:53.142
That hurts. Shit.
[shivers]

14:53.225 --> 14:54.476
[Gi-hun cries]

14:55.936 --> 14:57.771
[Gi-hun whimpers]

14:58.814 --> 14:59.773
[Gi-hun grunts]

14:59.857 --> 15:01.901
Hey, you little… Come here. Get back here.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.528
My money… give it back. Give it back now!

15:04.612 --> 15:06.488
Give it back!
[grunts]

15:06.572 --> 15:09.033
Give me my money! Give it back! Ow!

15:09.742 --> 15:11.619
Oh, shit. Give me back the money.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.914
-[coughs]
-That's all your mother means to you.

15:16.248 --> 15:19.251
You little… Hold on,
you stop right there. Hey!

15:20.085 --> 15:22.588
Hey! Don't walk away!

15:23.505 --> 15:24.590
God, shit.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.976
[man] Excuse me, sir, where are we?

15:41.148 --> 15:42.149
[Sang-woo] Yeouido.

15:43.817 --> 15:46.779
Where exactly is… Yeouido?

15:51.492 --> 15:52.993
In the center of Seoul.

15:56.622 --> 16:00.793
Uh… sir, sir,
do you have a cell phone on you?

16:02.044 --> 16:03.879
Uh, would you let me borrow it, please?

16:04.922 --> 16:05.839
I'll be quick.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.550
[exhales]

16:10.678 --> 16:14.431
[clicking]

16:15.015 --> 16:16.266
[cashier] That's 2,000 won.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.942
[cell phone buzzing]

16:25.025 --> 16:26.318
CYBER POLICE: SUBPOENA
HAS BEEN SENT.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.695
SANG-WOO, CALL US NOW
AND WE WON'T SUE.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.071
MR. CHO SANG-WOO,
YOUR LOANS ARE…

16:29.154 --> 16:29.989
SEOUL POLICE:
YOU ARE TO ATTEND AT ONCE.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.740
[cell phone buzzing]

16:31.824 --> 16:33.033
[sighs]

16:35.619 --> 16:36.996
[man slurping]

16:48.132 --> 16:49.258
Thank you, sir.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.265
Hello?

16:57.016 --> 16:57.975
[in Hindi]
Hi.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.602
Yes, I had some work.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.105
I'm sorry.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.983
[lighter clicking]

17:09.486 --> 17:11.905
[in English] Here you go.
And thanks again, sir.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.909
Have a good night.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.370
Wait. Stop.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.456
Got money for the bus?

17:20.539 --> 17:21.415
Sorry?

17:21.915 --> 17:23.125
You said you live in Ansan.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.378
You couldn't afford the ramyeon here.
Got money for the ride back?

17:27.546 --> 17:29.506
-Money.
-No. No money.

17:30.049 --> 17:30.883
I'll walk.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.428
You'll walk… all the way to Ansan?

17:47.107 --> 17:49.068
Here, take this for the bus ride home.

17:50.527 --> 17:51.487
I can't. No.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.323
I don't have money to pay you back.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.826
I won't ask you to do that. Take it, okay?

18:03.582 --> 18:05.334
[rustling]

18:09.088 --> 18:10.214
Thank you.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.632
Thank you so much, sir.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.844
Listen, I'm not your sir,
so stop calling me that.

18:16.553 --> 18:17.387
[man] I'm sorry.

18:18.931 --> 18:19.890
Thank you.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.603
Thank you so much.

18:27.022 --> 18:28.107
[Gi-hun] Look, officer.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.651
You've gotta realize
what a massive deal all of this was.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.194
I know it sounds crazy.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.445
Okay, sir.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.490
So you're saying that your kidnappers

18:36.573 --> 18:39.827
rounded up hundreds of people
and had them play a game.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.829
Then went out there
and shot the ones who lost.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.205
-[officer 1] Is that right?
-Yeah.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.124
And they didn't just shoot one or two.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.918
Those people had no mercy.
They killed more than 200!

18:48.001 --> 18:49.002
What game was it then?

18:49.086 --> 18:50.546
You know Red Light, Green Light?

18:51.713 --> 18:52.673
Wait, that's for kids.

18:52.756 --> 18:54.633
-Is that what they made you play?
-Yes.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.261
-And they forced adults to do it?
-I know how it sounds.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.971
And then they shot everyone
who got caught?

18:59.054 --> 19:00.681
How many more times
do you want me to say it?

19:00.764 --> 19:01.723
[officer 2] Mister.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.101
So where did they do it?
Where's the place they were killed?

19:04.184 --> 19:06.395
They had me knocked unconscious,
so how could I know?

19:06.478 --> 19:07.980
I said I don't have any freaking clue.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.481
Then give us the killer's description.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.775
They all had these masks on
the whole time we were there.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.527
[officer 2] Then, wait,
how did you manage to get out?

19:14.153 --> 19:17.364
Hey, look, the players came together
and put it to a vote.

19:17.447 --> 19:20.450
-And since the majority wanted to leave--
-Hold on, okay?

19:20.534 --> 19:22.119
You said you wanted to stop playing,

19:22.202 --> 19:25.080
and the killers, they told you,
"Sure, you can go." Just like that?

19:26.039 --> 19:27.666
-Yeah.
-[laughs]

19:27.749 --> 19:29.960
And what made you want to go there?

19:32.379 --> 19:33.547
Well, they…

19:34.506 --> 19:38.302
-they promised we would get money, so…
-[officer 2] Money?

19:40.345 --> 19:41.388
Yeah.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.473
-We're talking tens of billions of won.
-[chuckles]

19:44.725 --> 19:48.312
Okay. Let me just sum up
everything you've told us so far.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.479
Just so I understand.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.647
You went to play kids' games

19:50.731 --> 19:52.733
because someone told you
you'd get all that cash.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.860
So then they had you play
some Red Light, Green Light,

19:54.943 --> 19:56.695
and they shot everyone who got caught.

19:56.778 --> 19:59.448
But when you said you wanted to go,
they said, "Okay, just go,"

19:59.531 --> 20:02.701
and you don't know what they look like
or where this all took place.

20:02.784 --> 20:04.036
Is that everything, mister?

20:05.871 --> 20:06.747
Yeah.

20:07.998 --> 20:08.999
What's your name, sir?

20:09.082 --> 20:11.668
I live in Ssangmun-dong.
My name is Seong Gi-hun.

20:11.752 --> 20:15.047
Seong Gi-hun, you got someone
who's taking care of you?

20:15.547 --> 20:19.092
If you want me to help, we can call around
and get you to a local medical center.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.260
What do you take me for?

20:20.344 --> 20:22.888
Look, I'm a tax-paying citizen
of Ssangmun-dong. Got it?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.099
Here's their number.
It's on a business card.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.143
Call and see what they say! Jeez!

20:29.311 --> 20:31.271
[breathing heavily]

20:41.114 --> 20:42.741
-[dial tone, beeping]
-[heavy breathing]

20:48.580 --> 20:49.748
[line rings]

20:51.041 --> 20:53.794
[huffing]

20:53.877 --> 20:55.796
-[ringing continues]
-[line clicks]

20:56.505 --> 20:57.923
-[woman] Hello?
-Uh…

20:58.715 --> 21:02.052
Hello, yes, sorry for bothering you.
Uh, my bad.

21:02.135 --> 21:04.638
Um, would you mind if I ask you something?

21:04.721 --> 21:05.764
[woman] Who is this?

21:05.847 --> 21:07.349
-Well, I…
-[whispers] Hey, you're not a cop, okay?

21:07.432 --> 21:09.977
Uh… Uh, sorry to call so early.

21:10.602 --> 21:14.564
Could I come play in those games there?

21:15.107 --> 21:16.775
[woman] Games?

21:16.858 --> 21:20.362
Uh, yeah. See,
games are my thing, you know.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.072
I'll play all the games you ask me to.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.824
-I'll do the best--
-[woman] Okay. Hold on.

21:25.701 --> 21:26.785
Who the heck are you?

21:26.868 --> 21:29.246
And why are you calling me this early
with this nonsense?

21:30.205 --> 21:32.624
If you wanna play games,
go to an Internet cafe.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.626
What's wrong with you,
you freaking pervert?

21:39.298 --> 21:40.507
[sniffles]

21:43.176 --> 21:44.886
[Gi-hun] You dialed
the wrong number! Let go!

21:44.970 --> 21:47.347
-Officer, don't do this. Please.
-We're sorry, mister. You better go home.

21:47.431 --> 21:50.600
You sure you dialed the right number, huh?
Better be sure you did!

21:50.684 --> 21:53.770
You'll see.
Look, I'll call and put you on the line.

21:53.854 --> 21:56.523
The right number's on my phone
from the call that I made already.

21:56.606 --> 21:57.733
[whispers]
Fuck this guy.

22:03.071 --> 22:04.281
[beeps]

22:05.782 --> 22:09.036
[operator] I'm sorry. The number
that you have dialed does not exist

22:09.119 --> 22:10.912
or is no longer in service.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.957
Please check the number
and try again later.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.208
Please check the number…

22:17.085 --> 22:18.837
Who was that? Was he drunk?

22:18.920 --> 22:20.672
Some crazy hobo guy.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.758
Everything's crazy around here today.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.926
You, get a grip. Wanna go back in?

22:28.847 --> 22:30.849
Well, I'm out. Have a good one.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.311
[officer 2] Here. Goodbye.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.482
[birds chirping]

22:40.734 --> 22:41.818
Hey, Ma.

22:44.529 --> 22:45.822
It's your son.

22:49.534 --> 22:50.452
Hmm.

22:53.288 --> 22:54.331
Ma?

23:00.253 --> 23:01.463
Where are you?

23:03.131 --> 23:05.300
[cell phone tinkles, beeps]

23:05.383 --> 23:08.929
[operator] The person you are trying
to reach is currently unavailable.

23:09.471 --> 23:12.224
Where'd you go?
You left the door open and everything.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.276
[Gi-hun] Sang-woo.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.823
What are you doing here?

23:28.698 --> 23:29.866
[sighs]

23:31.409 --> 23:33.453
[both sigh]

23:39.709 --> 23:41.086
Is it because of your debt?

23:43.296 --> 23:44.422
Shh…

23:44.506 --> 23:48.593
Hey, come on, you're still
Ssangmun-dong's own pride and joy.

23:48.677 --> 23:52.430
You're still the genius who got accepted
to SNU Business School. So don't worry.

23:52.514 --> 23:53.557
You'll make money again.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.601
Go tell your mom all about it
and make a fresh start.

23:57.644 --> 23:58.812
[scoffs]

23:58.895 --> 23:59.938
Just make…

24:01.356 --> 24:02.649
six billion won?

24:03.358 --> 24:04.776
Six billion?

24:06.528 --> 24:08.238
I thought it was 600 million won.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.074
They don't know everything there is.

24:12.325 --> 24:15.704
And all those stocks that guy said
that you lost, you did that for real?

24:16.288 --> 24:17.747
It wasn't just stocks now.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.294
[inhales]
There was futures too.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.420
Excuse me?

24:24.796 --> 24:25.964
You bet on your future?

24:27.215 --> 24:29.676
[Gi-hun] What kind of bet was it
that you used that much money?

24:31.469 --> 24:33.722
-Did you get a girlfriend?
-Doesn't mean that future.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.767
[sighs]
Just forget it.

24:38.351 --> 24:39.603
[Gi-hun scoffs]

24:40.979 --> 24:42.522
[huffs]

24:42.606 --> 24:45.609
Hey, file for personal bankruptcy then.

24:46.401 --> 24:47.527
Whatever they call it.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.238
I heard you won't have to pay
your debts off if you do that.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.908
I used my own mother's house
as financial collateral.

24:53.617 --> 24:54.451
And her shop.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.412
I put it all on the line.

24:58.538 --> 25:00.665
-[exhales]
-[phone rings]

25:01.541 --> 25:05.045
[ringing continues]

25:07.839 --> 25:08.840
Who is this?

25:12.719 --> 25:13.887
Yeah, this is he.

25:17.599 --> 25:18.516
What?

25:18.600 --> 25:20.518
24-HOUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

25:21.937 --> 25:23.813
-[Gi-hun] Oh.
-[doctor] She's diabetic.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.610
-[sighs]
-She left it untreated, and it got worse.

25:29.527 --> 25:33.031
She had to be in a lot of pain recently.
You didn't know?

25:34.199 --> 25:36.076
Will you be able to treat her for it?

25:36.743 --> 25:39.788
In the worst case,
she might need to have her feet amputated.

25:40.413 --> 25:44.417
Let's keep her here for now
and see how things go with treatment.

25:44.501 --> 25:47.337
[breathing heavily]

25:48.338 --> 25:51.383
[background chatter]

25:51.967 --> 25:52.968
[Gi-hun] Ma.

25:58.014 --> 25:59.015
Ma!

26:00.767 --> 26:01.977
Mom, where are you going?

26:02.686 --> 26:04.396
He said you need to stay here.

26:04.479 --> 26:05.480
I'm okay.

26:06.022 --> 26:07.774
But you're not okay.

26:07.857 --> 26:10.068
Hey, Mom, you can't walk around like that.

26:10.151 --> 26:12.070
-Look, just stop it.
-[breathing heavily]

26:12.153 --> 26:14.197
You haven't been home in days now,

26:14.281 --> 26:16.491
out doing whatever it is
you're doing lately,

26:16.574 --> 26:18.618
but now you're a good son, huh?

26:18.702 --> 26:20.537
Mom, don't be like this, okay?

26:20.620 --> 26:22.539
You know how bad this thing could get?

26:23.164 --> 26:26.793
Tell me. Say I stay here
and they treat me,

26:26.876 --> 26:29.296
who's going to pay the rent in that case?

26:30.046 --> 26:33.967
Also, do you know how much it costs
to be in the hospital,

26:34.050 --> 26:36.845
not to mention how much all the drugs are?

26:36.928 --> 26:38.596
The insurance will help pay for them.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.474
Insurance? Help us?

26:41.975 --> 26:43.393
You canceled all that.

26:44.102 --> 26:48.023
Remember, you ended it
and used up all the cash we had.

26:48.565 --> 26:50.692
Will you please just get a grip?

26:51.318 --> 26:52.319
Goodness.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.321
[Gi-hun's mom sighs]

26:54.946 --> 26:56.031
Gi-hun.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.367
Let's stop. I'm too tired.

27:00.785 --> 27:04.956
I'm too tired to go on.
Stop arguing with me.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.167
Let's end this.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.252
[Gi-hun's mom sighs]

27:10.712 --> 27:11.880
[sighs]

27:12.964 --> 27:15.592
Damn it. I'll get what you need.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.386
I'll get all the money you need.
[sniffs]

27:23.725 --> 27:24.642
Hello, Ma.

27:26.853 --> 27:28.980
Heading over to his apartment right now.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.568
I'm sure he's fine, okay?

27:33.651 --> 27:36.571
He dodges our calls all the time.
You know what he's like.

27:39.449 --> 27:42.660
I can call everyone who might know places
he's hold up in before.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.413
If I can't reach him then,

27:46.331 --> 27:48.458
then I'll go report him missing tomorrow.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.630
I'm a police officer.
Have you forgotten that?

27:54.672 --> 27:55.924
I will find him.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.885
[young officer] Yes, Mom.
Don't worry too much.

28:00.303 --> 28:01.304
[distant dog barking]

28:01.388 --> 28:03.431
[young officer] How long
has it been since he came by?

28:04.349 --> 28:07.143
Well, I don't bother tenants every day.

28:07.227 --> 28:09.979
Still, I mean,
his rent was due a week ago.

28:10.063 --> 28:12.482
I've stopped by every day since then,

28:12.565 --> 28:15.985
he was never here, though,
and never picked up his phone.

28:17.654 --> 28:18.738
There.

28:18.822 --> 28:21.866
That's right.
Think you could pay his rent?

28:23.284 --> 28:26.996
Otherwise, you'll have to come
move all of his things out.

28:29.457 --> 28:31.543
I'll take a look now
and pay his rent later.

28:32.794 --> 28:33.962
[landlord giggles]

28:35.130 --> 28:36.464
Well, I'll be down the hall.

28:43.304 --> 28:44.806
[light switch clicks]

28:50.353 --> 28:52.564
THEORY OF DESIRE, JACQUES LACAN
RENÉ MAGRITTE

28:54.357 --> 28:57.360
[foreboding music]

29:20.467 --> 29:21.551
[young officer] Was he drunk?

29:21.634 --> 29:23.595
Some crazy hobo guy.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.263
[officer 1] Everything's crazy
around here today.

29:31.019 --> 29:32.896
Hey, I got ice cream, everyone.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.774
[kids laugh]

29:41.112 --> 29:43.948
What? No ice cream for you, little man?

29:50.580 --> 29:52.248
How did you get your face like that?

29:53.583 --> 29:54.959
Did you get into a fight?

29:59.130 --> 30:00.632
If you're not gonna talk to me,

30:01.132 --> 30:02.008
I guess I'll just go.

30:07.180 --> 30:09.849
Wait. I don't wanna stay here, okay?

30:11.935 --> 30:13.770
Where's Mom? You said she would come soon.

30:15.188 --> 30:17.148
You told me that we'd be together.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.651
that I just had to wait a month.

30:23.530 --> 30:24.447
Cheol.

30:26.449 --> 30:28.618
-Listen--
-All the kids told me you lied.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.870
They said I'd never leave and…

30:32.497 --> 30:34.290
They said I'd get abandoned here.

30:38.628 --> 30:39.712
They're wrong.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.339
[Cheol sniffles]

30:41.422 --> 30:43.466
And Mom and Dad will be here soon.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.301
[Cheol sniffles]

30:45.385 --> 30:47.428
I swear, okay?
I'll make sure that they do.

30:50.890 --> 30:54.477
Don't worry. Listen, we'll all live
under the same roof next year, okay?

30:54.561 --> 30:55.520
[sniffles]

30:58.356 --> 30:59.399
I'm your big sis.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.694
I always keep my word, don't I?

31:02.777 --> 31:04.821
[kids chattering, laughing]

31:12.871 --> 31:16.749
Ah, you mean the stupid game guy?
That guy?

31:16.833 --> 31:19.127
What do you need his name for,
Detective Hwang?

31:19.210 --> 31:21.629
I saw that he looked familiar to me.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.424
I think I know the guy
like to a family friend or something.

31:24.507 --> 31:25.425
Really?

31:26.009 --> 31:27.093
Let me think about it.

31:27.176 --> 31:31.306
-Something like Saeng or Seong or--
-[officer 1] Seong Gi-hun.

31:31.389 --> 31:34.434
-Ssangmun-dong is where he lives, right?
-You're right. Seong Gi-hun.

31:34.517 --> 31:35.768
[officer 2] Is he your friend?

31:36.686 --> 31:38.187
Uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

31:38.938 --> 31:42.108
Uh, and how about getting his address too?

31:42.191 --> 31:44.402
[machine rumbling]

31:46.905 --> 31:48.573
[worker] Hey, Ali! Long time no see!

31:56.831 --> 31:59.208
-Hey, Ali.
-[Ali] Why won't you answer my calls?

31:59.292 --> 32:00.627
You called, huh?

32:00.710 --> 32:01.836
And now you're here.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.713
[Ali's boss] What's up?
Is something wrong?

32:03.796 --> 32:06.299
Sir, stop. Pay what you owe me now.

32:07.592 --> 32:08.676
[sighs]

32:08.760 --> 32:10.929
Yeah. Don't you remember?

32:11.012 --> 32:14.057
I told you, I've got no money.
Business isn't going so well.

32:14.140 --> 32:16.392
Look at what working here
did to my body, sir.

32:16.476 --> 32:18.937
I couldn't afford the hospital either.
[breathing heavily]

32:19.020 --> 32:20.647
Now look here, I gotta go.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.774
-Give me the wages you owe.
-[Ali's boss] Damn it.

32:22.857 --> 32:25.360
Go and ask the rest of my employees
if they got their paychecks yet.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.320
I can't pay anyone till I get the cash!

32:27.862 --> 32:30.657
Hey, I got pain everywhere, Ali.

32:31.157 --> 32:33.576
I'm so damn broke. I need a doctor.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.870
You said you would pay us.
Where did it all go?

32:36.829 --> 32:37.872
-Six whole months…
-Come on.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.666
…and nothing
for all our hard work out there.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.334
Hey, you little son of a…

32:43.711 --> 32:46.255
Hah! I'm busy now. We'll talk later.

32:47.882 --> 32:50.051
[machines rumbling]

32:52.011 --> 32:53.554
Sir, give me my paycheck.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.057
Sir, please give me my money back.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.684
You little shit, don't touch me.

32:58.267 --> 32:59.769
[Ali] Don't swear at me!

32:59.852 --> 33:01.813
[both grunting]

33:02.730 --> 33:04.232
[Ali] I saw you have money.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.733
-Shut up!
-[Ali] My money!

33:05.817 --> 33:07.193
Give it to me!

33:07.276 --> 33:09.487
-Let me go, son of a bitch!
-[both grunting]

33:09.570 --> 33:11.114
-Give me my money!
-[grinding]

33:11.197 --> 33:14.117
-[screams]
-[worker] What did you do, Ali?

33:14.200 --> 33:16.035
-Stop that. Hey!
-[Ali's boss screaming]

33:16.703 --> 33:17.829
[screaming continues]

33:19.122 --> 33:20.164
Shit!

33:20.248 --> 33:21.833
[worker] Hey, you can't just leave!

33:21.916 --> 33:23.626
[panicked shouts]

33:23.710 --> 33:26.129
SOUTHERN MEN, NORTHERN WOMEN

33:27.755 --> 33:31.009
[man] I completely understand
what your situation is like.

33:32.468 --> 33:33.761
But you know, it's…

33:34.303 --> 33:37.557
A broker can't be tracked down
once they've fled with all of their money.

33:38.141 --> 33:39.934
You aren't the only victim.

33:40.518 --> 33:44.313
There's some who went all the way
to Dandong to try and catch this one guy,

33:44.397 --> 33:46.816
they got caught by the Chinese police,

33:46.899 --> 33:49.235
almost got dragged all the way back North.

33:49.318 --> 33:51.571
My options, what are they? What do I do?

33:53.698 --> 33:56.701
[sighs]
Get another broker and try it all again.

33:57.368 --> 33:58.995
And I'm sure you already know,

33:59.078 --> 34:02.790
but you're going to need
to start the process over again.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.043
How much is it?

34:05.626 --> 34:06.502
[sighs]

34:06.586 --> 34:09.881
We're gonna start by finding out
your parents location again.

34:10.465 --> 34:13.926
And security around the border
is now much tighter,

34:14.010 --> 34:16.596
so the price for helping them
cross the river shot up.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.139
So how much then?

34:18.890 --> 34:20.099
[inhales sharply]

34:20.683 --> 34:22.351
So you'll want…

34:24.270 --> 34:26.147
at least 40 million.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.440
[glass clinks]

34:28.357 --> 34:29.275
Forty million.

34:29.358 --> 34:32.028
You're only paying
to get them to China, though.

34:32.111 --> 34:33.821
If you want to get them to the South then…

34:33.905 --> 34:34.739
[screams]

34:34.822 --> 34:37.742
[man] That burns! Oh, that's fucking hot.

34:37.825 --> 34:40.286
Damn it.
[whimpers]

34:40.369 --> 34:42.538
I trusted you and brought my money here
like you told me.

34:44.665 --> 34:46.959
That money is something
I risked my own life to get.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.127
[whimpers]

34:48.211 --> 34:49.670
Hey. Uh…

34:49.754 --> 34:52.298
I had no idea.
[whimpers]

34:52.381 --> 34:56.302
I didn't know those people
would just run off with all your money.

34:56.385 --> 34:57.678
Please, I swear.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.264
[breathing shakily]

35:00.973 --> 35:02.100
Sure.

35:03.309 --> 35:04.519
I'll get your money.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.731
-You pull anything on me…
-[whimpers]

35:08.815 --> 35:11.484
…I'll rip your fucking throat wide open,
and that's that.

35:12.985 --> 35:13.903
You got it?

35:13.986 --> 35:15.822
[whimpers]

35:17.824 --> 35:19.492
[relieved sigh]

35:20.076 --> 35:22.370
[exhales in relief]

35:23.913 --> 35:25.665
[panicked cries]

35:35.758 --> 35:37.051
SANG-WOO'S FISH STORE

35:37.135 --> 35:39.679
[Sang-woo's mom] So,
have you been eating all right over there?

35:40.221 --> 35:42.807
[Sang-woo] Yes, I've been eating well,
so don't worry.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.894
I doubt that greasy American food
is doing all that much for you.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.397
-Tell me what you're eating.
-[Sang-woo] It's okay, Mom.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.315
There are lots of Korean restaurants.

35:51.399 --> 35:54.777
Oh, really? That's great.
[chuckles]

35:54.861 --> 35:56.320
So when are you coming back?

35:57.697 --> 36:00.449
Uh, it's taking longer than expected,
so I'm not sure.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.286
-It might be a while.
-Oh, really?

36:03.369 --> 36:04.996
It sure sounds like it's been tough there.

36:06.038 --> 36:06.956
Hey, Mom.

36:07.039 --> 36:08.916
Yes? What?

36:12.962 --> 36:14.589
[woman] Excuse me. Hi.
Excuse me.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.632
I'll take three squids,
prepped and cleaned.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.259
Ah, yes. Wait just a minute.

36:18.342 --> 36:19.760
Sang-woo, there's a customer here.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.805
[Sang-woo's mom] Don't bring me
back anything from your trip.

36:22.889 --> 36:25.391
I don't need anything over here, okay?

36:25.474 --> 36:26.934
-Okay.
-My goodness.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.728
I'm just worried that you might get me,

36:28.811 --> 36:31.105
you know, something that's really
way too expensive.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.483
All right, honey, you should go.
I love you, Sang-woo.

36:34.567 --> 36:35.943
[Sang-woo's mom chuckles]

36:36.027 --> 36:37.486
-You wanted a squid--
-[line beeps]

36:37.570 --> 36:38.571
[scoffs]

36:53.085 --> 36:55.463
[Sang-woo's mom]
Oh, he always gets me a little something

36:55.546 --> 36:59.634
whenever he goes on one of his trips,
he takes for work. Ah!

36:59.717 --> 37:02.511
-[giggles]
-A gentleman too. Sounds amazing.

37:03.638 --> 37:04.639
He went to SNU.

37:06.307 --> 37:07.475
For Business.

37:07.558 --> 37:10.937
-Come on, Business at SNU?
-[chuckles]

37:11.938 --> 37:14.523
[woman] And he's not just smart,
he's handsome too.

37:14.607 --> 37:15.608
Is he married yet?

37:15.691 --> 37:17.360
Not yet. He's single.

37:17.443 --> 37:18.611
[woman] How old is he?

37:18.694 --> 37:20.154
I know someone he might like.

37:20.738 --> 37:23.115
Well, the man's standards
are set pretty high.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.242
[chuckles]

37:25.076 --> 37:26.410
[detective] Hi there. Excuse me.

37:27.870 --> 37:30.206
Are you Mr. Cho Sang-woo's mother?

37:30.289 --> 37:33.334
Uh, yeah. Cho Sang-woo.
Yes, he's my son, sir.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.253
Do you know where your son
happens to be now?

37:35.336 --> 37:37.546
On business in the United States. Uh…

37:37.630 --> 37:40.132
-Why do you ask, sir?
-Well, we're the police.

37:41.092 --> 37:44.387
I'm afraid that Mr. Cho Sang-woo
has a warrant out for his arrest.

37:44.470 --> 37:47.515
He's charged with forgery,
embezzlement, crimes that are all…

37:47.598 --> 37:49.225
some form of financial fraud.

37:49.934 --> 37:50.935
Huh?

37:52.103 --> 37:54.397
No, you can't be right.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.482
[rain pattering]

37:57.108 --> 38:00.987
Uh, no, detectives. You know what,
you know what, there's a mistake.

38:01.070 --> 38:04.490
I know that my son
wouldn't do anything illegal. So…

38:05.199 --> 38:07.326
Listen, I'm sure you love him a lot.

38:07.410 --> 38:10.121
If he contacts you,
just tell him to come to us.

38:10.204 --> 38:12.290
If he keeps avoiding us like this,

38:12.373 --> 38:14.500
when they put him on trial,
it's gonna look bad.

38:18.170 --> 38:19.255
[umbrella opens]

38:27.596 --> 38:30.599
[foreboding music]

38:38.399 --> 38:40.526
[breathes heavily]

38:48.909 --> 38:51.912
[foreboding music continues]

[doorbell dinging]

39:00.546 --> 39:03.466

-[gasps]

[foreboding music]

39:41.212 --> 39:42.213
Hmm?

40:14.578 --> 40:16.539
[Ali's wife in Hindi]
Where did you get this money?

40:17.373 --> 40:19.500
Ali, where did you get this money?

40:21.877 --> 40:23.254
[in Hindi]
Listen carefully.

40:23.337 --> 40:26.757
Buy tickets for the earliest flight
for you and our kid and go home first.

40:26.841 --> 40:29.844
-What about you?
-You two should go first.

40:29.927 --> 40:32.471
I'll be there
as soon as my job here is done.

40:32.555 --> 40:36.934
Something is going on with you, right?

40:37.017 --> 40:38.727
Don't ask anything for now.

40:38.811 --> 40:42.440
You need to pack up and leave right away.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.734
I hope you can understand my problem.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.238
I love you. You and our child.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.700
[Ali's wife sobbing]

40:53.367 --> 40:55.035
[Gi-hun's friend] I don't have any money.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.287
HEALING PUB

40:56.370 --> 40:58.497
[Gi-hun] Just lend me
three million won, please.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.166
I'll pay it all back.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.835
Friends shouldn't talk
to each other like this.

41:02.918 --> 41:05.004
You know how strapped for cash
we both are.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.756
I know that. Of course.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.676
You think I'm happy
asking you for cash, huh?

41:11.594 --> 41:13.637
Look, I'll come
and make deliveries for you, okay?

41:13.721 --> 41:16.849
I'm not paying for delivery man right now.
Look at my bar.

41:16.932 --> 41:18.601
Just the rent is too much.

41:18.684 --> 41:21.270
[rain pattering]

41:21.353 --> 41:23.731
I'll pay you in a month, okay? Huh?

41:24.482 --> 41:27.485
I'll continue my chauffeuring
and come help around here.

41:28.652 --> 41:29.653
Listen.

41:30.571 --> 41:32.573
They told me she needs
to get surgery right away.

41:33.282 --> 41:34.742
Hey, honey.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.952
You should get back in here, okay?

41:37.453 --> 41:38.454
I will soon.

41:38.537 --> 41:41.999
Get in here right now, okay?
And put that out.

[inaudible dialogue]

41:51.800 --> 41:52.927
Hello.

41:54.136 --> 41:55.971
-[woman] Gi-hun.
-Yeah?

41:56.055 --> 41:59.099
Coming out to someone's nice pub
and smoking outside is rude.

42:01.560 --> 42:02.520
Oh, yeah.

42:02.603 --> 42:05.397
[rain pouring]

42:10.653 --> 42:12.947
-[thunder rumbles]
-[sighs]

42:31.882 --> 42:32.967
[Player 1] Wait.

42:34.552 --> 42:35.761
Aren't you…

42:43.602 --> 42:44.812
Oh, it's a small world.

42:45.729 --> 42:46.814
It's you.

42:47.940 --> 42:50.609
-You are Player 456, right?
-Uh, yeah.

42:50.693 --> 42:52.027
I'm, um…
[stammers]

42:52.111 --> 42:54.196
-That's me. Yeah.
-What are the chances?

42:54.280 --> 42:56.615
So then, what are you doing around here?

42:56.699 --> 42:58.534
Actually, I live right down the road.

42:59.159 --> 43:00.327
[Player 1] Oh.

43:00.411 --> 43:01.495
[chuckles]
I see.

43:01.579 --> 43:02.788
-And you?
-Ah.

43:02.871 --> 43:04.957
You come from around this area as well?

43:05.040 --> 43:06.750
Uh, no.
[chuckles]

43:06.834 --> 43:10.546
I have a friend who lives nearby. So…

43:10.629 --> 43:11.505
[laughs]

43:11.589 --> 43:15.259
There isn't anywhere
for this old man to go.

43:15.801 --> 43:18.804
I'm just staying there for a while.

43:18.887 --> 43:20.180
[Player 1 chuckles]

43:20.264 --> 43:21.682
-Uh, goodness.
-Uh…

43:22.474 --> 43:24.518
-Would you like to sit down?
-Sure.

43:25.811 --> 43:27.104
[both chuckle]

43:27.187 --> 43:29.398
What are the odds you're here
at the same time as me?

43:30.107 --> 43:31.358
What are the odds, right?

43:31.942 --> 43:33.152
You know I think…

43:34.153 --> 43:36.071
that we were destined to meet here.

43:36.155 --> 43:37.573
[chuckles]

43:38.157 --> 43:39.074
[Player 1 sighs]

43:39.158 --> 43:41.076
Uh, would you like a little?

43:41.160 --> 43:42.995
Mm. Sure.
[chuckles]

43:43.787 --> 43:44.622
Uh…

43:45.414 --> 43:47.750
Is your head okay?
Are you allowed to drink?

43:47.833 --> 43:49.627
It's all right.
[chuckles]

43:50.210 --> 43:51.962
[Player 1 grunts]

43:52.046 --> 43:53.088
[chuckles]

43:54.548 --> 43:56.008
[slurping]

43:57.384 --> 44:00.846
Uh, sorry. I wish I have some food
for the two of us.

44:00.929 --> 44:02.097
[Player 1] Ah.

44:03.015 --> 44:04.183
It's okay.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.033
[in muffled voice]
Oh, hey, hold on.

44:21.950 --> 44:23.869
You're absolutely sure
you could have this much?

44:23.952 --> 44:26.205
-I mean, you had a lot of already.
-Mm-hm.

44:27.956 --> 44:30.751
[thunder rumbles]

44:31.251 --> 44:32.503
[slurps]

44:33.504 --> 44:34.505
I…

44:36.006 --> 44:38.676
decided to going again.

44:38.759 --> 44:40.552
Hmm. Go where?

44:43.931 --> 44:45.182
[Player 1 clears throat]

44:47.726 --> 44:48.727
You're going there?

44:52.314 --> 44:53.440
Since my…

44:54.566 --> 44:56.402
time's almost out as it is.

44:56.485 --> 44:57.528
I don't want…

44:58.654 --> 45:00.739
to sit around waiting to die.

45:00.823 --> 45:02.157
That sounds pathetic.

45:04.034 --> 45:05.244
And who knows

45:05.869 --> 45:10.207
I still could go and win the whole thing.

45:10.791 --> 45:13.293
When we played Red Light, Green Light,

45:13.794 --> 45:16.964
I got to the line even before you did.

45:17.047 --> 45:18.632
How could you wanna go there?

45:20.342 --> 45:22.219
But as soon as I got back here,

45:23.095 --> 45:27.975
I got some harsh reminders.
Yeah, what they say is true.

45:28.809 --> 45:32.813
Out here, the torture is worse.

45:32.896 --> 45:34.440
[chuckles]

45:36.233 --> 45:39.236
[somber music]

45:40.070 --> 45:42.197
[thunder rumbles]

45:43.031 --> 45:45.784
[fanfare music playing in the carnival]

45:47.453 --> 45:48.579
[thug] Hey, boss!

45:50.289 --> 45:51.707
What took you so long?

45:51.790 --> 45:53.917
All these stupid drunks
got into a huge fight

45:54.001 --> 45:55.961
as I was about to leave the bar
and head here.

45:56.670 --> 45:58.505
Ah, you know how it goes.
[chuckles]

45:58.589 --> 46:01.633
Something about a Friday night
always brings out the weirdos.

46:01.717 --> 46:03.719
-The money?
-Oh.

46:06.263 --> 46:08.140
I couldn't get more on short notice.

46:08.223 --> 46:10.434
I'll make sure the rest
will come in soon, okay?

46:11.101 --> 46:14.605
And anyways, the Big Boss sent out
all the boys to find you

46:14.688 --> 46:17.149
Incheon and Ilsan,
the whole damn place had eyes.

46:17.232 --> 46:18.275
[scoffs]

46:18.358 --> 46:20.027
Where have you been hiding?

46:20.110 --> 46:23.197
We better not discuss that out here.
Did you drive here?

46:24.072 --> 46:25.991
Yeah, this way.

46:29.536 --> 46:31.246
[engine revs]

46:31.955 --> 46:36.168
So this is the invitation from that whole
Red Light, Green Light game, huh?

46:36.251 --> 46:37.586
Yeah.

46:38.378 --> 46:40.088
This one came yesterday.

46:40.714 --> 46:42.466
They're starting up again.

46:43.175 --> 46:48.055
So then, we go on Tuesday.
Gather all the boys and meet us there.

46:48.680 --> 46:50.265
Get some guns for us too.

46:51.475 --> 46:53.685
-Guns?
-They've got guns, yeah.

46:53.769 --> 46:56.313
Still, the pickup is only one guy.

46:57.648 --> 46:59.441
We'll beat up those masked shitheads,

46:59.525 --> 47:01.777
and then we break in
and take all the cash.

47:01.860 --> 47:05.364
I don't know. How am I supposed to know
how much of that is true?

47:05.447 --> 47:09.159
You bastard. Come on,
tell me what you're getting at.

47:10.744 --> 47:11.662
Sorry, boss.

47:13.080 --> 47:17.501
So they've got tens of billions of won
up in a huge piggy bank up there.

47:18.085 --> 47:20.462
As long as we hit them
with everything we got,

47:20.546 --> 47:24.675
no more dealing with those stupid drunks
at bars to make barely anything, assholes.

47:24.758 --> 47:25.592
[chuckles]

47:26.176 --> 47:27.469
Uh, boss, hold on.

47:28.345 --> 47:32.933
All the guys… you went into hiding
because you mess with the Big Boss.

47:33.016 --> 47:35.477
At this point, all of Incheon knows.

47:35.978 --> 47:37.479
Ahh!

47:37.563 --> 47:40.274
I doubt I'd be able to convince anyone.

47:40.357 --> 47:41.775
Hey, look here, you jerk.

47:41.858 --> 47:44.152
We're gonna do this
so I can get the money I owe him.

47:46.113 --> 47:47.155
So…

47:48.407 --> 47:51.702
in the Philippines, how did you lose
so much money at the casino?

47:53.495 --> 47:54.788
How did you know that?

47:54.871 --> 47:57.708
Boss, you should've known not to go
pushing your luck, you know.

47:57.791 --> 47:59.251
You little piece of shit.

48:05.132 --> 48:06.133
Deok-su.

48:06.216 --> 48:07.259
"Deok-su"?

48:07.342 --> 48:08.844
-[laughs]
-[car horn honks]

48:08.927 --> 48:10.178
[tires screeching]

48:10.762 --> 48:14.474
The guys from the casino
came here looking for you.

48:14.558 --> 48:19.521
They'll take your liver, your kidneys,
and your eyes for the money you owe.

48:19.605 --> 48:20.897
[laughs]

48:20.981 --> 48:23.191
And now you're gonna die,
you fucking asshole!

48:23.275 --> 48:24.735
[cackles]

48:26.695 --> 48:28.655

Hey! Welcome to Korea!

48:49.009 --> 48:49.885
Welcome!

48:50.636 --> 48:52.346
I killed Deok-su, okay?

48:52.846 --> 48:55.390
Come on! Come at me, you bastards.

48:56.516 --> 48:58.852
-[goon 1] Hey!
-[goon 2] Go! Kill Deok-su!

48:59.770 --> 49:00.937
[goon 3] Get him!

49:02.230 --> 49:03.857
[splashes]

49:06.068 --> 49:07.277
[Ga-yeong's mom] Money?

49:07.361 --> 49:08.445
[Gi-hun] Yeah.

49:10.364 --> 49:11.490
[Ga-yeong's mom] How much?

49:14.159 --> 49:15.160
[Gi-hun] About…

49:16.203 --> 49:17.788
two million won.

49:18.538 --> 49:19.915
[Ga-yeong's mom] Two million won?

49:23.460 --> 49:24.503
Yeah.

49:29.216 --> 49:32.010
You think you can come here
and ask for that?

49:32.094 --> 49:36.348
You never paid child support
or any alimony or help us with anything.

49:36.431 --> 49:38.684
And now you're asking us
to give you money?

49:41.395 --> 49:44.606
I'm sorry. It's for… my mom.

49:44.690 --> 49:45.941
She was in the hospital.

49:48.402 --> 49:49.820
[sighs]

49:50.946 --> 49:52.197
And how bad is it?

49:53.782 --> 49:55.283
She has diabetes.

49:56.451 --> 49:58.870
[inhales sharply]
She needs surgery.

50:02.165 --> 50:03.667
[sighs deeply]

50:06.920 --> 50:07.921
[Gi-hun clicks tongue]

50:08.422 --> 50:09.464
Well, I'm broke.

50:10.215 --> 50:11.633
Things have been hard.
[exhales]

50:14.177 --> 50:15.387
[Gi-hun clicks tongue]

50:16.471 --> 50:17.764
Please, I'm begging you.

50:19.433 --> 50:21.518
Mom was always really good to you.

50:21.601 --> 50:23.395
Look how desperate I was to ask you.

50:24.730 --> 50:26.356
And I'll give it back.

50:27.691 --> 50:28.942
I really am broke.

50:29.484 --> 50:31.319
I just get money from my husband.

50:32.362 --> 50:35.031
Well, then could you,
could you ask him for it?

50:35.115 --> 50:36.199
You crazy?

50:38.160 --> 50:39.453
Hey.
[scoffs]

50:40.328 --> 50:43.206
And what am I supposed to tell him
it's for if he asks, huh?

50:45.375 --> 50:46.793
[sighs deeply]

50:47.461 --> 50:49.087
Out. Now.

50:49.171 --> 50:51.256
-Hey.
-The kids' dad will be here soon.

50:51.339 --> 50:52.632
-Go.
-Hey.

50:53.508 --> 50:55.927
What the hell do you think
you're doing calling him her dad?

50:56.678 --> 50:59.264
-I'm her real father, okay?
-Oh, yeah? Tell me more.

51:00.098 --> 51:03.059
Go ahead. Why don't you tell me
what you did to deserve to be her dad?

51:03.143 --> 51:05.896
You-- Were you there when she was born?
Didn't think so.

51:05.979 --> 51:08.398
[shaky breath]
You know that…

51:09.232 --> 51:10.859
-I told you all that, okay.
-[sighs]

51:10.942 --> 51:12.360
And you know why I couldn't go.

51:12.444 --> 51:13.570
Someone collapsed at work.

51:13.653 --> 51:15.697
Yeah, well, I fainted too.
[sobs]

51:16.198 --> 51:19.242
I was alone and had to crawl
just to get myself over to the hospital.

51:19.326 --> 51:22.496
-And if I'd been any later, she'd be dead!
-No, I watched that guy die!

51:22.579 --> 51:23.789
With my own eyes!

51:24.581 --> 51:26.958
But no hospital, though. He couldn't go!

Honey, we're home.

51:37.886 --> 51:39.262
[door lock chimes]

51:39.346 --> 51:40.388
Um, hi, Dad.

Hi, Mom!

51:49.689 --> 51:53.193
Come on in here, guys.
He stopped by to see Ga-yeong.

51:53.276 --> 51:54.402
Um…

51:55.070 --> 51:57.489
And now that I saw her, I'll get going.

52:00.867 --> 52:01.701
You're going?

52:01.785 --> 52:03.495
Yeah, I have an important meeting
to go to.

52:04.371 --> 52:05.580
Ga-yeong, bye now.

52:06.122 --> 52:07.582
-I'll see you soon.
-Hmm.

52:07.666 --> 52:08.959
[door rattles]

52:09.876 --> 52:11.294
-[Gi-hun] How do you open…
-Here.

52:11.378 --> 52:12.671
-[door chiming]
-[Gi-hun] Thanks.

52:18.051 --> 52:19.302
[door lock chimes]

52:19.386 --> 52:21.388
[Ga-yeong's stepdad]
Why did he come here this time?

52:22.013 --> 52:24.474
-Why did you let him in the house?
-[Ga-yeong's mom] I'm sorry.

52:25.267 --> 52:29.187
I was coming back from the market,
and he was waiting at the front door.

52:29.271 --> 52:32.482
[rain pouring]

52:38.446 --> 52:39.531
[Ga-yeong's stepdad] Wait.

52:48.790 --> 52:49.749
What is that?

52:49.833 --> 52:51.084
You needed money.

52:53.962 --> 52:55.213
[sighs]

53:03.388 --> 53:04.598
Thanks so much.

53:05.932 --> 53:08.268
Uh, I swear I'll pay you back.

53:08.351 --> 53:09.853
[Ga-yeong's stepdad] You don't have to.

53:10.812 --> 53:14.441
Instead, you can stop trying
to contact our family.

53:16.902 --> 53:18.653
It's tough for Ga-yeong, but…

53:19.446 --> 53:21.114
we're moving to the US soon.

53:21.197 --> 53:23.241
If you just keep showing up--
[grunts]

53:23.950 --> 53:25.285
You asshole!

53:26.119 --> 53:27.621
Do you think money solves everything?

53:27.704 --> 53:29.456
[Gi-hun breathing heavily]

53:32.167 --> 53:33.585
[Ga-yeong] Dad, why?

53:38.673 --> 53:41.176
[dramatic music]

53:43.762 --> 53:46.014
[dramatic music continues]

54:07.744 --> 54:08.828
Seong Gi-hun?

54:11.039 --> 54:11.957
Yeah?

54:14.709 --> 54:16.127
Hwang Jun-ho, police.

54:17.712 --> 54:19.965
You recently made a report
at the station, right?

54:22.050 --> 54:25.345
You said a group abducted people
and make them play games.

54:25.428 --> 54:26.554
And you also said…

54:27.514 --> 54:28.974
some players were killed too.

54:29.724 --> 54:32.018
Oh, all that? Yeah, I just made that up.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.646
Yeah, a story I made up when I was drunk.

54:36.022 --> 54:37.524
They sent a card to my brother

54:38.817 --> 54:40.443
just like the one you had, sir.

54:42.779 --> 54:44.322
He went missing a few days ago.

54:46.950 --> 54:48.201
I just found it, I don't know.

54:48.284 --> 54:50.870
I saw it on the street
and just put it in my pocket.

54:50.954 --> 54:51.997
Mr. Seong.

54:53.456 --> 54:54.666
You can help me.

54:56.626 --> 54:57.961
I need to get him back.

54:58.628 --> 55:01.631
[tense music]

55:02.799 --> 55:04.134
Why would you think…

55:06.052 --> 55:09.305
that I will be useful to you
or anybody else?

55:14.728 --> 55:17.731
[somber music]

55:18.273 --> 55:19.274
