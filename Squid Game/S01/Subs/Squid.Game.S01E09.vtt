EPISODE 9
ONE LUCKY DAY

00:51.926 --> 00:55.388
[masked manager]
Player 218 and Player 456,

00:55.472 --> 00:58.057
welcome to the final game.

00:59.059 --> 01:03.855
Before we begin, we'll flip a coin
to decide who plays offense or defense.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.275
Please choose a shape. Triangle or square.

01:08.860 --> 01:09.903
Triangle.

01:12.363 --> 01:14.949
[coin clangs, whooshes]

01:19.037 --> 01:20.246
[masked manager] It's triangle.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.291
Please choose either offense or defense.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.462
[inhales sharply]

01:28.838 --> 01:30.006
Offense.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.634
[masked manager]
Player 456 will play offense.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.719
Player 218 will defend.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.349
[door clangs]

01:47.315 --> 01:51.110
[masked manager] For the final game,
you'll both be playing Squid Game.

01:53.404 --> 01:54.864
[VIP 1] Squid Game.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.826
What an odd name.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.454
[Front Man] It was originally
a children's game

02:01.955 --> 02:05.500
-that was played in Korea many years ago.
-[VIP 1] Hmm.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.628
[masked manager] Let me explain
the rules of Squid Game.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.923
One, the attacker must enter
the squid shape court,

02:12.006 --> 02:15.593
run past the defense, and then tap
the area inside the squid's head

02:15.677 --> 02:17.262
with his foot to secure the win.

02:17.345 --> 02:20.765
Two, the defender must block
the attacker's advance

02:20.849 --> 02:23.810
and force them outside
of the court's bounds in order to win.

02:23.893 --> 02:26.187
Three, if a situation arises,

02:26.271 --> 02:29.774
in which either player is unable
to continue playing the game,

02:29.858 --> 02:31.985
the last one standing will be the winner.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.244
A player's unable to continue.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.581
Could you explain that?

02:45.582 --> 02:48.293
[masked manager] That would be
referring to the player's death.

02:50.211 --> 02:53.423
And now, with that, let the game begin.

02:53.923 --> 02:56.926
[suspenseful music]

02:58.386 --> 03:01.472
[Front Man] Among all the games
that kids played back then,

03:01.556 --> 03:03.975
it was the most physical and violent.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.810
So any kind of violence is allowed?

03:05.894 --> 03:07.854
Sure. There are no restrictions.

03:09.063 --> 03:12.066
[suspenseful music continues]

03:17.030 --> 03:18.448
[inhales deeply]

03:27.916 --> 03:30.209
[breathes deeply]

03:38.301 --> 03:40.386
[in English]
Why is he hopping on one foot?

03:41.846 --> 03:43.932
[Front Man] The attacker
is given a handicap.

03:44.766 --> 03:48.519
He can only hop on one foot
until he crosses the squid's neck.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.064
Oh, so the defender tries to block him.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.232
[Front Man] Yes.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.609
That's the first challenge of this game.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.698
[in Korean]
We always used to play this as kids.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.493
-[heavy breath]
-When we cross…

04:04.702 --> 04:06.663
do you remember what we used to call it?

04:06.746 --> 04:07.830
Shut up. Who cares about all that?

04:07.914 --> 04:09.749
[Sang-woo grunts, screams]

04:10.333 --> 04:11.709
[Sang-woo coughing]

04:11.793 --> 04:13.670

04:16.130 --> 04:18.132
[tense music]

04:18.216 --> 04:19.300
[grunts]

04:20.718 --> 04:22.178
Inspector royal.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.392
"Inspector royal," we called it.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.521
[rain pattering]

04:35.316 --> 04:36.609

04:40.321 --> 04:43.032

04:48.955 --> 04:51.332
[speaking Mandarin]

04:52.542 --> 04:54.877
[VIP 2, in English]
Mm. It sounds so romantic.

04:55.586 --> 04:56.587
What's it mean?

04:57.171 --> 05:01.175
[VIP 3] "Good rain
knows the best time to fall."

05:01.259 --> 05:02.427
Du Fu.

05:02.927 --> 05:05.596
[rain pouring]

05:09.767 --> 05:11.477
I put an end to her suffering.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.188
You know she would have died anyway.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.691
That's bullshit. Stop lying.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.068
She could've survived.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.404
They would've treated her.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.948
I know what you're like, okay?

05:24.532 --> 05:26.409
You're the reason that I had to kill her.

05:27.076 --> 05:30.913
I knew you two would stop all this,
so she didn't die in there.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.708
Was that it?

05:35.710 --> 05:37.378
You killed someone because this might end?

05:37.462 --> 05:38.379
Yeah!

05:39.172 --> 05:42.050
You and that girl would have been
the majority you needed to get out!

05:42.133 --> 05:44.510
Going home without a single cent.
I couldn't do that!

05:47.096 --> 05:48.598
She's the one who stopped me.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.935
'Cause I was gonna kill you with this.

05:59.025 --> 05:59.942
It's over.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.489
I won't let you leave here
with that money.

06:04.572 --> 06:05.782

06:05.865 --> 06:07.909

08:42.188 --> 08:44.815
It's the damn place where they made us
play Red Light, Green Light.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.236
So many people played with us,
but now they're dead.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.279
Everyone except for us, Gi-hun.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.572

08:54.116 --> 08:55.034
We…

08:55.993 --> 08:58.246

09:34.949 --> 09:37.076
So it was you that killed them.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.079
You… you killed everyone!

09:41.455 --> 09:42.790
You killed them.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.751

11:45.913 --> 11:47.998

the majority agrees.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.294

11:53.754 --> 11:55.548
So if we both give up now,

right… right here

12:12.815 --> 12:14.817
No fucking way.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.034

12:26.162 --> 12:27.496

I just thought…

12:29.498 --> 12:31.500
how they used to call our names when…

12:33.461 --> 12:35.838
our moms had made supper for us.

That won't happen again.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.225
That was quite the game there.

14:54.643 --> 14:55.603
[Gi-hun] Why?

14:59.648 --> 15:02.443
Why did you do it? How can you?

15:04.028 --> 15:05.279
You bet on horses.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.992
It's the same here but…

15:10.826 --> 15:12.202
we bet on humans.

You're our horses.

It was a dream. Just think of it that way.

And it really wasn't a bad one
for you, either.

repent now!

The day of judgment is upon us!

in the afterlife will be fire and pain!

Let us repent
and kneel down before the Lord!

18:50.671 --> 18:51.964
[gasps]
Are you…

18:52.047 --> 18:53.799
What happened? What's going on?

18:56.885 --> 18:59.221
Did you get into another fight
while drinking?

19:01.306 --> 19:02.516
[sighs]

19:03.433 --> 19:04.726
Hold on. Wait right here.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.696
[panting]

19:16.822 --> 19:19.992
Here's some mackerel.
I know your mother may want it.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.911
[pensive music]

19:23.537 --> 19:24.788
[breathes deeply]

19:24.872 --> 19:28.750
She came down with something, I think.
She hasn't come out to work.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.503
And it's been a few days
since she's answered her phone.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.630
I should've stopped by to check on her.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.967
I just don't know what's wrong with me.
I mean, I, uh…

19:42.890 --> 19:44.141
[gasps]
It's all right.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.603
Give your mom any cash you got.
She needs it more than I do.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.648
[pensive music continues]

19:56.653 --> 19:57.821
[Sang-woo's mom] Gi-hun.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.618
By any chance…

20:03.744 --> 20:06.663
have you heard anything recently

20:07.748 --> 20:08.874
from Sang-woo?

20:14.463 --> 20:15.589
Never mind.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.050
You should go.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.312
[pensive music continues]

20:31.939 --> 20:33.232
[gate clangs]

20:37.694 --> 20:39.905
[distant dog barking]

20:49.331 --> 20:52.334
[barking continues]

21:05.222 --> 21:06.974
[door opens]

21:19.319 --> 21:21.196
[Gi-hun breathes deeply]

21:22.698 --> 21:23.782
Hey, Ma.

21:24.783 --> 21:25.826
I'm home.

21:27.244 --> 21:30.247
[Gi-hun breathing heavily]

21:39.131 --> 21:40.215
Hey, Ma.

21:48.515 --> 21:49.808
Mom, are you asleep?

21:52.102 --> 21:53.103
Hey, Ma.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.817
Mom, I'm home.

22:02.821 --> 22:03.822
Come on.

22:09.244 --> 22:10.746
I came home, Ma.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.832
[pensive music]

22:16.543 --> 22:17.461
Hey, Ma.

22:19.629 --> 22:22.674
[shaky breathing]
Just, just open your eyes.

22:26.053 --> 22:26.887
Come on.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.022
[pensive music continues]

22:38.565 --> 22:39.983
I'm home now, Mom.

22:41.109 --> 22:42.444
[gulps]

22:43.445 --> 22:45.113
I got some money for us now.

23:00.087 --> 23:03.006
[sobs]

23:10.055 --> 23:11.640
[quiet sob]

23:22.567 --> 23:25.570

24:09.197 --> 24:10.824
[Gi-hun exhales deeply]

24:22.294 --> 24:27.215
[train rumbling]

24:33.763 --> 24:35.056
[nervous chuckle]

24:35.140 --> 24:37.893
We've got a real barista
working for us here,

24:37.976 --> 24:39.603
and he can make you a cup as well.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.105
I'm not sure if you'd like it that much.
[chuckles]

24:42.189 --> 24:44.649
-[bank manager chuckles]
-Why am I here to see you?

24:44.733 --> 24:45.817
[gasps]

24:45.901 --> 24:48.570
Uh, sorry, you had to take the trip here.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.364
I wanted to have a car
sent out to you, but…

24:51.448 --> 24:52.866
Why am I here? What's wrong?

24:54.701 --> 24:55.994
Uh, well…

24:56.077 --> 24:58.705
[sucks teeth, inhales]

24:58.788 --> 25:02.876
So you see, you created your account here
quite a while ago and…

25:03.793 --> 25:06.671
and you haven't made that much effort
to contact us since.

25:10.258 --> 25:11.384
What do you mean?

25:14.012 --> 25:15.597
Did I do something wrong?

25:16.223 --> 25:17.224
Huh?

25:18.642 --> 25:22.187
Uh, uh, no. It's nothing like that, sir.
[chuckles]

25:24.022 --> 25:28.318
Uh, you've got all your money set up
in a normal savings account.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.613
You weren't earning
all that much interest on it.

25:32.614 --> 25:37.494
And recently, our bank began offering
these consultations for VIPs

25:37.577 --> 25:39.829
looking to expand their financial assets.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.249
I wanted to let you know
that we're here to help.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.208
[chuckles]

25:43.291 --> 25:45.585
I'm sure you're keeping busy.
I just wanted to say…

25:46.127 --> 25:49.172
Oh. I'm sorry. Did I offend you?

25:51.424 --> 25:53.677
Could you help me out with something else?

25:53.760 --> 25:55.929
Okay, what can we do?

25:59.266 --> 26:01.518
Please spare me just 10,000 won?

26:03.144 --> 26:04.062
What?

26:04.938 --> 26:05.981
Uh…

26:06.773 --> 26:09.192
All right, yeah. Here, let me just…

26:12.904 --> 26:13.989
[bank manager] Um…

26:20.704 --> 26:22.914
[distant train rumbling]

26:31.923 --> 26:34.634
[water sloshing]

26:47.897 --> 26:49.232
[woman] Excuse me.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.112
Would you buy some flowers?

26:55.905 --> 26:57.198
Please, mister.

26:58.366 --> 27:02.120
I need to get rid of them tonight
or they'll end up wilting away.

27:09.669 --> 27:11.004
Thank you, mister.

27:12.505 --> 27:13.840
I appreciate it.

27:13.923 --> 27:15.800
Uh, here.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.428
[woman] Have a good night.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.355
[Gi-hun sniffles]

[inhales deeply]

29:52.248 --> 29:53.416

29:55.210 --> 29:57.295
Pour some water in there.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.590
[Il-nam exhales]

30:05.178 --> 30:06.471
Please, Gi-hun.

[heart rate monitor beeping]

30:27.784 --> 30:28.910
[Il-nam gulping water]

30:28.993 --> 30:30.203
Who are you?

30:33.540 --> 30:34.916
You explain this.

30:37.627 --> 30:38.628
[gulps]

30:41.422 --> 30:44.634
[Il-nam breathing heavily]

30:45.927 --> 30:47.178
You see him?

30:47.971 --> 30:49.389
That man down there?

30:51.808 --> 30:53.518
He must be drunk…

30:54.811 --> 30:58.231
because he's been sitting there for hours.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.609
He looks homeless too

31:02.527 --> 31:04.320
if I had to guess.

31:04.904 --> 31:05.864
You…

31:08.700 --> 31:10.785
Were you the one who's behind it?

31:10.869 --> 31:14.789
He's going to freeze to death
if he stays out there any longer.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.960
And no one is going over
to help or anything.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.004
Why the hell did you do it?

31:21.504 --> 31:23.673
[breathes deeply]

31:24.382 --> 31:25.925
Would you help out that guy?

31:26.009 --> 31:27.218
Answer me!

31:27.302 --> 31:28.469
[shaky breathing]

31:28.553 --> 31:30.555
Why did you do that to us?

31:32.181 --> 31:34.601
You think that you will stop walking

31:34.684 --> 31:41.566
and help that disgusting, stinking drunk,
little piece of trash, huh?

31:41.649 --> 31:43.067
[shouts angrily]
Show me who you are!

31:44.402 --> 31:46.154
Why did I get to live and no one else?

31:46.738 --> 31:47.739
Listen.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.491
Let's play something tonight.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.579
That man out there…

31:55.705 --> 31:58.249
if he remains out there until midnight,

31:58.917 --> 31:59.918
I win.

32:01.461 --> 32:02.629
If anyone…

32:04.756 --> 32:06.758
goes to help the drunk before then,

32:07.884 --> 32:09.719
in that case, you win.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.348
Cut the crap, okay?

32:13.431 --> 32:15.642
-[Gi-hun breathing shakily]
-[Il-nam grunting]

32:15.725 --> 32:17.727
I could easily snap your neck right here.

32:17.810 --> 32:20.480
[grunts]
If you do that,

32:20.563 --> 32:24.150
then you won't get to hear
my explanation for all this.

32:24.651 --> 32:27.987
-[shaky breathing]
-Play this game with me and…

32:28.780 --> 32:30.114
I'll give you the…

32:30.865 --> 32:32.825
answer to your question.

32:33.534 --> 32:35.620
[shaky breathing]

32:36.371 --> 32:37.288
[Il-nam grunts]

32:41.834 --> 32:43.419
[Gi-hun breathes deeply]

32:43.503 --> 32:45.713

32:49.384 --> 32:52.387
[wind gusting]

32:57.308 --> 33:00.395
[clock ticking]

33:04.482 --> 33:05.942
And if I win…

33:06.651 --> 33:07.944
[inhales deeply]

33:08.027 --> 33:10.446
…then I'll kill you
without a second thought.

33:10.530 --> 33:15.576
What will you… bet on it with then?

33:16.160 --> 33:17.036
Anything.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.288
[inhales sharply]

33:20.123 --> 33:22.875
It doesn't matter.
You might as well take everything I have.

33:26.212 --> 33:28.506
[breathing heavily]

33:28.589 --> 33:32.593
-[ticking]
-[heart rate monitor beeping]

33:35.805 --> 33:36.889
So then…

33:38.224 --> 33:39.475
who are you?

33:39.559 --> 33:40.893
I earn…

33:42.353 --> 33:44.522
a living, lending out money.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.150
You give money to people for a living…

33:47.859 --> 33:49.485
[inhales deeply]

33:50.236 --> 33:51.779
…and you get rich doing it?

33:52.405 --> 33:53.865
Money.
[chuckles]

33:54.782 --> 33:56.868
You know what making money is like.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.955
It's not simple to do.

34:02.623 --> 34:03.624
So then…

34:05.710 --> 34:07.754
was any of what you said true

34:08.921 --> 34:10.590
or was it all just a lie?

34:13.384 --> 34:14.427
Oh Il-nam.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.972
Is that even your real name, huh?

34:18.473 --> 34:19.557
[Il-nam] It is.

34:20.266 --> 34:21.726
Yes, that's real.

34:22.435 --> 34:25.021
Oh Il-nam.
[inhales]

34:25.772 --> 34:27.523
That tumor's also real.

34:28.316 --> 34:31.944
And it also had gotten larger too.
That's true.

34:33.696 --> 34:34.864
And the house

34:35.865 --> 34:38.701
I used to live with my family in

34:39.744 --> 34:44.207
was almost exactly like that one
in the alley. That's all true.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.464
[wind gusting]

35:10.191 --> 35:11.651
[sighs]

35:12.985 --> 35:15.738
[inhales]
Can you still…

35:16.739 --> 35:19.992
trust anybody to be good

35:20.576 --> 35:23.287
even after everything you've been through?

35:24.080 --> 35:25.832
Why did you send a card?

35:26.833 --> 35:28.251
I heard that

35:29.418 --> 35:32.296
all the money you won
is just sitting there

35:33.297 --> 35:36.050
and that you are still living
like you used to.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.348
Is it all just because you feel guilty?

35:48.479 --> 35:49.772
Guilt? Shut up.

35:52.942 --> 35:55.653
You don't feel any guilt
for what you did, do you?

35:55.736 --> 35:57.280
It's yours now.

35:58.072 --> 36:00.116
That cash is your reward

36:00.908 --> 36:03.161
for your hard work and luck.

36:03.744 --> 36:07.498
And you have every right to use it now.

36:08.624 --> 36:10.209
Life goes by quick.

36:12.753 --> 36:14.213
In one minute…

36:16.465 --> 36:17.550
gone in a blink.

36:17.633 --> 36:18.926
[wind gusts]

36:19.010 --> 36:20.845
[ticking]

36:20.928 --> 36:22.680
[heart rate monitor beeping]

36:22.763 --> 36:25.516
[breathing deeply]

36:25.600 --> 36:27.018
[exhales]

36:29.395 --> 36:31.397
[Gi-hun] Why did you do
something like this?

36:34.150 --> 36:35.318
[Il-nam] Do you know

36:36.485 --> 36:39.447
what someone who doesn't have any money

36:41.115 --> 36:44.952
has in common with someone
with too much money

36:45.036 --> 36:47.121
to know what to do with?

36:48.789 --> 36:50.917
[labored breathing]

36:51.834 --> 36:52.960
Living is…

36:54.003 --> 36:55.963
no fun for either of them.

36:59.008 --> 37:01.510
If you have too much money, then it…

37:02.470 --> 37:07.642
doesn't matter what you buy,
or eat, or drink, or whatever.

37:07.725 --> 37:08.809
[chuckles]

37:08.893 --> 37:13.397
Everything, well, it all gets boring.

37:16.317 --> 37:17.818
All of my clients,

37:18.319 --> 37:23.616
started to eventually say
the exact same things whenever we talked.

37:24.575 --> 37:25.993
Everybody felt…

37:26.577 --> 37:31.249
that there was no joy
in their lives anymore.

37:33.209 --> 37:36.963
And so, we decided to get together.

37:38.172 --> 37:40.508
We did a little bit of thinking.

37:42.009 --> 37:44.679
What could we all do to…

37:45.471 --> 37:48.224
finally have some fun?

37:48.307 --> 37:49.433
Some fun?

37:53.813 --> 37:55.773
You put us through all of that

37:57.483 --> 37:58.734
so you can have fun?

37:59.235 --> 38:00.361
[Il-nam] It seems…

38:00.945 --> 38:05.491
that you forgot how… no one had to play,

38:05.574 --> 38:09.954
and you… all put your signatures
on the agreement.

38:11.580 --> 38:17.586
And that you all made your decision
to come back on your own.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.549
[Il-nam breathing heavily]

38:23.467 --> 38:26.554
[ticking]

38:29.598 --> 38:31.559
[Il-nam] Well, he's still out there.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.854
It looks like you've run out of luck.

38:38.065 --> 38:39.317
Tell me…

38:40.401 --> 38:46.157
you still trust… in humanity being good?

38:47.825 --> 38:49.160
[Gi-hun] I wanna know…

38:50.411 --> 38:52.371
I wanna know why you joined us?

38:52.872 --> 38:54.290
[inhales]

38:54.373 --> 38:56.709
Oh, well, in my childhood

38:58.961 --> 39:00.588
I always had

39:01.422 --> 39:05.384
so much fun out doing things
with all of my friends.

39:06.677 --> 39:10.014
We'd lose track of time for hours.

39:11.766 --> 39:13.267
I wanted to just…

39:14.352 --> 39:16.479
feel something

39:17.271 --> 39:20.566
just one last time before I die.

39:22.026 --> 39:26.906
And you are not going to get that feeling
if you are just going to spectate.

39:27.490 --> 39:30.326
And I desperately wanted that.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.203
And so…

39:34.872 --> 39:36.582
did playing do that then?

39:37.666 --> 39:38.793
Hell yeah.

39:40.294 --> 39:42.922
You asked why I let you live.

39:43.672 --> 39:45.299
By joining…

39:48.010 --> 39:49.929
and playing with you…

39:50.846 --> 39:52.848
I got that chance to…

39:53.808 --> 39:55.643
feel again.

39:56.602 --> 39:57.895
Thanks to you…

39:59.730 --> 40:02.191
I got to remember

40:03.275 --> 40:06.070
all these things that I had…

40:07.279 --> 40:09.573
forgotten long ago.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.117
[ticking]

40:11.617 --> 40:14.662
It had been such a long time…

40:17.289 --> 40:18.666
since I…

40:20.543 --> 40:23.587
was able to have that much fun.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.256
[ticking]

40:25.339 --> 40:28.384

40:43.274 --> 40:44.108
[Gi-hun gasps]

40:45.067 --> 40:46.402
Look at that.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.780
There's someone who cares.

40:49.864 --> 40:51.699
[ticking]

41:11.093 --> 41:13.179
[wistful music]

41:33.073 --> 41:34.825
[Gi-hun] You saw that, didn't you?

41:38.496 --> 41:40.080
You saw that you lost.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.963
[clock chimes]

[Il-nam sighs, clears throat]

[grunts]

42:10.319 --> 42:12.029
[exhales]

42:13.822 --> 42:17.368
And our guests,
greet them for me, all right?

42:17.451 --> 42:20.329
[Front Man] Of course, sir,
but why not do it yourself?

42:21.664 --> 42:28.587
Because I know that I'm not going to have
as much fun watching as playing.

42:30.506 --> 42:32.508
[dramatic music]

42:34.176 --> 42:35.135

INCREASE IN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD DEBT
RANKING KOREA 2ND GLOBALLY

42:52.278 --> 42:55.864
[female reporter] The country's reported
household debt is rapidly on the rise,

42:55.948 --> 42:57.700
topping the current global average.

42:58.325 --> 43:01.787
Last third quarter, the Bank of Korea and
the Bank for International Settlements…

43:01.870 --> 43:02.705
[hairdresser] Hmm.

43:02.788 --> 43:04.123
…reported that the GDP…

43:04.206 --> 43:06.458
Holy moly! Your hair, sir, grew out.

43:06.542 --> 43:08.168
Uh, what you're getting done today?

43:08.252 --> 43:10.129
Did you want a shorter cut?

43:10.212 --> 43:13.173
Or keep it longer
so we can perm it like that, huh?

43:13.257 --> 43:15.301
[female reporter]
…Bank for international Settlements.

43:15.384 --> 43:18.178
The biggest increase in the world
besides China.

43:18.262 --> 43:21.348
The reason for the steep rise
in Korea's reported household debt

43:21.432 --> 43:23.017
is due, at least in part,

43:23.100 --> 43:25.936
to the lifted government restrictions
on financial loans.

43:26.562 --> 43:28.856

[somber music]

44:02.431 --> 44:03.641
[clicks tongue]

44:04.600 --> 44:06.226
The family resemblance is there.

44:11.065 --> 44:12.483
Sir, do you know…

44:14.109 --> 44:15.944
my sister very well?

44:19.490 --> 44:20.783
I know her.

44:23.827 --> 44:25.245
We're good friends.

44:25.746 --> 44:28.666
Does that mean you know
where she is right now?

44:33.128 --> 44:35.464
[somber music continues]

44:41.470 --> 44:43.013
[Sang-woo's mom] Is this the boy?

44:44.890 --> 44:45.933
Yeah.

44:48.394 --> 44:50.062
Tell me your name, sweetie.

44:51.397 --> 44:52.439
It's Cheol.

44:53.482 --> 44:54.817
Kang Cheol.

44:54.900 --> 44:56.777
Kang Cheol?
[gasps]

44:56.860 --> 44:58.987
How cool!
That's a manly name you have there.

45:00.072 --> 45:02.491
And you look so tough and strong.

45:03.826 --> 45:04.910
Take care of him, please.

45:05.494 --> 45:06.370
Okay.

45:07.162 --> 45:10.332
It'll be nice to have
a little extra company around

45:10.416 --> 45:11.834
for dinner for a change.

45:11.917 --> 45:14.211
Don't worry about me. Have a good trip.

45:14.753 --> 45:15.712
Thanks.

45:28.100 --> 45:30.102
Cheol, have you had dinner yet?

45:31.353 --> 45:33.772
Here, come. Come and take a seat.
Come on now.

45:33.856 --> 45:34.857
Have a fish bun.

45:36.275 --> 45:37.526
Here you go.

45:39.445 --> 45:42.823
Oh, goodness! That jacket
is way too light for this cold.

45:42.906 --> 45:44.533
Wait, don't you have a warmer jacket?

46:50.849 --> 46:52.434
I'll be boarding the flight soon.

46:55.145 --> 46:57.564
Of course, of course, I got you a present.

46:58.732 --> 47:01.109

No way. It's a secret.

49:49.903 --> 49:51.196
Listen carefully.

49:53.198 --> 49:54.616
I'm not a horse.

49:56.159 --> 49:57.411
I'm a person.

49:59.621 --> 50:01.164
That's why I wanna know…

50:01.248 --> 50:02.874
[breathes deeply]

50:03.375 --> 50:04.960
…who you people are,

50:08.213 --> 50:10.966
and how you can do
these horrible things to people.

50:11.508 --> 50:12.968
-[Front Man] Player 456.
-[sighs]

50:13.677 --> 50:15.429
