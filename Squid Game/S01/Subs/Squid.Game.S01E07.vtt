[stammers]
How…

01:43.478 --> 01:44.354
how the hell…

01:44.938 --> 01:45.855
What?

01:46.940 --> 01:49.567
You're looking at me
like you've seen a ghost. Are you okay?

[scoffs]

01:52.904 --> 01:53.947
[inhales]

01:54.697 --> 01:57.659
The masked guys all called me this,
"the weakest link."

01:59.828 --> 02:03.540
Like when nobody chooses you as a partner
for things when you were a kid.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.209
Hey, this guy knows about it.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.544
The weakest link!

02:08.044 --> 02:09.587
[Mi-nyeo cackles]

02:09.671 --> 02:13.341
And after that, they gently
escorted me back to this dorm.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.219
[laughs]

02:17.178 --> 02:18.263
Because…

02:19.222 --> 02:21.975
they said that it's all
a part of a rule that…

02:22.642 --> 02:23.977
in the old days…

02:24.894 --> 02:28.064
not to let a kid turn
into some kind of an outcast, I guess.

02:28.606 --> 02:31.442
Goddamn it!

[Front Man, in Korean]
Are you in here right now?

03:41.095 --> 03:43.431
You're good, but you made one mistake.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.935
I always put the receiver down
the other way.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.815
[eerie music]

03:57.612 --> 04:01.366
The bullet you shot was from
a Smith and Wesson M60 revolver,

04:01.908 --> 04:04.285
standard issue for Korean police.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.914
What's a cop doing here

04:09.666 --> 04:10.875

I am sure you have lots of questions.

It's not too late to come out and talk.

04:22.512 --> 04:23.972
I don't know how you got in,

[Sang-woo exhales]

06:39.357 --> 06:40.650

The majority must agree.
Well, come on, let's get out.

Half of us, that's all we need
to end this right now.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.100
Don't any of you want to leave
this horrible place?

07:56.601 --> 07:59.770
Anyone who wants to go, stand up.
Let's get out of here.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.784
How many of you can continue
with this insanity

08:13.868 --> 08:15.536
just for the money?

08:17.163 --> 08:19.999
You just had to kill the ones
you were the closest to at this place,

08:20.082 --> 08:21.542
and you're good with that

08:21.626 --> 08:23.419
just to get the money?

-[cries]
-[Sang-woo] So what if we stop now?

08:28.257 --> 08:31.677
You think your wife will stop being dead
if we all go now?

08:33.262 --> 08:35.556
And she'll forgive you
for letting her get murdered?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.893
If you can't keep going,
then why are you alive right now?

08:38.976 --> 08:41.187
You should've been the one
who died in there instead.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.398
See that?

08:45.816 --> 08:47.360
That's the price of being in here.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.238
And your wife and the others
paid it with their lives.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.864
-No.
-And you wanna go and leave?

08:52.615 --> 08:54.242
You wanna start from the beginning again?

-You ready to do all that, huh?

ready to do that as well?

has not been too difficult.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.211
I am the Front Man.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.465
I oversee all of the operations here
at this facility.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.384
It is a true honor to welcome you.

10:36.510 --> 10:37.803
Where is the host?

10:37.887 --> 10:42.433
Regrettably, some urgent business
has prevented him from attending.

10:42.933 --> 10:43.809
Seriously?

10:44.602 --> 10:47.438
I find it hard to believe
the host would miss a night like tonight.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.066
[Front Man] He asked me
to apologize on his behalf.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.901
Did some problem happen here?

10:51.984 --> 10:52.902
Not at all.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.072
It's just a personal matter of the host.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.532
The remaining games
will be held as scheduled.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.744
I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.079
Well, I hope not.

11:03.788 --> 11:07.750
Listen, I'm willing to give anybody
some slack. That's not a problem.

11:09.460 --> 11:12.922
I just have to say
that I'm a difficult man to please.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.549
I hope you won't disappoint me.

11:15.633 --> 11:16.759

11:40.783 --> 11:42.618
May you give me protection and strength

11:42.701 --> 11:44.662
that I need to make my way
through these routes,

11:44.745 --> 11:46.497
and may you light the path
to my salvation.

11:47.289 --> 11:48.791
I give myself to you, Oh Lord.

Please look down on me
with pity and forgiveness.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.296
I pray for those who have sacrificed
themselves for me,

11:54.380 --> 11:55.881
or forgive them as well.

Hear me, Oh Lord, help me and forgive me

11:58.175 --> 12:00.010
for what I have done and what I may do.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.555
I live with my heart only by your graces.

12:02.638 --> 12:05.641

Give us a hint, will you?

12:18.446 --> 12:22.908
[Front Man] As much as I'd like to, sir,
I'd hate to ruin the fun for everyone.

have been amazing.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.081

The contest in Korea was the best.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.500
[Front Man] Thank you.

I believe this next game
will exceed your expectations.

[VIP 1] Well, that's why
we came all this way.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.301

we have at home are plenty big, but…

nothing beats seeing with your own eyes.

12:44.013 --> 12:44.847
[VIP 4] No!

No, don't do it, you idiot! You asshole!

Fucking loser!

12:49.602 --> 12:51.228
What are you so worked up about?

before the next game begins.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.591
Why don’t you all get some rest
in your rooms?

13:21.217 --> 13:23.928
We’ll come and get you
when everything’s ready.

So, will you bet on brain or muscle?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.893
[VIP 2] So who you're putting
your money on this time?

13:30.976 --> 13:32.186
[VIP 6] I think
I'm going muscle all the way.

13:32.269 --> 13:34.480

-[VIP 5] Number 101.

[VIP 4 sighs]
No.

I’m doubling my stakes on this round.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.069
[VIP 5] Are you sure about that?

16:27.152 --> 16:29.029
You don't even know
what game it’s gonna be.

16:29.863 --> 16:33.409

16:54.013 --> 16:56.682
Just tell us about the next game.

16:56.765 --> 16:59.309
How long are you gonna string us
along like this?

16:59.393 --> 17:03.147
He's in a bad mood because of 69.
Better tell him quickly.

17:03.230 --> 17:06.900
[Front Man] Gentlemen,
let me introduce the next game.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.202
[VIP 5] What's that thing?

17:17.870 --> 17:21.123
[VIP 1] Looks like a bridge of some sort.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.083
[VIP 2] I like the looks of it.

17:23.667 --> 17:26.086
What the hell is that?

17:29.089 --> 17:30.549
[music stops]

17:40.392 --> 17:41.852
[inhales deeply]

17:58.410 --> 18:00.704
[woman on PA, in Korean]
Welcome, players, to the fifth game.

18:00.788 --> 18:04.041
Before we begin,
please make your way down the steps

18:04.124 --> 18:07.127
and choose one of the mannequins
that you see presented before you.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.922
Once you've chosen,
take the corresponding vest.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.965
They are numbered 1 through 16.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.427
Let me repeat the instructions.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.971
Please make your way down the steps

18:18.055 --> 18:20.849
and choose one of the mannequins
that you see before you,

18:20.933 --> 18:22.518
and take the corresponding vest.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.812
They are numbered 1 through 16.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.482
[classical music on TV]

18:28.565 --> 18:30.275
[VIP 1, in English]
Ooh, this is exciting.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.946
Gentlemen,
this may be the deciding moment.

18:34.029 --> 18:35.239
There are plenty of other variables,

18:35.322 --> 18:37.616
but I think the order,
in which they compete, matters most.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.535
Who are you betting on this time?

18:42.204 --> 18:43.455
Ninety-six.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.998
What's your reason?

18:45.582 --> 18:47.668
Well, if I can't do 69,

18:48.919 --> 18:50.337
I'll try 96.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.172
[VIPs laughing]

18:53.715 --> 18:56.176
-[VIP 1] Good luck with that.
-[VIP 2] How do you know this guy?

18:56.260 --> 18:58.137
[VIP 1] I didn't bring him.
I thought you brought him.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.389
-[VIP 2] Me? No.
-[VIP 1 laughs]

19:01.431 --> 19:03.267
[VIP 1] Oh, jeez. You kill me.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.769
Oh.
[chuckles]

19:09.690 --> 19:11.859
[breathing deeply]

19:15.737 --> 19:17.531
[Gi-hun, in Korean]
There are 16 people left,

19:18.157 --> 19:19.575
and there are 16 numbers.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.368
[footsteps approaching]

19:27.207 --> 19:28.917
[Sang-woo breathing deeply]

19:35.215 --> 19:38.552
It was on the sixth day
that God created the first man on Earth.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.222
And now, I will go back
to that day God made us

19:42.890 --> 19:44.600
sinless and innocent.

19:48.770 --> 19:49.855
[exhales]

19:50.355 --> 19:51.690
[sighs]

19:56.904 --> 19:59.865
Okay. Lucky number seven, come on.

20:05.579 --> 20:06.914
[Deok-su grunts]

20:10.792 --> 20:11.960
[Mi-nyeo] Mm.

20:12.044 --> 20:16.506
[classical music on TV]

20:17.090 --> 20:19.176
[in English]
They always take the middle numbers first.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.844
Animal instinct.

20:21.970 --> 20:25.724
When faced with danger,
seek refuge in the herd.

20:25.807 --> 20:28.101
[Gi-hun, in Korean]
What should I do?

20:28.185 --> 20:30.103
The middle numbers are all taken.

20:31.188 --> 20:34.816
[in English]
Only two choices left. Front or back?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.151
[clicks tongue]

20:36.235 --> 20:38.278
I can't say I'd know
which one to choose either.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.864
[Front Man] Shall I help them along
with their decision?

20:40.948 --> 20:43.200
Sure, drop them a hint.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.620
[VIP 4] Show mercy to the miserable!

20:47.287 --> 20:48.538
[VIP 2] Okay, do it.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.333
[beeps]

20:51.416 --> 20:53.377
[woman on PA, in Korean]
Your attention, please.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.420
The numbers you see on the mannequins

20:55.504 --> 20:58.882
correspond to the order
in which you will be playing.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.884
Please make your decision carefully.

21:02.678 --> 21:03.762
[Gi-hun] The order?

21:04.680 --> 21:05.847
That we're playing in?

21:07.724 --> 21:08.558
Okay.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.479
If this is the order we'd play,
then the low numbers are better.

21:13.313 --> 21:17.901
It's probably gonna have a time limit
like Red Light, Green Light and Honeycomb.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.112
It's better to get a head start.

21:21.905 --> 21:22.823
Wait.

21:22.906 --> 21:23.949
No.

21:24.866 --> 21:27.828
It'd be too dangerous to go first
without knowing the game.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.872
If I stay in the back,
I can watch the ones who go first

21:30.956 --> 21:32.708
and make a plan like in Tug-of-War.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.418
[sighs]

21:34.501 --> 21:37.421
[quirky music]

21:39.089 --> 21:40.382
[gasps]

21:42.676 --> 21:43.760
[Gi-hun] Sixteen.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.263
I can't go with 16.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.890
Whatever it is,
it's too dangerous to go last.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.685
[Gi-hun breathing heavily]

21:51.768 --> 21:53.562
[panicked breathing]

21:59.943 --> 22:02.571
Number 1? That means
I'll be starting the game off.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.198
Then should I go last?

22:05.949 --> 22:07.409
No, that seems wrong too.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.039
Gi-hun, pull yourself together.

22:12.539 --> 22:14.541
[in English]
Down to two positions,

22:15.208 --> 22:16.626
first and last.

22:16.710 --> 22:19.171
Mm. The start and the finish.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.256
Two places you really don't wanna be.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.259
Going first in a life-or-death contest?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.136
Very scary.

22:26.219 --> 22:29.222
But recall, too, that in the first game,

22:29.306 --> 22:34.102
most of the contestants in the back died
after running out of time, so…

22:34.186 --> 22:37.314
you can't feel too comfortable
picking 16 either.

22:38.106 --> 22:40.442
You bet on 96, right?

22:41.026 --> 22:42.152
Yeah.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.946
Pick a good one.

22:46.948 --> 22:47.866
What?

22:49.409 --> 22:50.911
Where are you going?

22:52.245 --> 22:53.371
[Player 96, in Korean]
Excuse me.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.124
[shaky breathing]

22:58.502 --> 23:00.587
Could I be number one instead?

23:01.880 --> 23:03.256
As long as I can remember,

23:03.340 --> 23:05.550
I've been hiding behind people
when I got scared.

23:06.426 --> 23:07.761
My life has been this thing

23:07.844 --> 23:10.263
that I've never really been able
to truly control.

23:11.056 --> 23:14.601
And I tried to act
like I wasn't afraid, but I was.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.815
And now, as always,
I'm choosing my number last

23:19.898 --> 23:21.775
after everybody else here.

23:22.984 --> 23:26.321
I wanna get at least one last chance
to claim ownership of my life.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.824
Sir, give this chance to me.

23:29.783 --> 23:30.909
[whimpering]

23:30.992 --> 23:32.327
Please just give me that.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.170
[Player 96 on TV] Thank you!

23:43.004 --> 23:45.132
-Thank you!
-[VIP 4, in English] You fuckwad!

23:45.215 --> 23:46.967
-Piece of shit!
-[VIPs laughing]

23:48.593 --> 23:50.137
Oh, it's really not your day, is it?

23:50.220 --> 23:53.265
First, 69, and now, 96.
[laughs]

23:56.226 --> 23:58.145
[VIP 4] Motherfucker!

24:00.021 --> 24:01.731
Son of a bitch!

24:02.941 --> 24:04.901
Now, the game will begin.

24:10.073 --> 24:12.033
[classical music stops]

24:14.619 --> 24:17.622
[dark music]

24:31.219 --> 24:33.513
Oh, wow. It's bigger!

24:34.264 --> 24:37.058
[VIP 1] Yeah. A lot bigger.

24:42.772 --> 24:45.775
[suspenseful music]

24:51.031 --> 24:55.160
[woman on PA, in Korean] Hello, players,
let me welcome you all to the fifth game.

24:56.077 --> 24:59.581
The fifth game is Glass Stepping Stones.

25:00.457 --> 25:04.252
The stepping stones before you
are made from one of two types of glass,

25:04.336 --> 25:07.881
one will be tempered glass
and the other will be normal glass.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.050
The tempered glass stepping stone

25:10.133 --> 25:13.094
as strong enough
to hold the weight of two people.

25:13.178 --> 25:17.641
However, the normal glass will break
even if just one person steps on it.

25:17.724 --> 25:21.061
For this game, you will guess
which one of next two tiles

25:21.144 --> 25:23.980
is the tile made
of the stronger tempered glass,

25:24.064 --> 25:28.026
and only step on those
across the 18 pairs of tile.

25:28.109 --> 25:31.112
You may then cross over
to the other side safely

25:31.196 --> 25:32.864
and pass this game.

25:33.448 --> 25:36.451
[suspenseful music continues]

25:45.919 --> 25:48.088
That means the numbers on us…

25:48.797 --> 25:51.091
[masked man] Are the order in which
you will cross the bridge.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.096
[whimpers]

26:02.352 --> 26:04.437
[shaky breath]

26:05.021 --> 26:06.815
[Player 96 shuddering]

26:08.775 --> 26:11.319
[terrified breathing]

26:13.655 --> 26:17.033
But then, how do I tell
which is the tempered one?

26:23.415 --> 26:25.250
[shudders]

26:36.594 --> 26:38.096
[grunts]

26:39.431 --> 26:40.849
[in English]
Scumbag.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.100
[slurps]

26:42.767 --> 26:43.935
[gulps]
Ah.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.187
Bring me another scotch.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.192
Hey, you!

27:06.333 --> 27:09.169
I don't wanna have
to keep calling you back.

27:10.003 --> 27:12.881
Sit down here.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.966
I must serve the other guests, sir.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.428
I'm gonna keep this one next to me.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.263
Any objections?

27:20.347 --> 27:21.681
[VIP 1] Not at all.

27:21.765 --> 27:24.142
-[VIP 2] As you please.
-[VIP 1] He's all yours.

27:27.395 --> 27:30.315
[woman on PA, in Korean]
For this game, you will have 16 minutes.

27:30.398 --> 27:33.693
Players must cross the bridge
within those 16 minutes.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.946
And now, with that, let the game begin.

27:37.447 --> 27:41.659
Each player, take off your shoes,
then go up to the tiles in order.

27:44.037 --> 27:47.040
-[tense music]
-[Player 96 shuddering]

27:49.209 --> 27:52.337
[ticking]

27:52.921 --> 27:54.089
Hmm.

27:54.172 --> 27:57.133
[Player 96 breathing shakily]

27:59.386 --> 28:00.345
Hmm.

28:01.721 --> 28:03.890
[Player 96 breathes nervously]

28:06.559 --> 28:08.686
-[man 1] What are you doing?
-[man 2] We're losing time!

28:08.770 --> 28:09.813
-[man 1] Hurry up and go!
-[man 2] Just jump!

28:09.896 --> 28:11.648
-[man 3] Are you just gonna stand there?
-Hey.

28:12.148 --> 28:14.359
Take your step now or I'll push your ass.

28:14.442 --> 28:17.821
I'll go. I'll go, okay? I'll go.
I'll go right now.

28:17.904 --> 28:20.573
-And please try to choose carefully, huh.
-[breathes nervously]

28:24.077 --> 28:25.203
[players exclaim]

28:25.286 --> 28:26.496
[man 3] You did it.

28:26.579 --> 28:28.331
[players chatter]

28:28.415 --> 28:29.541
[man 4] You picked right.

28:29.624 --> 28:34.170
Oh! Yes, that's it.
Keep doing that one after the other.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.964
-[man 4] Come on.
-You got this.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.173
-That's it. Go on.
-[man 4] Come on.

28:39.134 --> 28:42.137
[suspenseful music]

28:44.431 --> 28:46.433
[shudders]

28:48.309 --> 28:49.602
-[glass breaks]
-[players scream]

28:49.686 --> 28:50.645
[VIP 4, in English]
He's gone.

28:50.729 --> 28:51.688
-[VIP 1] Oh, no.
-[clanks]

28:52.272 --> 28:53.898
Well, that's it for 96.

28:53.982 --> 28:56.484
Aw, what a shame.

28:57.777 --> 29:00.572
Oh. Hmm, you've already found
some more fun.

29:01.156 --> 29:02.615
[VIP 2 chuckles]

29:02.699 --> 29:05.368
What pretty eyes you have.

[whimpers]

29:17.589 --> 29:20.049
[breathing heavily]

29:26.222 --> 29:28.641
[in Korean]
Step one was left.

29:29.642 --> 29:31.352
Step two is on the right.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.855
[Player 308 shuddering]

-[players gasp]

29:44.073 --> 29:47.076
[tense music continues]

29:56.544 --> 29:57.504
[woman 1] You can do it.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.798
-[man 1] Hey, you got this.
-[man 2] Hurry the hell up and go!

30:00.381 --> 30:01.800
I'm looking at 15.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.802
-[man 2] Stop stalling!
-The tiles ahead of me.

30:03.885 --> 30:04.844
Let's go.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.137
-So the probability that…
-[woman 1] We don't have time for this.

30:06.721 --> 30:08.932
-I'll get everything right is…
-[man 3] Hey, you got this.

30:09.015 --> 30:10.809
…two to the power of fifteen.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.894
[heavy breathing]

30:12.977 --> 30:14.145
Times that…

30:18.107 --> 30:22.362
One in 32,768.
[exhales nervously]

30:24.197 --> 30:26.991
[laughs]

30:29.285 --> 30:30.453
Damn it.

30:32.038 --> 30:34.833
[shaky breathing]

30:40.797 --> 30:42.882

31:19.335 --> 31:20.628

31:20.712 --> 31:21.921
[Player 21] Excuse me, ma'am.

31:22.505 --> 31:23.506
Do you think

You happen to remember what he chose next?

I can't seem to recall which one now.

31:31.097 --> 31:33.766
Oh, I don't know,
uh, it happened too quickly.

31:33.850 --> 31:35.184
Think hard please.

31:36.019 --> 31:38.563
Since both of our lives
depend on getting this next one.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.273
Okay.

31:43.985 --> 31:46.279

-[man 1] Wait, no.

31:46.362 --> 31:48.448
-He went right and then he went left.
-Uh, he didn't do that.

31:48.531 --> 31:51.451
-[man 2] He went left right away.

There are ten tiles left,

33:05.108 --> 33:07.068
and 11 people still playing.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.071
If they manage to step on one or two each,

33:10.571 --> 33:12.782
the three of us can get across to the end.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.159
[Sang-woo] That might not be the case.

33:15.243 --> 33:18.204
If one of those players get scared
and starts to run down the time,

33:19.163 --> 33:21.082
we are in danger at the back of the line.

45:27.599 --> 45:29.184
[in Korean]
Go check the VIP room.

45:32.271 --> 45:33.480
-[player screams]
-[VIP 1] Oh!

45:33.564 --> 45:34.731
[laughs]

45:39.611 --> 45:41.530
[breathing heavily]

45:43.991 --> 45:45.534
-[sighs]
-[clock ticking]

45:46.869 --> 45:47.744
Move. Quick!

45:48.704 --> 45:49.788
You can't just stop.

45:49.872 --> 45:53.208
Hold on. Wait, one second.
I can tell the panels apart.

45:53.292 --> 45:56.545
-You can tell?
-I used to make glass for over 30 years.

45:57.421 --> 45:59.047
You can't normally tell, but…

45:59.673 --> 46:04.052
when you look at tempered glass
when it's lit from the side,

46:04.136 --> 46:07.514
then you can see faint stain marks.

46:13.228 --> 46:14.438
[exhales]

46:14.521 --> 46:16.064
[gulps]

46:23.739 --> 46:25.741
Another hint, the sound.

46:26.366 --> 46:30.287
Tempered glass is made
at a heat over 700 degrees.

46:30.370 --> 46:33.999
Pound on it with a hammer
and it rings clearer than normal glass.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.210
Why wasn't all this brought up earlier?

46:36.293 --> 46:38.670
-If you had led everybody from--
-[Player 17] Why would I?

46:39.254 --> 46:41.924
The players up here
tried to kill us at every chance.

46:42.007 --> 46:43.592
[sighs]

46:43.675 --> 46:44.676
Hmm.

46:48.096 --> 46:49.598
-[Player 17 grunts]
-[feet thud]

46:49.681 --> 46:51.683
[tense music]

46:57.731 --> 46:58.815
[sighs]

46:59.358 --> 47:00.901
[in English]
Can he really tell the difference?

47:00.984 --> 47:02.402
I think so.

47:02.486 --> 47:04.446
LONG-TERM WORK EXPERIENCE
IN GLASS MANUFACTURING

47:05.656 --> 47:09.993
According to his file,
he once had a job as a glass manufacturer.

47:10.661 --> 47:14.289
That was in the report?
Hah! How did I miss that?

47:14.373 --> 47:15.457
I didn't catch it either.

47:15.541 --> 47:18.252
Well, that's no fun.

47:18.961 --> 47:23.340
[VIP 2] Yup, number 13 definitely sees
something that the others can't.

47:23.423 --> 47:26.760
I think he might be examining
the refraction of the light.

47:27.427 --> 47:29.179
Let me adjust the settings.

47:30.764 --> 47:32.558
[beeps]

47:38.063 --> 47:41.066
[tense music]

47:48.824 --> 47:51.827
[tense music continues]

47:54.288 --> 47:56.039
It seems to have done the trick.

47:56.540 --> 47:59.376
Yeah, he's not so confident now.

48:02.170 --> 48:05.173
[suspenseful music]

48:13.140 --> 48:14.474
[Sang-woo, in Korean]
What's wrong?

48:15.183 --> 48:17.936
-What's the problem?
-[Player 17 shuddering]

48:18.478 --> 48:20.689
I can't tell them apart in the dark.

48:21.773 --> 48:23.567
[Player 17 breathing nervously]

48:23.650 --> 48:25.569
[knocking on door]

48:25.652 --> 48:27.029
[masked man] Excuse me, sir.

48:33.160 --> 48:34.286
[radio beeps]

48:37.414 --> 48:38.999
[masked man] The VIP has collapsed.

48:39.666 --> 48:40.751
[Front Man] Is he alive?

48:40.834 --> 48:42.210
[masked man] He's fine.

48:42.294 --> 48:43.545
[Front Man] And the intruder?

48:44.046 --> 48:46.006
-We're searching for him now.
-[radio beeps]

48:46.089 --> 48:47.466
[sighs]

48:47.549 --> 48:50.218
[tense music]

48:54.181 --> 48:55.307
[exhales]

48:56.350 --> 48:58.769
All right, which one?
You need to choose now.

48:59.394 --> 49:01.146
[Player 17] I need to listen to the sound.

49:02.939 --> 49:04.650
You got anything to throw?

49:07.569 --> 49:09.071
Do… do you have anything?

49:14.076 --> 49:16.078
[tense music]

49:17.287 --> 49:18.622
[Player 17 sighs]

49:25.462 --> 49:26.713
[breathes nervously]

49:30.759 --> 49:32.886
[glass clinking]

49:36.181 --> 49:37.224
I need another.

49:38.308 --> 49:40.310
I need to hear the right one,
so I can be sure.

49:45.023 --> 49:46.483
[Sang-woo sighs]

49:58.370 --> 50:00.539
[thrilling music]

50:05.460 --> 50:06.920
[ticking]

50:17.931 --> 50:19.808
I can't tell what it is.

50:20.475 --> 50:22.269
I'll pick, okay?
[grunts]

50:22.352 --> 50:23.937
-[Player 17 shrieking]
-[glass shatters]

50:24.020 --> 50:25.272

-[ticks]

50:41.997 --> 50:42.956

52:10.836 --> 52:12.504
[banging]

52:23.640 --> 52:25.559
-[radio beeps]
-One of the dive packs is gone.

52:26.268 --> 52:28.436
[masked man]
I suspect the intruder took it.

52:28.520 --> 52:31.022
[Front Man] Start tracking it
and get the boat ready.

52:31.106 --> 52:33.441
[VIP 1, in English]
Oh! That's hard to top.

52:33.525 --> 52:34.776
-Bravo!
-[VIP 2] Bravo.

52:34.860 --> 52:36.736
-[VIP 3] Bravo!
-[VIP 5] Yes.

52:38.321 --> 52:41.324
[foreboding music]
