[masked manager] Players,
what you witness before you

02:14.384 --> 02:17.637
is what remains of those who broke
the rules for their own benefit.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.975
They tainted the pure and fair ideology
everything here has been built upon.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.478
Each and every one of you
is considered an equal

02:25.562 --> 02:27.230
within the walls of this facility.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.607
You must be guaranteed
the same opportunities

06:02.111 --> 06:03.654
Let's do this, huh?

06:04.739 --> 06:05.948
I'm better than you think.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.409
And I'm stronger than most guys too.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.331
Guess what? I know how to con
just about anybody I see.

06:13.998 --> 06:17.085
I'm not a genius,
but I still got it work out. Huh?

06:21.464 --> 06:23.216
Hey, let me play with you.

I'll do anything you tell me.
I'm not a regular girl.

Hmm?

06:34.060 --> 06:36.062
[players murmuring]

06:38.731 --> 06:41.818
You're pretending that you do not want me
on your team. Is that it?

06:42.401 --> 06:43.611
Why? Can't decide?

06:43.694 --> 06:45.488
Want me to choose instead, huh?

06:45.571 --> 06:47.365
[Sae-byeok] Stop embarrassing yourself.

No one will want to play
with you like this.

[Mi-nyeo sighs]

06:51.119 --> 06:52.662
And you should all be honest.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.624
You don't want a girl to team up with
or an old guy.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.668
Of course we don't. We could die.

06:59.418 --> 07:01.254
We already almost die
in the previous round.

07:01.337 --> 07:02.380
This man is right.

07:03.214 --> 07:06.926
And it was Adam's rib the Lord used
to make Eve after all.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.304
And that's the reason
that we're choosing men.

07:11.722 --> 07:14.725
-They played different roles than women.
-You idiot.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.353
We're not playing in Eden right now.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.606
Uh, hold on a second.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.989
Why? You want a girl?

07:40.543 --> 07:42.587
You're all idiots.

07:43.504 --> 07:47.967
You two, you're making a big mistake,
and you're going to regret it.

-Sang-woo, let's--
-Ali, let's join forces.

07:56.893 --> 08:00.480
Most of these games here,
you need to be strong or smart to win.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.065
And I think if we're a team, we'll…

08:03.858 --> 08:05.818
we'll beat a lot of the others out there.

Uh, it's okay, really, it's…

08:16.537 --> 08:18.873
Uh, you two will make
a great team together.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.500
I'll find someone to play with.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.117
Sorry, but, um…

08:56.327 --> 08:57.620
You know it's just, um…

08:58.287 --> 09:00.831
-Uh…
-You should go put this on.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.170
Just in case people here…

09:07.380 --> 09:11.384
Well, they might look down on you
for missing it.

[exhales]

09:30.570 --> 09:31.904

09:34.865 --> 09:36.075
We'll be the best team.

09:42.373 --> 09:43.291
[Player 240] Hey.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.253
Wanna do this?

09:50.506 --> 09:51.841
Why should I?

09:52.508 --> 09:55.344
I can't picture you going around here
and begging these jerks.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.679
Hmm? Embarrassing.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.515
What matters is winning.
Embarrassing or not.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.891
[Player 240] Then play with me.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.685
I'll make sure that you win.

10:02.768 --> 10:03.811
What will you do?

10:03.894 --> 10:05.146
Whatever it takes.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.483
What do you see in me?

10:09.567 --> 10:11.485
Well, I wanted to ask you that.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.991
You were someone who looked like
they would come with me.

10:18.242 --> 10:19.410
That's how I feel.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.757
I promise, okay?
There's no option left here.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.717
I teach Math at a high school.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.178
And I can run too. Soccer every day.

10:38.929 --> 10:42.141
Everyone was asking,
but I held out so you and I could win.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.143
'Cause you and me would be great together.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.311

10:46.062 --> 10:48.314
The… the thing is…
[sighs]

10:48.397 --> 10:50.775
…we don't know which game
we're playing, so…

10:50.858 --> 10:53.277
Hey, choose me so it can just be done.

10:54.111 --> 10:57.406
At this rate, nobody will be left for you,
and you won't continue.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.241
You know,

10:59.325 --> 11:02.870
since the man who'd been cheating
is gone, there's an uneven number.

11:03.454 --> 11:06.165
Once everyone is in pairs,
there'll be one person.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.918
And what happens to that one?

11:09.001 --> 11:10.127
What do you think?

11:10.211 --> 11:12.129
They'll be out and they'll get killed.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.840
I would guess that old man there.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.760

11:22.598 --> 11:23.641

11:23.724 --> 11:25.226

11:26.227 --> 11:27.269
Let's play together.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.537
[Gi-hun] Hey, old man.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.081
Wanna do this together?

11:49.875 --> 11:52.044
[woman on PA] The time for finding
a partner is now over.

11:52.128 --> 11:55.047
[Mi-nyeo] You guys,
you're all making a big mistake.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.134
Do you really think you can win
without me on your team?

11:59.427 --> 12:01.512
It's me, Han Mi-nyeo!

12:01.595 --> 12:06.517
I've made suckers out of everyone there is
from Dongducheon to Gangnam!

12:06.600 --> 12:07.685
Guys…

12:07.768 --> 12:09.895
[breathing shakily]

12:10.729 --> 12:13.357
What if you have to play Gonggi
or Elastics?

12:13.441 --> 12:14.650
I'm an expert in those.

12:14.733 --> 12:18.070
Babe, please, play with me.
Boys aren't very good at those.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.947
-[Player 17] Hey. Get off.
-Come back!

12:21.490 --> 12:23.951
-Hey, come on, be my partner.
-[Player 69] Oh.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.911
Let's show everyone with a dick
they're wrong!

12:25.995 --> 12:27.663
-Let her go.
-After us, we need to stick together.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.874
-[woman] My gosh!
-[Mi-nyeo] I work well with women too!

12:29.957 --> 12:32.501
-I'll be really good! I'll be--
-Stop it!

-Hey, don't trust this scumbag.
-Okay, okay.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.634
He's a jerk. He's just gonna throw you
under the bus.

12:40.718 --> 12:41.677
-Okay, sure.
-Look at me.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.929
-That dead doctor and him worked together.
-Okay.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.055
He played you.

12:45.139 --> 12:49.018
He just wanted to save his own ass,
so he kept it secret from you all.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.603
Tell me if I'm wrong, you jerk!

12:50.686 --> 12:52.146
He was with him, guards!

12:52.229 --> 12:53.606
-Hey.
-He deserves to die too!

12:53.689 --> 12:55.357
Let… let go, bitch!

13:18.005 --> 13:19.548
What? Hey, hold on a second.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.176
Why is the room empty?

13:22.927 --> 13:24.470
I still need a partner.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.639
Hold on. Where did they go?

13:26.722 --> 13:28.432
Who… who took my partner?

13:28.516 --> 13:31.310
What's going on here? You can't do this!
[panicked screaming]

13:31.393 --> 13:32.686
Hey, I need a partner!

13:32.770 --> 13:34.897
[Mi-nyeo screaming]
Let me go! Please!

13:34.980 --> 13:37.441
Bring my partner here, you jerks!

13:37.525 --> 13:39.693
Where's my partner?

13:40.486 --> 13:42.988
I'm so sick of that whore.
[chuckles]

13:43.072 --> 13:45.282
It's nice to think
she won't be in my way again.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.284
-[both scoff]
-And, uh…

13:48.410 --> 13:50.162
what she said about you in there,

13:50.871 --> 13:52.331
you working with the doctor…

13:52.831 --> 13:54.208
It's nothing.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.503
That brat was so desperate,
she said whatever she could.

13:58.504 --> 14:02.007
[woman on PA] Attention.
All players, please follow the staff

14:02.091 --> 14:04.134
to your designated positions for the game.

[suspenseful music]

14:19.608 --> 14:20.776
[Sang-woo] Ali.

14:20.859 --> 14:23.946
Look at me. No one can stop us
if we work together.

14:25.072 --> 14:28.617
I think you and I
could really win the money.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.995
All right, let's do this and get out.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.832
That money is ours
to give to both our families.

14:35.457 --> 14:36.292
Let's do it.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.419
[suspenseful music continues]

14:40.087 --> 14:42.756
[Player 1] You know, when I was a kid,

14:43.549 --> 14:46.510
I live in a neighborhood just like this.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.928
[chuckles]
So did I.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.388
And you know something?

14:49.471 --> 14:51.223
-Our alleyway looked very similar.
-Really?

14:51.307 --> 14:52.349
[chuckles]

14:56.353 --> 14:58.272
[woman on PA] Players,
please take one bag each

14:58.355 --> 14:59.982
from the staff member before you.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.570
[objects clinking]

15:05.321 --> 15:08.657
There should be a set of ten marbles
in each bag.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.868
Please check to confirm the number.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.623
[inhales]
It's marbles.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.917
Old man, we're gonna be playing with this.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.544
-[Player 1] Hmm.
-Are you familiar with it?

15:21.670 --> 15:23.380
Ah, yes, very familiar.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.550
Used to have a lot as a kid. Ah!

15:26.634 --> 15:28.969
Oh, yes, back in the day.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.848
-And you know, I was pretty good.
-[Gi-hun snickers]

15:33.515 --> 15:35.434
-Not too bad myself.
-[both chuckle]

15:35.517 --> 15:36.727
-Ah, that's good news.
-Yeah.

15:36.810 --> 15:39.104
I'm glad it's not just about our strength.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.483
That means you and I are…

15:43.192 --> 15:45.194
gganbu now, pretty great.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.570
Gganbu, huh?

15:47.154 --> 15:50.908
I thought you said you played this before.
Gganbu, come on, you know.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.117
It's a good friend.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.244
One who you trust a lot.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.038
You share things with them, you see?

15:56.121 --> 15:58.040
-Ah!
-Your marbles, everything.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.459
A gganbu. I remember now.

16:00.542 --> 16:03.253
I had one in my town too.
Used to do everything with him.

16:03.337 --> 16:06.298
Okay, we are gganbu.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.967
[grunts]
Yes.

16:10.260 --> 16:13.389
Should we do this to make it official?

16:13.472 --> 16:14.515
[laughs]

16:14.598 --> 16:16.266
Yeah, buddy. Like this.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.643
[both chuckle]

16:18.227 --> 16:20.813
-You and me, sir… Oh, no, gganbu, man.
-Yeah? Mm.

16:20.896 --> 16:23.190
We'll go around this whole town,
and take all the marbles.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.650
[both chuckle]

16:26.902 --> 16:27.861
[sighs]

16:27.945 --> 16:31.824
[woman on PA] In this game,
using your set of ten marbles,

16:31.907 --> 16:35.244
you will play the game of your choice
with your partner.

16:35.327 --> 16:39.373
The player who manages to take
all ten marbles from their partner wins.

16:39.456 --> 16:40.624
[tense music sting]

16:40.708 --> 16:42.501
Let me repeat the instructions.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.587
Using your set of ten marbles,

16:45.671 --> 16:48.215
play the game of your choice
with your partner.

16:48.298 --> 16:52.594
The player who manages to take
all ten marbles from their partner wins.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.596
Oh, boy.
[inhales sharply]

16:55.222 --> 16:57.433
[chuckles]
Shit, man.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.143
[Player 278 breathing shakily]

17:03.063 --> 17:05.441
-[somber music]
-[exhales]

17:05.524 --> 17:06.442
Sang-woo.

17:11.739 --> 17:12.906
How pretty.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.910
Sir, excuse me.
[sighs]

17:18.537 --> 17:21.290
[woman on PA]
You will have 30 minutes for this game.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.208
-Let the game begins.
-[ticking]

17:23.876 --> 17:25.627
Uh, sir, come back.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.965
[breathing heavily]

17:33.010 --> 17:36.013
[ominous music]

17:44.229 --> 17:45.898
[ticking]

17:50.360 --> 17:51.236
Let's start.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.074
That means one of us ends up dead,
doesn't it?

17:55.157 --> 17:58.494
So both of us should do nothing then?
So we should just die?

18:00.621 --> 18:02.790
Or one of us dies so the other can go on.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.045
[Sang-woo]
You haven't played before, right?

18:10.881 --> 18:12.216
[Player 240 sighs]

18:13.509 --> 18:16.595
Since the Korean War,
nothing has been this sad.

18:17.679 --> 18:18.597
Tragic.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.475
What should we play then?

18:21.975 --> 18:23.519
Wow. You're so cold.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.729
As cold as ice.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.692
So you a spy from the North or what?

18:30.776 --> 18:32.486
Hey, stop the dumbshit, girl.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.739
What game are we gonna play?

18:35.823 --> 18:37.825
[background chatter]

18:39.409 --> 18:40.744
You tell me.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.623
These boomers know all these games.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.002
Ten marbles,
then we can create our own game.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.172
Hmm. I'll try to come up with one.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.094
We must be close.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.597
Yes, it was somewhere around here, huh.

19:02.391 --> 19:06.061
Come on, let's play. Sir, we need to, huh?
Come, let's play this right now.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.063
[Player 1] This is so strange.

19:08.772 --> 19:12.359
-It should be here. This is the alley.
-[whimpers]

19:12.860 --> 19:16.029
Where… My house, where did it go?

19:16.113 --> 19:17.322
[Gi-hun] Sir, come back.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.825
[Sang-woo exhaling]

19:21.660 --> 19:26.456
So you guess if I'm holding even or odd.
Which one you think is in here.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.875
That all makes sense to you?

19:28.458 --> 19:29.710
Even or odd?

19:31.128 --> 19:32.212
What's that?

19:33.213 --> 19:34.715
[sighs]

19:34.798 --> 19:37.593
Odd is like one, three, five.

19:39.344 --> 19:42.139
And even is two, four, six.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.308
Understand?

19:47.060 --> 19:51.481
Just think it through.
Then you wager a few of your own.

19:53.817 --> 19:54.818
[Player 278] Odd.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.531
[Deok-su inhales, exhales]

20:00.741 --> 20:01.825
[marbles clink]

20:02.576 --> 20:04.661
[Player 278 chuckles]

20:04.745 --> 20:05.787
Open your hand.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.713
Ah, shit.

20:15.297 --> 20:18.050
I should have added another one.
[chuckles]

20:21.094 --> 20:22.888
Stop giggling, asshole.

20:23.847 --> 20:27.100
Hey, old man,
who are you calling asshole, huh?

20:27.684 --> 20:31.063
You really think I'm your minion
just 'cause I call you "boss" a few times?

20:31.146 --> 20:33.232
-You wanna die, you bastard?
-You wanna show me?

20:33.315 --> 20:35.609
Ooh! So, how are you gonna do it?

20:35.692 --> 20:40.072
Hmm? You can't resort to violence,
you puny little idiot dog.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.157
[heavy breathing]

20:42.241 --> 20:44.576
[Player 278 sniggers]

20:45.744 --> 20:48.747
Sir, we have to play now.
We gotta start right now.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.624
Play what?

20:51.667 --> 20:53.627
With our marbles. Let's go.

20:54.670 --> 20:55.671
Why should I?

20:56.463 --> 20:58.757
Look around you. Everybody else is too.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.136
We gotta do this.

21:03.887 --> 21:04.930
No.

21:06.014 --> 21:08.850
That game is for little children.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.521
-[grunts]
-No. Sir, come back here.

21:15.857 --> 21:17.067
So let's…

21:18.110 --> 21:19.903
end the game in one round.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.159
All or nothing. A simple bet.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.708
Don't tell me that you would
rather do what they are?

21:33.667 --> 21:35.460
[man 1] Watch.
[pants]

21:36.420 --> 21:38.880
-Bullseye! Yes.
-[man 2] Ah, damn it.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.093
-[man 2] My turn.
-Okay.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.095
Playing what then?

21:45.178 --> 21:46.972
Why are you in such a hurry?

21:47.973 --> 21:49.599
You're just dying to kill me, huh?

21:50.892 --> 21:52.102
[sighs]

21:54.521 --> 21:56.315
We're just playing one round here.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.151
And we got time left too.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.862
Let's wait till the end.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.364
What are we gonna do before then?

22:05.490 --> 22:06.408
Talk.

22:06.908 --> 22:08.452
About what, though?

22:09.995 --> 22:12.414
Things we never told anybody about
I guess.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.336
One of us is gonna die here, so…

22:19.129 --> 22:20.922
doesn't matter what we tell each other.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.800
No one can really embarrass
themselves anymore.

22:24.676 --> 22:25.552
Okay?

22:27.596 --> 22:29.056
[Ali sighs]
Even.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.851
-[background chatter]
-[clock ticking]

22:37.814 --> 22:38.940
[exhales]

22:39.858 --> 22:41.443
What's your wager?

22:44.613 --> 22:45.655
[Ali] Two.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.491
[inhales, exhales]

22:48.950 --> 22:50.077
[marbles clink]

22:51.870 --> 22:54.873
[suspenseful music]

23:04.049 --> 23:05.092
You're up now.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.262
I don't want to do this with you, sir.

23:09.930 --> 23:10.764
Can I stop?

23:11.932 --> 23:13.558
I would like to play with someone else--

23:13.642 --> 23:15.435
Shut up and keep playing with me. Come on.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.146
Sir, he's not in his right mind, sir.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.606
I think he's got dementia.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.691
That does mean that he's out or…

23:21.775 --> 23:24.152
He's not gonna play.
So that means he forfeited, right? Huh?

23:25.654 --> 23:26.905
Ah, shit.

23:30.408 --> 23:32.869
Just one little game, okay?
Here, it'll be…

23:32.953 --> 23:34.788
It'll be so much fun, sir.

23:34.871 --> 23:37.374
No. I'd better go home now.

23:38.625 --> 23:43.672
I know my house is nearby.
It's somewhere down this alley.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.758
[grunts]
Shit! Goddamn it!

23:46.842 --> 23:49.553
Will you please just pull yourself
together, old man?

23:50.053 --> 23:52.889
They'll kill us both
if we don't get started soon!

23:52.973 --> 23:53.807
[sobs]

23:53.890 --> 23:56.768
You got that thing in your head,
so I bet you don't care what happens here,

23:56.852 --> 23:59.187
but I won't just sit here and die, okay?

23:59.271 --> 24:00.689
Listen, I can't die!

24:00.772 --> 24:02.899
-I need to get out of here.
-[Player 1 whimpers]

[Gi-hun breathes shakily]

24:06.111 --> 24:08.738
All right, I will, but don't yell.

24:14.619 --> 24:19.332
…12, 13, 14, 15. Bam, okay.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.503
We're playing something else.

24:24.045 --> 24:26.298
No way. I'm not gonna stop now.

24:27.757 --> 24:30.093
We already did things how you suggested.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.138
I should get a chance to choose.

24:33.221 --> 24:34.556
[Player 278 breathing shakily]

Goddamn it.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.316
You people said we're equals.
What is this?

24:44.399 --> 24:47.068
I think we should play
a new game here, huh?

What do you wanna play then, huh?

25:01.583 --> 25:02.417
Even.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.712
[foreboding music]

25:08.715 --> 25:10.508
Do it. Show me.

[exhales]

25:40.830 --> 25:42.165
You asshole.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.795
You gotta be cheating.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.714
Uh, Sang-woo, why would I do that to you?

25:49.798 --> 25:51.675
How are you winning like this every round?

25:51.758 --> 25:53.385
You keep beating me. How's that?

25:54.761 --> 25:56.680
The odds should be 50-50.
That means you're cheating!

25:57.264 --> 25:59.766
I didn't. No!
Sir, I wouldn't do that to you.

26:00.517 --> 26:03.395
You jerk! You pretended not to know
how this works!

26:03.478 --> 26:05.272
You said you haven't done this before!

[Player 240]
Why did you come here from the North?

26:18.660 --> 26:20.328
I thought things were good over here.

26:24.666 --> 26:25.625
And so?

26:26.793 --> 26:27.794
Were you right?

26:34.217 --> 26:36.594
Your family, are they here with you?

26:40.348 --> 26:41.683
Just my brother.

26:42.475 --> 26:43.810
Your parents?

26:48.732 --> 26:51.985
My father got shot trying to swim
across the border and drowned.

26:52.068 --> 26:53.236
Our mother…

26:55.238 --> 26:58.950
she was hiding in China and got sent back
once the immigration agents found her.

27:02.412 --> 27:04.080
Where is your brother now then?

27:08.251 --> 27:09.544
In a shelter.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.836
[Deok-su] We take turns throwing marbles

27:51.920 --> 27:55.215
till you make a shot that lands
in the hole I dug over there.

27:55.882 --> 27:56.716
Then what happens?

27:56.800 --> 28:00.387
What happens is that person
gets to take everything on the ground.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.806
Ah…

28:02.889 --> 28:05.767
You mean, you want a way
to turn this around, huh.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.520
-What? You scared?
-Not a chance.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.605
I'm not worried at all.

I'm pretty good
at getting things in the holes, huh.

You sure about this, hmm?

28:20.198 --> 28:21.783
[ticking]

28:23.201 --> 28:26.996
If you win the money and get out of here,
what's your plan then?

28:28.081 --> 28:30.583
I did this to get a house
where I could be with my brother first.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.127
Then I'll get our mother out of the North.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.545
[scoffs]

28:33.628 --> 28:37.340
Hey, with a price that big,
you can do a whole lot more than that.

28:38.091 --> 28:39.467
You gotta want something else too.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.636
Is there anywhere you wanna go?

28:44.222 --> 28:45.473
Jeju Island.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.808
Jeju Island?

28:49.352 --> 28:50.770
There was a thing about it on TV.

28:51.354 --> 28:53.898
It looked exotic.
It didn't look like Korea at all.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.275
[chuckles]
Hey.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.944
Don't you think
you should dream bigger, huh?

28:58.486 --> 29:02.240
Do Hawaii. Hold on, go to the Maldives
for a while instead.

29:02.323 --> 29:03.908
And have a mojito too.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.120
Mojito?

29:07.203 --> 29:08.788
Like the movie.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.457
Lee Byung-hun's in it.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.585
"Go to mojito
and have a glass of Maldives."

29:14.419 --> 29:15.503
Really?

29:15.587 --> 29:16.755
[Player 240 chuckles]

29:17.338 --> 29:19.466
Oh, no, we gotta fix that then.

29:19.549 --> 29:20.717
Well, once we're out of here,

29:20.800 --> 29:23.970
we'll have a girls' night out
and make mojitos and everything, okay?

29:24.053 --> 29:24.888
[laughs]

29:30.101 --> 29:31.311
Oh.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.523
We can't both get out of here.

29:37.484 --> 29:38.318
[scoffs]

29:40.028 --> 29:41.279
[Sang-woo sighs]

29:45.366 --> 29:47.202
[Sang-woo crying]

29:48.745 --> 29:50.163
God, I'm so sorry, Ali.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.166
I know you won't cheat.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.252
But I can't die this way, I beg you.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.005
They'll kill my family

30:00.757 --> 30:02.634
if I don't get out of here.

30:02.717 --> 30:05.637
-Sorry, Sang-woo. No.
-[Sang-woo sobbing]

30:07.013 --> 30:08.264
[Ali] I'm so sorry.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.934
I have to think of my family.

30:11.518 --> 30:12.852
Hey, Ali. Hey.

30:13.436 --> 30:14.896
Hey, come on, if you help me,

30:14.979 --> 30:16.898
then there's a way
that both of us could live.

30:18.024 --> 30:20.026
You only got this far 'cause I was there.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.655
Like when I gave the bus fare to you and…

30:23.738 --> 30:25.907
I'm the one who got the team
through Tug-of-War,

30:25.990 --> 30:28.117
we kept watch at night together.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.494
And just before this begin,

30:29.577 --> 30:31.704
you and I swore
that we leave here together, right, Ali?

30:31.788 --> 30:33.289
[sobbing]

30:33.373 --> 30:35.291
Listen, Ali, please.

30:35.375 --> 30:38.169
Trust me, help me
and I'll make sure we get out of here.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.046
Huh?

30:40.630 --> 30:42.048
[sobs]

30:42.757 --> 30:44.300
Okay. What do we do?

30:45.134 --> 30:47.887
[Player 1] What is it? It might be odd.

30:50.181 --> 30:52.809
On the other hand, it could be even.

30:55.353 --> 30:57.647
-That must be it.
-Come on, hurry up and go.

30:58.773 --> 30:59.899
Odd.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.363
[exhales]

31:08.366 --> 31:11.035
[Player 1 laughing]

31:12.245 --> 31:15.415
Look at that. I won again.
[chuckles]

31:16.082 --> 31:17.458
How many are in yours?

31:17.542 --> 31:19.335
[chuckles]
Uh…

31:19.419 --> 31:20.587
[chimes]

31:21.671 --> 31:23.631

31:40.607 --> 31:42.650
[gasps]
I, uh…

31:43.234 --> 31:44.569
I still have one.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.237
I still have one more.

31:49.032 --> 31:49.866

32:20.688 --> 32:22.065
[Player 278] Goddamn it.

32:22.815 --> 32:24.192
Okay, here's what I think.

32:24.275 --> 32:27.362
I think there are gonna be teams out there
who can't decide the winner either.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.322
Mm. Why not?

32:30.031 --> 32:31.449
Think about how you win.

32:31.532 --> 32:35.161
Remember the rules. Thirty minutes
to determine who will win or lose.

32:36.996 --> 32:38.081
So think about it.

32:38.164 --> 32:40.833
Some teams aren't gonna have a winner
when time is finally up, right?

32:40.917 --> 32:43.711
You win and you lose,
and things just keep going on like that.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.838
That means not every team
will have a winner.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.799
What will they do?
Eliminate all those teams?

32:48.299 --> 32:50.677
Makes no sense.
They have to decide who won. Don't they?

32:51.970 --> 32:52.804
Yeah.

32:53.638 --> 32:57.058
We'll play again.
We'll be working together.

32:58.184 --> 33:00.395
We're teammates.
So we'll just add up everything.

33:00.478 --> 33:03.064
Our team will go play other teams
with all 20.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.567
You and I can play as a team

33:07.610 --> 33:09.696
just like we planned to from the start.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.366
You and I will get out of here.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.004
Is that what you want?

33:27.171 --> 33:28.673
You want them to do that to me?

33:34.053 --> 33:36.764
You ever have to see anyone die
before those?

33:38.641 --> 33:41.602
Once, we have this plague
go through my town when I was a kid.

33:44.147 --> 33:47.275
As time went on, more and more towns
got sick and died.

33:49.068 --> 33:52.280
Soldiers started carrying the dead
into piles and lit them on fire.

33:53.281 --> 33:56.534
That's how my grandpa, grandma
and older brother all died.

33:57.744 --> 33:58.995
They burned together.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.291
Damn. Your stories are
a bit too dark even for me.

34:03.916 --> 34:04.917
[scoffs]

34:05.543 --> 34:06.461
And you?

34:07.378 --> 34:08.463

34:16.304 --> 34:17.680
First body I saw…

34:18.598 --> 34:19.557
my mother's.

34:20.975 --> 34:23.061
One day, I came back from school,

34:24.187 --> 34:26.481
and my mom was lying there,
dead on the floor.

34:28.608 --> 34:29.817
And next to her…

34:31.360 --> 34:33.613
was my so-called dad with a knife.

34:35.823 --> 34:37.575
The next body that I saw…

34:40.411 --> 34:41.704
that was my dad's.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.459
And the person standing there
holding the knife…

34:47.043 --> 34:48.169
that was me.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.715
He was a goddamn pastor too.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.884
[thrilling music]

34:56.260 --> 34:58.054
And when he hit her and…

34:59.764 --> 35:02.975
did the things he did to me,
he would talk to God.

35:04.727 --> 35:07.021
He'd always ask for forgiveness.

35:07.772 --> 35:10.483
He didn't pray on that day
after he killed her.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.780
I was too mad he even forgot, I guess.

No, hold on. That's not what…
Wait a minute.

Just give me a second.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.131
What?

36:17.633 --> 36:19.010
Can you repeat…

36:20.011 --> 36:22.305
what you said just now?

36:26.726 --> 36:27.852
Even.

36:29.353 --> 36:30.646
I said…

36:31.314 --> 36:32.356
even.

36:37.278 --> 36:38.279
Oh.

37:04.931 --> 37:08.100
We both can win this round? Are you sure?

37:08.184 --> 37:09.477
Hmm.

37:10.436 --> 37:11.437
You're positive?

37:11.520 --> 37:14.523
Just hear me out first
and then turn me down if you like.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.235
I mean it. Here.

37:18.194 --> 37:20.363
Let me just give you this
to hold on to, okay?

37:22.198 --> 37:24.617
So you won't have any guilt
around my death.

37:25.826 --> 37:26.953
Your plan…

37:28.079 --> 37:29.288
what is it?

37:30.373 --> 37:32.375
[woman on PA] Player 68, eliminated.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.460
Well, it will depend
on who we're going against.

37:34.543 --> 37:36.921
We need to know which teams will be here
after the round ends.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.465
We better split up to get an idea

37:39.548 --> 37:41.467
how all the other teams are doing
to be prepared.

37:42.176 --> 37:44.428
Let's look for one
that seem too young or old,

37:44.512 --> 37:47.181
and check only teams that are still
playing games at this point.

37:48.182 --> 37:49.976
-Young or old?
-Yeah.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.394
That's what we need.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.063
Like someone who looks your same age

37:54.146 --> 37:56.941
or someone who seems like
they're older than 50.

37:59.277 --> 38:02.113
You go up a few blocks from here,
then meet up back up with me later, okay?

38:02.196 --> 38:03.281
Okay, Sang-woo.

-Ali.
-Huh?

38:15.668 --> 38:17.295
It's too dangerous to keep it out.

before the end.

38:20.172 --> 38:21.549

Here. I'll make sure that it's safe, okay?

if you win all that money and get out?

38:52.705 --> 38:54.165
I don't know what I would do.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.336
Someone was waiting

38:59.170 --> 39:00.921
at the prison the day I got out.

39:01.881 --> 39:04.717
I thought he was a creditor
who came to collect my dad's debt.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.552
But he pulled out a card.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.721
That weird card.

39:10.473 --> 39:13.267
I had nowhere else to go, so I…

never thought about what I'd do
if I got the money.

How's that?

Yeah.

Yeah, but, um, what was your guess?

42:37.263 --> 42:38.180
Huh?

42:40.140 --> 42:44.270
Oh, yeah. But which one did I guess?

You said even was your guess.

Did I…

Yeah.

47:17.709 --> 47:19.294
[Sae-byeok] Who should go first then?

47:19.378 --> 47:20.462
It should be your turn.

47:21.630 --> 47:23.257
Since your number is lower.

47:29.346 --> 47:33.350
[Player 1] Let me see. Darn it.
I'm out of marbles.

Hey. Would you let me

47:49.825 --> 47:52.619

Stop. Why the hell
would you try to do that?

49:24.670 --> 49:27.047
Hey, butter fingers, what else can I say?

49:28.757 --> 49:29.883
What you said

49:31.134 --> 49:33.011
making sure that I won.
Is that what this is?

49:35.764 --> 49:37.766
You think I'll be thankful
that you did this, huh?

49:38.475 --> 49:39.601
Take another throw.

49:39.685 --> 49:41.770
And I still wouldn't be able to win.

49:42.646 --> 49:44.981
Ugh. Just let me lose
this thing in style, okay?

49:45.065 --> 49:48.110

I have nothing.

49:53.156 --> 49:54.199
[Sae-byeok] What?

49:55.575 --> 49:57.661
You got a reason to get out of this place,

50:00.122 --> 50:01.123
but I don't.

50:01.206 --> 50:02.958

50:05.669 --> 50:07.170
I thought hard about what I'd do.

If I were the one who got out
since you asked me earlier.

I got nothing.

50:35.031 --> 50:36.241
And go…

50:38.201 --> 50:39.703
And go meet your mother.

Go get your brother too.

you have one marble left.

53:05.807 --> 53:07.809
We're running out of time, sir.

53:08.894 --> 53:12.314
And I, I would come home from work,

53:13.273 --> 53:17.819
and see my son, his friends
were always here and they would all play,

53:17.903 --> 53:19.863
and they wouldn't even know I was here.

53:19.946 --> 53:21.406
You need to get it together!

53:21.489 --> 53:23.992
Get it together and play with me again
right now, understood?

53:24.075 --> 53:27.871
I would hide and I'd go
just behind the utility pole there

and just watching.

What?
