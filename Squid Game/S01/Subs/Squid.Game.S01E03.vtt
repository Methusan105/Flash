Sorry.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.538
I just got seasick.

[masked deck supervisor 3]
Did you forget the rules?

05:36.044 --> 05:38.588
You do not speak

[soft classical music playing on speakers]

Wake up. Get up, huh?

-[Player 1] Uh-huh.
-[sighs]

07:35.663 --> 07:36.873

07:36.956 --> 07:38.040
You're here.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.542
[gasps]

07:41.210 --> 07:44.005
So Player 456 came back.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.298
Yeah.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.425
I got scared.
I thought you were gone for good.

07:47.508 --> 07:48.593
[chuckles]

07:49.093 --> 07:52.972
Hey. I won't die so easily, you know.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.807
-I know you won't.
-[Player 1 chuckles]

07:54.891 --> 07:57.727
I stopped playing because of you,
and I'm back because of what you said.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.395
I'm actually sort of partial to you.

-[classical music playing]
-[background chatter]

08:07.528 --> 08:10.948
[Player 1] A lot of people
decided to come back.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.577
[sighs]
You're right. Hmm.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.996
-Yeah.
-I guess everybody's desperate.

08:17.788 --> 08:18.956
-Oh.
-Huh?

08:19.040 --> 08:22.877
There, look. That's the woman who couldn't
name her kid. She came back too.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.961
[Player 1] You're right.

08:24.045 --> 08:27.173
Think she named her kid yet?

08:27.673 --> 08:28.674
I don't know.

08:28.758 --> 08:29.675
[Sang-woo] Gi-hun.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.010
Oh, Sang-woo.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.224
So you're here.
I didn't think I'd see you.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.643
[clicks tongue]

08:39.644 --> 08:41.020
Neither did I.
[awkward chuckle]

08:42.313 --> 08:43.397
And you?

08:44.649 --> 08:46.192
Your mom, did you see her?

08:48.110 --> 08:49.529
[Ali] Hey, good sirs.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.447
[Gi-hun] Oh. Hey.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.157
It's my angel.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.159
I'm happy to see both of you.
I hope we make it.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.452
[Gi-hun sighs]

08:56.536 --> 08:58.871
Thanks for the bus fare, sir.
It meant so much to me.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.540
What, you gave him the bus fare?

09:00.623 --> 09:02.792
Because he said that
he'd walk Yeouido to Ansan.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.461
[chuckles]
That's so heartwarming.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.297
We're like a bunch of soldiers
at training camp, huh?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.341
-[Gi-hun laughs]
-A training camp is what?

09:11.342 --> 09:14.345
You know, it's like the army
shooting guns.

09:14.428 --> 09:17.056
Oh! Soldiers all training together?

09:17.139 --> 09:18.015
Uh-huh.

09:18.891 --> 09:19.850
Wait a minute.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.854
Since we're on the subject now,
you should join me.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.940
We should just form our own team,
don't you think?

09:26.023 --> 09:29.193
You're right. Who knows what game
they'll have us play next.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.530
It wouldn't hurt to be in a group
so we're ready for anything.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.575
Hey, you should join up with us.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.119
I mean, we already know he's crazy strong.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.121
You saw it.

09:40.204 --> 09:43.040
He lifted me up with one hand
like it was nothing at all.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.461
You mean… that you… I can join you?

09:47.545 --> 09:51.257
Oh, yeah, sure. Uh, so then,
you'll be the new recruit.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.634
He's the skilled corporal,
and that means I'm a sergeant.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.554
Oh, man. Thank you, sir.
[chuckles]

09:56.637 --> 09:59.015
-Please just drop the "sir," will you?
-[Player 1] Excuse me.

10:00.016 --> 10:04.854
If you don't mind,
can I join up with all of you?

10:04.937 --> 10:06.063
Yeah, of course.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.733
And you can be the… Hold on…

10:08.816 --> 10:12.069
So you can be the old major
who's been in the army his entire life.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.904
-Thanks so much.
-[both laugh]

10:14.488 --> 10:18.659
Yeah. Quite a team we got going here.
Damn! Let's do this.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.411
[chuckles]

10:20.494 --> 10:23.247
I'll take you in again
and look past everything.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.207
Come and join us.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.086
We were a good team
for a while out there, huh?

10:29.629 --> 10:30.921
Are you actually serious?

10:32.465 --> 10:34.592
I mean, everybody out there
is still looking for you.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.135
Stop with the act.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.596
It doesn't matter how tough you are,

10:38.679 --> 10:41.432
you're not going to win in this place.
Not on your own.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.727
Didn't you notice?
[chuckles]

10:44.810 --> 10:46.687
Those jerks with masks came in

10:46.771 --> 10:48.481
and removed the beds
of the people who died.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.400
Make one mistake out there,
and yours is next.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.318
[chuckles]

10:53.027 --> 10:54.904
Worry about your own ass, okay?

10:54.987 --> 10:56.656
[men laugh]

10:56.739 --> 10:58.824
-[Deok-su sighs]
-[Player 67] Don't join him.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.035
This guy's a dumb dumbass.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.331
He liked to pick
all of his little minions' pockets

11:05.414 --> 11:07.458
just so he could fill up his own.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.087
He got bold enough one day
to go after his head honcho's pockets,

11:11.170 --> 11:12.171
but now he's in here.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.256
'Cause he was stupid and got caught.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.843
You know what people in my hometown
would call you, huh?

11:20.805 --> 11:22.848
A damn revolutionary asshole.

11:22.932 --> 11:23.933
[men laugh]

11:24.016 --> 11:26.185
You communist little bitch, I'm gonna…

11:26.852 --> 11:28.771
[grunts]
Excuse me.

11:29.647 --> 11:30.773
Am I interrupting you?

11:31.357 --> 11:32.483
Sorry.

11:32.566 --> 11:33.776
What is it?

11:33.859 --> 11:34.735
Oh, boy.

11:35.569 --> 11:36.862
You're really good looking.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.739
[chuckles]

11:38.823 --> 11:39.740
[scoffs]

11:40.241 --> 11:42.451
Come on, let me join you guys.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.411
Join what?

11:43.994 --> 11:45.704
I'll be your teammate.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.540
[men chuckle]

11:48.624 --> 11:50.084
Tell me what you're good at?

11:50.167 --> 11:52.253
Everything, except the things I can't do.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.298
And I'm certainly better
than some skinny girl.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.801
-A lot better.
-[men exclaim]

11:59.301 --> 12:00.428
You mean, you're that good?

12:03.764 --> 12:04.974
How about it?

12:05.766 --> 12:07.017
Plenty of empty beds.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.686
[men snigger]

12:10.855 --> 12:13.649
[woman on PA] Attention.
Your mealtime begins now.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.943
-All players, please form a line…
-Maybe later.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.111
…in the center of the room.

12:17.611 --> 12:19.613
[woman on PA]
Let me repeat the instruction.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.700
-Attention. Your mealtime begins now.
-[chuckles]

12:22.783 --> 12:25.911
All players, please form a line
in the center of the room.

[classical music playing on speakers]

12:49.977 --> 12:53.230
[masked manager] Out of 201, 187 returned.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.858
The re-entrance rate is 93 percent.

12:58.527 --> 13:01.322
[Front Man] Keep an eye on the ones
who didn't return to play

13:01.906 --> 13:03.115
and keep me posted.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.325
[masked manager] Yes, sir.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.040
[receding footsteps]

13:11.123 --> 13:13.125
[indistinct chatter]

13:22.468 --> 13:24.303
-[Gi-hun] Mm…
-Ahh…

13:25.346 --> 13:27.097
This brings back old memories.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.391
Do you remember eating lunches
like this too?

13:29.475 --> 13:30.351
Of course.

13:30.893 --> 13:34.563
My wife was always in the kitchen
every morning.

13:34.647 --> 13:39.276
She'd pack lunches just like these ones
for me and my kids.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.236
[chuckles]

13:40.319 --> 13:42.530
I wish the rice was piping hot.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.116
At least they could've
warmed it up a little.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.244
[grumbles]
All we need is a stove.

13:48.744 --> 13:49.578
Remember doing that?

13:51.038 --> 13:54.333
The little briquette stove we had
in our elementary school classroom.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.793
We'd stick our lunch boxes on it.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.087
It'd get burning hot on us too,

13:58.170 --> 13:59.838
and the rice'd get all scorched. Hmm?

14:01.840 --> 14:02.800
Gi-hun.

14:02.883 --> 14:03.926
Hmm?

14:04.009 --> 14:05.928
Let's try to stay on the subject.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.138
How about putting your mind
to what the game could be?

14:09.890 --> 14:10.766
[Player 1] Mm.

14:10.849 --> 14:11.767
Hey.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.103
No one can figure that out.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.146
We'll find out when it's time.

14:17.314 --> 14:20.651
You know, considering the last one
that we did,

14:20.734 --> 14:25.990
I think that there'll be another old game
kids played, just like I used to.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.616
I'll bet you right there.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.160
Think of all the ones they could choose.

14:30.786 --> 14:31.996
Ddakji, Dabanggu,

14:32.079 --> 14:33.956
there's Hopscotch, Biseokchigi,

14:34.039 --> 14:36.250
and Tag, Don Katsu, Freeze Tag.

14:36.750 --> 14:41.005
And for girls, there's Gonggi, Elastics,
Cat's Cradle and…

14:42.548 --> 14:43.799
And what else?

14:44.925 --> 14:46.510
I don't know how to play those.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.597
You don't know any of the games I listed?

14:51.348 --> 14:52.433
Hey, listen to me.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.643
All those games are easy to learn.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.437
And we'll teach them to you.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.480
[chuckles]

14:58.564 --> 14:59.815
That's much appreciated.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.448
[mysterious music]

15:07.531 --> 15:10.367
[woman on PA] Attention.
The work schedule is done for today.

15:10.451 --> 15:14.747
All active staff, please take this time
to return to your rooms.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.042
Let me repeat the instruction.

15:19.209 --> 15:21.378
The work schedule is done for today.

15:22.004 --> 15:26.342
All active staff, please take this time

16:02.419 --> 16:03.587
1. ALWAYS WEAR YOUR MASK
OUTSIDE THE ROOM

16:03.671 --> 16:04.797
2. DO NOT CONVERSE
WITHOUT PERMISSION

WITHOUT PERMISSION

16:10.803 --> 16:13.847
[Player 212] Hey, hey, hey!
Open the door, you jerks!

16:13.931 --> 16:16.892
I have to pee really bad, right now!

Look, it's mostly men in here, okay?
Want a puddle here?

[masked supervisor] You may not leave
this room past your given curfew.

I beg to get the damn toilet,

17:32.134 --> 17:34.136

right on top of it like that?

17:35.012 --> 17:35.971
Hey.

You're a pretty annoying girl, aren't you?

I smelled it, though.

What did it smell like?

25:28.485 --> 25:29.653
Sugar or something.

25:29.736 --> 25:30.862

Are you saying
they were melting sugar in there?

Oh, when I was a kid,
I had problems digesting it,

So our options are circle, triangle,

31:26.801 --> 31:28.261
star, umbrella.

31:28.761 --> 31:32.640
I don't know. They seem very familiar.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.811
[Sang-woo] You tell me what you saw,
I might guess what it is.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.522
They were heating sugar.

31:40.565 --> 31:44.235
[suspenseful music]

31:58.082 --> 31:59.500
[gasps]

32:01.836 --> 32:02.837
[Gi-hun] Sang-woo.

32:02.921 --> 32:03.922
Huh?

32:04.005 --> 32:04.964
Got anything?

32:06.883 --> 32:07.926
Not yet.

32:09.886 --> 32:13.723
[woman on PA] Choose a shape
and stand in front of it immediately.

32:15.224 --> 32:18.937
Choose a shape
and stand in front of it immediately.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.855
[indistinct chatter]

32:20.939 --> 32:22.523
[murmurs]
What do you think it could be?

32:29.697 --> 32:31.032
Should we play this together?

32:34.035 --> 32:35.119
That could be dangerous.

32:36.245 --> 32:37.914
At this point, we don't know anything.

32:37.997 --> 32:40.458
I think it would put us at a disadvantage
if we just choose one.

32:40.541 --> 32:41.668
You think?

32:41.751 --> 32:43.336
There's this saying in investing.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.505
"Try not to keep your eggs
in the same basket."

32:45.588 --> 32:46.631
[chuckles]

32:47.298 --> 32:48.633
Listen to him.

32:48.716 --> 32:51.511
He was first in his class
in SNU Business School.

32:51.594 --> 32:54.222
And in my hometown,
he was a genius. A prodigy.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.599
Really? Is that so?

32:56.683 --> 32:58.768
Well then, he is an incredible guy, huh?

32:58.851 --> 33:00.311
-Are you kidding me?
-[both chuckle]

33:00.937 --> 33:05.483
Like Sang-woo told us, let's all split up
and take it from there, huh?

33:06.234 --> 33:07.610
[Gi-hun] Who should go where?

33:08.236 --> 33:10.029
[indistinct chatter]

33:12.573 --> 33:14.450
All right, let me go triangle.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.077
What about you?

33:17.996 --> 33:18.830
Dayira.

33:20.623 --> 33:22.000
-[Gi-hun] Huh?
-Dayira.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.751
-A circle, you mean?
-Yeah.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.129
It looks just like the moon
where I'm from.

33:26.212 --> 33:27.797
[Gi-hun sighs, clicks tongue]

33:28.381 --> 33:30.591
That means we have star and umbrella.

33:31.342 --> 33:32.593
[Player 1 sighs]

33:33.845 --> 33:35.722
You pick first. Go on.

33:36.305 --> 33:37.598
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.064
-Uh, then I'm choosing the umbrella.
-[Sang-woo] Hmm?

33:45.648 --> 33:46.482
You sure?

33:47.150 --> 33:47.984
Why?

33:48.985 --> 33:52.447
Oh, growing up, I'd always lose
my umbrella so my mom would get angry.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.824
So then, she gave me broken ones
to bring to school.

33:55.324 --> 33:58.036
I always wanted her to get me
one of those good umbrellas

33:58.119 --> 34:00.121
-like the other kids.
-Mm-hm.

34:00.830 --> 34:03.875
Um, don't want the star?
Or do you wanna switch with me?

34:03.958 --> 34:07.462
Oh, no, the star sounds great.
[clears throat]

34:08.004 --> 34:09.172
Good with me.

34:09.672 --> 34:13.426
Besides, nobody really sees
many stars these days.

34:13.509 --> 34:15.595
Great, let's get moving.

34:16.471 --> 34:19.098
Once we know what we're up against,
let's set up a strategy together.

34:19.182 --> 34:20.016
[Player 1] Sure.

34:20.683 --> 34:22.226
-All right.
-[Player 1] Hmm.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.063
Gi-hun, wait.

34:25.646 --> 34:26.856
Huh?

34:28.232 --> 34:29.609
[inhales sharply]

34:29.692 --> 34:30.693

34:55.218 --> 34:57.762
[woman on PA]
The time to select your shape has ended.

34:57.845 --> 35:00.807
I will now explain the rules
of the next game.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.895

35:07.814 --> 35:12.777
All players, please take one case each
from the table at the front of your line.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.714
[woman on PA]
The second game is sugar honeycombs.

36:14.797 --> 36:16.299
The shape you have chosen

36:16.382 --> 36:19.093
is the shape you must remove
from the honeycomb.

36:22.263 --> 36:23.556
[Gi-hun] I'm dead.

36:27.059 --> 36:29.437
[woman on PA]
The time limit is ten minutes.

36:30.188 --> 36:34.108
You will pass if you trim out the shape
without it breaking or cracking

36:34.192 --> 36:35.151
within the time limit.

36:35.234 --> 36:37.820
