00:20.228 --> 00:23.898
[man] In my town, we had a game
called the "Squid Game."

00:25.859 --> 00:29.195
We called it that because it's played
in a court shaped like a squid.

00:30.488 --> 00:31.573
The rules are simple.

00:32.949 --> 00:37.579
Children are divided into two groups,
the offense and the defense.

00:39.914 --> 00:43.960
Once the game starts, the defense
can run around on two feet within bounds,

00:44.044 --> 00:48.006
while the offense outside the lines
are only allowed to hop on one foot.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.469
It's your mom.

00:52.552 --> 00:58.475
[man] But if an attacker cuts through
the waist of the squid passing defense,

00:58.558 --> 01:01.394
then they are given freedom
to use both feet.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.738
[man] Inspector royal.

01:11.821 --> 01:14.657
For whatever reason,
we called that the inspector royal.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.329
When we were ready for the final battle,

01:19.996 --> 01:23.249
all the attackers gathered
at the entrance to the squid.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.504
Go.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.048
[man] In order to win,

01:30.131 --> 01:33.176
the attackers must tap
the small closed-off space

01:33.259 --> 01:35.178
on the squid's head with their foot.

01:36.554 --> 01:39.432
But if someone on the defense
manages to push you

01:39.516 --> 01:41.434
outside of the squid's boundaries,

01:42.519 --> 01:43.603
you die.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.607
That's right. You die.

-[kids cheering]

02:06.376 --> 02:07.544
[man] Victory.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.923
Once you tap the squid's head,
you win and yell out, "Victory."

02:12.924 --> 02:16.845
At that moment,
I felt as if I owned the entire world,

Because there are so many capillaries.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.966
Oh, no. Hey, don't do this.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.052
-I don't wanna die.
-[lender 1] Your blood was tasty.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.597
I think my boys and I
should make a nice delicious soup in it.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.807
I'll pay you!
[sobs]

10:41.891 --> 10:45.353
I'll pay you. I mean it. I'll pay you.
[whimpers]

10:45.436 --> 10:47.438
-[crying]
-Jesus, guy.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.899
Don't make me feel sorry for you
with all that crying.

10:49.982 --> 10:52.109
How did you know I was such a softie?

10:52.193 --> 10:53.402
[sobs]

10:54.278 --> 10:56.989
-Hey.
-[crying]

10:58.282 --> 11:00.409
Okay, wipe off your tears.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.286
Sign here and your fingerprint.

11:03.371 --> 11:07.249
If you don't pay it off by next month,
I'll take one of your kidneys.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.795
And then after that,
I'll take one of your eyes. Okay?

11:12.380 --> 11:14.590
-You don't like it?
-No, uh, I got it. Yeah.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.510
Next month is good with me.
[breathing heavily]

11:17.593 --> 11:19.303
-Here.
-Okay.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.013
Well, I, I need ink.

11:21.722 --> 11:22.807

11:22.890 --> 11:24.517
-[whimpers]
-[lender 1 chuckles]

11:24.600 --> 11:27.186
There, you got your ink.
It's all natural too.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.438
Huh?
[whimpers]

11:29.522 --> 11:30.481
Oh.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.651
[lender 1] That's it. Right there.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.820

11:35.903 --> 11:39.532
[chuckles]
You did it, huh!

11:39.615 --> 11:42.326
You have one month. Take care of yourself.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.829
Uh, hold on. Sir, excuse me.

11:46.956 --> 11:50.167
I'm sorry to even ask but…
[stammers]

11:50.793 --> 11:52.711
may I please borrow 10,000 won?

11:54.088 --> 11:56.048
[scoffs]
You little…

11:56.841 --> 11:59.635
-[lender 1] Forget it.

12:03.305 --> 12:04.432
[Gi-hun] Excuse me.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.309
Sorry to do this.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.104
Uh…

12:10.187 --> 12:11.647
Can I get back that 10,000?

12:13.190 --> 12:14.358
[Gi-hun sighs]

12:14.442 --> 12:15.776
THE FUN DOESN'T END, CRANE GAME

[claw machine beeping]

12:19.113 --> 12:20.072

12:25.161 --> 12:26.120
[Gi-hun] Come on.

12:35.796 --> 12:36.714
[Gi-hun yells]

12:39.175 --> 12:41.802
Yeah. Come on. That's it, that's it.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.637
That's right. Ah!

[yells]

12:47.975 --> 12:49.185
Goddamn it!

12:50.227 --> 12:51.687
[boy] Excuse me, sir.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.690
You need to stop and pick the prize
you want first.

12:55.399 --> 12:56.775
Does that help you?

12:59.945 --> 13:02.948
[guitar strums]

13:03.032 --> 13:04.617
[claw machine beeping]

13:06.494 --> 13:08.787

13:08.871 --> 13:10.664
[Gi-hun] Ah. Ah…

13:11.624 --> 13:12.958
-That's it. Good.
-[whirring]

13:13.667 --> 13:14.960
Yes, that's it.

13:15.878 --> 13:16.837
-Oh!
-Yay!

13:16.921 --> 13:19.048

13:21.383 --> 13:23.427
[Gi-hun whooping]

13:23.511 --> 13:25.930
-Great job! Thank you. Thank you!
-[both laugh]

13:26.013 --> 13:28.516

-[boy] Yay!

13:28.599 --> 13:30.434
[distant car honking]

13:36.190 --> 13:37.316
Oh, this?

13:38.526 --> 13:41.445
It's a huge mosquito bite, that's all.

13:42.279 --> 13:45.282
Mosquitoes are really mean
these days. Yeah.

13:47.117 --> 13:51.288
Dad, you can be
in all of the fights that you want,

13:51.997 --> 13:53.457
but don't get hurt too bad.

13:57.461 --> 14:00.089
I'm sorry, sweetie. I really am.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.426
You know, I wanted to buy you
a nicer dinner than this.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.427
It's okay.

14:05.928 --> 14:09.473
We went with my stepdad
to a steakhouse earlier, so…

14:12.434 --> 14:13.811
A steak, huh?

14:16.313 --> 14:17.481
That's nice of him.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.653
Well, I still want tteokbokki
a lot more, though.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.113
[sighs]

14:26.031 --> 14:27.783
[whispers]
I'm not allowed to have it at home.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.368
Mom says it's junk food.

14:29.451 --> 14:30.536
[Gi-hun chuckles]

14:30.619 --> 14:32.705
-[both laugh]
-Eat up then.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.207
Oh, my gosh.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.542
Surprise.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.795
-Ga-yeong, I got your present right here.
-[muffled gasp]

14:39.879 --> 14:40.754
[Gi-hun chuckles]

14:44.258 --> 14:45.259
[Gi-hun] Ah…

14:49.763 --> 14:50.764
Uh…

14:53.267 --> 14:56.103
You know why, huh?
These days, even women go to war.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.229
Uh-huh.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.772
I mean, when you finally get older,

14:58.856 --> 15:01.817
there's not gonna be that kind
of discrimination like we got now.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.194
And you'll need to get used to this
pretty soon, you know.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.780
[clacking]

15:08.407 --> 15:09.783
Ah.
[chuckles]

15:10.910 --> 15:13.829
Oh, plus, it's a lighter.
[laughs]

15:14.538 --> 15:16.999
Looks like the real deal, doesn't it?
[chuckles]

15:17.082 --> 15:18.167
[laughs awkwardly]

15:18.250 --> 15:21.378
I think you'll get in trouble
with Mom again

15:21.962 --> 15:23.839
if she saw me holding this.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.215
Is that right?

15:26.008 --> 15:29.053
I'll keep it then, just till you get
a little bit older. Okay?

15:29.136 --> 15:30.846
Hey, don't smoke of it, though.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.264
Oh, come on, I'm clean now.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.892
[sniffing]

15:37.978 --> 15:39.021
[chuckles]

15:39.563 --> 15:40.898
All right. All right.

15:40.981 --> 15:44.026
I'll make sure I'll stop smoking for real.

15:44.109 --> 15:47.696
And you'll see next year, huh,
I'll get an awesome present for you, okay?

15:48.697 --> 15:49.865
Ga-yeong, I swear.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.201
Next year?

15:52.284 --> 15:53.827
Last year, you had a birthday.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.454
This one came right around, right?

15:55.537 --> 15:56.914
And the next one will be quick.

15:58.248 --> 15:59.458
Um, Dad?

15:59.541 --> 16:01.794
Hmm? Shoot.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.882
Nothing.
[nervous chuckle]

16:10.177 --> 16:12.262
Okay. Come on, come on.
Have more tteokbokki.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.599
Excuse me, sir, one more order, okay?

16:15.683 --> 16:17.518
And mix it with some of that in.

16:19.812 --> 16:20.938
[sighs]

16:33.075 --> 16:35.077
[Ga-yeong's mom]
Why did you bring her back so late?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.495
She's not dressed for the cold.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.081
Oh, she got sleepy, I carried her.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.917
We're ten minutes late at most. Okay?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.752
I said I'd drive down
to get her, didn't I?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.046
It's her birthday. Let's not yell.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.090
[Ga-yeong] Mom.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.300
-Oh.
-Hey, Ga-yeong, hey, get down.

16:50.384 --> 16:53.095
I'll carry her to the elevator
if you don't mind, okay?

16:53.178 --> 16:54.471
She can walk on her own.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.556
[Ga-yeong] Mom…

16:55.639 --> 16:58.183
-Ga-yeong, get down.
-Ah, jeez. Seriously.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.644
[Ga-yeong's mom] All right. Let's go.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.111
[Ga-yeong] Bye, Dad.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.738
[Gi-hun] Go on in. Good night.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.077

[train alarm beeping]

17:21.915 --> 17:23.834
[Gi-hun] Ah, wait a minute!
Hey, open the door!

17:23.917 --> 17:25.294
Ah, shit!

[exhales]

17:55.199 --> 17:56.200
Hello, sir.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.327
Can I talk to you?

18:01.497 --> 18:03.123
I don't believe in Jesus.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.416
[sighs]

18:04.500 --> 18:05.584
It's not that.

18:06.585 --> 18:09.171
Listen, I wanna let you in
on a great opportunity to…

18:12.841 --> 18:13.884
[clicks]

18:14.551 --> 18:15.677
[man sighs]

18:16.178 --> 18:19.848
I come from a very long line of Buddhists,
so find another guy to preach to,

18:22.559 --> 18:23.519
Mister.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.688
-Would you like to play a game with me?
-[sighs]

18:29.108 --> 18:30.234
Who are you?

18:31.735 --> 18:32.861
Salesman, huh?

18:34.029 --> 18:36.115
You people have all kinds of tactics.

18:37.491 --> 18:41.036
And I know you're only doing your job,
but I really don't have time to sit here…

18:43.789 --> 18:45.749
[guitar strums]

18:45.833 --> 18:48.585
I'm sure you've
played ddakji before, right?

18:50.712 --> 18:52.089
Play a few round of ddakji with me.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.925
And each time you win,
I'll pay you a 100,000 won.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.220
[Gi-hun scoffs]

19:02.391 --> 19:04.935
Wait, so if I hit your ddakji,
and it flips over,

19:06.103 --> 19:07.646
I get a 100,000 won?

19:07.729 --> 19:11.316
And if I can flip yours, you will give me
the exact same amount of money.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.532
You can also be the first to play.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.415
Hey, look, I had a bad day today.

19:27.583 --> 19:31.420
You pull a scam or you rip me off,
well, then, I'll… I'll kill you, huh?

19:33.255 --> 19:34.840
So then it's my turn, eh?

19:37.467 --> 19:39.344
So which color do you wanna play as?

19:45.350 --> 19:46.560

[frustrated grunt]
Shh…

20:11.877 --> 20:13.337
Well, what's wrong?

20:13.921 --> 20:15.547
So the thing is…

20:17.341 --> 20:19.134
How about you use your body to pay?

20:19.760 --> 20:21.094
A what?
[grunts]

20:22.971 --> 20:24.097
What the hell, man?

20:24.181 --> 20:26.350
I'll take a 100 grand off per slap.

20:29.436 --> 20:30.520

[Gi-hun laughing]
Did you see that? I did it. I won.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.019
Get over here. It's my turn to do this.

21:52.102 --> 21:53.020
[Gi-hun grunts]

21:53.603 --> 21:55.063
What are you doing, jerk?

You're welcome, sir.

The money.

[train chugging]

22:21.131 --> 22:22.215
[man] You know, sir.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.968
There are other games like this
where you can make even more.

-Come on, it must sound tempting.
-[scoffs]

22:29.389 --> 22:30.307
Hey, dude.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.684
Is this some new pyramid scheme or what?

22:34.352 --> 22:35.854
Look, I'm desperate, okay?

22:35.937 --> 22:38.023
Still, not that desperate yet.

Earlier, you signed away
your physical rights.

This thug is trying to hit me, huh!

36:16.340 --> 36:18.342
Hey, somebody get over here! We need help!

36:18.426 --> 36:20.094

36:37.820 --> 36:39.530

36:49.081 --> 36:52.627
[masked manager] I would like to extend
a heartfelt welcome to you all.

36:53.211 --> 36:57.590
Everyone here will participate
in six different games over six days.

36:57.673 --> 37:02.553
Those who win all six games
will receive a handsome cash prize.

37:03.346 --> 37:05.014
[man 3] And why should we believe that?

37:05.598 --> 37:08.142
Y-You took all our stuff
and put us to sleep coming here,

37:08.226 --> 37:10.144
and then you brought us
to this strange warehouse.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.481
Now you're saying you'll pay us
if we go and play a few games?

37:13.564 --> 37:15.399
You really expect us to buy that?

37:15.483 --> 37:17.693
[masked manager]
We reluctantly took all of those measures

37:17.777 --> 37:20.863
to maintain confidentiality
as we brought you here.

37:21.489 --> 37:24.242
We'll return everything
once the games are over.

37:25.117 --> 37:28.329
You all… you all have masks.
Why are you wearing those things?

37:28.412 --> 37:30.373
[masked manager]
We do not disclose the faces

37:30.456 --> 37:33.501
and personal information of our staff
to any of the participants.

37:33.584 --> 37:37.713
It's a measure we take
to ensure fair games and confidentiality.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.090
Please understand.

37:39.173 --> 37:41.092
Well, I don't believe you one bit.
You got that?

37:41.175 --> 37:43.928
You tricked us. We were kidnapped.

37:44.553 --> 37:46.305
You can make as many excuses as you want

37:46.389 --> 37:48.683
to make sure nobody knows
you broke the law in here.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.603
If you're going to make up for that,
then we're gonna need something more.

37:58.234 --> 38:00.903
Former team leader
of Team Two at Joy Investments.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.738
Siphoned money off
from his clients' balances,

38:02.822 --> 38:06.325
then invested it in derivatives
and futures options and failed.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.828

Every person standing here in this room
is living on the brink of financial ruin.

38:27.388 --> 38:30.016
You all have debts that you can't pay off.

38:30.725 --> 38:35.021
When we first went to see each of you,
not a single one of you trusted us.

38:35.104 --> 38:38.107
But as you all know, we played a game,

38:38.190 --> 38:40.818
and as we promised,
gave you money when you won.

38:40.901 --> 38:43.279
And suddenly, everyone here trusted us.

38:43.362 --> 38:48.200
You called and volunteered to participate
in this game of your own free will.

38:48.284 --> 38:49.118
So this is it.

38:49.201 --> 38:52.079
I'll give you one last chance to choose.

38:54.498 --> 38:57.752
Will you go back to living your old
and depressing lives

38:57.835 --> 38:59.712
getting chased by your creditors?

38:59.795 --> 39:04.175
Or will you act and seize
this last opportunity we're offering here?

39:06.302 --> 39:08.304
[all murmuring]

39:08.387 --> 39:10.973
Hey! Which games are we playing here?

39:11.057 --> 39:12.558
[masked manager] In order to play fair,

39:12.641 --> 39:15.561
we cannot disclose any information
about the games ahead of time.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.229
[Gi-hun] One question.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.483
If we win, just how much do we get?

accumulated in there after every game.

39:36.499 --> 39:40.753
We will disclose the amount to everyone
after the first game is over.

39:41.504 --> 39:46.175
If you do not wish to participate,
then please let us know at this time.
