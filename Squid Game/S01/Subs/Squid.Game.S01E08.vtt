[eerie music]

02:07.961 --> 02:09.212
Why'd you do that?

02:11.381 --> 02:13.049
What the hell did you expect, huh?

02:13.133 --> 02:14.843
Why go up and push that guy?

02:15.426 --> 02:16.594
[scoffs]

02:16.678 --> 02:18.763
You got lucky waiting
in the back of the line.

02:19.347 --> 02:21.224
Must have forgotten how things are here.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.854
What if that guy ended up wasting our time
on that one step like that criminal?

02:26.729 --> 02:27.981
Would you have done nothing?

02:28.064 --> 02:29.482
But he was on the last tile.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.610
He would move to the next one soon.

02:32.694 --> 02:33.820
How can you know that, huh?

02:34.988 --> 02:37.949
That last guy could tell
the tempered glass apart the whole time,

02:38.032 --> 02:40.493
but he watched all
those poor bastards out there die.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.747
The only reason you and I even made it
is 'cause he could tell the tiles apart.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.250
Come on! Just stop it with this bullshit.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.460
That guy is not the reason
that I'm still here, okay?

02:50.128 --> 02:51.421
I'll tell you the reason.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.799
It's that I'm willing to do
almost anything to win this.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.676
Stop with the excuses. I'm not buying it.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.429
You still killed someone.
His bullet is in your hands.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.638
Get it together, huh.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.893
We'll be killing everyone
if we want that money.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.228
Think about it for just one second.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.816
You should be happy that there's someone
who's not afraid to get his hands dirty.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.820
And if it were me on that tile?

03:17.322 --> 03:18.698
[groans]
Come on!

03:19.574 --> 03:20.575
Gi-hun!

03:23.578 --> 03:25.788
Your life is so damn pathetic,
and here's why.

03:27.123 --> 03:30.501
It's because you always gotta open
your mouth and ask something idiotic.

03:31.252 --> 03:34.339
Because you're a nosy-ass idiot
who's too slow to keep it shut.

03:35.256 --> 03:38.801
Someone who always has to get into trouble
but somehow can't tell he's in it.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.388
Okay.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.267
That's right.
That's how I got caught in all this.

03:48.144 --> 03:51.397
Because I was slow, crazy incompetent.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.151
Just a dimwit who lives off his mother,
but you're with me in this place.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.402
Isn't that interesting?

congratulate and commend you all

04:29.894 --> 04:32.730
for successfully making it
through the first five games.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.527
The three of you are now the finalists

04:37.610 --> 04:41.364
and as such, we have prepared
a special gift for each of you.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.158
Before we reveal the gift,

04:44.242 --> 04:47.745
please take a moment to change
into the outfits we have brought.

-Can you hear me all right, sir?

-I haven't seen or heard from you in days!
-Just hold on, I'll explain it later.

-Look, I'm somewhere southwest

-What?

07:04.298 --> 07:05.591
Can you try to locate my signal?

07:05.675 --> 07:07.176
-Put a whole team together for this.
-What?

07:07.260 --> 07:08.886
-A whole team?
-[Jun-ho] I need backup.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.514
You gotta get a whole squad.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.224
[Chief] What did you say?
I can't hear you!

07:13.307 --> 07:15.560
Let me send over a couple of things, okay,
and take a look.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.228

-I'll call you again soon.

for the sacrifice and effort
that you finalists have made,

you got that?

Have the Korean police
ever been quick to act?

And besides, you barely get
any signal around here.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.026
I don't know what you tried to send,

11:34.652 --> 11:36.320
but I doubt it went through.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.740
Come and turn yourself in.
You'll get a plea bargain with that.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.910
If you drop your gun right now
and hand over the phone,

11:43.536 --> 11:45.162
I might let you live.

11:45.663 --> 11:46.956
[Jun-ho] Stop right there.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.041
[Jun-ho panting]

11:49.125 --> 11:51.585
That gun of yours holds five bullets.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.964
But for police regulations,

11:55.047 --> 11:59.176
one chamber must remain empty,
and one must be filled with a blank.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.138
That leaves three live rounds.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.765
You've already used one to kill a man

12:05.558 --> 12:07.560
and another one to break the lock.

12:09.728 --> 12:13.899
Which means that there's only
one bullet left in your gun.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.651
One bullet is more than enough
to kill you.

It's all right.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.160
I didn't come here to kill you.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.079
You've been dozing off.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.998
I'd have killed you already
if I wanted to.

No, it's okay. I feel fine.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.254
So how come you barely touched
your food earlier?

18:11.465 --> 18:13.550
It wasn't very well cooked, that's all.

Stop lying, please.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.768

18:24.895 --> 18:26.396
Are you gonna try to treat it?

18:28.482 --> 18:29.983
[Sae-byeok gulps]

18:30.484 --> 18:32.194
You need to think about yourself.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.405
Just leave me. I'll be okay.

Hey, Kang Sae-byeok.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.580
We should stick together.

18:44.790 --> 18:45.874
We can beat him.

18:46.834 --> 18:47.918
Whatever the game,

18:48.877 --> 18:51.171
we'll help each other get through this
as teammates.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.555
Show that psychopath what we can do.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.107
Share all that prize money
and just run away.

19:20.492 --> 19:23.662
And do you know what you're gonna do
with all that money once we get out?

19:24.371 --> 19:26.039
I'd pay my debt off first.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.796
And buy a nice clean store
in the city for my mom.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.091
[deep inhale]

19:36.175 --> 19:40.220
She always hoped to run a, a real store,
not just the kind of little stall.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.764
And I would…

19:47.019 --> 19:49.229
finally start being a dad to my girl…

19:53.525 --> 19:55.277
for once in my life.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.321
How old is your daughter?

19:58.071 --> 19:59.198
She's ten.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.619
That's also how old my little brother is.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.499
And where is your brother staying now?

20:10.167 --> 20:11.585
In orphanage.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.342
I promised that
he'd get out of there soon.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.304
Our mother is stuck in the North
right now.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.852
I said I'd get her once I was able
to make enough money,

20:28.936 --> 20:30.479
and I'll get us all a house.

20:32.147 --> 20:35.234
There's so much in there. I think
even with half, you'll have plenty.

20:39.780 --> 20:40.864
Hey, Gi-hun.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.829
I think you and I should make a deal.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.087
[Gi-hun] What kind of deal?

20:59.383 --> 21:01.176
Just in case either of us…

21:03.011 --> 21:05.597
can actually make it out
of this hellhole somehow,

21:07.140 --> 21:09.559
we'll look after
each other's loved ones, okay?

21:13.730 --> 21:15.148
Don't say that. Come on.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.571
We'll beat Sang-woo,
and then, we'll get out of here together.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.240
[Sae-byeok inhales deeply]

21:27.202 --> 21:28.745
I still want you to swear, though.

21:32.874 --> 21:34.376
[quiet sob]

21:35.669 --> 21:37.713
I need you to swear
that you'll look after him.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.341
Shh.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.568
