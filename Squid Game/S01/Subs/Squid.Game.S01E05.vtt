00:16.933 --> 00:18.685
Get yourselves together and listen!

00:19.352 --> 00:22.063
Let's try something.
Take three steps up when I signal.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.983
Up? What now? But that's the edge!

00:25.525 --> 00:27.026
Look, just trust me and they'll fall!

00:27.110 --> 00:28.570
There's no way I'll do that!

00:28.653 --> 00:29.988
We might as well try!

00:30.071 --> 00:31.823
[Mi-nyeo] No way! I can't do it!

00:31.906 --> 00:33.575
Move up or you'll die!

02:52.255 --> 02:53.339
[woman] Hey, dude.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.259
Who you think you're praying to, huh?

02:57.594 --> 02:58.511
To God?

02:59.095 --> 03:00.805
[mumbling prayers]

03:00.889 --> 03:03.349
You think you made it out of there
because of God, don't you?

03:04.475 --> 03:05.643
[sighs]

03:09.647 --> 03:13.109
The reason you're still breathing
and thanking that nice God of yours…

03:13.818 --> 03:15.320
is that old man there.

03:16.446 --> 03:20.783
And that guy over there who came up
with that awesome last-minute trick.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.243
[man continues praying]

03:22.327 --> 03:24.579
You know if there's anybody
that you should be thanking

03:25.371 --> 03:27.040
it's them, not God.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.628
You sad lost soul.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.088
What would you say about everybody
who was nailed to the cross

03:34.172 --> 03:35.465
for our salvation today?

03:36.090 --> 03:39.469
They sacrificed themselves for us.
We are here, thanks to their blood.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.931
I pray to the Lord
on behalf of all us sinners.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.641
I gave thanks for their sacrifice.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.851
God made a decision to help our team win.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.478
That's why we're all here.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.604
Bullshit.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.649
You killed those guys out there.

[mumbling prayers]

03:55.526 --> 03:56.402
Oh!

03:57.028 --> 03:59.489
If we say some prayers,
do we all get to go to heaven?

03:59.989 --> 04:02.367
I should really pray too
if that's how easy it is.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.619
Our God who art in Heaven,

04:04.702 --> 04:06.996
we worked as a team
to send people to your side.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.915
And we sent a bunch of them today.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.918
And please help us
with a whole lot more to be with you.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.003
-And I hope that from now on--
-[Sae-byeok] Be quiet!

[man muttering prayers]

04:19.050 --> 04:19.926

04:20.677 --> 04:21.761

04:46.452 --> 04:48.121
Why do you care about that?

04:48.663 --> 04:50.498
So I can use your name, duh!

04:50.581 --> 04:51.666
It doesn't matter.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.835
[chuckles]
So secretive.

04:55.461 --> 04:56.587
Listen, okay.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.715
Just leave me alone.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.343
Well, you're the one
who asked me to join you guys.

05:08.099 --> 05:11.311
[Player 278] Did you see that bald guy
wet his pants like a little baby?

[masked man 1] He's not breathing.
Go get that doctor.

07:03.047 --> 07:06.384
You know what? I really thought
we were going to die out there.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.804
And then, as soon as we're all
leaning back, I felt so powerful.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.389
Like, "Whoa! It works. Is this real?"

07:11.472 --> 07:13.349
Hey, old man, how do you know that?

07:13.432 --> 07:14.433
[chuckles]

07:14.517 --> 07:17.395
-As a kid, I would always--
-Oh, you copied that one thing.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.772
From that movie. What's it called?

07:19.856 --> 07:21.524
The guy who dodges bullets like this.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.525
-Right?
-Matrix.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.361
Hmm.

07:26.446 --> 07:30.032
Hey, when you got to Korea,
is all you did watch movies?

07:32.452 --> 07:33.703
And our man…

07:34.203 --> 07:37.206
"Everybody, three steps up when I signal."
[gasps]

07:37.290 --> 07:40.293
Oh. My God, I can't believe
how cool that was.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.628
How did you come up with it
under all that pressure?

07:42.712 --> 07:44.255
Earlier, you were the one who said no.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.508
Yeah?
[scoffs]

07:48.050 --> 07:49.260
Was that what you heard?

07:49.343 --> 07:50.553
[Ali] You cried and said,

07:50.636 --> 07:53.931
"But that's the edge.
There's no way I'll go."

07:54.015 --> 07:54.891
Like that.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.686
Hey, you. You got a visa? I bet you don't.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.605
You're an illegal alien.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.648
[sighs]
Hey, boys, how about it?

08:02.732 --> 08:05.109
Why keep the strange foreigner
when we could just ditch him?

08:05.193 --> 08:07.487
Our team's more secure that way, huh?

08:07.570 --> 08:10.740
Guess I'd better do some major
restructuring while I'm here.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.492
Who's captain here, guys?

08:14.243 --> 08:17.079
Mr. Brains, you've been captain, right?

08:17.622 --> 08:20.708
There's no captain. We're all equal here.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.877
Ah! That's great.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.713
Building an egalitarian society!

08:26.631 --> 08:28.174
Damn, guys.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.551
I gotta say this is quite a change
from that huge asshole

08:30.635 --> 08:33.179
who just bosses you around
and pretend he's king.

08:33.262 --> 08:35.389
Oh, about that, grandma,
why did you get kicked out?

08:37.433 --> 08:38.935
Grandma?

08:39.018 --> 08:41.270
Don't you ever call me that!

08:42.688 --> 08:45.024
Here, Han Mi-nyeo.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.318
Got it? Mi-nyeo. That's my name.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.738
And I didn't get kicked out.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.740
I made the decision to go, all right?

08:52.823 --> 08:56.327
Those crazy thugs there?
You can't lock me in with that crew.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.828
[Sang-woo] They only got rid of you,

08:57.912 --> 08:59.997
then they only wound up with male players.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.707
Right before the game at that.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.794
You know, it's almost like
they knew about it ahead of time.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.714
[Deok-su laughs]

09:08.798 --> 09:11.509
[PA system chiming]

[woman on PA] Players,
your bedtime will begin in 30 minutes.

09:14.262 --> 09:17.139
Please return to your assigned beds
and prepare for lights-out.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.892
[Sang-woo] Another fight
could break out like last night.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.102
We should make a plan.

09:21.185 --> 09:22.895
What can we do, huh?

09:22.979 --> 09:24.855
We've got three girls and old man and us.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.607
Our team is the weakest one in here.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.443
We should choose a weak team
and go after them first.

09:29.527 --> 09:30.361
[scoffs]

09:31.237 --> 09:34.240
For a resident priest,
you sure are bloodthirsty.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.992
I mean, everybody's hands are bloody.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.829
We're all sinners,
but we're still here, aren't we?

09:41.914 --> 09:44.750
Attacking is our best option.
So I think that's our plan.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.627
During the fight last night,

09:47.878 --> 09:50.256
the man in the bed
in front of me got killed.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.176
And the person he thought
was on his side broke his neck.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.263
Do you trust me then?

09:59.682 --> 10:01.183
I don't trust one person here.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.480
All right.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.983
I think let's still do something.

10:09.650 --> 10:10.776
Before the lights go out,

10:10.860 --> 10:12.361
let's create a barricade.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.406
It might be good to make sure
that we have cover.

10:15.489 --> 10:16.699
[Ali] Mm-hm.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.661

10:49.190 --> 10:51.567
Hey, I appreciate the work you're doing.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.070
Nice.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.238
But do you think these will do anything?

10:57.073 --> 10:59.533
[scoffs]
We can get through all of this easily.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.035
[chuckles]

11:01.118 --> 11:02.370
You're not worried at all?

11:03.788 --> 11:06.374
Those scumbags you got
on your side over there?

11:07.083 --> 11:08.084
They're people you trust?

11:18.052 --> 11:19.178
If that was me there…

11:22.306 --> 11:24.100
once the fighting starts to happen,

11:25.184 --> 11:27.186
you'll be the first person I'd go for.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.358
You're the strongest person here.

11:43.702 --> 11:44.954
[both laughing]

11:50.418 --> 11:51.335
Boss.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.879
So who's our first target, huh?

11:53.963 --> 11:55.297
Let's take the night off.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.049
How come?

11:57.925 --> 12:00.594
-I mean shouldn't we try to cut down the--
-Do what I tell you to do.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.304
Oh.

12:02.847 --> 12:03.681
Sure.

12:05.182 --> 12:06.350
Hey.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.687
Cut that out. We all need to rest tonight.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.233
-[Deok-su sighs]
-[metal clanking]

12:15.943 --> 12:17.111
Where'd the doc go?

12:17.695 --> 12:21.532
He just left. He went to the restroom
while you're gone.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.741
[Gi-hun] They'll shut off the lights soon.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.618
They might not all come right away.

13:05.701 --> 13:08.787
So we better swap out who's gonna
keep watch, just to be safe, I think.

13:08.871 --> 13:09.955
No, two of us should watch.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.250
A pair can keep each other awake.

13:13.792 --> 13:16.337
Just one person might go leave
and betray our team.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.379
[Sang-woo sighs]

13:19.256 --> 13:20.257
I can…

13:21.091 --> 13:22.426
be first watch then.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.596
You don't really sleep a lot
when you're old.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.806
Excuse me, but are we just
supposed to trust

13:27.890 --> 13:30.601
an old man like you
to not sleep on the job all night?

13:32.603 --> 13:35.356
[inhales]
Let me go first.

13:38.817 --> 13:40.277
I'm not tired yet.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.279
I'll go with you.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.782
Then I'll be next.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.326
You wake me up the second you get tired.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.913
Then why don't I join you on second watch?

13:51.413 --> 13:53.332
Assuming that's okay with you.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.626
Yeah, that sounds good.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.299
[ticking]

14:02.383 --> 14:03.384

14:10.808 --> 14:13.310
[woman on PA]
The work schedule is done for today.

14:13.394 --> 14:16.730
All active staff,
please return to your rooms immediately.

14:18.399 --> 14:22.820
I repeat. Active staff,
please return to your rooms immediately.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.991
[mysterious music]

14:39.503 --> 14:41.714
[rustling]

14:43.591 --> 14:44.633
Have some of this.

14:45.676 --> 14:48.345
I saved this earlier
when they gave it to us for supper.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.431
So I could give it to you.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.308
Give it to me. What'd I do?

14:53.267 --> 14:55.519
Today, you saved my life.
It's that simple.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.314
[Ali] I wanted to thank you.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.690
I'm flattered but…

15:00.566 --> 15:01.817
I just didn't wanna die.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.944
You gave me that money for the bus too.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.740
I just wanted to return the favor.

15:15.873 --> 15:16.916
Your share.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.380
[Ali munching]

15:24.089 --> 15:25.424
It's Ali. Is that right?

15:26.300 --> 15:27.343
How old are you?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.888
Ali, yes. I'm 33, mister.

15:32.389 --> 15:33.891
Just call me Sang-woo, okay?

15:35.476 --> 15:36.602
You sure about that…

15:37.895 --> 15:38.896
Sang-woo?

15:40.314 --> 15:41.649
[chuckles]

15:43.817 --> 15:45.861
[Ali munching]

15:45.945 --> 15:47.029
How did you get here?

15:48.030 --> 15:49.990
I came to Korea to make money,

15:50.699 --> 15:51.992
Sang-woo.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.370
I don't mean that. In here.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.205
The game.

15:57.665 --> 15:58.874
I needed money.

15:59.583 --> 16:00.793
I came for that.

16:05.839 --> 16:06.924
Got family?

16:10.427 --> 16:14.640
Pakistan. Got my dad and mother
and siblings there.

16:16.308 --> 16:20.062
I still had to take the wife and baby
with me here.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.146
You're a father?

16:23.148 --> 16:24.191
How old is your kid?

16:24.692 --> 16:25.943
He's a year-old boy.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.614
You miss them a lot?

16:32.866 --> 16:33.867
Yes.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.499
What's your reason for being…

16:41.792 --> 16:42.793
in here?

16:47.297 --> 16:48.507
The same as you.

16:49.758 --> 16:50.676
For money.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.050
[Number 28] 29, what happened yesterday?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.217
Where were you?

17:33.927 --> 17:34.970
[Jun-ho] Sorry.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.306
[Number 28] "Sorry"?

17:39.433 --> 17:42.436
I stopped the other guys from killing you
because they didn't trust you.

17:43.812 --> 17:47.691
Since you saved my life
during the last dive, we're even now.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.196
If you do that again, you're out.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.366

18:23.310 --> 18:26.355
[masked man 1 scoffs]
Number 29. So you're finally here.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.607
[Number 28] I gave him a warning.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.818
[masked man 2]
We couldn't make the delivery last night.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.778
We can't let it slide with only a warning!

18:32.861 --> 18:34.947
[Number 28]
Then you can deliver this yourself.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.243
You think it's easy
to find divers like us in this place?

18:39.326 --> 18:42.121
[masked man 2] Make sure tonight's
delivery goes off without a hitch.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.294
[metal door closes]

18:50.295 --> 18:52.965
[Number 28] What?
You aren't even done with one?

18:53.048 --> 18:56.051
[masked man 1] The doctor is slow today.
More so than usual.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.178
[Number 28] Hey, quack. Hurry it up.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.722
This is all pointless
if the boat leaves before we deliver.

19:01.306 --> 19:04.977
You come over here and try doing this,
especially when you're sleep deprived.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.689
I'm just barely escaping death
every damn day.

19:08.772 --> 19:11.775
[dark music]

19:21.243 --> 19:24.663
[Number 28] That's why we tell you
what the games are beforehand

19:24.746 --> 19:26.623
and gave that extra food.

19:27.875 --> 19:28.750
[exhales sharply]

19:48.061 --> 19:49.146
Huh? Sang-woo.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.523
-You ready to switch?
-Ah…

19:53.025 --> 19:54.026
Okay.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.945
[Gi-hun grunts, panting]

19:58.614 --> 20:00.532
-Are you okay?
-Huh?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.410
Looked like you were having
a nightmare just now.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.288
Oh, no, no. It's all good.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.333
[Deok-su] Hey.

20:10.709 --> 20:11.960
What are you doing up?

20:15.172 --> 20:16.924
I can't keep my eyes shut.
[sighs]

20:18.050 --> 20:20.010
Well, you should really try
to get some rest.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.137
I'll keep everybody safe tonight.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.683
-Glad you got our backs tonight, kid.
-[man chuckles]

20:29.728 --> 20:31.104
Heard from the doctor yet?

20:31.188 --> 20:34.524
[man] No. This is weird.
He's taking too long.

20:39.738 --> 20:40.822
[doctor] Hold this.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.621
[masked man 1] We're in a hurry.
Maybe I should try working on those?

20:47.704 --> 20:51.083
I bet I could do it
if you teach me a few tricks.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.627
Yeah. You think all of this
is so simple, huh.

20:54.211 --> 20:57.005
[masked man 2] I saw on the news
doctors don't always perform surgeries.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.424
Sometimes it's the office managers
or nurse's aides.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.384
[cackles]

21:00.467 --> 21:02.678
And some of them are better
than the doctors are.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.888
You think you know so much?
Then how about you try?

21:05.931 --> 21:08.725
[masked man 2] Who would have thought
a quack who killed his own patient

21:08.809 --> 21:10.811
would still be so proud about his work?

21:11.311 --> 21:14.606
If you were so good, how come you ruined
the eyes you pulled out last time?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.775
Those Chinese guys busted my ass!

21:16.858 --> 21:18.402
Listen, I'll tell you what went wrong.

21:18.485 --> 21:19.945
That thing was still alive
when I got here.

21:20.028 --> 21:22.698
How'd you expect me to operate
with all of that struggling?

21:22.781 --> 21:24.533
[Number 28] We don't have time for this.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.326
The boat will be here soon.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.911

-[faint screaming stops]

22:32.642 --> 22:34.144
[Player 1 breathing heavily]

22:34.227 --> 22:37.230
So, uh, what's going on? Are you okay?

22:38.065 --> 22:41.777
I thought you were sleeping
with your eyes open.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.987
[sighs]
Um…

22:45.030 --> 22:46.740
Thinking of the old days.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.283
The old days, huh?

22:49.618 --> 22:53.163
I worked at this place once
where we went on strike.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.334
Had a barricade just like this one.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.504
What did you do
when you were working there?

23:00.587 --> 23:02.672
I used to make parts for cars.

23:02.756 --> 23:05.133
Hmm. Ah.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.094
Why did you strike?

23:07.803 --> 23:10.347
They fired a bunch of us all at once.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.307
[inhales deeply, sighs]

23:12.390 --> 23:14.476
I've been employed there
more than a decade.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.314
I bet it wasn't easy.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.736
-[Player 1 sighs]
-[Gi-hun exhales deeply]

23:24.820 --> 23:26.488
I had a kid on the way too.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.699
I couldn't afford to get fired like that.

23:29.783 --> 23:30.826
[deep inhale]

23:31.785 --> 23:34.788
Our bosses said we couldn't stay.
I had no other option.

23:36.498 --> 23:39.501
[Gi-hun] They ruined the company
and held us responsible.

23:40.335 --> 23:42.504
[sighs]
It made me furious.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.508
And everyone same as now…
[inhales]

23:47.592 --> 23:49.845
…all kept watching in pairs until morning.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.930
That way, no one could kick us all out.

23:52.722 --> 23:53.974
[Player 1 sighs]

23:54.808 --> 23:56.852
And we were all so scared.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.021
Police might come any second.

24:00.105 --> 24:03.108
I remember. I heard about it back then.

24:04.484 --> 24:08.155
There was a huge strike.
Some car company. That's right.

24:09.489 --> 24:13.827
I think the news turned it
into this crazy story.

24:14.619 --> 24:17.956
[Player 1] That was it.
Someone died there too, right?

24:18.874 --> 24:20.625
Mmm.
[Player 1 sighs]

24:21.585 --> 24:22.586
I'm sorry.

24:23.503 --> 24:24.838
My goodness.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.631
I don't know…

24:27.799 --> 24:29.092
why I said all of that.

24:29.676 --> 24:30.760
[Player 1] Mmm.

24:30.844 --> 24:33.388
[somber music]

24:33.471 --> 24:35.473

Oh.

Do you need help, sir?

24:44.983 --> 24:47.194
-[Player 1 moans]
-What's going on?

24:47.277 --> 24:49.779
-[grunts]
-Oh.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.116
-You're burning up.
-No, no, it's fine. I'm fine.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.577
[masked man 1]
I nearly pissed myself that night.

24:55.660 --> 24:58.997
I thought the thing was dead,
but then it shot up like a zombie.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.750
It started glaring at me
with one of its eyes popping out.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.711
[sighs]
I saw it in my dream last night.

25:04.794 --> 25:06.588
[masked man 2] Everyone who got eliminated

25:06.671 --> 25:09.216
in Red Light, Green Light
was shot by a sniper rifle.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.967
We could hardly salvage anything.

25:11.801 --> 25:15.180
That zombie looked promising.
At least before we saw inside.

25:15.972 --> 25:18.391
[Number 28] I almost died
making the delivery that day.

25:18.475 --> 25:21.645
But we didn't even get full price
because it only had one kidney.

25:21.728 --> 25:24.064
It's my fault the zombie
was missing a kidney?

25:24.648 --> 25:26.483
[Number 28] Hopefully,
this guy is all right.

25:27.359 --> 25:31.196
Most people who came here either signed
away their bodies or are terminally ill.

25:31.279 --> 25:33.073
This one better be worth it.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.454
-[Gi-hun] Here. Lie down.
-[groaning]

25:40.247 --> 25:41.456
[Gi-hun] Wait right here.

25:41.539 --> 25:44.751
Okay. We need to lower your fever.
Hold on.

25:45.418 --> 25:46.503
-[grunts]
-[cloth tearing]

25:49.172 --> 25:50.298
Ah, shit.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.716
[Sae-byeok] Here. Use this.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.263
[panting]

26:00.684 --> 26:01.685
[Jun-ho] So what happened…

26:04.271 --> 26:05.355
to that zombie?

26:06.564 --> 26:08.441
[Number 28]
What do you think happened to it?

26:08.942 --> 26:12.445
We were in a hurry,
so I beat it to death with that.

26:16.324 --> 26:18.660
[masked man 1] Hold on.
Why do you need to ask?

26:18.743 --> 26:20.161
You were there for the whole thing.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.413
[masked man 2] What the hell?

26:22.163 --> 26:23.123
Don't you remember?

26:27.127 --> 26:28.128
[Jun-ho] Back then…

26:29.921 --> 26:31.381
I was a bit out of it.

26:31.464 --> 26:32.966
[masked man 2] You were out of it?

26:34.342 --> 26:37.220
You got rid of the body
with your own hands.

26:38.805 --> 26:40.098
Number 29.

26:40.890 --> 26:44.144
-You haven't been--
-[doctor] This is my operating room, okay?

26:45.687 --> 26:48.857
Stop chatting and do what I say,
so I can actually do some work!

26:50.275 --> 26:52.652
Just let me work in peace, okay?
[pants]

26:52.736 --> 26:53.862
If you don't shut up,

26:53.945 --> 26:56.614
I'll cut right through his liver
and kidneys just like this! Damn it!

26:57.115 --> 26:59.534
[doctor huffing]

27:03.330 --> 27:06.458
[Player 1 breathing heavily]

27:10.003 --> 27:11.254
Thank you, friend.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.673
[sighs]

27:14.674 --> 27:15.717
[clicks tongue]

27:16.343 --> 27:17.552
Just you rest now.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.597
After all, we can't…

27:21.389 --> 27:23.308
start the next game without you.

27:25.018 --> 27:26.561
[Gi-hun exhales]

27:31.107 --> 27:32.192
[Gi-hun sighs]

27:33.693 --> 27:35.070
You should go and rest.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.739
I can handle this alone.
[groans]

27:38.740 --> 27:40.283
We agreed to do pairs.

27:41.242 --> 27:42.994
And I'm already awake now.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.166
Thanks so much.

27:53.296 --> 27:54.255
For this.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.550
[Sae-byeok] It wasn't for free.

27:58.885 --> 28:00.553
You can pay me back tomorrow.

28:04.224 --> 28:05.433
[sighs]

28:08.019 --> 28:09.020
[Gi-hun scoffs]

28:09.104 --> 28:11.564
[chuckles]

28:14.651 --> 28:16.820
-[plastic rustles]
-[zips]

28:18.238 --> 28:19.239
[masked man 1] Hurry up.

28:19.322 --> 28:21.491
[masked man 2]
They're all in great condition this time.

28:21.574 --> 28:23.034
Make sure you get full price.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.871
[tense music]

28:32.877 --> 28:35.088
[Number 28] Pick up the pace.
The boat's already here.

28:39.092 --> 28:42.095
[tense music continues]

28:52.147 --> 28:53.314
[doctor] All right, I'm done.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.774
What game is up next?

28:54.858 --> 28:56.317
[masked man 1] We don't know yet.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.278
What'd you say?

28:59.237 --> 29:00.155
Bullshit.

29:00.238 --> 29:02.198
[masked man 1]
We haven't been told what it is yet.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.867
You better go and ask your boss.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.411
There must be somebody up there
you can go ask.

29:06.494 --> 29:08.580
[masked man 2] If he knew,
he would've told us already.

29:08.663 --> 29:11.499
-I'm sure there's a reason.
-It sounds like that's on you.

29:12.876 --> 29:14.502
I did everything you said to.

29:15.253 --> 29:16.796
Go tell them to find out this second!

29:16.880 --> 29:18.381
[masked man 2] Go back and wait!

29:18.465 --> 29:20.258
I'll tell you before the next game begins.

29:21.509 --> 29:23.261
This is a bunch of bullshit!

29:25.096 --> 29:28.099
[eerie music]

29:42.447 --> 29:43.782
[Number 28] What are you doing?

29:43.865 --> 29:44.741
Pull.

29:49.245 --> 29:53.249
[rumbling]

29:58.087 --> 30:00.089
[rustling]

30:03.510 --> 30:05.804
[rustling continues]

30:08.765 --> 30:11.059
-[chains screech]
-[thuds]

30:11.142 --> 30:14.145
[rumbling]

30:14.896 --> 30:15.814
[thuds]

30:23.571 --> 30:26.574
[tense music]

30:28.159 --> 30:30.245
-[masked man 1] Calm down.
-Tell me what the game is,

30:30.328 --> 30:32.413
or else I'm gonna end up
getting killed tonight!

30:32.497 --> 30:35.750
This isn't the way to handle things.
Give us more time.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.002
I'm not giving you
any more time, assholes!

30:38.086 --> 30:41.005
-[masked man 1] Then what do you suggest?
-Check what's next and come back.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.382
[masked man 2 grunts]

30:42.465 --> 30:43.633
[doctor] And you…

30:43.716 --> 30:46.094
you'll be staying right here
until he returns, okay?

30:46.177 --> 30:48.513
[masked man 1]
It'll be more dangerous if we stay here.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.473
We have to get back
before morning roll call!

30:50.557 --> 30:52.725
I don't care about any of that shit!

30:53.893 --> 30:56.688
No, I'm not going anywhere
until I know what it is.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.482
[masked man 2] Fine, okay. Calm down.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.944
Go up and find out what the game is.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.446
[masked man 1] Okay.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.907
[doctor breathing heavily]

31:11.035 --> 31:11.995
[masked man 2] Wait!

31:12.537 --> 31:14.122
You have to take the key.

31:14.664 --> 31:17.458
The key to upstairs
is in my right side pocket.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.253
Don't try to pull something.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.546
[masked man 2] I'm not.

31:21.629 --> 31:24.048
He needs it to get into the control room.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.843
If you don't trust me,
you can throw it to him yourself.

31:33.266 --> 31:35.018
[both grunting]

31:36.311 --> 31:38.521
-[doctor screams]
-[gunfire]

-[doctor panting]

31:53.328 --> 31:55.496
[both groaning]

32:07.050 --> 32:08.134
[Number 28] Don't touch it.

32:08.217 --> 32:13.848
It's a bomb. They made this passage
so the VIPs could escape in an emergency.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.475
And once they're all out,

32:15.558 --> 32:17.936
they set that off
and blow the entire place.

32:18.519 --> 32:21.022
[Jun-ho] The VIPs? Who are they?

32:21.981 --> 32:23.524
[Number 28] That's as much as I know.

32:32.283 --> 32:33.368
[door opens]

32:42.126 --> 32:43.336
[light switch clanks]

32:44.963 --> 32:46.172
[Number 28] Number 29.

32:47.632 --> 32:48.633
[knife rasps]

32:49.759 --> 32:51.552
[hurried footsteps]

32:52.720 --> 32:54.847
[panting]

32:57.225 --> 32:59.102
[masked man 1] Are you there?
The doctor escaped.

32:59.686 --> 33:00.520
[keyboard clacks]

33:05.900 --> 33:06.985
[masked supervisor] Damn it.

33:08.236 --> 33:09.278
[doctor] Shit.

33:10.571 --> 33:13.574
[suspenseful music]

33:18.788 --> 33:20.540
[panting]

33:21.457 --> 33:22.667
Shit!

33:26.796 --> 33:27.922
[grunts]

33:29.924 --> 33:31.801
[panting]

33:39.058 --> 33:42.061
[doctor breathing heavily]

33:42.145 --> 33:44.981
[Number 28] Why do you wanna know
who the VIPs are?

33:46.941 --> 33:48.192
[Jun-ho] I was just grateful

33:49.736 --> 33:51.821
for our diving equipment and this passage.

33:52.655 --> 33:54.365
They prepared it all for us.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.743
[Number 28] Not only are you more curious,

33:56.826 --> 33:58.661
but your voice seems to have changed.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.246
Let me see your face.

34:02.665 --> 34:04.042
[Jun-ho] Do you have to do this?

34:07.420 --> 34:08.713
[Number 28] Do you wanna die?

34:21.309 --> 34:22.852
-Who are you?
-[gun cocks]

34:32.403 --> 34:34.530
-[knife clanks]
-Now show me yours.

34:36.616 --> 34:37.825
Do you wanna die?

34:40.870 --> 34:42.914
[tense music]

34:54.217 --> 34:55.885
[doctor pants]

34:55.968 --> 34:57.929
-[door bangs]
-[doctor gasps]

34:58.012 --> 34:59.388
Stay away!

34:59.472 --> 35:00.932
[huffing]

35:01.015 --> 35:03.309
[masked man 1] Calm down.
We can still fix this.

35:03.392 --> 35:04.644
How will you do that?

35:06.187 --> 35:07.188
Using that gun?

35:07.271 --> 35:08.606
[masked man 1] Think about it.

35:08.689 --> 35:10.358
Why would I kill you anyway?

35:10.441 --> 35:12.276
That'll only complicate things.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.070
It's complicated already.

35:14.862 --> 35:16.239
I had to kill your friend.

35:16.322 --> 35:17.782
[masked man 1] He wasn't a friend.

35:17.865 --> 35:22.161
Look, listen.
I can throw bodies in the incinerator.

35:22.703 --> 35:24.539
The guy you killed, I'll just cremate him.

35:25.248 --> 35:27.708
It's a huge problem
when a player goes missing,

35:27.792 --> 35:30.586
but when it's soldier,
no one cares about that.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.296
[heavy breathing]

35:33.047 --> 35:34.257
[Jun-ho] Who I am

35:35.299 --> 35:37.468
doesn't matter right now, you got that?

35:42.640 --> 35:46.310
Now, what matters is the identity
of the man that you murdered here.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.647
The one you've been calling a zombie.

35:50.940 --> 35:53.526
With the one kidney, the one you put
on the table who woke up.

35:54.777 --> 35:56.696
You know where that other kidney went?

35:57.697 --> 35:58.739
In here.

35:59.782 --> 36:00.867
It's in here.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.371
-He was my brother.
-[trembling breath]

36:06.038 --> 36:07.874
-He gave me that kidney.
-No, no, wait!

36:08.541 --> 36:10.501
[shaky breathing]

36:10.585 --> 36:11.961
It was a girl.

36:12.044 --> 36:13.254
Not a man.

36:13.337 --> 36:14.630
I'm not lying.

36:14.714 --> 36:16.674
[masked man 1]
I'll find out what the next game is.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.468
If you make a bigger scene and get caught,

36:20.052 --> 36:21.637
we'll both die for nothing.

36:22.930 --> 36:23.764
Trust me.

36:24.515 --> 36:25.725
We still have a chance.

36:25.808 --> 36:28.186
How can I trust someone like you, scumbag?

36:28.811 --> 36:30.980
[doctor panting]

36:43.701 --> 36:44.702
[exhales]

36:45.703 --> 36:46.704
[masked man 1] Look.

36:47.246 --> 36:49.540
Now you see, we're all the same here.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.336
[doctor panting]

37:03.054 --> 37:03.888
All right.

37:04.513 --> 37:06.641
You just need to go back quietly.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.685
If you go back before your bedtime is up…

37:10.937 --> 37:12.730
you and I can live through this.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.652
[metal thuds]

37:17.735 --> 37:19.820
[doctor breathing heavily]

37:19.904 --> 37:21.572
[doctor] Then what do I have to do?

37:25.868 --> 37:27.370
Listen, doctor.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.378
Let's get you washed up
before anything else.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.506
-[gunshot]
-[man yelps]

37:40.800 --> 37:42.260
I'm not lying!

37:43.678 --> 37:44.762
It was a girl.

37:44.845 --> 37:46.514
It sounds like bullshit.

37:46.597 --> 37:49.183
Before we operated on her,

37:50.017 --> 37:52.561
we took turns having sex
with the girl, okay?

37:53.145 --> 37:54.981
Would we have done that to a guy?

37:56.065 --> 37:58.192
Go check the list,
if you still don't trust me.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.987
-What list?
-There's a list of all the players

38:01.070 --> 38:02.697
with all their info as well.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.074
-Even their medical records.
-Where?

38:06.284 --> 38:07.952
[whimpers]

38:09.036 --> 38:10.413
Over the ladderway in…

38:11.580 --> 38:12.707
the room the leader is in.

38:12.790 --> 38:13.791
Leader?

38:13.874 --> 38:15.209
[Number 28] You've seen him.

38:15.751 --> 38:17.378
His mask isn't the same.

38:19.338 --> 38:22.341
[ominous music]

38:24.427 --> 38:26.095
[chuckles]

38:26.178 --> 38:30.391
And so, you and I
will find your brother, okay?

38:31.100 --> 38:34.353
And I'll give you all the money I got
selling organs!

38:36.605 --> 38:38.441
-Once we're a team, we'll be, uh--
-[gunshot]

38:39.692 --> 38:41.027

[exhales]

38:50.995 --> 38:53.581
[man groaning]

38:54.165 --> 38:56.709
[Front Man] Whether you sell
the dead bodies' organs

38:56.792 --> 39:00.212
or eat them or whatever,
I don't give a damn.

39:00.796 --> 39:04.550
However, you ruined the most important
aspect of this place.

39:05.051 --> 39:06.427
[man breathing shakily]

39:09.430 --> 39:10.806
Equality.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.143
Everyone is equal
while they play this game.

39:14.810 --> 39:18.356
Here, every player gets to play
a fair game under the same conditions.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.693
These people suffered from inequality
and discrimination out in the world,

39:23.319 --> 39:26.906
and we're giving them one last chance
to fight fair and win.

39:27.907 --> 39:30.785
But you broke that principle.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.289
[grunts]
Sir, I'm sorry.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.415

41:34.909 --> 41:36.160
[masked man 3] That was 28.

41:36.243 --> 41:37.411
[Front Man] There's one more.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.580
The one who killed this one.

41:40.289 --> 41:42.333
[masked man 3]
He could've escaped to the sea already.

41:45.252 --> 41:47.338
[Front Man] No oxygen tanks are missing.

41:47.421 --> 41:49.006
He's still here somewhere.

41:49.548 --> 41:50.382
Find him.
