Nothing.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.929
You saved me.
[panting]

What?

00:56.389 --> 00:57.265
[panting]

01:25.293 --> 01:27.253
[Ali sighs]
I'm glad you made it.

01:27.754 --> 01:28.797
I was really worried.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.175
It will take a whole lot more
killing Gi-hun. Hah!

01:32.258 --> 01:34.594
I got Ssangmun-dong running
through this heart, huh?

01:34.677 --> 01:35.887
[Player 1 chuckles]

01:35.970 --> 01:37.972
Are you holding up all right here, mister?

All thanks to your sharp thinking.

-[Player 1 and Gi-hun chuckle]
-[Sang-woo] I'm sorry.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.856
I was wrong to suggest separating.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.610
Ah, don't say that.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.238
How could you know what it was?

01:53.321 --> 01:55.198
Choosing the umbrella was my call.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.951
-Don't worry, okay?
-Mm.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.203

Where's the rest?

04:36.484 --> 04:38.403
Hey, we didn't get our meals either.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.488
One, two, three, four, five.

04:40.571 --> 04:41.948
Five meals are missing, sir.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.534
[masked supervisor] We prepared food
for the exact number of players.

04:44.617 --> 04:45.868
Then where is ours?

04:45.952 --> 04:47.745
Please, sir, we need to eat!
[exclaims]

04:47.829 --> 04:50.790
-It was prepared for the exact number.
-[woman] Excuse me.

04:53.835 --> 04:54.669
It was them. They…

04:56.462 --> 04:59.090
skip the line and got seconds. I saw it.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.179
Hey, what's the matter, everybody? Jeez.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.473
You never see a guy eat before,
is that it?

Shit.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.565
That's my food you just ate.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.943
Ah. So, uh, is this yours?

05:19.777 --> 05:20.862
Is your name on it?

05:21.821 --> 05:23.323
'Cause I sure don't see anything.

-[Player 271 grunts]
-[players exclaim]

05:44.385 --> 05:47.597

-You piece of shit!
-[grunting]

05:49.098 --> 05:53.770
Hey, listen up. You should learn to share.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.147
Is it too hard, you dumbass?

05:56.731 --> 06:00.234
[Deok-su] You bastard!

06:41.651 --> 06:43.486
Uh, hello, guards.

[shaky breathing]

06:50.910 --> 06:52.286
Hey, didn't you hear that?

06:54.413 --> 06:55.665
A person died.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.959
That man there just died.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.047
Look, that man was killed.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.842
That bastard…
That bastard just killed him.

He just killed someone over there!

We can't fall asleep tonight, okay?

09:42.331 --> 09:44.125
Who knows what someone else may try.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.297
[Sang-woo] Look at them. It looks like
they're planning something.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.049
If they try to attack someone,

09:53.342 --> 09:55.094
let's group together and fight them.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.180
Come to our side if anything goes wrong.

10:11.235 --> 10:14.113
Sorry, but you really can't go to sleep
after lights-out, understand?

10:14.864 --> 10:15.740
Why?

10:15.823 --> 10:18.868
We gotta keep an eye out.
It will be dangerous.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.120
And we'll come here if anything goes down.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.331

really had it out for each other.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.019
So what?

10:45.102 --> 10:49.106
Tonight, if anything happens,
we'll all meet in my bed right there.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.443
Are you in?

10:56.906 --> 10:58.199
I don't trust people.

10:59.575 --> 11:02.203
And that's twice as true for anyone
who'd end up in here. Got it?

11:02.286 --> 11:04.038
You think that's how it works, huh?

11:06.707 --> 11:09.210
Listen, you don't trust people here
because you can.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.630
You do it because
you don't have anybody else.

-[masked man 1] Was there an accident?
-[Number 28] I don't know.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.037
[masked man 2]
Then you'll need to deliver this alone.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.332
[Number 28] I can't go underwater
by myself. It's too dangerous.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.834

12:02.304 --> 12:03.472
Are you sure?

12:04.682 --> 12:07.852
If I get eliminated,
then I can't do all of this.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.354
[masked man 1] Worry about that
after you survive the night.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.523
What's tonight?

12:12.606 --> 12:14.024
[masked man 1] Fighting will break out.

12:14.733 --> 12:18.195
We gave you less food on purpose

Weeding out the weaklings

12:21.574 --> 12:22.783
It's all part of the game.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.161
[masked man 2] You know we can't
protect you when you're in there.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.622
Go back to the players
and find a way to live.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.416
Way to live?

12:30.499 --> 12:32.042

I'm a doctor out there.

13:33.437 --> 13:34.563
You might need me.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.606
So?

You're gonna come give me a shot
if I get sick?

Don't breathe or make a noise.

31:08.783 --> 31:09.909
[Jun-ho] Number 29.

31:16.124 --> 31:19.127
[classical music playing on speakers]

31:26.551 --> 31:27.844
[Gi-hun exhales]

31:33.892 --> 31:34.934
Hey, old man.

31:36.311 --> 31:37.145
Huh?

31:37.228 --> 31:39.772
-Did you stay up all night?
-[Player 1 chuckles]

31:40.440 --> 31:43.359
I thought they would attack again
or something.

31:43.443 --> 31:46.070
Old man, but you must be
so exhausted already.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.865
[sighs]
It's all right.

31:49.616 --> 31:53.244
You don't really need that much sleep
when you're old.

31:54.537 --> 31:57.874
And I didn't help
when they went after everyone

31:58.708 --> 32:01.252
but keeping night watch,
well, I can do that.

32:02.962 --> 32:04.756
-[sighs]
-["The Blue Danube" plays on speakers]

32:05.340 --> 32:09.010
[woman on PA] Attention, players.
The third game will begin momentarily.

32:09.093 --> 32:10.970
Please follow the staff's instructions

32:11.054 --> 32:13.556
and swiftly make your way
towards the game hall.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.683
Let me repeat the instructions.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.852
The third game will begin momentarily.

32:17.936 --> 32:21.773
[mysterious music]

32:23.566 --> 32:27.528
[woman on PA] Beginning head count now.
Please wait in front of your door.

32:30.114 --> 32:31.366
[masked man coughs]

32:33.618 --> 32:35.203
Head count complete.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.708
[mysterious music continues]

32:43.962 --> 32:46.089
[breathing heavily]

32:50.343 --> 32:53.429
[woman on PA] Players,
welcome to the third game.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.891
For this game, you will play in teams.

32:57.600 --> 33:01.688
All players, please divide yourselves
into teams of ten people.

33:02.188 --> 33:06.275
Your time limit will be ten minutes.
Ten minutes.

33:07.193 --> 33:09.070
Let me repeat the instructions.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.240
For this game, you will play in teams.

33:12.907 --> 33:17.161
All players, please divide yourselves
into teams of ten people.

33:17.245 --> 33:21.082
Your time limit will be ten minutes.
Ten minutes.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.752
We need to get a bunch of men
who are well built.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.087
Oh, okay.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.631
What about the girl?

33:36.764 --> 33:39.308
[clock ticking]

33:39.892 --> 33:42.520
Something that has teams of ten players.

33:42.603 --> 33:45.106
So maybe it's Tail Tag
or Why Did You Come to My House?

33:45.189 --> 33:46.190
[sighs]

33:46.774 --> 33:48.609
Tail Tag means running is involved.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.821
Or it might just end up
being simply based on luck.

33:53.823 --> 33:54.699
What do you think?

33:54.782 --> 33:56.284
[deep inhale]

33:56.367 --> 33:58.661
Our team already has a girl
and an older guy.

33:59.662 --> 34:01.330
I'm thinking we better get more men first.

34:02.331 --> 34:05.877
What if they make us play Gonggi
or Elastics? Then, what do we do?

34:05.960 --> 34:07.545
Girls are usually the good ones at that--

34:07.628 --> 34:10.715
That's true, but when it really comes
down to it, usually men are better.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.593
It's our lives we're betting on right now.

34:14.927 --> 34:16.220
And we gotta win.

34:17.388 --> 34:18.389
[inhales]

34:19.307 --> 34:20.266
[exhales]

34:21.934 --> 34:23.561
Five more people are needed.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.439
I see that we each
bring one guy to join us.

34:26.522 --> 34:27.690
[Sang-woo] Okay?

34:32.195 --> 34:33.863
[Player 1 grunting]

34:38.201 --> 34:39.410
Don't let them see.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.580
You'll seem weaker.

34:44.707 --> 34:47.877
[players chattering]

34:58.179 --> 35:00.473
[man 1] Boss, excuse me.
Look, this guy wants to join us.

35:01.390 --> 35:03.101
Hey, go find more guys.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.478
[Gi-hun sighs]

35:06.229 --> 35:08.231
[indistinct chatter]

35:11.442 --> 35:13.402
[sighs]

35:24.664 --> 35:25.623
Sir?

35:26.124 --> 35:27.959
Got a team yet? Are you taken?

35:28.042 --> 35:29.293
Huh? Uh, no.

35:29.377 --> 35:32.421
Come join ours then, sir. We have a team.

35:33.047 --> 35:34.549
Well, the thing is, though,

35:34.632 --> 35:39.137
so I can't join unless she does, too.
[nervous chuckle]

35:39.637 --> 35:40.555
Would you let her?

35:41.889 --> 35:43.182
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:43.266 --> 35:45.309
Our team already has too many girls.

35:49.355 --> 35:52.942
Excuse me. Still picking who to join in?
You should come with us.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.326
Excuse me, sir.

36:03.452 --> 36:07.790
If you're not on a team yet,
perhaps you would like to join ours?

36:22.013 --> 36:23.347
[Deok-su] Let's team up next time.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.682
[Player 212] Babe, wait!

36:26.350 --> 36:28.895
I don't get it.
Come on, you're just joking.

36:28.978 --> 36:31.522
My team is full. I'm sorry.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.150
We've got ten already.

36:35.568 --> 36:39.822
[chuckles]
Old man. No, please, you can't do this.

36:40.573 --> 36:42.491
[sobs]
I'm sorry.

36:42.575 --> 36:43.701
I'll do anything.

36:44.327 --> 36:45.995
Babe, I swear I'll do better.

36:46.078 --> 36:48.414
Uh, I'm good at everything.
You know that's true.

36:48.497 --> 36:49.832
Just listen, okay?

36:51.125 --> 36:53.169
Let's split up just for this game,
all right?

36:53.252 --> 36:55.880
Then meet up with the next one, huh?

36:55.963 --> 36:57.882
[sobs]
But…

36:58.507 --> 37:00.343
do we really need to, though?

37:01.802 --> 37:03.721
You said we'd do this together.

37:04.513 --> 37:05.556
Babe.

37:06.432 --> 37:07.934
Can you really do this alone?

37:08.017 --> 37:11.604
I need you, old man. Can't you see that?

37:11.687 --> 37:13.314
-Get off!
-[whimpers]

37:13.814 --> 37:16.651
God, this bitch is so pathetic.
Get your hands off me.

37:16.734 --> 37:19.278
And stop calling me "babe"
and "old man," huh!

37:19.362 --> 37:22.240
Call me that one more fucking time,
and I'll cut your goddamn throat out!

37:22.323 --> 37:24.283
[shaky breathing]

37:33.459 --> 37:35.002
You asshole.

37:36.045 --> 37:38.005
Just stop it. You were using me.

37:40.633 --> 37:41.634
Jang Deok-su.

37:42.635 --> 37:44.136
Goddamn you, scumbag.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.304
[scoffs]

37:45.388 --> 37:48.432
You betrayed me,
you're dead now. Got that?

37:48.516 --> 37:49.684
Oh, I'm so scared…

37:50.184 --> 37:51.519
Ms. Han Mi-nyeo.

37:52.395 --> 37:54.897
Well then, best of luck to you, huh?

37:56.857 --> 38:00.987
-[men laugh]
-[man] She's not worth it anyways.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.034
What do you want?

38:07.618 --> 38:08.619
Play with us.

38:09.787 --> 38:12.248
[indistinct chatter]

38:14.125 --> 38:15.209
[Gi-hun] One.

38:16.877 --> 38:17.837
Two.

38:18.337 --> 38:19.171
Three.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.257
Four.

38:22.925 --> 38:23.926
Five.

38:24.427 --> 38:25.511
Six.

38:26.053 --> 38:27.054
Seven.

38:28.055 --> 38:29.098
Eight.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.476
Nine? Um…

38:33.185 --> 38:36.147
-Wait, did someone not bring anyone?
-[sighs deeply]

38:36.230 --> 38:37.398
It was me. I didn't.

38:40.943 --> 38:42.445
What about you? Who brought you here?

38:43.863 --> 38:44.780
Her.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.618
I said to bring only men back here,
didn't I?

38:51.245 --> 38:52.371
This doesn't sound good.

38:53.456 --> 38:54.749
You want me to go?

38:55.249 --> 38:56.500
I'll go now.

38:56.584 --> 38:57.793
No, wait. Hold on.

38:58.753 --> 39:00.713
It's okay. Stay where you are.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.842
We don't even know what we're doing yet.

39:05.801 --> 39:07.470
And the time's almost over.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.140
At this point, let's just find
one more team and be done.

39:11.223 --> 39:13.601
We put together a weak team,
who would want to join it?

39:14.560 --> 39:16.395
That means that once the timer's done,

39:16.479 --> 39:18.189
we'll end up with anyone
that got kicked out.

39:18.272 --> 39:21.233
Well, nobody kicked me out, huh!

39:21.317 --> 39:24.153
I'll play with you
as a special deal here, okay?

39:24.236 --> 39:26.572
Man, you guys lucked out today. Yikes!

39:26.655 --> 39:29.617
I'll be way more help
than either of these wimpy little girls.

39:29.700 --> 39:33.746
Plus, I'm good at everything
except the things that I can't do.

39:33.829 --> 39:35.915
-[Mi-nyeo laughs]
-[sighs]

39:35.998 --> 39:37.166
[clock beeps]

39:37.249 --> 39:40.252
[woman on PA]
The time for forming your teams is over.

39:40.336 --> 39:43.297
All players, please line up
with your teammates

39:43.381 --> 39:45.549
-at the entrance to the game hall.
-Hold on.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.635
We're not gonna stay in here, though?

39:47.718 --> 39:49.303
[inhales, exhales]

39:54.141 --> 39:57.144
[suspenseful music]

39:57.645 --> 40:00.773
[quirky music]

40:06.237 --> 40:09.698
[quirky music continues]

40:21.836 --> 40:25.756
[masked manager] I would now like
to welcome you all to the third game.

40:26.340 --> 40:29.301
Today's game is Tug-of-War.

40:30.553 --> 40:33.556
In order to win, you must pull the rope
towards your platform

40:33.639 --> 40:36.434
in an attempt to
drop your opponents down below.

40:45.067 --> 40:46.110
[sighs]

40:46.861 --> 40:50.656
Now, I will draw numbers to decide
which two teams will play first.

40:52.032 --> 40:53.909
Everyone, please sit down.

40:55.703 --> 40:58.581
[players murmuring]

40:59.582 --> 41:02.668
[masked manager] First, the team
that will play on the left tower.

41:06.964 --> 41:09.508
Team One. Team One, please stand up.

41:13.846 --> 41:17.016
And now, the team that will play
on the right tower.

41:20.394 --> 41:21.270
Team Seven.

41:21.353 --> 41:23.439
Team Seven, please stand up.

41:29.403 --> 41:31.155
[shaky breath]

41:31.822 --> 41:35.284
[masked manager] Teams One and Seven
will be the first teams to play.

41:37.203 --> 41:39.830
Will both teams please go to your towers.

41:43.459 --> 41:46.253
[foreboding music]

42:01.644 --> 42:04.188

[suspenseful music]

42:33.175 --> 42:35.052
[players grunting]

42:40.099 --> 42:41.016
Get them!

42:43.394 --> 42:46.438
[grunting continues]

42:46.522 --> 42:47.982
Oh! Oh, shit!

42:48.065 --> 42:50.150
[players screaming]

42:51.318 --> 42:52.486
[player] Shit!

42:52.570 --> 42:54.488
[screaming, grunting]

42:56.991 --> 42:58.534
Get them!

42:59.868 --> 43:01.453

[all scream]

43:15.718 --> 43:18.304
[panting, laughing]

43:20.681 --> 43:22.391
[Deok-su laughs]

43:22.474 --> 43:24.435
[players panting]

43:29.315 --> 43:32.318
[ominous music]

43:41.076 --> 43:43.954
[woman on PA]
The following players, Player 245,

43:44.038 --> 43:48.334
Player 120, Player 37, Player 408,

43:48.417 --> 43:52.921
Player 27, Player 273, Player 58,

43:53.005 --> 43:59.428
Player 243, Player 327,
and Player 241 are eliminated.

44:03.057 --> 44:05.267
[man grunting]

44:05.351 --> 44:06.727
[moaning]

44:15.861 --> 44:18.197
[player groaning]

44:26.580 --> 44:29.583
[eerie music]

44:36.131 --> 44:38.884
[masked manager] I will now draw
the teams for the next round.

44:38.967 --> 44:39.927
Team Four.

44:44.515 --> 44:45.516
Team Five.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.863
[whispers]
Damn it.

45:00.489 --> 45:01.990
All men.

45:02.074 --> 45:04.827
Team Four and Team Five,
please go to your towers.

45:05.577 --> 45:07.913
[Sang-woo breathing heavily]

45:10.916 --> 45:12.167
[Deok-su chuckles]

45:12.251 --> 45:15.879
Oh, man. I was looking forward
to killing you guys.

45:17.714 --> 45:21.176
[tense music]

45:29.893 --> 45:33.147
[beeping]

45:40.863 --> 45:43.866
[tense music continues]

45:55.169 --> 45:57.212
[rumbles]

45:57.754 --> 45:59.047
[Player 1 grunts]

46:01.008 --> 46:04.052
Come on. Don't lose your spirit.

46:05.512 --> 46:09.057
Tug-of-War needs more
than just raw strength.

46:09.141 --> 46:12.436
Well then, what it's about, huh?
We just go out and speak to them?

46:12.519 --> 46:15.522
All you need is a good strategy
in Tug-of-War

46:15.606 --> 46:17.149
and combined with good teamwork,

46:17.232 --> 46:20.277
you'll be able to win
when you are against stronger teams.

46:20.360 --> 46:22.404
Only one thing can help us now.

46:22.488 --> 46:24.239
-It's the Lord himself, I know it.
-[scoffs]

46:24.323 --> 46:26.492
You can barely stay standing, old man.

46:26.575 --> 46:28.827
So shut up and keep
all your strength, okay?

46:29.453 --> 46:30.496
[clears throat]

46:30.579 --> 46:33.123
Wait a minute,
let's hear what the old man says.

46:33.207 --> 46:34.541
[panting]

46:34.625 --> 46:38.795
Okay, when I was young,
we always like Tug-of-War.

46:38.879 --> 46:40.881
It's a game I know well.

46:40.964 --> 46:44.051
And back then, I would always win,

46:45.093 --> 46:48.931
even if there was a wrestler
on the other team,

46:49.014 --> 46:52.601
and it seemed the odds
were stuck against us.

46:55.395 --> 46:57.064
[Player 1] Listen closely,

46:57.147 --> 47:01.151
and I'll tell you how my team and I
were able to win

47:01.235 --> 47:03.570
even when it seemed impossible.

47:07.491 --> 47:11.119
First off, having a good leader
is very important.

47:11.745 --> 47:13.830
The person is at the front

47:13.914 --> 47:17.668
and keeps an eye on
how the other team is performing.

47:17.751 --> 47:21.797
And the rest of the team focuses
on the back of their leader's head

47:21.880 --> 47:23.423
and follows their lead.

47:23.507 --> 47:27.803
If the leader seems weak or looks like
their spirit is beginning to falter,

47:28.387 --> 47:30.806
then the game is already over.

47:32.266 --> 47:35.018
And then at the end of the rope,

47:35.102 --> 47:38.230
you'll need to have someone strong
and dependable

47:38.313 --> 47:39.898
like the anchor of a ship.

47:41.275 --> 47:45.404
After that, it's all about
how you arrange the rest of your team.

47:45.487 --> 47:48.156
If one player is
on the right side of the rope,

47:48.240 --> 47:52.452
then the next one should be on the left,
all the way down the rope.

47:54.204 --> 47:58.917
Both of your feet
should be facing straight forward,

47:59.001 --> 48:02.379
and then, hold the rope in your armpits.

48:02.921 --> 48:06.717
That way, everyone can put in
all of their strength.

48:07.426 --> 48:12.139
Finally, and this is absolutely
the most important thing.

48:12.639 --> 48:16.143
Once the game begins,
for the first ten seconds…

48:16.810 --> 48:19.229
-[all scream]
-…you have to hold your ground.

48:19.771 --> 48:23.275
You should lean back,
practically lie down.

48:23.358 --> 48:27.112
Push your lower abdomen up to the sky,
as hard as you can.

48:27.195 --> 48:29.781
And throw your head back to the point

48:29.865 --> 48:33.368
where you can almost see the groin
of the person behind you.

48:33.452 --> 48:38.206
If you do that, the other team
won't be able to pull us to their side.

48:38.290 --> 48:41.168
Just hold like this for ten seconds.

48:41.668 --> 48:45.005
Then the opposing team
will start to get frustrated

48:45.088 --> 48:47.966
because they are thinking,
"Why won't they budge?"

48:48.550 --> 48:51.803
Because they believed
that they were much stronger.

48:52.429 --> 48:54.723
If you can hold out for that long,

48:54.806 --> 48:58.810
you will be able to catch a moment
in your opponents' hold,

48:58.894 --> 49:01.271
and their rhythm breaks.

49:03.106 --> 49:04.399
Now's our chance!

49:04.483 --> 49:07.694
[Team Four rhythmic shouting]

49:09.237 --> 49:12.115
[all grunting, shouting]

49:14.951 --> 49:17.829
[rhythmic shouting continues]

49:23.460 --> 49:25.087
[Team Five grunting]

49:27.255 --> 49:29.174
Pull it together!

49:29.257 --> 49:30.884

49:37.182 --> 49:40.560
[rhythmic shouting]

49:45.023 --> 49:46.817

49:46.900 --> 49:47.859
[Mi-nyeo exclaims]

49:49.528 --> 49:51.154
[Team Four grunting]

49:52.239 --> 49:55.033
[Mi-nyeo yells]

49:55.117 --> 49:57.703
We're losing! Goddamn it! Do something!

49:57.786 --> 50:00.539
[Team Four grunting]

50:03.542 --> 50:05.293
Get yourselves together and listen!

50:06.044 --> 50:08.797
Let's try something.
Take three steps up when I signal.

50:08.880 --> 50:11.758
Up? What now? But that's the edge!

50:12.259 --> 50:13.760
Look, just trust me and they'll fall!

50:13.844 --> 50:15.303
There's no way I'll do that!

50:15.387 --> 50:16.763
We might as well try!

50:16.847 --> 50:18.515
[Mi-nyeo] No way! I can't do it!

50:18.598 --> 50:20.183
Move up or you'll die!

50:20.684 --> 50:21.935
On count of three!

50:22.018 --> 50:23.854
-One! Two!
-[gasps]

50:23.937 --> 50:25.647
-Three!
-[screams]

50:29.651 --> 50:31.653
