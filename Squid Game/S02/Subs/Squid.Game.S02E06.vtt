- Four.

- I knew you were going to be okay!

06:55.456 --> 06:57.166
I knew it. You're not just anybody.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.378
I was worried. I'm glad you made it.

- Rock, paper, scissors!

- Come with me.

Where's your son?

09:52.675 --> 09:53.676
Sorry?

09:53.759 --> 09:55.177
Weren't you with him?

09:57.054 --> 10:02.101
Oh, well, I lost hold of him.

10:02.184 --> 10:07.023
He told me to wait
until he brought one more person,

10:07.106 --> 10:09.483
but I lost him in all the fuss.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.193
He didn't come back?

10:19.910 --> 10:23.372
My son isn't that kind of person.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.752
We may be poor, but he has a good heart.

10:27.835 --> 10:30.713
He'd rather be bullied
than bully another human being.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.049

You're not hurt at all, are you?

11:25.017 --> 11:26.811
He saved our lives.

11:26.894 --> 11:31.565
Mr. 246 here showed up
when we were running out of time,

11:31.649 --> 11:33.192
just like Prince Charming!

11:33.275 --> 11:37.530
Boy, you do look like a prince.
Thank you so much.

11:37.613 --> 11:41.367
Not at all. These two saved my life.

11:43.994 --> 11:44.870
Mom.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.710
No! Young-mi!

Yong-sik, what do we do?

14:02.508 --> 14:04.552
Young-mi! What do we do?

14:04.635 --> 14:05.678
It's your fault.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.889
Don't kid yourself.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.766
If I hadn't come in, you'd be dead too.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.395
It's your fault! I could have saved her!

14:14.478 --> 14:15.771
There was no time!

14:16.397 --> 14:17.815
The moment you went out to save her,

14:17.898 --> 14:20.609
you'd have died
along with everyone else here

14:20.693 --> 14:22.528
for not having enough people!

14:23.320 --> 14:25.739

14:33.789 --> 14:34.790
He…

14:36.625 --> 14:38.335
is right about that.

It's true. There wasn't enough time.

15:20.127 --> 15:21.086
Thank you.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.089
Don't get the wrong idea.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.759

15:51.325 --> 15:54.954
<i>Now, the final round will begin.</i>

16:00.751 --> 16:02.753
What do you think it'll be this time?

16:04.088 --> 16:05.047
Two.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.048
Why?

16:06.757 --> 16:08.592
There are 126 people left,

16:08.676 --> 16:10.552
and there are 50 rooms.

16:10.636 --> 16:14.181
So there won't be enough rooms
for everyone, only for 100 people.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.726
The rest will be killed.

16:24.692 --> 16:25.609
<i>Two.</i>

16:27.736 --> 16:28.737
Gi-hun.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.115

17:50.694 --> 17:51.987

17:57.034 --> 17:57.868
Get out.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.286
We were here first.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.082
Open the door, you bastards!
I was here first!

<i>Game over.</i>

19:15.779 --> 19:19.158
When we get back, let's count
the number of people remaining.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.285
Why?

19:22.035 --> 19:24.496
If we count the numbers of Os and Xs,

19:24.580 --> 19:28.667
we'll be able to see
who's likely to win the next vote.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.629
We'll have to hope
more people from the other side died.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.560
By the way,
what's this thing called again?

19:46.643 --> 19:48.187
It's called a drone.

19:48.812 --> 19:51.190
"Drong"? It's so cool.

19:51.273 --> 19:54.860
Up until now, you had to use binoculars,

19:54.943 --> 19:57.487
climb onto the island, and all that shit.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.698
This makes things much easier.

19:59.781 --> 20:03.368
Fly lower. They know we're onto them.
They likely improved their camouflage.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.328
Got it.

20:09.124 --> 20:12.920
But what makes you think
we can find them within a few days

20:13.003 --> 20:14.671
when you couldn't over the last two years?

20:14.755 --> 20:16.882
If we exclude the places
I've already searched,

20:17.758 --> 20:19.343
we can narrow down the search area.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.887
We'll find them if the weather holds up.

20:21.970 --> 20:26.308
That's right. We've got another team
and this "drong" thing now.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.518
Captain. It's "drone," not "drong."

20:28.602 --> 20:29.853
Whatever.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.242
My little boy, Min-su!

20:45.786 --> 20:48.455
I'm so happy to see you again, bro.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.834
Min-su, do you know how worried I was?

20:53.585 --> 20:55.337
I thought I was running with you.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.424
But then I realized
I was with this douche.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.344
I told you he wouldn't die easily.
You saw what he did.

21:02.427 --> 21:06.056
When Se-mi stuck her hand out like this,
he took a beat, then went scissors.

21:06.139 --> 21:09.142
I thought, "Damn, he's unbelievable."

21:09.226 --> 21:10.936
I got chills, Min-su.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.021
Let's play one more game, okay?

21:13.105 --> 21:14.481
You'll play one more, right?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.822
What did you want to tell me?
Make it quick.

21:22.698 --> 21:23.907
Jun-hee.

21:24.491 --> 21:27.244
When we get out, let's start over.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.246
"Start over"?

21:30.038 --> 21:31.206
How exactly?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.250
Trust me one last time.

21:34.501 --> 21:37.462
We can have our baby and start over.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.968
I did some calculations.

21:43.051 --> 21:45.387
Each person will get 300 to 400 million.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.764
A lot of people will want to leave.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.850
We could win the next vote.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.477
If we get out,

21:53.687 --> 21:54.730
then what?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.900
If we put our money together,
it'll be a lot.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.028
We'll pay off some urgent debts first.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.572
I'll find a new way of investing
the rest of the money.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.659
No more coin.

22:08.201 --> 22:10.912
I know a team of great stockbrokers.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.749
They deal in inverse ETFs
and futures trading.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.543
Their profit rate was
over 100% last month.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.171
It's my money you need, isn't it?

22:20.422 --> 22:21.548
Not me and the baby.

22:21.631 --> 22:23.550
It's not like that, Jun-hee.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.928
I want to make enough money
to build a good life for us--

22:27.012 --> 22:27.888
"Enough money"?

22:29.097 --> 22:30.640
How much is that exactly?

22:30.724 --> 22:31.683
What?

22:34.353 --> 22:36.605
Pay your debts with your own money.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.858
I'm going to use mine to raise my baby.

22:43.737 --> 22:44.571
Jun-hee.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.742
- Listen to me.
- <i>Min-su, Nam-su, Gyeong-su, so many "su"s</i>

22:49.659 --> 22:51.745
Hey, look at those two.

22:54.748 --> 22:55.707
What's going on?

22:55.791 --> 22:56.833
Maybe they're a thing.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.711
That bastard sure is lucky.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.129
Even in a place like this.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.136
Don't be so sad.

23:09.012 --> 23:13.600
You will be joining her
in the underworld soon.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.897
I've put a curse on you all.

23:21.358 --> 23:24.861
I've been praying to the gods
of heaven and earth with all my heart

23:25.779 --> 23:28.407
to let me see all of you

23:29.408 --> 23:32.035
die in this place, one by one!

23:33.995 --> 23:36.623
You'll never get out of here alive.

23:37.624 --> 23:40.544
You will die a miserable, painful death,

23:42.045 --> 23:44.589
staring at each other the whole time.

23:58.603 --> 24:04.359
That woman is not a shaman,
she's just a lunatic.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.360
Good grief.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.574
You should spit too.

24:12.200 --> 24:15.829
Gi-hun, there are 55 people
who voted in favor of continuing.

24:15.912 --> 24:17.038
Are you sure?

24:17.122 --> 24:18.331
I counted them twice.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.667
What about you? Did you include yourself?

24:22.711 --> 24:24.004
It's 56.

24:26.339 --> 24:29.426
We have 44 people on our side,
so we're outnumbered by 12.

24:29.509 --> 24:32.053
Shoot, that means
we're likely to lose again.

24:32.846 --> 24:34.598
It may seem like a big difference,

24:35.140 --> 24:38.768
but if six of them change their minds,
it'll be 50/50, all tied.

24:39.352 --> 24:42.189
If seven of them change their minds,
we could win.

24:42.272 --> 24:45.901
But those who pressed X
might change their minds too.

24:45.984 --> 24:49.696
They probably won't
change their minds easily.

24:49.779 --> 24:50.780
Why not?

24:51.990 --> 24:55.076
They wanted to quit
even when the prize was smaller.

24:55.702 --> 24:58.079
Now they can leave with even more money.

24:58.163 --> 25:01.833
They wouldn't want to risk their lives
playing another game.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.793
I'm going to press X this time.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.713
That means we'll have a tie
if five others change their minds.

25:06.796 --> 25:08.089
With six more, we win.

25:08.673 --> 25:12.928
Then let's go over there
and try to convince them.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.054
No, that's too risky.

25:14.679 --> 25:18.683
Most of them will want
to continue the games.

25:18.767 --> 25:22.145
If we make a move,
they won't just sit back and watch.

25:22.229 --> 25:24.064
So you think we should just stand here

25:24.856 --> 25:27.651
and pray they change their minds?

25:29.236 --> 25:30.612
What if we lose again?

25:30.695 --> 25:33.657
We march down, hand in hand,
to play another game?

25:33.740 --> 25:35.617
I understand how you feel.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.703
I also wish I could leave right now.

25:39.621 --> 25:42.123
But this is the moment to stay calm.

25:42.832 --> 25:44.334
"Stay calm"?

25:44.417 --> 25:47.003
We've already taken a vote twice.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.589
If we can't convince them,

25:49.673 --> 25:52.300
we'll have to bring them over
to our side by force.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.553
If we provoke them now,

25:54.636 --> 25:57.556
we may end up in a big fight
before we even get to vote.

25:57.639 --> 25:59.307
Is that what you want, Gi-hun?

26:04.938 --> 26:06.064
Look, Gi-hun.

26:06.815 --> 26:09.150
I'm too scared to play another game.

26:09.234 --> 26:12.279
I'm sure there are more people like me.

26:12.362 --> 26:15.365
That's right. That's what I think too.

26:15.448 --> 26:19.119
If it's just five or six people,
we've got a shot.

26:19.202 --> 26:22.539
I did the math, and the prize is
now over 300 million per person.

26:22.622 --> 26:25.333
I think that gives us
a pretty good chance.

26:36.344 --> 26:41.933
Congratulations to all of you
for making it through the third game.

26:42.017 --> 26:46.646
Now, here are the results
of the third game.

26:56.531 --> 26:59.075
Hang on. Can you double back?

26:59.159 --> 26:59.993
Sure.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.291
There's something on the ground.

27:06.374 --> 27:08.209
What's that? A door?

27:08.293 --> 27:09.419
Get down lower.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.298
I can't because of the trees.

27:13.381 --> 27:14.841
We've got to go check it out.

27:17.385 --> 27:18.803
Everyone, get ready to move!

27:20.263 --> 27:21.765
It's 356 million won.

27:21.848 --> 27:26.061
With that kind of money,
some of them will change their minds.

27:27.020 --> 27:30.482
If we get six more people, it's a tie.
If it's seven, we win.

27:30.565 --> 27:34.861
The vote will once again be conducted
in reverse order of your player numbers.

27:34.944 --> 27:38.114
Player 456, please cast your vote.

27:39.908 --> 27:43.078
To ensure fair and democratic voting,

27:43.161 --> 27:47.832
we will not tolerate
any disruptions from this point onward.

27:48.416 --> 27:50.210
Please bear that in mind.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.114
Player 388.

28:22.283 --> 28:24.411
Six more to win.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.419
Player 380.

28:36.464 --> 28:37.465
Five more.

28:45.140 --> 28:48.101
- Player 377.
- That fucking bitch.

28:52.647 --> 28:53.982
Number 011.

28:54.733 --> 28:59.404
If you'd done this sooner, you wouldn't
have gotten a scratch on your pretty face.

28:59.946 --> 29:01.573
Let's keep it this way.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.514
Player 230.

29:36.357 --> 29:39.819
Circle! Let's go!

29:55.585 --> 29:58.338
It's four people now.
Four more, and we win.

29:58.421 --> 29:59.798
Player 149.

30:01.591 --> 30:05.595
If you pull the same crap again,
I'll hang myself right here.

30:05.678 --> 30:06.679
I got it.

30:13.853 --> 30:15.438
Player 145.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.446
Min-su. Just one more game.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.990
I already talked to him.

30:26.741 --> 30:29.577
We agreed to play one more game
and leave with one billion.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.289
Player 125.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.918
Come on, Min-su. Come on.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.775
With three more people, we win.

31:05.738 --> 31:07.365
Player 124.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.587
Player 120.

31:33.641 --> 31:35.685
Only two more now!

31:35.768 --> 31:37.103
Player 119.

31:37.186 --> 31:39.647
Two more. We need two more people.

32:45.838 --> 32:47.465
I think it leads underground.

32:47.548 --> 32:48.549
Open it.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.067
Player 015.

33:20.707 --> 33:23.459
He switched to X!

33:23.543 --> 33:25.753
That's six! It's a tie now.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.213
If we get one more person, we win.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.925
Are we really going home?

33:31.926 --> 33:32.844
Player 009.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.861
It's all right. She voted O before anyway.

33:50.445 --> 33:51.487
Player 007.

33:59.787 --> 34:02.415
Your son will definitely vote X
this time, right?

34:02.999 --> 34:07.754
Don't worry. My Yong-sik
will definitely press X this time.

34:10.089 --> 34:12.341
He switched sides! That's it!

34:12.425 --> 34:13.760
Yes!

34:15.595 --> 34:17.180
Let's go home!

34:17.263 --> 34:19.098
- Yes! Let's go home!
- Yes!

34:20.224 --> 34:22.435
- Player 006.
- He was the seventh one.

34:28.191 --> 34:31.235
We did it. They're both on our side.
We're going to win!

34:41.704 --> 34:42.747
Gi-hun.

34:43.539 --> 34:44.415
Yeah?

34:45.208 --> 34:46.501
About Young-il…

34:49.170 --> 34:50.046
What about him?

34:50.588 --> 34:54.467
Well, when I was
in the room with him earlier…

35:12.360 --> 35:13.820
Good job.

35:13.903 --> 35:16.447
- Well done! That's great!
- Yes!

35:18.658 --> 35:20.993
Lastly, Player 001.

35:21.619 --> 35:22.912
Please cast your vote.

35:29.627 --> 35:30.753
Brother Young-il.

35:32.046 --> 35:32.880
Let's go!

35:33.756 --> 35:37.802
It's going to be 50/50,
so it's still a tie, isn't it?

35:50.523 --> 35:53.401
Young-il scares me a little.

35:55.528 --> 35:56.362
What do you mean?

35:58.865 --> 36:02.285
I don't know how to put this,

36:03.286 --> 36:05.788
but when I was in the room with him
in the last game…

36:07.915 --> 36:09.000
he…

36:10.543 --> 36:13.212
That's it! Finally.

36:15.131 --> 36:16.382
Oh, my God.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.092
We did it.

36:23.222 --> 36:24.599
We did it.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.100
It's a tie.

36:26.184 --> 36:29.478
The vote has ended.

36:29.562 --> 36:33.733
Wait, it's a tie. What happens now?

36:33.816 --> 36:36.068
Clause three of the consent form.

36:36.152 --> 36:40.448
"In the case of a tie,
players will vote again."

36:40.531 --> 36:44.368
So when are we going to vote again?

36:44.452 --> 36:47.205
To give you some time to think,

36:47.288 --> 36:50.041
the vote will be conducted tomorrow.

36:50.124 --> 36:54.962
Until then, please think carefully
about your future.

37:23.950 --> 37:27.119
Listen. Maybe we should head back to port.

37:27.203 --> 37:29.914
Isn't it all over
if we don't find it in the next few days?

37:29.997 --> 37:34.085
That's true,
but you should take him to the hospital.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.004
How are you holding up?
Can you push through?

37:37.880 --> 37:39.382
Yes, I'm okay.

37:39.966 --> 37:43.052
His bleeding has stopped,
and I stitched him up. He'll be fine.

37:43.135 --> 37:45.429
Still, someone just died.

37:45.513 --> 37:46.806
Let's keep going.

37:46.889 --> 37:49.141
He won't be able to rest in peace

37:49.225 --> 37:51.185
until we even the score
with those bastards.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.689
But they've even set up booby traps.

37:54.772 --> 37:57.066
That means they already know
our whereabouts.

37:59.777 --> 38:02.238
From now on, a different radio channel
will be used each day,

38:02.321 --> 38:04.323
and cell phone usage is prohibited.

38:05.074 --> 38:05.950
You heard him.

38:06.033 --> 38:07.118
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.161
Please let Team 2 know.

38:23.592 --> 38:25.761
- What were you going to tell me earlier?
- What?

38:27.179 --> 38:30.308
About Young-il during the last game.

38:39.817 --> 38:42.820
I guess it's not him. It's this place
that's making everyone crazy.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.656
We have to get out of here.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.825
I might go crazy too if I stay any longer.

38:53.414 --> 38:56.876
You know, Young-il.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.212
I thought you might vote in favor,
like on day one.

39:00.296 --> 39:03.591
I was so nervous, I couldn't watch.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.218
Jung-bae also said something weird--

39:06.302 --> 39:07.887
Just eat.

39:08.471 --> 39:09.972
Aren't you hungry?

39:11.849 --> 39:14.769
Thank you, Young-il.
You gave us another chance.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.480
No, I just wanted to stay alive.

39:20.107 --> 39:24.487
The money is enough now too,
so I should get out of here.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.614
Alive.

39:29.075 --> 39:33.913
But do you think
we'll be able to win the second vote?

39:34.955 --> 39:36.665
We'll have to go for broke.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.086
Like Gi-hun said earlier,

39:40.169 --> 39:45.216
we should try to convince some of them
to change their minds

39:45.299 --> 39:46.967
before the second vote.

39:47.468 --> 39:48.969
Will they though?

39:49.053 --> 39:52.848
They seem to have
lost their minds over the money.

39:52.932 --> 39:55.017
The way I see it,
we're more likely to win.

39:55.601 --> 39:58.062
All we've got to eat
is this roll of <i>gimbap</i>.

39:58.145 --> 40:00.606
Everyone will be so hungry tomorrow.

40:00.689 --> 40:05.111
When you're hungry,
you start to miss home.

40:07.863 --> 40:08.697
Hey!

40:10.449 --> 40:13.119
Don't agonize over your decision
while eating this dry <i>gimbap</i>.

40:13.202 --> 40:16.205
I just want one of you
to come over to our side.

40:16.288 --> 40:19.875
If we get out of here tomorrow morning,

40:19.959 --> 40:21.877
we could get Korean beef!

40:22.586 --> 40:25.214
I'll tell you what. It's my treat!

40:25.297 --> 40:27.258
And after that, the noodles are on me!

40:27.341 --> 40:29.260
Come over to our side! Anyone!

40:29.343 --> 40:30.803
Come on over!

40:30.886 --> 40:33.889
Once you all die in the next game,

40:34.515 --> 40:37.268
we can all leave with 800 million each!

40:37.810 --> 40:42.314
With 800 million,
we could buy a freaking cattle ranch!

40:42.398 --> 40:44.233
- That's right!
- You can join us!

40:44.316 --> 40:47.445
- That's right! Come on over!
- Come over to our side!

40:47.528 --> 40:49.697
You'll get 800 million?
Who are you kidding?

40:49.780 --> 40:52.491
Do you think you'll still be alive
after the next game?

40:52.575 --> 40:55.327
If you don't get out now,
you're all going to die!

40:55.411 --> 40:59.915
So let's play one more game
to see who dies.

40:59.999 --> 41:02.460
Stop trying to run away
like a goddamn coward.

41:03.711 --> 41:06.839
What did you say? Hey, come here.

41:06.922 --> 41:08.299
Come here, asshole!

41:08.382 --> 41:09.925
- Let's go.
- I'll take you down, chump!

41:10.009 --> 41:11.010
Not with civilians.

41:11.093 --> 41:11.969
Come here.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.182
I was in the Marines, fucking asshole!

41:18.392 --> 41:22.271
Oh, yeah?
Then I was in the air force, fucker!

41:22.354 --> 41:26.525
Hey, if you want to go home,
why would you even bother eating?

41:26.609 --> 41:28.402
Just starve!

41:28.486 --> 41:29.653
That's it.

41:32.781 --> 41:34.825
- Come on, fuckers!
- You fucker!

42:00.601 --> 42:01.894
<i>Min-su.</i>

42:02.686 --> 42:04.313
I know you're upset with me.

42:05.022 --> 42:06.565
I'm sorry, boy!

42:07.441 --> 42:11.529
But still, you shouldn't have betrayed me.
That really hurt.

42:11.612 --> 42:14.114
- Open the door.
- Hey, Min-su.

42:14.198 --> 42:17.910
You said you got scammed in a rental deal
and have no place to go anyway.

42:17.993 --> 42:19.453
Open the door!

42:19.537 --> 42:20.829
Let's play one more game.

42:20.913 --> 42:24.041
We'll protect you. I swear.

42:24.124 --> 42:27.461
So when we vote again tomorrow,
press O, all right? Come here.

42:27.545 --> 42:31.131
Whoa, boy. Sit the fuck down.

42:32.383 --> 42:33.509
Look, Min-su.

42:34.760 --> 42:38.639
Before I came here,
I went to a bridge to kill myself.

42:39.181 --> 42:40.933
But on that bridge,

42:41.016 --> 42:44.728
a man in a suit came
and gave me that card.

42:45.604 --> 42:47.064
You got one too, didn't you?

42:47.690 --> 42:48.524
Yes.

42:49.358 --> 42:52.361
I don't have a religion, but it felt like…

42:53.904 --> 42:56.490
like divine intervention.

42:57.074 --> 43:00.369
It felt like I was being given
a chance at a whole new life.

43:00.452 --> 43:03.289
So I decided to give it my best shot

43:03.372 --> 43:05.291
and make my mom proud.

43:05.374 --> 43:07.501
But you're stopping me from doing that.

43:07.585 --> 43:10.004
It makes me fucking furious!

43:10.087 --> 43:12.131
I'm so fucking angry, man!

43:12.214 --> 43:13.215
Knock it off.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.933
Mind your own damn business and fuck off.

43:23.017 --> 43:24.602
You're interfering with the vote.

43:24.685 --> 43:28.272
The amazing Myung-gi.
Who do you think you are?

43:28.355 --> 43:30.024
The election commissioner?

43:30.107 --> 43:31.066
MG Coin.

43:32.401 --> 43:36.572
You're next,
so just take a piss and get out.

43:38.699 --> 43:43.662
Everyone on Team X!
These guys are threatening one of us!

43:43.746 --> 43:46.415
They're forcing him to vote O next time!

43:46.498 --> 43:50.336
Is that true? Hey, that's cheating.

43:51.045 --> 43:53.380
You kids are still so young.

43:53.464 --> 43:55.674
Who taught you to do something so nasty?

43:55.758 --> 44:00.679
Hey! Team O!

44:00.763 --> 44:03.098
These Xs are about to attack us!

44:03.182 --> 44:06.143
What the fuck? Why would they attack us?

44:06.226 --> 44:08.354
Shut your trap.

44:08.437 --> 44:12.608
You damn wimps.
Just shut up and take a piss!

44:12.691 --> 44:14.276
I already did, asshole.

44:16.153 --> 44:17.154
Min-su, come here.

44:19.740 --> 44:20.616
MG Coin.

44:21.867 --> 44:23.035
Are you high?

44:24.620 --> 44:26.038
Have you lost your mind?

44:26.997 --> 44:30.459
It's because of her, isn't it?
We saw him with some bitch earlier.

44:30.542 --> 44:33.504
It looked like they were a thing,
remember?

44:35.756 --> 44:38.342
You little shit. You have time
to fool around with a girl?

44:38.926 --> 44:41.553
I've been watching her carefully.

44:42.888 --> 44:45.683
She was walking a bit funny,
and her belly looked--

44:45.766 --> 44:48.185
Leave her alone, you bastards!

44:50.104 --> 44:53.107
You're getting all worked up.
So there is something going on.

44:53.190 --> 44:54.316
I'm telling you.

44:55.359 --> 44:56.402
MG Coin.

44:56.485 --> 45:00.489
- Something's going on.
- If you press X again tomorrow,

45:00.572 --> 45:05.077
I'm going to cut off your finger,
give it to her,

45:05.786 --> 45:07.287
and ask her out.

45:09.415 --> 45:10.499
She'll love it.

45:10.582 --> 45:12.418
You asshole!

45:16.588 --> 45:18.507
You motherfucker!

45:20.008 --> 45:21.635
I'll end you!

45:37.067 --> 45:42.156
Your money, your girl, your life,
they're all mine.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.200
It all belongs to me, Thanos the great!

45:48.454 --> 45:53.208
You fucking… You son of a fucking bitch!

48:31.450 --> 48:36.455
