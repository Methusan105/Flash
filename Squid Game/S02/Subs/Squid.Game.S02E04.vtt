SQUID GAME 2

01:02.020 --> 01:07.150
EPISODE 4
SIX LEGS

01:28.880 --> 01:30.882
Just like my mom used to make.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.885
What's in yours?

01:36.679 --> 01:37.972
Aren't you going to eat?

01:40.433 --> 01:41.976
Look, you've got to eat.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.896
You know what they say.
"Eat up, even on your deathbed."

01:44.979 --> 01:48.358
Just do your thinking while you eat,
or afterwards. Here.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.152
Come on.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.404
Forget it then.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.408
This might be for the best.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.579
I don't know about you,

02:01.663 --> 02:04.958
but that 20 million
wouldn't even cover my interest.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.793
If we play just one more game--

02:06.876 --> 02:07.794
Jung-bae.

02:09.379 --> 02:14.342
Last time I was here,
someone said the exact same thing.

02:16.761 --> 02:17.762
And in the end,

02:19.264 --> 02:21.182
that person died here.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.019
Help us then, sir.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.857
You said you've played these games.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.154
I pressed the O button because of you.

02:35.989 --> 02:40.034
Honestly, I was scared.
I wanted to quit and leave.

02:40.618 --> 02:45.248
But you made me think
maybe I could play just one more game.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.875
- Me too.
- Same here.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.501
- Yes.
- Me too.

02:52.839 --> 02:53.840
Sir.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.468
You know which game's next, don't you?

03:01.389 --> 03:02.432
That's right.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.102
You're a previous winner,
so you should know.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.271
What are we playing next?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.442
The second game

03:13.860 --> 03:15.445
was <i>Dalgona</i>.

03:17.947 --> 03:21.534
<i>Dalgona</i>? The sugar candy
with a shape you can carve out?

03:22.202 --> 03:23.203
That's right.

03:24.078 --> 03:27.123
We had to choose one of four shapes
and carve it out.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.793
Four shapes? Which was the easiest one?

03:30.877 --> 03:32.086
Triangle.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.714
Which was the hardest one?

03:35.673 --> 03:36.716
Umbrella.

03:36.799 --> 03:37.717
Umbrella?

03:39.969 --> 03:41.763
Some people chose umbrella?

03:44.474 --> 03:49.062
Those unlucky bastards
must have bitten the dust.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.988
So that means
we should all just pick triangle.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.532
Everyone could probably pass the round.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.159
Hush now!

04:04.118 --> 04:08.539
If all 365 of us survive,
the prize money won't go up at all.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.251
Then we'll have risked
our lives again for nothing.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.294
- That's true.
- He's right.

04:13.378 --> 04:18.174
Listen. We should probably
keep this information to ourselves.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.301
- What do you say?
- Let's do that.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.970
We can't do that.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.847
I'm telling you this
to save everyone's lives.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.268
If it's confirmed
that the next game is <i>Dalgona</i>,

04:28.351 --> 04:30.728
I'm going to tell everyone what I know.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.111
<i>Dalgona</i>, triangle.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.995
So which shape did you pick?

04:52.542 --> 04:55.211
Mom. I just found out something important.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.552
Shit. Mom!

05:08.266 --> 05:09.934
Have this too.

05:12.186 --> 05:14.647
You should eat it for your baby.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.483
Eggs are good for pregnant women.

05:21.738 --> 05:25.867
I've helped more than
a dozen women in my neighborhood

05:25.950 --> 05:28.286
deliver their babies.

05:28.369 --> 05:34.125
I can tell just by looking at
your body shape and the way you walk.

05:34.667 --> 05:38.004
It looks like
your due date is getting close.

05:38.546 --> 05:41.132
If you compress your belly to hide it,

05:41.215 --> 05:44.385
it'll be bad for both you and your baby.
It could be dangerous.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.721
That's why you were in pain earlier.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.348
It's not what you think.

05:50.183 --> 05:54.645
How did you end up in a place like this
in your condition?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.148
- What are you doing here?
- You startled me!

05:57.231 --> 05:59.025
- Come. No time for socializing.
- Whatâ€¦

05:59.108 --> 06:01.277
All right, just wait.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.237
You should finish your food,

06:03.321 --> 06:05.656
and if something feels off,
come find me right away.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.785
- Come on!
- I'll be over there, okay?

06:08.868 --> 06:10.953
Why? What is it?

06:22.340 --> 06:23.925
May I ask you something?

06:30.890 --> 06:33.643
Why did you come back to this place?

06:35.144 --> 06:37.397
You said you won and made it out.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.149
Then you must have received 45.6 billion.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.693
Did you spend it all?

06:43.861 --> 06:45.405
Did you bet on horses again?

06:45.488 --> 06:47.407
That money doesn't belong to me.

06:50.284 --> 06:53.121
It's blood money
for the people who died here.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.208
The same goes for the money up there.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.754
You don't have to think of it that way.

07:02.713 --> 07:05.007
It's not like you killed those people,

07:05.091 --> 07:07.927
and saving that money
won't bring them back to life.

07:08.719 --> 07:13.599
If you had pressed the X,
everyone here would've made it out alive.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.521
That's right.
I was the last to press the O button.

07:20.189 --> 07:24.861
But there were 182 more people
who wanted to stay.

07:24.944 --> 07:28.823
And there were also 182 people
who wanted to leave.

07:29.574 --> 07:30.950
Let's say

07:32.577 --> 07:37.206
I pressed X and we all left.
Would everyone have been happy?

07:37.790 --> 07:40.042
Do you think if they ran into me later,

07:40.126 --> 07:45.423
they'd thank me for saving their lives
and tell me they're happy now?

07:49.635 --> 07:53.639
All right.
There's no point in placing blame now.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.684
You know the saying,
a widow understands a widower best.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.479
Let's just focus on tomorrow's game, okay?

07:59.562 --> 08:01.564
He has won all these games before.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.901
If we stick together,
we'll have nothing to worry about.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.152
He's right, sirs.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.783
We have to stick together.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.702
I'll be with you all the way.

08:14.785 --> 08:15.828
Who are you?

08:15.912 --> 08:17.330
My good sir.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.709
I'm Dae-ho. Kang Dae-ho.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.128
- Oh, Mr. Dae-ho.
- Yes.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.046
Have we met?

08:27.882 --> 08:30.843
Earlier during the game,
Mr. 456 here was like,

08:30.927 --> 08:34.847
"Freeze!" And I became his fan.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.808
I'd like to get to know you, sirs.
Please give me the chance!

08:38.851 --> 08:41.020
"Freeze!" That was so cool.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.355
Hang on.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.564
Yes, sir?

08:43.648 --> 08:44.815
You were in the Marines?

08:44.899 --> 08:46.108
Yes, why?

08:46.192 --> 08:47.193
Class number?

08:52.240 --> 08:53.074
You're laughing?

08:56.953 --> 08:59.163
Victory at all costs!

08:59.247 --> 09:00.998
I was in Class 1140, sir!

09:01.582 --> 09:02.416
At ease!

09:03.042 --> 09:03.960
"Dae-ho."

09:04.752 --> 09:06.963
I knew there was something about you.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.674
- Sir!
- Class 746 here. Let's make a good team.

09:09.757 --> 09:10.716
I won't let you down!

09:11.759 --> 09:13.469
Sir!

09:13.553 --> 09:15.054
You're full of spirit.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.014
Yes, sir!

09:18.391 --> 09:19.225
Yes!

09:22.270 --> 09:23.854
Enjoying your food?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.274
I couldn't eat.

09:26.357 --> 09:30.027
After seeing everyone get shot dead,
you still have a damn appetite?

09:30.570 --> 09:33.322
That crypto ruined my life too.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.409
That's why I'm here, to make money.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.288
That's right.
You'd better make a lot of money.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.498
Because of that damn coin,

09:42.582 --> 09:47.837
I lost over 500 million won, the money
I earned from busting my ass rapping.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.171
I lost 300 million.

09:49.255 --> 09:53.801
You'd better win the games
and make a load of money to pay us back.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.846
I get it. Can you go away now?
I'm trying to eat--

09:57.430 --> 10:00.725
You little shit,
eating like a fucking pig.

10:01.475 --> 10:02.310
Give it back.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.227
No.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.689
You want to eat this so badly?

10:07.398 --> 10:09.483
Then Thanos will feed you.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.780
Good, isn't it?

10:17.491 --> 10:19.577
- You motherfucker.
- Son of a bitch.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.746
- You asshole.
- Knock it off.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.372
Fucking asshole.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.084
Son of a bitch.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.920
I lost all that money
because of you, fucker.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.215
- You piece of shit.
- Let me get in there.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.092
- You son of a bitch.
- Hey.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.260
Step aside.

10:37.094 --> 10:40.514
Be grateful and fucking eat
what you're given!

10:40.598 --> 10:44.018
It's good to be young.
They still have the energy to do that.

10:44.101 --> 10:47.563
He might get really hurt.
Someone should stop them.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.648
I know.

10:50.524 --> 10:51.400
Me?

10:56.113 --> 10:59.325
Boys, what are you doing
in the middle of mealtime?

10:59.408 --> 11:01.035
No fights during mealtime.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.579
There are elders present.
Mind your manners.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.456
And two against one?

11:07.083 --> 11:08.376
Aren't you embarrassed?

11:08.459 --> 11:11.796
You're lecturing me
when you ended up in this shithole too?

11:12.463 --> 11:16.550
Dude, stop running your mouth

11:16.634 --> 11:19.011
and take care of your own damn kids.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.889
What did you just say?

11:22.932 --> 11:25.851
I said save the lecture
for your own damn kid.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.728
You son of a bitch.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.196
Wait.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.288
I'm sorry.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.750
Pleaseâ€¦

11:53.921 --> 11:54.922
Let me go.

12:01.262 --> 12:05.558
- Great! You're the man!
- Nice!

12:08.144 --> 12:09.603
That was cool!

12:16.736 --> 12:17.820
What is he?

12:19.071 --> 12:20.239
Is he an ex-Marine too?

12:28.914 --> 12:32.042
<i>The day's work has been completed.</i>

12:32.126 --> 12:36.130
<i>All soldiers,</i>
<i>please return to your quarters.</i>

12:53.564 --> 12:54.607
Na-yeon!

12:57.985 --> 12:58.819
Are you with her?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.237
<i>Yes, I'm her father.</i>

13:00.321 --> 13:02.364
<i>Please take her</i>
<i>to Seohyeon University Hospital.</i>

13:19.006 --> 13:23.928
Dissolve my karmic ties and grievancesâ€¦

13:47.660 --> 13:50.204
Mom, are you asleep?

14:04.051 --> 14:05.594
Honey, I'm sorry.

14:08.222 --> 14:11.392
I'm sorry.

14:14.645 --> 14:15.771
Excuse me.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.401
If you're still up,
can we have a little talk?

14:22.152 --> 14:23.112
Sure.

14:30.411 --> 14:34.415
I think I was out of line before.
I'd like to apologize. I'm sorry.

14:34.498 --> 14:36.834
No, that's okay.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.547
I laid all the blame on you.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.092
I was out of line.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.436
My wife is very sick.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.442
She has acute cirrhosis.
She needs a liver transplant.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.613
But when she was going through the tests,

15:06.947 --> 15:09.116
we found out she was pregnant.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.203
The doctor suggested a termination,

15:14.330 --> 15:15.956
but she won't listen.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.043
Says she'll give birth
even if it kills her.

15:20.127 --> 15:23.172
You see, my wife is stubborn.

15:24.173 --> 15:27.176
I've never been able
to change her mind about anything.

15:29.887 --> 15:33.974
We were struggling to find a donor,
and her condition was getting worse.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.728
I borrowed as much money as I could,

15:38.979 --> 15:40.397
but it still wasn't enough.

15:42.483 --> 15:46.278
I was desperate.
Then one of my oldest vendors

15:47.488 --> 15:49.865
heard about my situation
and offered to help.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.368
So I borrowed money from them.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.665
But people saw it as a bribe,

15:58.707 --> 16:01.877
and I got fired from my job.

16:03.587 --> 16:06.131
I had devoted my entire youth to it.

16:09.176 --> 16:13.138
These games were my last hope.

16:17.726 --> 16:18.727
I get it.

16:20.104 --> 16:23.399
I know what
you were trying to say, Mr. 456.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.528
What that money represents.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.491
But Iâ€¦

16:37.287 --> 16:38.914
I really need that money,

16:38.998 --> 16:40.958
even if it's blood money.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.127
I need that moneyâ€¦

16:54.346 --> 16:59.852
to save my wife and our child.

17:20.914 --> 17:21.874
Close up.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.626
Why? Nothing usable?

17:35.012 --> 17:35.888
What the hell?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.933
This is it? Where's the rest?

17:40.017 --> 17:42.019
The organs were not viable.

17:42.102 --> 17:45.022
Dead too long.
Only the eyes were salvageable.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.858
I told you to bring live ones.

17:47.941 --> 17:50.694
What are you talking about?
I missed on purpose.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.281
Someone shot them again
to make sure they died.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.953
That guy too.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.500
He was shot in the leg,
but someone shot him again in the head.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.089
Who's doing this?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.525
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

18:31.485 --> 18:35.155
<i>Sir. Reporting from the operating room.</i>

18:35.239 --> 18:36.615
How did it go?

18:38.992 --> 18:42.704
<i>Most players were shot in the head</i>
<i>or chest and died on the spot.</i>

18:42.788 --> 18:45.749
<i>Someone shot those who were still alive</i>
<i>a second time to confirm the kill.</i>

18:45.833 --> 18:47.751
<i>We only got a few usable products.</i>

18:51.547 --> 18:52.589
Who did that?

18:54.925 --> 18:56.426
Number 011, I think.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.206
Number 011.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.878
Officer wants to see you.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.712
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

20:51.250 --> 20:52.417
You wanted to see me, sir?

20:53.669 --> 20:55.212
Mask off.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.890
I told you not to interfere
if you're not going to help.

21:12.062 --> 21:15.732
I hear you shot them a second time
to make sure they died.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.944
I was just doing my job.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.991
How longâ€¦

21:25.867 --> 21:27.369
have we known each other?

21:27.953 --> 21:29.705
I don't quite remember.

21:29.788 --> 21:30.872
If I remember correctlyâ€¦

21:37.713 --> 21:39.756
it's been about seven years.

21:43.635 --> 21:45.721
When I first went to see you,

21:47.347 --> 21:52.019
you were staring at the ceiling
like a corpse in that cheap hospital room.

21:52.769 --> 21:56.273
I couldn't believe you had taken out
the entire pursuit unit

21:56.356 --> 22:00.235
and made your way
to the demarcation line by yourself.

22:06.783 --> 22:09.161
I felt bad for you.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.417
I wanted to give you a second chance.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.295
I've always been grateful to you.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.672
Then do what I tell you.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.549
I do not wish to.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.304
Are you afraid the captain might find out?

22:29.723 --> 22:31.475
You don't have to worry about that.

22:32.059 --> 22:35.103
We made a mistake last time
and had a player do the operations

22:35.187 --> 22:36.605
in exchange for game info.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.733
This time, we hired a doctor from outside.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.361
So he will never find out,
and even if he does--

22:42.444 --> 22:43.362
It's not about that.

22:43.445 --> 22:44.946
Then what is it about?

23:04.299 --> 23:09.554
When we first met, you said you wanted
to find the child you left behind.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.308
You said you'd do anything.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.147
Did you have a change of heart?

23:22.526 --> 23:25.112
When you first came to me,

23:26.071 --> 23:27.531
you said my job here would be

23:28.990 --> 23:33.495
helping those who feel hopeless
by putting them out of their misery.

23:35.747 --> 23:39.459
I trusted you.
That's what I came here to do.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.672
You're the one who has changed.

23:46.299 --> 23:48.218
Those people are going to die anyway.

23:49.761 --> 23:52.472
We're just using their organs
to save others.

23:53.181 --> 23:54.808
What's wrong with that?

23:55.559 --> 23:59.354
If there are no further orders,
I'd like to be excused.

24:15.745 --> 24:19.124
SEOUL DOBONG POLICE STATION

24:28.675 --> 24:30.635
Hey, Hwang. It's been a while.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.100
Hwang Jun-ho!

24:37.893 --> 24:40.312
You handed in your resignation
without a word to me?

24:40.395 --> 24:42.856
Then you went MIA.
Where the hell have you been?

24:42.939 --> 24:46.443
Do you know how much I had to beg
to change it to a leave of absence?

24:47.027 --> 24:48.945
Chief, are you finished?

24:49.029 --> 24:49.946
What?

24:50.030 --> 24:51.156
Please help me.

24:52.491 --> 24:55.368
Look, what else
could I possibly do for you?

24:55.452 --> 24:57.454
You want me to look
for that island with you?

24:58.038 --> 24:58.872
Yes.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.082
For God's sake.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.335
We must start the search immediately.

25:03.418 --> 25:07.214
Otherwise, Mr. Seong Gi-hun
and everyone else there will be in danger.

25:07.881 --> 25:10.759
Haven't we already finished
discussing this?

25:10.842 --> 25:13.720
Sir, things have changed since then.

25:13.803 --> 25:17.766
If we don't stop them now,
we may not get another chance.

25:17.849 --> 25:18.725
Chief Kim.

25:18.808 --> 25:19.643
Yes, sir.

25:19.726 --> 25:22.896
What's gotten into him this time?
You said he was doing better.

25:24.314 --> 25:27.359
Jun-ho, go back to therapy.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

25:27.442 --> 25:28.485
Sir!

25:29.069 --> 25:31.279
Are you really going to let
those people die?

25:31.363 --> 25:34.574
You've been talking about
this shit for years now!

25:35.158 --> 25:36.826
If it's true, bring me evidence!

25:37.410 --> 25:40.622
The police work with evidence!

25:46.503 --> 25:47.963
Process his resignation.

25:48.046 --> 25:49.589
He's beyond help now.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.132
But, sirâ€¦

25:52.926 --> 25:55.220
Damn it. Hey!

25:55.804 --> 25:59.391
I told you this was a bad idea.
You'll never be able to come back now.

25:59.474 --> 26:04.145
Sir! I'll make sure
he goes back to therapy! Please wait!

26:04.229 --> 26:07.566
See? What did I tell you?
Police are never helpful.

26:08.441 --> 26:12.112
We'll do it ourselves. If we split into
two teams, we might have a chance.

26:12.696 --> 26:16.324
Yeah.
Captain Park got another boat for us,

26:16.408 --> 26:18.159
and we also got more men.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.036
<i>We divided them into two search teams.</i>

26:20.120 --> 26:21.204
Okay, good.

26:21.788 --> 26:24.583
If the games have begun,
we only have five days at most.

26:24.666 --> 26:25.834
We've got to move fast.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.085
Got it.

26:27.168 --> 26:30.046
We're all set to go
once the weather clears up.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.506
I'll see you soon.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.769
Have a drink and relax.
We can't set sail today anyway.

26:50.442 --> 26:53.653
Captain. Are you sure we can go tomorrow?

26:53.737 --> 26:56.573
Tomorrow's weather forecast
isn't looking good either.

26:57.157 --> 26:58.116
Look.

26:59.075 --> 27:00.827
I've been sailing for 30 years.

27:01.578 --> 27:05.498
You think those guys who sit
in front of their computers all day

27:05.582 --> 27:07.083
know the seas better than me?

27:07.167 --> 27:10.795
I'll blame you
if we can't set sail tomorrow, then.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.840
What's the rush?

27:13.923 --> 27:16.217
We've been trying to find
that island for two years.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.552
How will you find it now?

27:17.636 --> 27:22.724
Well, this is a secret,
so I can't really tell you in detail.

27:24.017 --> 27:27.437
But one of our friends
has been taken to that island.

27:30.106 --> 27:31.483
The one who was there before?

27:32.067 --> 27:32.942
What?

27:33.735 --> 27:38.156
Wait, you know about Mr. Seong?

27:39.491 --> 27:41.368
Hwang gave me a rough idea.

27:41.451 --> 27:45.330
All right, then. I can just tell you.

27:46.956 --> 27:51.044
His name is Seong Gi-hun.
He's a previous winner of the game.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.338
He wanted to get back at those bastards,

27:53.421 --> 27:57.050
so he put a GPS tracker in here
and let them take him to the island.

27:57.133 --> 27:59.886
But I don't know how the intel leaked.

27:59.969 --> 28:03.431
So everything Hwang told me was true?

28:03.515 --> 28:04.724
Yeah!

28:04.808 --> 28:08.436
I just helped him look for the island

28:08.520 --> 28:10.605
because I rescued the guy from the water.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.901
But, come on,
I couldn't believe what he was saying.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.486
About the games, the money, and--

28:16.569 --> 28:20.323
Captain, I didn't believe it
at first either.

28:21.116 --> 28:24.035
But they really do exist.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.538
Those masked men. I saw them.

28:26.621 --> 28:29.499
They zapped me with a stun gun at a club.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.252
Masked men with stun guns?

28:32.335 --> 28:33.169
Yeah!

28:33.253 --> 28:37.674
So that's why you brought all those men.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.593
Damn.

28:42.262 --> 28:45.306
They look so intimidating.
Like a bunch of sharks.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.852
We're dealing with
some brutal bastards here.

28:48.935 --> 28:50.937
My boss was looking for them, andâ€¦

28:54.899 --> 28:58.403
Anyway, you're now
in the same boat as us, okay?

28:58.486 --> 29:00.613
We live or die together.

29:01.197 --> 29:02.782
Nobody is going to die.

29:02.866 --> 29:06.286
I've been sailing that boat for ten years.

29:06.786 --> 29:09.122
Never seen any trouble.

29:09.622 --> 29:10.999
No one's even tripped once.

29:13.251 --> 29:15.670
All right. I'll count on you then.

29:18.173 --> 29:21.217
<i>Welcome to your second game.</i>

29:28.600 --> 29:30.351
So the triangle is the easiest one?

29:31.936 --> 29:32.771
Yes.

29:51.247 --> 29:54.542
Hey. How's that a triangle?

29:54.626 --> 29:56.461
Even we Marines couldn't do that!

29:59.297 --> 30:01.758
This is supposed to be the easiest one?

30:01.841 --> 30:03.301
What the heck is that?

30:03.384 --> 30:06.304
This guy is going to get us all killed!

30:06.387 --> 30:07.430
- Hey!
- Iâ€¦

30:07.514 --> 30:11.142
What are you going to do,
take responsibility for this?

30:11.226 --> 30:13.228
You said you won!

30:13.311 --> 30:14.270
You said you've done it!

30:14.354 --> 30:15.855
- No, Iâ€¦
- What are you going to do?

30:15.939 --> 30:17.357
How will you take responsibility?

30:17.440 --> 30:22.111
Do something!

30:22.195 --> 30:23.655
Iâ€¦ I justâ€¦

30:49.722 --> 30:50.765
Look at you.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.436
Jun-hee.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.355
So you really had no clue?

30:58.690 --> 31:00.567
I thought you were just ignoring me.

31:01.401 --> 31:05.154
Well, you've always been self-absorbed.

31:05.238 --> 31:06.990
Why are you here?

31:07.073 --> 31:08.199
Have you forgotten?

31:09.659 --> 31:12.912
You told me to buy that coin too.

31:21.671 --> 31:22.672
Youâ€¦

31:23.381 --> 31:25.800
Oh, you haven't forgotten about this.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.970
You didn't get rid of it? We agreed.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.223
I'm keeping it.

31:32.307 --> 31:35.476
How can you raise a baby
without any money?

31:35.560 --> 31:36.978
I'm going to make money.

31:37.061 --> 31:40.023
I'm going to make money,
pay off my debt, and get a place for us.

31:42.525 --> 31:45.403
This baby has no father,
so its mom needs to make money.

31:45.486 --> 31:47.322
That's why you're here? To make money?

31:48.072 --> 31:50.950
How the hell will you survive here
in your condition?

31:51.034 --> 31:53.620
I'm not going to ask for your help,
so drop the act.

31:54.829 --> 31:56.289
It doesn't suit you.

31:58.833 --> 32:00.084
That's what you came to say?

32:00.168 --> 32:02.879
No, I came to take a look
at your beat-up face.

32:05.757 --> 32:06.758
Serves you right.

32:11.888 --> 32:13.598
<i>Attention, please.</i>

32:13.681 --> 32:17.060
<i>The second game will begin momentarily.</i>

32:17.143 --> 32:21.397
<i>Please follow</i>
<i>the instructions from our staff.</i>

32:21.481 --> 32:23.066
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

32:23.149 --> 32:26.069
- Let's talk about this when we get out.
- <i>The second game willâ€¦</i>

32:29.113 --> 32:30.615
I wanted to leave.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.202
I couldn't, because of you.

32:45.713 --> 32:46.589
Gi-hun.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.841
Triangle.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.136
I'm counting on you, buddy.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.429
Yeah.

33:11.030 --> 33:11.906
What's that?

33:11.990 --> 33:13.366
You don't need to know.

33:14.617 --> 33:16.244
It's time to play the game.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.172
Triangle.

33:53.656 --> 33:57.243
<i>Welcome to your second game.</i>

34:00.747 --> 34:03.416
<i>This game will be played in teams.</i>

34:03.499 --> 34:07.128
<i>Please divide into teams of five</i>
<i>in the next ten minutes.</i>

34:08.296 --> 34:10.089
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

34:10.923 --> 34:13.593
<i>This game will be played in teams.</i>

34:13.676 --> 34:16.804
<i>Please divide into teams of five</i>
<i>in the next ten minutes.</i>

34:16.888 --> 34:19.057
Is <i>Dalgona </i>a team game?

34:19.807 --> 34:22.226
Aren't we playing the <i>Dalgona </i>game?

34:22.852 --> 34:25.646
No, it doesn't look like it.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.190
What's the game then?

34:28.024 --> 34:29.233
I'm not sure.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.819
What? You said you'd done this before.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.322
That triangle was the easiest.
Was that all bullshit?

34:36.282 --> 34:37.325
I'm sorry.

34:37.408 --> 34:38.326
Sorry won't cut it!

34:38.910 --> 34:41.204
You talked like you knew everything.

34:41.287 --> 34:44.123
All these people believed your bullshit.
What are you going to do?

34:44.207 --> 34:45.833
Will you take responsibility?

34:48.127 --> 34:49.587
That's enough.

34:52.048 --> 34:54.175
<i>Please divide into teams now.</i>

34:55.885 --> 34:57.970
Yeah, just drop it.

34:58.054 --> 35:00.181
Don't waste your time
talking to this nutjob.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.934
We shouldn't have fallen for his nonsense.

35:03.017 --> 35:06.938
Jesus. Come on, let's form a team first.

35:08.022 --> 35:09.774
Previous winner? Damn lunatic!

35:09.857 --> 35:12.777
<i>Dalgona</i>? Triangle? Screw you.

35:15.446 --> 35:16.989
How about teaming up with me?

35:17.949 --> 35:19.158
What's going on?

35:20.034 --> 35:23.162
- It's not the <i>Dalgona </i>game?
- No, I don't think so.

35:23.246 --> 35:24.831
What do we do then?

35:25.581 --> 35:26.415
Let's go.

35:26.499 --> 35:27.583
Go where?

35:27.667 --> 35:31.921
We've got to get a move on
if we want to join a good team.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.467
I'm sorry.

35:37.176 --> 35:39.053
I still trust you.

35:41.347 --> 35:45.059
I'd like to play the game with you,
if that's okay?

35:45.143 --> 35:49.230
All right. Let's be real men
and give it a shot.

35:49.313 --> 35:52.817
It's a children's game, right?
We used to play games all the time.

35:53.484 --> 35:57.280
That's right, sirs. I'll join you.

35:58.030 --> 36:00.241
I feel like I can do anything with you.

36:01.450 --> 36:02.618
That's the Marine spirit.

36:03.619 --> 36:06.706
It'd be embarrassing for brave Marines
to be carving <i>Dalgona </i>anyway.

36:06.789 --> 36:09.792
If we're playing a game,
it should be worth risking our lives for.

36:10.293 --> 36:13.129
Like Buck Buck or the Squid Game, right?

36:13.212 --> 36:17.300
Yes! I will certainly
risk my life to win, sir.

36:17.884 --> 36:21.387
We only need one more person then.

36:21.929 --> 36:24.849
Leave it to me, sir. I'll go find someone.

36:24.932 --> 36:28.269
All right, then.
Get someone who'd risk their life to win.

36:28.936 --> 36:30.146
Yes, sir! Victory at all costs!

36:31.189 --> 36:32.190
Go.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.206
Jun-hee.

36:52.668 --> 36:53.753
Let's team up.

36:53.836 --> 36:54.670
No.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.339
You have to join a team.

36:56.422 --> 36:57.423
Not with you.

36:57.506 --> 36:58.925
Stop trying to act tough.

36:59.008 --> 37:01.344
Do you think
anyone would want a pregnant girl?

37:01.427 --> 37:04.055
Mind your own business.
I can take care of myself.

37:04.138 --> 37:05.973
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

37:07.266 --> 37:09.268
But I had a tough time too.

37:09.352 --> 37:12.772
You know that
all those people were out to kill me.

37:12.855 --> 37:16.275
You completely ignored me for six months.
I thought you were dead.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.985
All right, I'm sorry.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.488
Now, let's team up.

37:20.571 --> 37:24.367
You can't have the baby
unless you make it out of here alive.

37:26.535 --> 37:27.662
I don't trust you.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.374
You're dead to me.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.430
Over there. How about him?

37:47.556 --> 37:49.100
- Because he can run fast?
- Yeah.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.310
I told you. It may not be a raceâ€¦

37:52.895 --> 37:54.730
If you need one more person, I couldâ€¦

38:01.320 --> 38:02.697
No, we're good.

38:17.461 --> 38:18.421
Excuse me.

38:23.301 --> 38:26.595
Would you like to team up with me?

38:29.974 --> 38:32.643
- If it's about strength, we've got it, soâ€¦
- Excuse me.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.854
If you need two people, can we join you?

38:35.563 --> 38:38.107
Sure. That'd be great.

38:38.190 --> 38:39.900
Where's the other person?

38:44.030 --> 38:48.075
I'm sorry. You're not the kind
of people we're looking for.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.369
All right.

38:51.370 --> 38:54.540
We'll take you if you ditch the old lady.

38:55.958 --> 38:58.085
The old lady is my mom.

39:03.007 --> 39:05.760
Yong-sik, you should join them.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.636
I'll find a team on my own.

39:07.720 --> 39:11.098
Mom! Don't be ridiculous now.

39:13.809 --> 39:18.064
Mom, why do you look so down?
You're a tough cookie.

39:18.147 --> 39:21.192
Keep your head up.
Let me see that fire in your eyes!

39:21.275 --> 39:24.445
Just be yourself
when you're letting me have it.

39:24.528 --> 39:28.157
You little brat.
How dare you take that tone with me?

39:28.240 --> 39:30.493
- You've got some nerve!
- There you go.

39:30.576 --> 39:32.661
There's my mom.

39:33.162 --> 39:35.247
Look, let's go ask those guys.

39:35.831 --> 39:36.707
I got someone.

39:41.879 --> 39:42.963
What's your name?

39:43.714 --> 39:45.966
It's Park Min-su.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.468
What brought you here?

39:47.551 --> 39:48.636
SeÃ±orita, excuse me?

39:51.430 --> 39:53.015
Let's play the game together.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.477
Well, why should I?

39:56.560 --> 39:57.853
Don't you know who he is?

39:58.396 --> 39:59.647
He's Thanos, the rapper.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.191
<i>I'm gonna kill half of humanity</i>
<i>With my raps</i>

40:02.274 --> 40:05.569
Hang on, a girl?
We don't know what the game is.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.905
I, Thanos the great, will protect you.

40:07.988 --> 40:10.741
Right, Thanos.

40:10.825 --> 40:13.202
So have you got all the Infinity Stones?

40:13.285 --> 40:14.203
Of course.

40:15.454 --> 40:18.791
I'm going to destroy
anyone who gets in my way!

40:20.000 --> 40:22.253
Just stick with me, and you'll be safe.

40:22.336 --> 40:23.421
Okay?

40:24.672 --> 40:27.716
But I already asked someone to join me.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.760
No problem. Who is it?

40:36.100 --> 40:36.934
What's your name?

40:37.935 --> 40:39.270
It's Min-su.

40:39.353 --> 40:41.355
He looks like a freaking dork.

40:42.356 --> 40:44.358
What's up? Nice to meet you, my brother.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.277
Welcome to the Thanos world.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.031
You're cute. Come on.

40:54.118 --> 40:56.829
- Sir! I got someone.
- Yes.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.832
He'll definitely risk his life to win.

40:59.915 --> 41:01.208
Victory at all costs!

41:02.001 --> 41:03.669
Hey, were you in the Marines?

41:03.752 --> 41:06.005
Class 946, sir!

41:06.088 --> 41:09.300
Boy, with three ex-Marines,
we'll be invincible.

41:09.383 --> 41:11.218
What do you think? I like him.

41:12.011 --> 41:13.095
Excuse me.

41:14.513 --> 41:16.140
Please let me join your team.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.101
Sorry, we've already got five people.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.352
Please help me.

41:22.938 --> 41:24.273
I'm pregnant.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.695
Oh, your bellyâ€¦

41:32.656 --> 41:36.452
<i>Team selection will end momentarily.</i>

41:44.251 --> 41:45.586
- Would youâ€¦
- Can weâ€¦

41:46.712 --> 41:49.173
You insolent fools!

41:50.591 --> 41:54.428
You made me come to you
when you should have come to me.

41:55.221 --> 41:58.724
I should just slay you with my knife.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.815
<i>Time for team selection is up.</i>

42:07.775 --> 42:12.821
<i>The game you will be playing</i>
<i>is Six-Legged Pentathlon.</i>

42:12.905 --> 42:16.158
<i>You will start</i>
<i>with your legs tied together.</i>

42:16.242 --> 42:20.996
<i>Each member will take turns playing</i>
<i>a mini-game at every ten-meter mark,</i>

42:21.080 --> 42:24.542
<i>and if you win,</i>
<i>the team can move on to the next one.</i>

42:24.625 --> 42:26.168
<i>Here are the mini-games.</i>

42:26.252 --> 42:28.337
<i>Number one, the </i>Ddakji<i>.</i>

42:28.420 --> 42:30.923
<i>Number two, Flying Stone.</i>

42:31.006 --> 42:33.259
<i>Number three, </i>Gong-gi<i>.</i>

42:33.342 --> 42:35.678
<i>Number four, Spinning Top.</i>

42:35.761 --> 42:38.222
<i>Number five, </i>Jegi<i>.</i>

42:38.305 --> 42:41.100
<i>Your goal is to win all the mini-games</i>

42:41.183 --> 42:45.396
<i>and cross the finish line in five minutes.</i>

42:45.479 --> 42:48.899
- <i>Please decide players for each mini-game.</i>
<i>- </i>You guys pick.

42:50.693 --> 42:52.069
What are you good at?

42:56.448 --> 42:58.367
It's good that we got a woman.

42:59.159 --> 43:00.578
You can play <i>Gong-gi</i>, right?

43:04.540 --> 43:06.667
Don't girls play <i>Gong-gi </i>anymore?

43:07.835 --> 43:09.503
I've never played it.

43:09.587 --> 43:10.421
Right.

43:12.756 --> 43:14.133
Actually,

43:14.216 --> 43:17.177
I can play <i>Gong-gi</i>.

43:18.053 --> 43:19.346
You? An ex-Marine?

43:19.930 --> 43:23.142
I grew up with four older sisters.

43:23.225 --> 43:26.103
I used to play it with them
from time to time.

43:28.063 --> 43:31.317
That's right.
There's nothing a Marine can't do.

43:32.401 --> 43:35.154
Everyone else,
what game are you confident playing?

43:35.904 --> 43:37.197
<i>Ddakji </i>for me<i>.</i>

43:37.281 --> 43:40.576
At the subway station,
I won more times than the guy.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.244
Okay, then.

43:42.911 --> 43:45.414
Miss 222, you can play <i>Ddakji</i>.

43:45.497 --> 43:46.624
I'll play Flying Stone.

43:46.707 --> 43:50.794
I was a pitcher for my baseball team.
I'm good at throwing.

43:51.462 --> 43:53.881
That leaves <i>Jegi </i>and Spinning Top.

43:54.923 --> 43:56.133
Which are you good at?

43:56.216 --> 43:57.259
Well,

43:58.010 --> 43:59.970
I'll play what you pick for me, Gi-hun.

44:01.889 --> 44:03.098
You know my name?

44:05.392 --> 44:10.356
Oh, your friend was calling you
by your name, so I thought I'd try it.

44:11.607 --> 44:12.858
Does it bother you?

44:14.693 --> 44:17.237
No, it's fine.

44:18.364 --> 44:20.824
So, Gi-hun, which are you good at?

44:23.619 --> 44:26.997
I guess I'm better at <i>Jegi</i>.

44:27.081 --> 44:30.376
Then I'll do Spinning Top.

44:31.251 --> 44:33.462
- All right.
- Guys, bring your hands together.

44:34.171 --> 44:35.214
All together now!

44:36.340 --> 44:38.425
On three, we go, "Victory at all costs."

44:38.509 --> 44:39.635
One, two, three.

44:39.718 --> 44:40.844
Victory at all costs!

44:42.179 --> 44:45.099
<i>Teams one and two, get ready.</i>

44:55.818 --> 44:58.737
- Let's go!
- Come on!

44:58.821 --> 45:01.740
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

45:01.824 --> 45:03.200
Let's get it.

45:04.368 --> 45:09.456
- One, two!
- One, two!

45:09.540 --> 45:11.041
- One, two!
- One, two!

45:12.334 --> 45:13.752
Stay calm.

45:19.299 --> 45:20.217
<i>Pass.</i>

45:20.300 --> 45:25.347
- Ready, go! One, two!
- One, two!

45:28.350 --> 45:29.268
<i>Fail.</i>

45:29.351 --> 45:31.937
- One, two!
- One, two!

45:32.020 --> 45:35.274
Throw it! Take your time.

45:35.357 --> 45:37.276
<i>Please do not step over the line.</i>

45:43.365 --> 45:44.408
Shit!

45:45.492 --> 45:46.785
Another stone.

45:47.327 --> 45:48.495
- What?
- What the hell?

45:48.579 --> 45:49.580
- Come on!
- Go!

45:49.663 --> 45:52.791
- Ready, go! One, two!
- One, two!

45:52.875 --> 45:53.709
Get it!

45:55.669 --> 45:57.087
Come on, hurry!

45:59.631 --> 46:03.761
A miss in Flying Stone
will eat up a lot of time.

46:10.851 --> 46:11.685
<i>Pass.</i>

46:12.728 --> 46:17.399
- One, two!
- One, two!

46:17.483 --> 46:20.152
- One, two!
- One, two!

46:20.235 --> 46:22.571
<i>For </i>Gong-gi<i>, you must pass all stages</i>

46:22.654 --> 46:25.866
<i>and catch all five stones at the end.</i>

46:25.949 --> 46:27.534
All five stones at once. Sit.

46:27.618 --> 46:28.744
- Sit.
- Careful.

46:35.501 --> 46:37.294
We don't have time! Hurry!

46:37.377 --> 46:40.380
We can still make it. Stay calm and focus!

46:40.464 --> 46:41.507
- You got this.
- Yeah.

46:41.590 --> 46:42.591
We can still make it.

46:43.509 --> 46:45.177
How can you miss?

46:45.260 --> 46:46.094
Let's go!

46:46.178 --> 46:47.471
- One, two!
- One, two!

46:58.273 --> 47:00.150
- All at once!
- Get them all!

47:04.863 --> 47:05.739
<i>Fail.</i>

47:05.823 --> 47:07.825
<i>- Please start over.</i>
- Dae-ho.

47:07.908 --> 47:10.244
- Practice the flip.
- The flip?

47:13.288 --> 47:17.835
- You can do this! Just relax and throw!
- You can do it!

47:20.087 --> 47:22.256
You son of a bitch!
How could you miss that?

47:22.339 --> 47:24.299
- You said you were good!
- Come on, let's go!

47:24.383 --> 47:26.385
- Come on!
- Goddamnit!

47:26.468 --> 47:29.304
- One, two!
- One, two!

47:31.306 --> 47:32.641
- That's it.
- Okay.

47:33.809 --> 47:35.352
Good. That's it!

47:36.562 --> 47:37.855
- Yes!
- You did it!

47:37.938 --> 47:39.398
- Finish it.
- Finish it.

47:39.982 --> 47:41.859
- Finish it.
- Come on, do it!

47:41.942 --> 47:43.110
Shut up!

47:48.740 --> 47:49.908
She did it!

47:49.992 --> 47:50.826
<i>Pass.</i>

47:55.414 --> 47:56.498
Go!

47:57.624 --> 48:00.586
- Hurry up!
- Come on! We have no time!

48:03.672 --> 48:05.257
Take it easy!

48:05.340 --> 48:07.676
- You can do it!
- Come on!

48:11.638 --> 48:13.390
- <i>Fail.</i>
- It was a hit!

48:14.182 --> 48:15.350
<i>You stepped over the line.</i>

48:16.018 --> 48:17.185
You stepped over the line?

48:17.269 --> 48:21.231
You idiot!
You stepped over the goddamn line!

48:21.315 --> 48:23.650
- We don't have time! We've got to go!
- Damn you!

48:24.651 --> 48:26.403
- Hurry!
- One, two!

48:26.486 --> 48:30.574
- One, two!
- Hurry!

48:42.336 --> 48:43.503
- Shit.
- Come on.

48:43.587 --> 48:44.963
- It's okay.
- We have time.

48:45.047 --> 48:46.298
Calm down. Try again.

48:46.924 --> 48:47.966
Okay.

48:50.093 --> 48:53.388
Please.

48:57.225 --> 49:01.939
Damn you.
You're going to get us all killed.

49:03.357 --> 49:06.234
Damn it. Come on.

49:18.372 --> 49:19.373
- Shit.
- Come on.

49:19.456 --> 49:22.000
- We've got to go!
- Pick it up quickly!

49:22.084 --> 49:23.043
Shit.

49:24.127 --> 49:27.547
- Get it!
- Hurry up!

49:28.590 --> 49:31.718
With Spinning Top,
it'll take even longer if you mess up.

49:38.100 --> 49:40.811
Do you really know how to spin a top?

49:40.894 --> 49:43.897
If you're not confident,
you can switch places with meâ€¦

49:44.690 --> 49:48.527
Only the gods of heaven and earth
decide where I go.

49:48.610 --> 49:50.737
You fools can stay where you are.

49:51.655 --> 49:54.157
Why does this skank
keep talking down to us?

49:55.325 --> 49:57.661
Does she think shamans
are just allowed to be rude?

50:02.332 --> 50:03.250
Hurry.

50:06.378 --> 50:08.171
- I did it!
- <i>Pass.</i>

50:12.092 --> 50:13.093
I did it.

50:14.803 --> 50:16.847
And I didn't step over the line.

50:16.930 --> 50:18.974
You goddamn idiot.

50:19.057 --> 50:20.058
<i>Pass.</i>

50:20.642 --> 50:23.353
- Go!
- Come on!

50:24.354 --> 50:26.314
Come on, let's go.

50:26.857 --> 50:28.608
- Wait.
- No!

50:28.692 --> 50:29.901
- Please!
- No!

50:31.903 --> 50:33.864
<i>Your time is up.</i>

50:51.631 --> 50:53.759
<i>The following players</i>
<i>have been eliminated.</i>

50:53.842 --> 50:57.846
<i>Players 016, 045, 178, 189,</i>

50:57.929 --> 51:03.143
<i>198, 254, 286, 341,</i>

51:03.226 --> 51:06.021
<i>395, and 416.</i>

51:06.938 --> 51:10.525
We should have left!
We're all going to die now!

51:10.609 --> 51:13.820
We're all going to die
because of those who voted to continue!

51:13.904 --> 51:15.822
What are you going to do now?

51:15.906 --> 51:18.575
- You think you can survive?
- Look at them!

51:18.658 --> 51:20.744
- What?
- You killed them.

51:20.827 --> 51:23.622
Can youâ€¦
Can you please give me one of those?

51:24.247 --> 51:25.665
- "Those"?
- The thing you took.

51:25.749 --> 51:28.251
You're keeping them inside your cross.

51:30.045 --> 51:32.339
I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

51:32.422 --> 51:35.550
If I get nervous
and lose the game, we'll all die.

51:36.635 --> 51:39.054
My hands are shaking like crazy.

51:39.137 --> 51:40.931
<i>- Attention, please.</i>
- Nam-su.

51:41.014 --> 51:42.057
- <i>Players.</i>
- It's Nam-gyu.

51:42.140 --> 51:46.394
- Right. Nam-gyu.
- <i>Please wait while we tidy up the venue.</i>

51:47.395 --> 51:48.396
Do you know what this is?

51:48.480 --> 51:51.108
Ecstasy? Ketamine?

51:51.858 --> 51:56.113
It's a new kind. It's fucking crazy, man.
You can't handle it.

51:56.196 --> 51:57.322
Hey.

52:00.033 --> 52:03.703
I did all kinds of stuff
when I was working at the club.

52:03.787 --> 52:08.583
I even brought you some
when you came to the club.

52:14.673 --> 52:16.133
You junkie.

52:23.557 --> 52:24.391
What?

52:25.475 --> 52:26.601
Nothing.

52:28.145 --> 52:29.396
What's your name again?

52:30.355 --> 52:31.898
It's Min-su.

52:31.982 --> 52:32.816
Min-su.

52:33.692 --> 52:36.903
Min-su. What's that famous quote
by Admiral Yi Sun-sin?

52:38.738 --> 52:42.242
"Those seeking life shall croak.
Those seeking death shall live."

52:42.325 --> 52:47.122
So don't be scared. Just tell yourself
that you don't care if you die.

52:47.205 --> 52:50.333
Then we'll survive, win the money,
and get the fuck out.

52:51.793 --> 52:53.879
Hey, mind your own business.

52:54.462 --> 52:55.547
Me?

52:55.630 --> 52:57.757
Yes, you. Mr. Shaky Hands.

52:57.841 --> 52:59.301
What's with the attitude?

53:00.010 --> 53:02.596
We shouldn't have picked a girl.
She's got an attitude.

53:02.679 --> 53:06.057
You're a prick
who had to pop a pill for his nerves.

53:06.141 --> 53:07.058
Fucking bitch.

53:09.519 --> 53:11.438
<i>Attention, please.</i>

53:11.521 --> 53:16.693
<i>Players, please wait</i>
<i>while we tidy up the venue.</i>

53:52.479 --> 53:53.480
Open it.

53:56.566 --> 53:57.859
That's an order.

54:03.698 --> 54:05.784
Please don'tâ€¦

54:27.514 --> 54:30.433
<i>The next teams, please get ready.</i>

54:44.322 --> 54:45.448
Look at me.

54:47.200 --> 54:49.160
I'm Hyun-ju. Cho Hyun-ju.

54:50.328 --> 54:51.371
What's your name?

54:52.872 --> 54:54.040
It's Young-mi.

54:55.041 --> 54:57.627
Kim Young-mi.

55:00.672 --> 55:05.176
Young-mi, when you spoke to me earlier,
I could tell right away.

55:05.969 --> 55:07.929
I could tell how brave you are.

55:09.097 --> 55:12.017
So you've got to believe in yourself.

55:13.768 --> 55:14.644
Can you do that?

55:17.856 --> 55:19.190
I'll try.

55:20.400 --> 55:25.905
That's right. I, Jang Geum-ja,
survived the Korean War.

55:25.989 --> 55:29.117
I will not die playing some kids' games.

55:30.410 --> 55:33.788
Everyone.
Let's pull ourselves together and do this.

55:34.456 --> 55:37.667
I'm the son of Ms. Jang Geum-ja,
who survived the Korean War.

55:38.293 --> 55:39.669
I'm Park Yong-sik.

55:42.172 --> 55:43.882
Ma'am, what's your name?

55:46.134 --> 55:47.052
I'm Seon-nyeo,

55:48.553 --> 55:49.679
shaman of the sea.

55:55.810 --> 55:58.355
I believe we can do this.

55:59.147 --> 56:01.941
Let's show everyone else here

56:03.401 --> 56:07.113
that these games are no big deal.

56:11.159 --> 56:15.497
<i>- Teams three and four, get ready.</i>
- Dear gods of heaven and earthâ€¦

56:17.415 --> 56:23.588
Dear gods of heaven and earth,
please guide me through this trialâ€¦

58:48.942 --> 58:53.947
