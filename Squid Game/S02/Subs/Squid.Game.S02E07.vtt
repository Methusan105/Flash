01:04.272 --> 01:06.316
You motherfucker!

01:06.399 --> 01:07.525
Fuck!

01:10.570 --> 01:13.948
Motherfucker! Fucking X bastard!

01:14.491 --> 01:15.450
Damn you!

01:19.412 --> 01:21.664
Fuck you! You fucking loser!

01:21.748 --> 01:23.792
- You fucker!
- Fucking asshole! Die!

SQUID GAME 2

02:05.875 --> 02:09.921
EPISODE 7
FRIEND OR FOE

02:19.139 --> 02:21.933
<i>The following players</i>
<i>have been eliminated.</i>

02:22.016 --> 02:25.854
<i>Players 230, 268,</i>

02:25.937 --> 02:31.317
<i>299, 331, and 401.</i>

02:32.026 --> 02:33.570
<i>End of list.</i>

03:07.770 --> 03:08.855
What's going on?

03:22.285 --> 03:24.245
Listen, Team O!

03:24.329 --> 03:25.872
We…

03:26.664 --> 03:28.291
When we were in the bathroom,

03:28.374 --> 03:33.213
those fucking X bastards
tried to kill all of us!

03:33.296 --> 03:36.049
They killed some of us,
including my friend--

03:36.132 --> 03:38.051
Bullshit.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.386
You're the ones who started it.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.554
Damn it.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.767
They threatened one of the people
on our side!

03:45.850 --> 03:48.436
They attacked us to win the second vote!

03:48.519 --> 03:49.354
That's right!

03:49.437 --> 03:50.271
Hey.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.274
You killed one of us first.

03:53.775 --> 03:57.111
You were trying to win the vote
by killing us!

03:57.195 --> 03:59.948
Fuck you. You killed some of us too.

04:00.031 --> 04:02.909
Did you think we would
just let you kill the rest of us?

04:04.577 --> 04:05.453
So?

04:06.788 --> 04:08.706
Which side lost more people?

04:12.335 --> 04:13.336
What?

04:13.878 --> 04:18.258
All right, everyone!
Let's count the numbers!

04:18.341 --> 04:21.886
Yeah, that's right!
Let's count ourselves! Come on down!

04:21.970 --> 04:25.265
Everyone! Gather round!

04:25.348 --> 04:28.559
We need everyone down here! Come on!

04:28.643 --> 04:31.271
- Get down here now!
- Gather round!

04:31.354 --> 04:32.647
- Come on!
- Get down here!

04:32.730 --> 04:35.650
- Gather round!
- Form a line!

04:35.733 --> 04:39.737
- Please come down!
- Form a line!

05:21.529 --> 05:23.072
- Captain?
- Huh?

05:24.907 --> 05:26.784
What are you doing here?

05:27.368 --> 05:29.537
Oh, well…

05:31.497 --> 05:32.915
Isn't that my drone?

05:33.708 --> 05:36.210
What? Oh, this?

05:36.294 --> 05:39.714
Well, I was looking for something
because I couldn't sleep,

05:39.797 --> 05:41.549
and I just stumbled across it.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.471
Did you do something?

05:47.513 --> 05:50.183
No, I was just looking.

05:50.266 --> 05:53.811
I'm fascinated by
how this thing can fly in the sky.

05:53.895 --> 05:57.398
All right. I'm done now.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.816
It's so fascinating.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.070
You reek of alcohol.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.988
Go get some sleep now, okay?

06:08.242 --> 06:09.077
Stop!

06:11.245 --> 06:12.080
Who are you really?

06:13.915 --> 06:14.957
You son of a bitch!

06:31.182 --> 06:32.141
Who's there?

06:35.436 --> 06:37.855
Choi, is that you?

06:38.439 --> 06:39.690
It's me, Captain Park.

06:42.026 --> 06:45.571
Captain, I thought you were asleep.
What are you doing out here?

06:45.655 --> 06:46.948
It's pouring down.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.784
I couldn't sleep.
I was tossing and turning,

06:49.867 --> 06:51.577
then I heard some noise.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.162
I heard it too.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.873
I think I heard someone scream
and some thuds after that.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.418
That's why I came out to take a look.

06:58.501 --> 07:02.797
I think it was the waves hitting the deck.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.215
Look at the mess.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.468
Oh, you're right.

07:09.178 --> 07:12.765
It's dangerous out here in the rain.
Go back inside and get some sleep.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.310
The boat's rocking so much.
I can't really sleep.

07:16.394 --> 07:20.440
Still, you've got to wake up early.
Try to get some sleep.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.484
Or you'll be exhausted tomorrow.

07:37.832 --> 07:42.462
41, 42, 43, 44, 45,

07:43.129 --> 07:44.547
46,

07:45.381 --> 07:46.549
47.

07:50.386 --> 07:51.888
Three dead.

07:52.847 --> 07:53.764
Are you sure?

07:53.848 --> 07:55.099
I counted three times.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.309
What about them?

07:58.019 --> 08:03.858
42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.153
Two people died on our side.

08:07.737 --> 08:11.866
Two out of five.
That means they lost three people.

08:13.242 --> 08:16.913
Then we have a better shot
at winning the vote tomorrow.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.376
Hey, it's 48 against 47.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.379
As long as we don't change our minds,
we'll win by one vote!

08:25.463 --> 08:26.631
Yes!

08:26.714 --> 08:29.217
- We'll win.
- We can get out of here tomorrow.

08:32.136 --> 08:37.308
<i>Attention, please.</i>
<i>Lights out in 30 minutes.</i>

08:37.391 --> 08:41.771
<i>All players, please return to your beds</i>
<i>and prepare for bedtime.</i>

08:41.854 --> 08:43.731
Listen. You cannot change your minds.

08:44.315 --> 08:48.277
We have to win the second vote
and get out of here tomorrow. All right?

08:48.361 --> 08:51.197
Don't worry. We're determined to get out.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.325
That's right.
We really have to get out now.

08:54.408 --> 08:55.952
Yes, let's do this.

08:56.035 --> 08:59.622
All right.
Let's go to sleep now, shall we?

09:31.445 --> 09:32.863
The delivery team has set out.

09:33.656 --> 09:34.782
How are the goods?

09:35.825 --> 09:37.368
<i>In top condition this time.</i>

09:39.495 --> 09:40.413
And Number 011?

09:40.496 --> 09:43.708
That bitch is behaving.
Won't be a problem anymore.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.668
Keep watching her carefully.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.378
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

09:58.639 --> 09:59.890
Get ready.

10:05.688 --> 10:09.400
<i>The special game will begin momentarily.</i>

10:09.900 --> 10:13.237
<i>Managers, soldiers, and workers,</i>

10:13.321 --> 10:17.033
<i>please move to your designated locations.</i>

10:18.034 --> 10:20.369
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

10:20.453 --> 10:24.040
<i>The special game will begin momentarily.</i>

10:24.624 --> 10:28.169
<i>Managers, soldiers, and workers,</i>

10:28.252 --> 10:31.964
<i>please move to your designated locations.</i>

10:41.807 --> 10:44.352
<i>Lights out in 20 minutes.</i>

10:45.061 --> 10:49.273
<i>All players, please prepare for bedtime.</i>

10:53.277 --> 10:55.446
Those bastards are acting suspicious.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.782
It looks like they're up to something.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.202
Whatever those idiots do,
once we win the vote tomorrow,

11:01.285 --> 11:02.870
it'll all be over.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.163
You think we'll be okay?

11:04.747 --> 11:08.376
They say things were really crazy
in the bathroom earlier.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.296
Once the lights go out,

11:13.798 --> 11:16.050
people on the other side will attack us.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.260
Really?

11:18.928 --> 11:23.683
Because if they kill us, they'll be able
to win the vote and increase the prize.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.185
So what do we do?

11:27.353 --> 11:28.646
Let's attack them first.

11:31.982 --> 11:36.779
They're probably thinking
we'll just wait for the second vote.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.782
We can use it to our advantage.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.159
We'll attack them first
once the lights go out.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.162
That's right.
It'd be better to attack them first.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.581
We have more women
and elderly on our side.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.042
If we get attacked,
we'll be at a disadvantage.

11:50.918 --> 11:54.422
Attacking them first
would give us a better chance of winning.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.674
- I agree.
- We can't do that.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.178
But we have to get out of here.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.306
You said it yourself.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.309
Staying calm won't get us anywhere now.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.688
That doesn't mean
we should kill each other.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.191
That's exactly what they want us to do.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.485
"They"?

12:20.489 --> 12:22.283
The ones who created this game.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.745
The ones who watch us play.

12:26.620 --> 12:30.541
If we're going to fight someone,
it should be them.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.881
Where are they?

12:42.136 --> 12:43.262
Up there.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.477
On the upper levels

12:49.560 --> 12:52.563
are the rooms they control the games from.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.941
The man in the black mask is their leader.

12:56.942 --> 13:00.696
Once we capture him, we'll be able to win.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.327
How are you going to fight them?

13:08.954 --> 13:10.372
They have guns.

13:15.503 --> 13:20.007
<i>All armed soldiers,</i>
<i>please move to your designated locations.</i>

13:20.758 --> 13:24.887
<i>The special game will begin momentarily.</i>

13:26.847 --> 13:28.474
We'll fight them with guns too.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.268
But we don't have any.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.313
We'll take their guns.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.529
From those masked men?

13:45.366 --> 13:46.450
That's too dangerous.

13:47.618 --> 13:51.163
Even if we manage to take a few guns,
we'll still be outnumbered.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.623
What then?

13:53.207 --> 13:57.962
Are you going to kill each other all night
and hope you survive?

13:59.713 --> 14:03.259
Is that what you want, Young-il?

14:08.013 --> 14:09.139
Do we…

14:10.599 --> 14:11.725
stand a chance?

14:12.309 --> 14:14.061
We do if we catch them off guard.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.772
Out of everyone,

14:16.856 --> 14:20.317
they're the ones
who would least expect us to attack first.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.319
This is

14:23.529 --> 14:28.617
our last chance
to end these games once and for all.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.747
How are you going to take their guns?

14:37.293 --> 14:40.963
Once the fight begins tonight,

14:43.382 --> 14:44.967
we'll have our chance.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.394
<i>Lights out in five minutes.</i>

15:10.993 --> 15:13.454
Thanos, that fucking asshole.

15:13.537 --> 15:16.999
That son of a bitch
treated me like a fucking idiot.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.370
Myung-gi.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.917
When the lights go out, hide.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.380
No matter what happens, don't do anything.

16:07.675 --> 16:08.509
Okay.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.680
And wipe that blood off.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.400
<i>Lights out in ten seconds.</i>

16:25.275 --> 16:26.235
<i>Ten,</i>

16:26.318 --> 16:27.277
<i>nine,</i>

16:27.361 --> 16:28.320
<i>eight,</i>

16:28.404 --> 16:29.321
<i>seven,</i>

16:29.405 --> 16:30.364
<i>six,</i>

16:30.447 --> 16:31.323
<i>five,</i>

16:31.407 --> 16:32.324
<i>four,</i>

16:32.408 --> 16:33.325
<i>three,</i>

16:33.409 --> 16:34.326
<i>two,</i>

16:34.410 --> 16:35.285
<i>one.</i>

16:55.431 --> 16:57.516
<i>Once the lights go out,</i>

16:57.599 --> 17:00.853
<i>get under the bottom beds quietly.</i>

17:01.937 --> 17:07.359
<i>You must not get caught</i>
<i>by those planning to attack us.</i>

17:23.709 --> 17:25.044
Shut up!

17:27.087 --> 17:28.005
Die!

18:20.057 --> 18:24.228
We have to hide until the fight ends.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.731
Don't get caught up in the fight.

18:28.398 --> 18:32.820
But that would put people on our side
at quite a disadvantage.

18:34.029 --> 18:38.158
Without us in the fight,
they'll be outnumbered.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.076
I know.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.288
But if we fight with them

18:43.997 --> 18:46.625
and some of us end up dead or injured,

18:46.708 --> 18:48.836
it will ruin our entire plan.

18:49.628 --> 18:54.341
We can't beat those bastards
with a lower headcount.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.968
Are you suggesting that

18:57.219 --> 18:59.805
we make a small sacrifice
for the greater good?

19:04.601 --> 19:06.353
If we miss this opportunity,

19:07.813 --> 19:09.940
the sacrifice will be even greater.

19:12.776 --> 19:15.070
Even if it takes a sacrifice…

19:16.155 --> 19:19.283
we must put an end to this game now.

19:25.539 --> 19:26.832
In that case,

19:28.417 --> 19:30.210
I'm with you.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.894
<i>The fight won't last long.</i>

19:47.477 --> 19:50.647
<i>Because if all of us end up hurt or dead,</i>

19:50.731 --> 19:53.734
<i>there can't be a next game,</i>
<i>and they wouldn't want that.</i>

20:18.759 --> 20:19.885
Se-mi.

20:20.844 --> 20:22.554
You fucking bitch.

20:28.685 --> 20:29.811
Fuck!

20:32.981 --> 20:34.274
You goddamn bastard!

20:36.985 --> 20:38.570
You fucking bitch!

20:41.531 --> 20:43.617
You think you're better than me?

21:04.888 --> 21:05.931
Suppress!

21:06.014 --> 21:07.307
<i>Prepare.</i>

21:08.350 --> 21:09.184
<i>Suppress.</i>

21:10.435 --> 21:11.770
<i>Once the lights come on,</i>

21:11.853 --> 21:16.858
<i>the soldiers will come</i>
<i>to settle the situation.</i>

21:17.526 --> 21:19.111
Hands up. Get back.

21:19.194 --> 21:21.113
<i>They'll try to break up the fight first.</i>

21:21.196 --> 21:22.197
Drop your weapon. Hands up.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.075
<i>They won't pay attention to the dead.</i>

21:27.577 --> 21:30.789
<i>- They will scan our trackers…</i>
- Check the IDs of the dead.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.833
<i>…to identify us.</i>

21:39.506 --> 21:41.633
<i>That'll be our window.</i>

21:44.636 --> 21:45.637
Dae-ho!

22:52.120 --> 22:54.122
Have everyone retreat and close the gate.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.543
<i>Retreat.</i>

23:14.601 --> 23:17.479
Stop! Hold fire!

23:18.772 --> 23:20.190
Everyone, hold fire!

23:22.067 --> 23:23.110
Hands above your head!

23:25.445 --> 23:26.405
On your knees!

23:28.573 --> 23:30.200
You goddamn bastards!

23:31.159 --> 23:32.202
No!

23:32.786 --> 23:36.748
Move! Do you not see this?

23:36.832 --> 23:39.126
They are not human.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.795
They're like goddamn vermin
blinded by money!

23:45.132 --> 23:47.884
This is not what we took these guns for.

23:48.593 --> 23:52.556
If we do this, we'll be no different
from those masked men.

24:04.776 --> 24:05.861
Everyone!

24:07.195 --> 24:08.947
Don't be scared.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.074
Gather round, please!

24:11.158 --> 24:12.909
It's okay to come out.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.871
We're not trying to hurt you!

24:16.746 --> 24:21.001
- Get the guns and ammo from the dead.
- Come on! I have something to say!

24:29.426 --> 24:31.344
Gather all soldiers.

24:33.054 --> 24:38.685
<i>All soldiers, please move</i>
<i>to the assembly point with your weapons.</i>

24:39.186 --> 24:40.979
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

24:41.062 --> 24:46.610
<i>All soldiers, please move</i>
<i>to the assembly point with your weapons.</i>

25:08.298 --> 25:09.257
Everyone.

25:11.051 --> 25:11.885
We will now

25:13.136 --> 25:17.474
head up to the masked men's headquarters.

25:18.642 --> 25:21.311
We'll capture the ones who captured us,

25:21.394 --> 25:23.063
put an end to this game,

25:23.939 --> 25:25.565
and make them pay.

25:28.443 --> 25:30.779
Anyone who knows how to use a gun

25:32.239 --> 25:35.742
and wishes to join us,
please step forward.

25:56.596 --> 25:57.514
Hey.

25:59.307 --> 26:00.809
I know you're scared.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.396
I'm scared too.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.690
But this may be

26:07.732 --> 26:11.069
our last chance
to make it out of this place alive.

26:12.654 --> 26:13.947
Fight with us

26:15.240 --> 26:16.575
so we can go home together.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.077
All together.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.375
I'll fight with you.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.085
Come on.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.046
I'll join you too.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.006
Come join us.

27:06.291 --> 27:09.210
Please check your guns and ammo.

27:10.253 --> 27:12.213
Let's take one radio each.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.425
We'll use channel 7, the lucky number.

27:22.390 --> 27:23.391
Thank you for earlier.

27:27.604 --> 27:30.899
You can buy me a soju when we get out.

27:41.576 --> 27:42.577
Attention.

27:44.287 --> 27:46.748
This is the MP5, a submachine gun.

27:47.374 --> 27:50.919
First, if you press this lever
in the middle and pull the magazine,

27:51.002 --> 27:52.837
it comes off like this.

27:52.921 --> 27:56.591
If the selector switch is down,
it's set to full auto mode.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.259
Up is single-fire mode.

27:58.343 --> 28:03.306
We don't have many magazines,
so set it to single-fire mode.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.767
Lastly, insert the magazine,

28:05.850 --> 28:08.436
pull the handle, and then release it.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.439
That's how you load it. Are we clear?

28:11.523 --> 28:12.941
- Yes.
- Yes.

28:16.319 --> 28:18.655
How do you know so much about guns?

28:21.449 --> 28:24.661
I was a sergeant first class
in the ROK Special Forces.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.209
Take it off.

28:43.179 --> 28:44.514
Take that off too.

28:51.354 --> 28:52.647
Good God.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.359
Do your parents know
what you're doing here?

29:01.990 --> 29:04.701
Take us to your captain.

29:51.164 --> 29:55.710
<i>All players, it is bedtime now.</i>

29:55.794 --> 29:59.631
<i>Please return to your quarters</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

29:59.714 --> 30:04.177
<i>Otherwise,</i>
<i>you will be eliminated from the game.</i>

30:04.803 --> 30:06.387
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

30:07.305 --> 30:09.641
<i>All players, it is bedtime…</i>

30:09.724 --> 30:13.144
I think I'll be hearing this voice
in my dreams. Don't you?

30:13.228 --> 30:16.439
<i>Please return to your quarters</i>
<i>immediately. Otherwise…</i>

30:19.025 --> 30:19.984
Get down!

30:30.328 --> 30:32.455
One o'clock!

30:34.249 --> 30:35.708
Cover me!

30:35.792 --> 30:37.168
Cover!

31:08.658 --> 31:09.993
Hold fire!

31:10.076 --> 31:11.369
Hold fire!

31:11.911 --> 31:12.829
Hold fire!

31:18.293 --> 31:20.753
Is everyone okay?

31:20.837 --> 31:22.505
- Yes.
- Yes, I'm okay!

31:22.589 --> 31:24.841
All right, then. Let's go up!

31:44.027 --> 31:46.863
Do not let them get close
to the management area.

32:14.307 --> 32:15.683
How much farther?

32:19.395 --> 32:20.980
Is this the right way?

32:23.066 --> 32:26.653
The entrance to the management area
is around that corner.

32:27.695 --> 32:29.530
The control room is right above it.

32:30.949 --> 32:31.783
Move it, then.

32:31.866 --> 32:32.992
Wait.

32:34.702 --> 32:35.870
What are you doing?

32:35.954 --> 32:37.830
I need my mask to pass security.

33:24.419 --> 33:26.421
I'll go look for the management area!

33:26.504 --> 33:28.631
Will you be able to find it?
Should I come?

33:28.715 --> 33:30.508
I'll go with Jung-bae.

33:30.591 --> 33:32.885
I need you to buy us some time!

33:34.178 --> 33:35.722
Jung-bae, let's go.

33:40.268 --> 33:41.185
Wait up!

34:04.125 --> 34:05.001
Here!

34:07.378 --> 34:10.631
Don't waste your ammo like that!
You'll quickly run out!

34:36.240 --> 34:37.533
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

34:56.594 --> 34:58.930
Why did you have to bring me
instead of Young-il?

34:59.013 --> 35:01.766
Because you're my friend.

35:03.059 --> 35:05.019
You only say that when you're in a jam.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.231
We're in the management area.

35:08.856 --> 35:10.566
<i>We'll make our way up.</i>

35:46.394 --> 35:48.521
They have magazines in their pockets.

36:03.494 --> 36:04.787
Which way should we go?

36:07.957 --> 36:09.667
The way they came.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.180
Guard the stairs to the control room!

37:15.608 --> 37:18.694
This isn't getting us anywhere!
Let's follow them to the upper level!

37:21.072 --> 37:23.950
We might get surrounded
if we move together without a plan!

37:25.284 --> 37:28.829
Let's wait until
they find the control room!

38:07.535 --> 38:09.829
Everyone! Check your magazines!

38:11.247 --> 38:12.707
I'm down to half.

38:13.374 --> 38:14.834
I've got less than half.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.377
Same!

38:16.460 --> 38:17.920
I've got two-thirds left.

38:18.004 --> 38:19.213
I'm almost out!

38:20.298 --> 38:21.424
Mine is empty!

38:24.010 --> 38:25.136
I'm almost out too!

38:28.222 --> 38:30.224
<i>Young-il, Dae-ho. Can you hear me?</i>

38:31.559 --> 38:32.727
Go ahead!

38:32.810 --> 38:34.895
I think we're right below
the control room!

38:34.979 --> 38:38.024
But we need backup and more ammo.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.443
We're running out of ammo too!

38:40.526 --> 38:44.071
There should be spare magazines
in the soldiers' pockets in our quarters.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.614
Go get them!

38:45.698 --> 38:46.699
Got it!

38:47.491 --> 38:51.078
Did you hear that? They need backup!

38:51.162 --> 38:54.540
Three of us will go,
and the rest will stay!

38:54.623 --> 38:57.168
Join us once you get the magazines!

38:57.251 --> 38:58.377
Who wants to go with me?

38:58.461 --> 38:59.462
I'll go!

38:59.545 --> 39:00.379
Me too!

39:00.463 --> 39:01.380
Let's go!

39:06.135 --> 39:08.304
I'll go get the magazines!

39:08.387 --> 39:11.682
I'll come back as soon as I can,
so just hold on until then!

39:11.766 --> 39:12.975
Hyun-ju!

39:13.934 --> 39:15.019
I'll go!

39:22.234 --> 39:24.362
I… I'm out of ammo.

39:24.445 --> 39:25.905
Do you know the way?

39:25.988 --> 39:27.281
Yes.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.743
We destroyed the cameras on the way.
Follow them.

39:30.826 --> 39:31.744
Okay.

39:32.787 --> 39:36.248
Take this. You might run into
the masked men on the way.

39:36.957 --> 39:37.792
Thank you.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.752
I'll cover you. Go!

39:40.544 --> 39:41.462
Cover him!

40:06.529 --> 40:11.367
Magazines in pockets.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.205
<i>Dae-ho.</i>

40:16.288 --> 40:19.333
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
<i>Where are those magazines?</i>

40:20.835 --> 40:23.546
Yes, brother. I'm on my way to get them.

40:23.629 --> 40:25.548
All right, Dae-ho! We're counting on you!

40:26.715 --> 40:29.802
Yes, you can count on me, brother!
I'll be there soon!

40:36.475 --> 40:38.394
Jung-bae, cover me.

40:38.477 --> 40:39.645
What are you going to do?

40:39.728 --> 40:40.688
Get their magazines.

40:40.771 --> 40:42.314
No, that's too dangerous.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.191
I'm almost out of ammo.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.277
If they notice, they'll close in on us.

40:46.360 --> 40:49.738
We need more magazines
to hold out until Dae-ho gets here.

41:48.923 --> 41:50.216
Gi-hun, hurry up!

41:57.598 --> 41:59.016
Hurry up and get back here!

42:10.444 --> 42:12.238
Magazines…

42:12.321 --> 42:14.532
Magazines…

42:15.741 --> 42:18.244
Magazines in pockets.

42:25.793 --> 42:26.877
What's up with him?

42:28.128 --> 42:29.171
I'm not sure.

42:34.969 --> 42:37.638
Dae-ho, what happened?

42:38.347 --> 42:40.266
Why are you back by yourself?

42:40.349 --> 42:41.267
Magazines.

42:41.767 --> 42:46.021
Get the magazines
from those bastards' pockets. Hurry!

42:46.105 --> 42:47.314
Oh, okay.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.068
Are you all right?

42:52.486 --> 42:54.196
I'm fine. It's just a graze.

42:54.280 --> 42:57.241
If you die before me, I'll kill you.

42:57.324 --> 42:59.451
Don't worry. I'll be sure to outlive you.

43:01.912 --> 43:04.873
Gi-hun! Did you find the control room?

43:04.957 --> 43:07.710
I think it's right up there,
but we can't go this way.

43:07.793 --> 43:09.712
I want you to find another way.

43:09.795 --> 43:12.006
I did a quick scan of the layout here.

43:12.089 --> 43:14.091
I'm sure there's a way to go around them.

43:14.174 --> 43:17.094
I want you guys
to keep their focus on you.

43:17.177 --> 43:18.470
We'll hit them from behind.

43:18.554 --> 43:19.471
Okay.

43:19.972 --> 43:20.889
Wait.

43:20.973 --> 43:23.726
Here, take this.

43:23.809 --> 43:25.269
You're going to need it.

43:26.562 --> 43:27.730
Are you sure?

43:29.773 --> 43:31.650
Dae-ho will be back with more.

43:45.664 --> 43:47.416
This was all we could find.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.628
Damn it, what's taking him so long?

44:34.713 --> 44:36.215
Do you think he got lost?

44:36.298 --> 44:37.508
Dae-ho, can you hear me?

44:38.550 --> 44:40.219
Where are you? Can you hear me?

44:41.136 --> 44:43.931
<i>Did you find the magazines?</i>
<i>Are you on your way?</i>

44:44.682 --> 44:46.767
<i>Dae-ho, answer me.</i>

44:49.436 --> 44:52.690
<i>Dae-ho, are you there?</i>

44:54.525 --> 44:57.361
<i>Dae-ho, please answer me!</i>

44:58.195 --> 45:00.114
Dae-ho! Answer me!

45:00.197 --> 45:03.617
We can't hold out much longer.
We need those magazines now.

45:03.701 --> 45:06.203
Something must've happened.
I'll go down and check.

45:07.079 --> 45:07.913
Please do.

45:09.289 --> 45:10.416
Cover me!

45:39.737 --> 45:42.197
Gi-hun, we found it.

45:42.281 --> 45:44.992
<i>Start attacking and draw their attention.</i>

45:45.075 --> 45:46.618
Then we'll hit them from behind.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.370
Okay, got it!

46:52.935 --> 46:56.188
<i>Young-il, what's going on?</i>
<i>Are you attacking?</i>

47:05.113 --> 47:06.323
Gi-hun, I'm sorry.

47:07.825 --> 47:08.909
<i>It's all over.</i>

47:10.410 --> 47:11.787
<i>They got us too.</i>

47:13.163 --> 47:16.959
Young-il, what happened?
Are you all right?

47:25.467 --> 47:26.426
<i>Young-il.</i>

47:27.886 --> 47:29.596
<i>Young-il! Answer me!</i>

47:31.515 --> 47:32.683
<i>Young-il!</i>

47:37.729 --> 47:39.898
Young-il!

47:41.233 --> 47:42.442
Young-il!

47:48.699 --> 47:49.908
Start wrapping things up.

48:02.796 --> 48:05.716
Dae-ho!

48:05.799 --> 48:07.968
Dae-ho, where are you? Dae-ho!

48:13.974 --> 48:15.058
Dae-ho!

48:19.271 --> 48:20.314
Dae-ho.

48:21.773 --> 48:22.774
What happened?

48:24.026 --> 48:26.028
I'm sorry.

48:26.612 --> 48:27.446
The magazines?

48:29.031 --> 48:31.909
I'm sorry.

48:32.826 --> 48:33.827
I'm…

48:37.664 --> 48:38.874
I'm sorry.

48:41.418 --> 48:43.045
I'm sorry.

48:48.634 --> 48:49.718
Get down on the floor!

49:00.896 --> 49:01.730
No.

49:07.069 --> 49:08.403
You can't die like this.

49:20.165 --> 49:22.000
They're moving!

49:24.211 --> 49:25.671
They're coming this way!

49:41.561 --> 49:42.980
We should retreat.

49:44.147 --> 49:45.774
This side is blocked as well.

49:52.197 --> 49:56.076
<i>All players, it is bedtime now.</i>

49:56.827 --> 49:58.996
<i>Please return to your quarters.</i>

49:59.579 --> 50:03.000
<i>Otherwise you will be eliminated</i>
<i>from the game.</i>

50:03.083 --> 50:04.167
No. Don't!

50:04.793 --> 50:06.503
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

50:07.796 --> 50:12.259
<i>All players, it is bedtime now.</i>

50:12.342 --> 50:15.095
<i>Please return to your quarters.</i>

50:15.178 --> 50:16.263
<i>Otherwise…</i>

50:16.346 --> 50:17.931
Let's surrender.

50:18.807 --> 50:20.225
We need to survive somehow.

50:29.317 --> 50:30.652
<i>Advance team, do you copy?</i>

50:31.778 --> 50:33.363
<i>We're out of ammo.</i>

50:34.239 --> 50:35.449
<i>We're surrendering.</i>

50:55.135 --> 50:56.094
Please don't kill--

51:04.686 --> 51:06.021
Please don't kill me.
