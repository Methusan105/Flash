00:18.059 --> 00:20.437
- One, two.
- One, two.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.527
Go. Get it.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.946
All right, throw it hard.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.574
<i>Fail.</i>

00:32.657 --> 00:34.993
Come on, again. Smash it!

00:36.202 --> 00:37.203
<i>Fail.</i>

00:37.996 --> 00:39.831
All right.

00:41.666 --> 00:42.625
<i>Fail.</i>

00:44.544 --> 00:46.796
What are you doing?
Pick it up and throw it!

00:50.800 --> 00:52.177
Hang on, Young-mi.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.096
Try it with the other side.
The other side.

00:57.807 --> 01:00.477
Go. Here we go.

01:01.686 --> 01:02.562
<i>Pass.</i>

01:03.188 --> 01:04.564
Great job.

01:04.647 --> 01:08.026
- Yes! All right!
- You did it!

01:08.109 --> 01:10.361
- Well done. Let's go.
- Thank God!

01:10.445 --> 01:12.155
Ready, go!

01:15.116 --> 01:17.243
I can't watch. It's making me anxious.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.291
Okay.

01:29.798 --> 01:30.632
There.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.512
- I'm sorry!
- It's okay.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.098
All right, we'll go pick it up.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.274
All right, now walk backwards.

01:50.610 --> 01:54.322
We could save some time
walking backwards like that.

01:54.405 --> 01:56.574
They're actually faster going backwards.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.201
All right.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.081
Here we go. Come on.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.624
Yong-sik, look.

02:04.707 --> 02:09.212
Imagine the stone is the face
of the crook who scammed you.

02:12.507 --> 02:16.719
That asshole ruined my fucking life!

02:17.762 --> 02:18.596
<i>Pass.</i>

02:18.680 --> 02:20.306
Way to go!

02:22.433 --> 02:24.310
They can do it.

03:04.225 --> 03:06.102
Old hag! What are you doing--

03:07.395 --> 03:11.399
You said you played <i>Gong-gi</i>
with bullets during the Korean War.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.680
Mom, just imagine

03:42.764 --> 03:46.392
the stone is Dad's mistress' face.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.566
Rotten bitch!

04:01.157 --> 04:02.742
<i>- Pass.</i>
- She did it! Go!

04:06.412 --> 04:07.622
Dad!

04:08.373 --> 04:10.250
All right. Ready?

04:15.213 --> 04:17.548
Hurry! One, two!

04:30.395 --> 04:33.147
You have to wrap it around the axle first.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.024
I know.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.288
Don't look at the clock. We've got time.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.045
Are you sure you've done this before?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.547
Stop talking to me.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.802
Take it easy.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.804
- Take it easy.
- Shut her up!

05:07.682 --> 05:09.934
God, it's taking too long.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.687
No, she should do it like…

05:12.770 --> 05:16.024
Dear gods of heaven and earth,
please have mercy on me.

05:16.816 --> 05:20.194
Dear gods of heaven and earth,
please have mercy on me.

05:21.571 --> 05:25.116
Dear gods of heaven and earth,
please have mercy on me.

05:25.199 --> 05:27.410
Dear gods of heaven and earth,
please have mercy on me.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.328
Dear…

05:33.583 --> 05:36.210
The gods of heaven and earth
have abandoned us.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.422
- She's completely out of it.
- She can't be.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.506
They've abandoned us.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.759
Am I going to die here?

05:42.842 --> 05:44.469
Get yourself together.

05:44.552 --> 05:45.845
We're all going to die--

05:50.683 --> 05:52.310
If you give up,

05:52.393 --> 05:54.395
I will kill you before your gods do.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.442
Hurry up.

06:00.234 --> 06:01.486
Hurry!

06:18.586 --> 06:19.504
<i>Pass.</i>

06:26.219 --> 06:27.387
- Go!
- Come on!

06:27.470 --> 06:30.348
- Hurry.
- One, two!

06:39.190 --> 06:40.274
Hurry!

06:41.692 --> 06:44.028
<i>You must kick the </i>jegi <i>five times.</i>

06:44.112 --> 06:45.238
Please, look away.

06:45.321 --> 06:46.406
- What?
- Please.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.033
- Yeah, all right.
- You guys too.

06:50.284 --> 06:53.204
Don't look! Turn around, guys!

07:00.837 --> 07:02.171
<i>One.</i>

07:04.215 --> 07:05.216
<i>Two.</i>

07:06.884 --> 07:07.718
<i>Three.</i>

07:08.428 --> 07:10.179

07:15.017 --> 07:19.480

SQUID GAME 2

08:25.463 --> 08:28.382
EPISODE 5
ONE MORE GAME

08:40.019 --> 08:41.145
You motherfucker!

08:41.229 --> 08:44.148
…two, three, four, five!

08:53.366 --> 08:56.744
One, two, three, four, five!

10:23.956 --> 10:26.334
<i>Last teams, get ready.</i>

10:37.428 --> 10:40.014
It's a little sad that
we have no audience, isn't it?

10:41.432 --> 10:42.767
Hey, are you scared?

10:43.559 --> 10:44.435
No, sir!

10:46.145 --> 10:50.191
It's quiet and easier to focus
without anyone watching.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.402
Guys!

10:54.070 --> 10:57.406
We'll see you again at the finish line!
Victory at all costs!

10:57.490 --> 10:59.659
Yes! We'll see each other again!

10:59.742 --> 11:01.994
- Yes, thank you!
- We'll see you again!

11:02.078 --> 11:03.412
- That's right!
- Good luck!

11:03.996 --> 11:06.040
All right. Let's get ready.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.337
I believe in our team.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.966
Plus, we have the previous winner with us.

11:30.606 --> 11:31.565
We're here.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.948
<i>- Pass.</i>
- You did it!

11:39.031 --> 11:40.116
Ready, go!

11:50.543 --> 11:51.377
Okay.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.462
Let's get this done the first time!
I believe in you!

11:53.546 --> 11:56.006
When I played baseball,
my pitches might've been slow,

11:56.632 --> 11:58.592
but I had flawless ball control.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.348
- Yes! You did it!
- <i>Pass.</i>

12:04.432 --> 12:05.433
Ready, go!

12:08.686 --> 12:10.354
I knew you could do it!

12:10.438 --> 12:11.897
Let's stay calm!

12:15.901 --> 12:16.777
All right.

12:21.282 --> 12:24.410
Dae-ho, stay calm. Even if you mess up…

12:49.185 --> 12:50.352
<i>Pass.</i>

12:51.061 --> 12:53.731
That was amazing! Dae-ho, my boy!

12:53.814 --> 12:55.691
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go!

12:55.775 --> 12:57.109
Ready, go!

12:59.528 --> 13:01.280
We've got plenty of time!

13:03.657 --> 13:05.075
You're expecting, so be careful.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.799
There's no rush. Take your time.

13:20.508 --> 13:23.052
Damn, we might get through everything
on the first attempt.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.359
It's okay, we've got enough time.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.528
Let's go pick it up. Ready, go.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.322
No fun passing everything without a hitch.

13:43.405 --> 13:47.660
That's right.
You can't grow without failure, right?

13:48.369 --> 13:50.246
Now backwards. Ready, go.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.004
- God.
- All right.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.507
It's okay. Just stay calm.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.511
Excuse me.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.477
<i>Fail.</i>

14:15.229 --> 14:16.856
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's…

14:16.939 --> 14:19.984
Let's go pick it up. All right, let's go.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.238
You sure you did this a lot as a kid?

14:24.822 --> 14:26.949
Throwing it backwards, now that's a skill.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.918
Get up.
Are you taking a break or something?

14:38.752 --> 14:41.463
Now forward. Ready, go!

14:44.133 --> 14:45.217
Hang on.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.427
Let me do this.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.347
What the hell is the problem?

14:50.431 --> 14:52.433
Stay calm, okay?

14:56.687 --> 14:58.731
Don't rush it. No!

14:59.815 --> 15:00.941
- Damn it!
- <i>Fail.</i>

15:04.653 --> 15:07.740
- We still have time--
- What the hell is wrong with me?

15:11.368 --> 15:14.997
You goddamn idiot! You're an idiot!

15:16.624 --> 15:18.792
No one is blaming you!

15:18.876 --> 15:21.420
All right. Take a deep breath, okay?

15:22.504 --> 15:25.633
Try to remember the times
when you had fun playing this.

15:25.716 --> 15:26.926
Now, deep breaths.

15:29.637 --> 15:32.431
Deep breaths. Calm down.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.267
It's okay.

15:35.351 --> 15:39.021
Take your time, okay? Stay calm.

15:39.897 --> 15:40.731
All right.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.663
Let's go! Ready, go!

15:57.915 --> 15:59.166
How are you holding up?

16:03.295 --> 16:04.129
Are you okay?

16:10.386 --> 16:11.553
Okay, move.

16:14.348 --> 16:19.186
One, two, three, four…

16:26.068 --> 16:27.611
You did it!

16:29.780 --> 16:32.658
<i>- Pass.</i>
- Let's go!

16:32.741 --> 16:33.826
Ready, go!

16:33.909 --> 16:35.953
One, two! Quickly!

16:37.705 --> 16:38.706
We're almost there!

16:46.296 --> 16:48.340
- We did it!
- Well done!

16:55.222 --> 16:57.099
<i>The following players</i>
<i>have been eliminated.</i>

16:57.641 --> 17:01.145
<i>Players 135, 239,</i>

17:01.228 --> 17:05.149
<i>263, 415…</i>

17:10.487 --> 17:12.906
Fuck, way too many are still alive.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.411
Hey.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.290
How many do you think are left?

17:21.373 --> 17:22.583
Sorry?

17:22.666 --> 17:27.838
How many roaches
do you think we have left in here?

17:32.843 --> 17:35.387
About 200.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.722
How do you know?

17:36.805 --> 17:38.265
What are you, an AI bot?

17:39.183 --> 17:40.225
Go count them.

17:40.809 --> 17:41.894
Now?

17:43.020 --> 17:44.563
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.318
Why do you want to count them?
Are you stupid?

17:50.444 --> 17:52.905
The masked men will come and tell us soon.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.406
Shut up, bitch.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.324
Stop it.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.787
- What's your name again?
- It's Min-su.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.080
How old are you?

18:01.663 --> 18:03.207
I'm 27.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.000
So you were born in 1997.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.711
Why do you treat him like he's your boss?

18:07.795 --> 18:09.004
He's the same age as you.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.007
- Nam-su, isn't that right?
- It's Nam-gyu.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.052
- Yes, Nam-gyu. Isn't that right?
- Yes.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.179
You're the same age.
Treat him like a friend.

18:17.262 --> 18:20.057
We'll work better as a team that way.
Okay?

18:21.141 --> 18:21.975
How old are you?

18:22.059 --> 18:23.310
Born in 1998.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.229
You?

18:25.312 --> 18:26.188
Born in 1996.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.066
It's settled.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.654
Gyeong-su is the youngest,
you're the same age, and you're older.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.866
Hey, call her <i>noona </i>since she's older.

18:40.327 --> 18:41.245
Do it.

18:43.914 --> 18:44.748
<i>Unnie</i>.

18:47.042 --> 18:48.836
Can I ask you something?

18:50.546 --> 18:51.421
Yes.

18:52.131 --> 18:56.343
How did you know it'd be easier
to flip the <i>ddakji </i>with the other side?

19:00.764 --> 19:05.477
I used to play <i>Ddakji</i>
with my friends when I was a kid.

19:06.228 --> 19:09.773
And that was my secret trick.

19:10.941 --> 19:11.984
I see.

19:12.067 --> 19:15.821
Listen, can I ask you something too?

19:15.904 --> 19:16.738
Yes.

19:17.322 --> 19:22.327
When you were playing <i>Jegi</i>,
how come you didn't want us to look?

19:22.870 --> 19:23.829
Oh.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.583
Well, I…

19:28.208 --> 19:31.378
Are you shy?

19:31.962 --> 19:33.463
It's not that.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.800
I'm just not completely done.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.303
What do you mean?

19:39.386 --> 19:42.764
Mom, stop asking questions.
You're being nosy.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.600
It's all right.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.853
I still have some procedures left.

19:49.146 --> 19:53.025
I just didn't want people to stare at me.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.484
What procedures?

19:57.571 --> 20:01.700
Oh, so that's how
you got yourself those too?

20:02.576 --> 20:04.828
Of course. I knew they were too big--

20:04.912 --> 20:06.246
Mom, please!

20:06.330 --> 20:08.081
I'm so sorry.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.921
What? We have more survivors?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.840
It's that nutjob's team.

20:17.925 --> 20:22.221
Goddamnit. There's going to be a big drop
in the prize money they add.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.515
- That young lady made it.
- Who?

20:25.599 --> 20:27.643
The tiny young lady.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.645
They don't seem so happy to see us.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.400
That sweet old lady.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.653
I miss my mom.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.334
<i>The day's work has been completed.</i>

20:52.417 --> 20:56.797
<i>All soldiers,</i>
<i>please proceed to your quarters.</i>

21:27.160 --> 21:32.165
I thought you'd be a total freak,
but you actually have a decent face.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.917
North Korean girls are pretty.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.169
What the hell is this?
You're breaking the rules.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.046
Rules, my ass.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.674
You should've steered clear
if you weren't going to help.

21:40.757 --> 21:42.384
I'm going to report this.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.389
To whom? The officer?

21:48.015 --> 21:50.892
How long do you think he'll protect you?

21:50.976 --> 21:52.853
He's already cut you loose.

21:56.481 --> 21:59.359
Do you want me
to explain it to you in detail?

22:00.402 --> 22:02.279
The situation you're in right now?

22:16.877 --> 22:19.212
Fuck. You damn commie.

22:22.966 --> 22:25.510
Shall I ruin your face?

22:28.221 --> 22:31.600
Or shall I cut your fingers off
so you can't pull the trigger anymore?

22:36.229 --> 22:37.356
Last warning.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.317
If you get in our way again,

22:40.901 --> 22:44.571
I will cut off all your fingers
and throw them in the incinerator.

22:45.489 --> 22:47.115
And play with you a little too.

23:07.803 --> 23:10.138
I'm sorry about earlier, everyone.

23:10.847 --> 23:11.890
No, it's okay.

23:11.973 --> 23:12.849
Don't be.

23:12.933 --> 23:17.020
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have made the last kick.

23:20.023 --> 23:22.567
Player 222, are you feeling all right?

23:23.151 --> 23:24.111
Yes.

23:25.445 --> 23:28.740
Thank you all
for letting me be on your team.

23:29.658 --> 23:33.161
She smashed that <i>ddakji</i>
and flipped it on her first try.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.080
That was impressive.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.332
She did great, even while carrying a baby.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.168
We were lucky she joined our team.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.879
What about your Flying Stone play?

23:42.963 --> 23:44.881
You hit it with one shot.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.926
With an underhand pitch at that. Bam!

23:49.177 --> 23:51.346
You were like Kim Byung-hyun.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.766
And you? Was <i>Gong-gi</i>
the only game you ever played?

23:56.351 --> 23:59.271
I could barely see your hand.
It was like a martial arts movie.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.731
I'm the only son for two generations.

24:01.815 --> 24:04.818
My mom only let me play at home
with my sisters.

24:04.901 --> 24:08.029
And yet they let their precious son
join the Marines?

24:10.115 --> 24:14.077
My father's idea,
he wanted me to be more of a man.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.496
He fought in the Vietnam War, you see.

24:17.914 --> 24:19.583
- He sounds like a great man.
- Yeah.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.293
Was he a Marine too?

24:21.376 --> 24:24.671
Yeah, well…
Would you excuse me for a moment?

24:26.673 --> 24:30.343
Listen. Perhaps we should learn
each other's names.

24:30.427 --> 24:34.556
I still don't know your names, gentlemen.
Or yours, Miss.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.727
I'll start. I'm Kang Dae-ho.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.812
"Dae" means "big," "ho" means "tiger."

24:41.688 --> 24:43.231
"Big tiger." Cool name.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.442
My name is Park Jung-bae.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.861
"Righteous" and "twice."

24:47.944 --> 24:50.906
My parents wanted me
to be twice as righteous.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.033
My name is Kim Jun-hee.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.036
I don't know what it means though.

24:56.995 --> 25:00.707
Jun-hee. When you get out of here,
go see a doctor right away.

25:00.790 --> 25:04.336
You've been under a lot of stress.
You need to get yourself checked out.

25:04.419 --> 25:05.670
Okay.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.672
I'm Oh Young-il.

25:07.756 --> 25:08.715
- "Young-il"?
- Yes.

25:10.050 --> 25:12.511
"Young-il" sounds like "zero one,"
and that's my number.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.138
Easy to remember.

25:15.222 --> 25:17.724
Oh, that's true! Your name is your number.

25:18.725 --> 25:21.853
Oh, Gi-hun. What's your last name?

25:21.937 --> 25:24.648
My name is Seong Gi-hun.

25:24.731 --> 25:25.899
- I see.
- Seong Gi-hun.

25:25.982 --> 25:28.235
"Seong" literally means "last name."

25:44.084 --> 25:49.589
Congratulations to all of you
for making it through the second game.

25:49.673 --> 25:54.719
Here are the results of the second game.

26:26.251 --> 26:30.255
In the second game,
110 players were eliminated.

26:30.839 --> 26:33.883
The prize money accumulated
up to this point is 20.1 billion won.

26:33.967 --> 26:36.344
Since there are 255 players remaining,

26:36.428 --> 26:41.474
each person's share is 78,823,530 won.

26:41.558 --> 26:42.934
Wait, what?

26:43.018 --> 26:46.271
It's still under 100 million?
It's not even 80 million.

26:47.606 --> 26:51.693
Only 110 people died? Is that all?

26:51.776 --> 26:54.279
Did you count them right?

26:54.362 --> 26:57.824
That's all? But you shot all those people!

26:57.907 --> 27:00.118
- It was more than that!
- Count them again!

27:00.201 --> 27:03.913
Fuck. I almost died twice,
and that's all I get?

27:05.040 --> 27:08.293
I'd get more money than that
if I let somebody beat me up!

27:08.376 --> 27:12.047
I completely understand
your disappointment.

27:12.130 --> 27:17.427
However, we always keep the door open
for you to pursue new opportunities.

27:18.428 --> 27:23.808
You will now take a vote to decide
whether to continue the games or not.

27:33.568 --> 27:39.449
Whether to continue the games
for a bigger prize or to stop here

27:39.532 --> 27:42.410
is entirely your choice.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.913
Please feel free

27:44.996 --> 27:49.417
to exercise your right to choose
in a democratic manner.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.589
- Yong-sik.
- Yeah?

27:54.673 --> 27:56.383
If we go home today,

27:57.425 --> 28:00.387
let's have kimchi stew.
I'll make it with some aged kimchi.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.597
With a lot of pork, right?

28:03.348 --> 28:04.808
I suddenly feel hungry.

28:04.891 --> 28:08.144
Listen, I think it's more than
a coincidence that we met here.

28:08.937 --> 28:14.025
If we get out, I'd like to invite you
to our house for a meal.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.694
We'll grill some pork belly.

28:18.446 --> 28:19.531
Would that be okay?

28:19.614 --> 28:21.700
Absolutely!

28:21.783 --> 28:26.830
We live in a small place, but there is
enough space for four people to eat.

28:26.913 --> 28:29.749
There's space for you to lie down.
You can sleep over.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.880
<i>Unnie</i>, are you coming?

28:49.102 --> 28:51.479
By the way, where do you all live?

28:51.563 --> 28:54.065
We live in Bongcheon-dong.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.484
Really? I live in Sillim-dong.

28:56.568 --> 28:59.779
Goodness, we're practically neighbors!

28:59.863 --> 29:01.990
What about you, Hyun-ju?
Do you live in Seoul?

29:02.574 --> 29:04.117
I live in Gwangmyeong.

29:04.200 --> 29:07.704
My! That's only a 30-minute bus ride away.

29:07.787 --> 29:09.956
I'm surprised we all live
so close together.

29:10.039 --> 29:13.418
We must have a special connection.
This is amazing.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.017
Don't worry.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.144
I want to stop here too.

29:31.895 --> 29:35.440
I should go and be with my wife
at the hospital.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.613
I'm telling you. We'll get out this time.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.282
Damn it.

29:45.074 --> 29:47.827
A Marine should think strategically
and know when to retreat.

29:48.578 --> 29:49.829
Isn't that right, brother?

29:51.080 --> 29:52.916
Yeah, you're right.

29:52.999 --> 29:57.128
Marines aren't invincible.
We should get out.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.589
We have to end the games here.

30:00.548 --> 30:03.635
I will help you guys out when we get out.

30:05.011 --> 30:07.806
Please trust me and support this vote.

30:08.389 --> 30:11.810
Guys, all huddle up again.

30:17.273 --> 30:19.734
- In 1, 2, 3. Victory at all costs!
- Victory at all costs!

30:23.696 --> 30:27.283
This time,
the vote will begin with Player 001.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.869
Player 001, please cast your vote.

30:50.181 --> 30:51.516
Player 006.

31:03.027 --> 31:03.903
Player 007.

31:06.781 --> 31:07.866
Excuse me.

31:07.949 --> 31:08.783
Yong-sik.

31:10.326 --> 31:12.203
Don't get any foolish ideas.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.331
If we put our money together,

31:16.416 --> 31:18.251
it'd be over 150 million.

31:18.334 --> 31:21.087
We'll pay off your debt with it

31:21.170 --> 31:25.758
and use the rest to open
a produce store or something. Okay?

32:28.321 --> 32:30.865
Hurry up! Are you doing a goddamn ritual?

32:34.202 --> 32:35.328
Shut your mouth!

33:02.313 --> 33:03.272
Don't betray us.

33:03.856 --> 33:04.691
What?

33:05.858 --> 33:07.568
- This.
- Player 048.

33:07.652 --> 33:11.280
We all agreed
to play one more game, right?

33:12.407 --> 33:13.241
Yeah.

33:59.912 --> 34:01.497
Player 125.

34:27.607 --> 34:28.691
Player 126.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.696
Excuse me.

34:33.780 --> 34:34.655
Everyone!

34:34.739 --> 34:36.240
Are you all out of your minds?

34:38.785 --> 34:43.081
You still want to keep going
after watching all those people die?

34:44.415 --> 34:46.584
Who's to say you won't die
in the next game?

34:50.296 --> 34:51.422
We have to stop.

34:52.173 --> 34:53.633
We'll all die if we keep going!

34:54.675 --> 34:57.345
Come to your senses,
and leave with that money.

34:58.554 --> 35:01.682
You've got to survive first,
or there won't be a next step.

35:02.642 --> 35:06.437
What do you think
we can do with a mere 70 million?

35:08.022 --> 35:11.776
I don't know how much you owe,
but for most people here,

35:11.859 --> 35:16.239
that doesn't even cover 10% of their debt.

35:16.322 --> 35:17.573
Am I right?

35:18.407 --> 35:20.326
There's no next step for us!

35:20.409 --> 35:22.245
That money won't change anything!

35:22.328 --> 35:24.747
- Yes, he's right!
- That's right!

35:24.831 --> 35:28.209
With that amount of money,
I won't last long.

35:28.709 --> 35:31.254
It was 25 million after the first game,

35:31.337 --> 35:33.422
and now it's 78 million!

35:33.506 --> 35:37.885
After one game,
the amount more than tripled!

35:37.969 --> 35:40.638
If we play one more game,

35:41.556 --> 35:46.144
the prize will be at least 240 million!

35:46.227 --> 35:48.479
But I can't do this anymore.

35:50.106 --> 35:51.190
Please.

35:52.608 --> 35:55.111
Please let me out of here.

35:56.362 --> 35:57.488
I really…

35:58.948 --> 36:01.951
I really want to go home.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.121
I don't want to die.

36:09.584 --> 36:10.835
Young lady.

36:12.128 --> 36:16.007
You're young, so you'd probably have
another chance.

36:17.800 --> 36:18.885
But I don't.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.720
Please.

36:20.803 --> 36:24.015
My family and I have no future.

36:25.558 --> 36:28.769
My business failed,
and now I owe over 500 million.

36:28.853 --> 36:32.398
I've got to make
at least half of that here

36:33.482 --> 36:35.651
if I want a real shot at a fresh start.

36:35.735 --> 36:36.861
What if you die?

36:37.403 --> 36:40.865
If you die here, your family
won't even get your body.

36:41.574 --> 36:45.494
Then it'd be the end
for you and your family!

36:46.954 --> 36:49.290
- Don't you see?
- Don't get fucking scared!

36:50.875 --> 36:53.920
<i>Ddakji</i>, Red Light, Green Light,
Spinning Top!

36:54.545 --> 36:57.048
It's not like the games
are that difficult.

36:58.007 --> 36:58.841
Look.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.594
There are still 255 players.

37:01.677 --> 37:04.680
Way more than half of us survived!

37:04.764 --> 37:08.851
We've made it this far,
so let's do this one more time!

37:08.935 --> 37:12.063
You make such a good point, young man.

37:12.146 --> 37:13.648
That's right!

37:13.731 --> 37:18.986
We've all played the games well
and are still standing!

37:19.070 --> 37:22.198
Now, let's play one more game!

37:22.281 --> 37:27.078
Just one more, and that's it.
Let's play just one more game!

37:27.161 --> 37:28.829
Yeah, let's play one more game!

37:28.913 --> 37:30.248
One more game!

37:30.331 --> 37:35.253
- One more game!
- One more game!

38:24.218 --> 38:28.139
The results are 139 for O and 116 for X.

38:28.222 --> 38:34.186
Based on the majority vote,
we'll proceed to the third game tomorrow.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.771
Thank you.

39:25.279 --> 39:26.197
Thank you.

39:28.491 --> 39:29.325
Thank you.

39:44.173 --> 39:45.132
<i>Noona.</i>

39:48.469 --> 39:50.388
Aren't you scared?

39:50.471 --> 39:51.305
Scared of what?

39:52.390 --> 39:54.475
Playing more games.

39:57.311 --> 39:58.187
I am scared.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.858
Then why do you want to continue?

40:07.655 --> 40:09.740
Because if I go out now,

40:10.908 --> 40:12.827
I'll have to face even scarier things.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.043
Don't call me <i>noona</i>.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.462
I'm younger than you,
but don't tell those jerks.

40:31.554 --> 40:34.807
Mom. Are you angry?

40:34.890 --> 40:36.892
Don't call me "Mom," you damn fool.

40:38.102 --> 40:42.731
Mom. I'm sorry,
but I can't go home with just that.

40:49.738 --> 40:50.781
What do you mean?

40:53.159 --> 40:55.536
I have a little more debt.

40:59.832 --> 41:00.708
How much?

41:01.667 --> 41:03.294
About 100 million.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.841
I borrowed it from loan sharks
and the gambling den.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.760
If I don't pay them back by next month,

41:13.053 --> 41:14.138
I'll be in huge trouble.

41:15.598 --> 41:20.478
They said they'd take and sell
my eyes, liver, and kidneys.

41:21.061 --> 41:22.688
I know they'll actually do it.

41:22.771 --> 41:26.317
That's why
I haven't been able to come home.

41:28.152 --> 41:30.905
Just one more game.

41:30.988 --> 41:33.032
Next time, I promise I'll vote to leave.

41:33.115 --> 41:35.784
After one more game,
I'll be able to pay off all my debts.

41:35.868 --> 41:37.786
We'll make a fresh start then. Okay?

41:39.330 --> 41:41.540
Yong-sik. "Next time"?

41:42.708 --> 41:44.210
"Fresh start"?

41:47.671 --> 41:51.926
What if one of us gets killed before that?

41:53.344 --> 41:54.678
I know…

41:55.804 --> 41:58.766
maybe you'd be fine without me.

42:02.102 --> 42:04.939
But if something happens to you…

42:08.317 --> 42:12.655
I wouldn't have a reason to live,
even if I make it out of here.

42:14.740 --> 42:16.617
Why would you say such a thing?

42:16.700 --> 42:19.537
We'll get through this together.

42:26.502 --> 42:27.336
Brother!

42:29.797 --> 42:30.965
Brother Jung-bae!

42:33.133 --> 42:35.302
Man…

42:37.054 --> 42:39.223
Hey, just come back here.

42:39.306 --> 42:42.226
- No, I'm good here.
- Oh, come on.

42:42.309 --> 42:44.770
- But… Hey.
- All right.

42:44.853 --> 42:46.772
You should've gone farther away then.

42:46.855 --> 42:50.025
It bugs me seeing you
sitting there all pathetic.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.198
I'm sorry.

42:58.325 --> 42:59.702
Jun-hee, Young-il. I'm sorry.

43:02.454 --> 43:03.455
Gi-hun, I'm sorry.

43:05.958 --> 43:07.751
I borrowed some emergency cash,

43:07.835 --> 43:10.421
and the creditors are harassing
my ex-wife and kid.

43:10.504 --> 43:13.048
If I play one more game,

43:13.132 --> 43:15.259
I think I'll be able to settle my debt.

43:15.342 --> 43:16.802
- So--
- Jung-bae.

43:16.885 --> 43:19.680
You of all people shouldn't have done it.

43:21.015 --> 43:22.433
It's not twice as righteous.

43:26.145 --> 43:29.898
But, looking at the results,
even if you had voted against,

43:30.482 --> 43:32.276
we would still have been outvoted.

43:32.359 --> 43:35.696
Right? It's not entirely my fault.

43:35.779 --> 43:36.989
All right. To be honest,

43:38.490 --> 43:40.743
I understand why you did it.

43:41.577 --> 43:44.830
The money isn't enough for me either,
so when I went up to vote,

43:45.623 --> 43:47.791
I did think about playing one more game.

43:47.875 --> 43:48.709
You did?

43:48.792 --> 43:50.002
I said I get it.

43:51.211 --> 43:53.005
Thank you for understanding.

43:53.839 --> 43:57.176
But I voted in favor
partly because I feel confident.

43:57.259 --> 43:59.595
We did so well as a team, didn't we?

44:00.220 --> 44:04.099
If we stick together one more time,
I'm sure we'll be fine. Jun-hee.

44:04.808 --> 44:06.727
I'll make sure we survive the next game--

44:06.810 --> 44:07.853
"The next game"?

44:09.730 --> 44:10.981
In the next game,

44:11.899 --> 44:14.068
we might have to kill each other.

44:16.654 --> 44:19.198
Gi-hun, that's a bit much.

44:20.240 --> 44:25.037
There's nothing we can do now,
so let's try to stay positive.

44:25.120 --> 44:29.541
We should eat, pull ourselves together,
and try our best again.

44:30.542 --> 44:34.129
Here, Jun-hee. You can have mine too.
Hang in there until the next game.

44:34.963 --> 44:36.632
- No, it's okay.
- Take it.

44:36.715 --> 44:39.385
I don't drink plain milk.

44:43.555 --> 44:44.723
Thank you.

44:44.807 --> 44:46.058
Have my bread too.

44:46.141 --> 44:47.851
I don't deserve to eat.

44:49.186 --> 44:50.729
I'll take your milk then.

45:03.701 --> 45:06.120
It wasn't just me.

45:06.203 --> 45:10.082
Oh, look. See?
I'm not the only one who voted in favor--

45:16.588 --> 45:18.382
Hyun-ju, why did you do it?

45:18.882 --> 45:21.593
We said we were all going
to get together at my house.

45:21.677 --> 45:24.179
Why did you change your mind?

45:24.263 --> 45:28.142
I wouldn't think you'd have
gambling debts like my son.

45:29.351 --> 45:33.647
Is it because of the surgery?
Does it cost that much?

45:37.067 --> 45:39.611
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

45:40.696 --> 45:42.906
I can't even keep
my own child under control,

45:42.990 --> 45:47.202
so who am I to tell you anything?

45:54.877 --> 45:55.711
I…

46:00.174 --> 46:02.676
Everything was fine
until I told people who I really am.

46:04.178 --> 46:06.722
People would look at me strangely,

46:07.765 --> 46:09.600
but I never had any big issues.

46:11.810 --> 46:12.644
But…

46:14.688 --> 46:17.149
once I told people
I wanted to live as a woman

46:18.275 --> 46:19.735
and started transitioning,

46:21.195 --> 46:22.529
everything changed.

46:29.703 --> 46:31.163
My mom cried a lot.

46:33.123 --> 46:34.875
And my father stopped talking to me.

46:37.920 --> 46:41.632
I got fired from my job,
and lost all my friends.

46:43.425 --> 46:45.677
I wasn't done with
the treatment and procedures,

46:47.429 --> 46:50.390
but I wasn't earning any money,
so my debt kept piling up.

46:51.183 --> 46:52.976
Although I felt liberated,

46:54.394 --> 46:55.312
my life…

46:57.189 --> 46:58.690
became so much harder.

46:58.774 --> 47:00.150
Oh, dear.

47:01.944 --> 47:06.949
Well, what did you do for work before?

47:08.909 --> 47:09.827
I was in the army.

47:13.455 --> 47:17.209
If you make money here, then what?

47:17.292 --> 47:18.877
Do you have a plan?

47:20.170 --> 47:22.256
I think I'm going to move to Thailand.

47:22.339 --> 47:23.257
Thailand?

47:23.841 --> 47:27.928
I want to play just one more game.
If I win the money…

47:30.138 --> 47:33.809
I'll finish my transition there
and buy a small house.

47:35.102 --> 47:36.812
I want to start a new life there.

47:36.895 --> 47:38.856
I've been to Thailand before.

47:38.939 --> 47:41.984
There are a lot of people
like Hyun-ju over there.

47:42.067 --> 47:46.780
They're hotter and more beautiful
than most women,

47:46.864 --> 47:49.992
and you see them everywhere.
Isn't that right?

47:50.075 --> 47:54.663
Yeah. I hear a lot of them
are really beautiful.

47:56.081 --> 47:57.958
You're beautiful too, <i>unnie</i>.

48:11.430 --> 48:14.975
I don't know if I could say "beautiful,"

48:15.893 --> 48:17.769
but I've spent some time with you now,

48:19.646 --> 48:21.481
and I think you look fine.

48:22.274 --> 48:24.359
You said she was unsightly.

48:26.653 --> 48:27.571
Hey.

48:41.418 --> 48:43.086
You traitor.

48:43.170 --> 48:46.256
How can you take a piss
under these circumstances?

48:49.384 --> 48:53.013
Just finish. You'll get an infection
if you stop mid-stream.

49:07.653 --> 49:09.696
Were you really trying to get out?

49:09.780 --> 49:11.657
What can you even do with 70 million?

49:13.158 --> 49:15.369
That's not even enough to pay me back.

49:16.954 --> 49:18.747
You need to pay me back, and also

49:19.539 --> 49:22.250
compensate for the damage
you did to my soul.

49:22.334 --> 49:24.252
How many times do I have to tell you?

49:24.336 --> 49:26.588
That coin's price did go up.

49:26.672 --> 49:28.674
You held out for more cash
but didn't sell at the right time.

49:28.757 --> 49:31.093
And I have the freedom
to decide if I want to leave.

49:31.176 --> 49:33.303
I don't care for your fucking tone.

49:33.387 --> 49:36.223
Hey, should I just rip his mouth off?

49:36.306 --> 49:38.058
You have the freedom?

49:38.809 --> 49:40.435
- You don't have such a thing.
- Goddamnit.

49:40.519 --> 49:43.063
You're my slave until you pay me back.

49:43.146 --> 49:44.606
My slave.

49:44.690 --> 49:47.776
So you have to keep playing
the games until the end.

49:47.859 --> 49:48.860
And who knows?

49:50.195 --> 49:52.072
You might win the entire prize alone.

49:53.198 --> 49:55.784
<i>Then I will get my money back</i>

49:55.867 --> 49:59.538
<i>And you will get your happiness back</i>

50:00.122 --> 50:03.000
If I won the prize alone,
that'd mean you're dead.

50:03.500 --> 50:05.752
Why would I pay you back if you were dead?

50:06.753 --> 50:09.089
How do you even remember your lyrics?

50:09.756 --> 50:11.216
Oh, right.

50:11.758 --> 50:13.760
You forgot the lyrics
in the show's finale.

50:14.344 --> 50:16.722
You son of a bitch. Got a death wish?

50:16.805 --> 50:18.724
I didn't even eat anything, so why…

50:27.858 --> 50:29.401
I'm watching you.

50:34.990 --> 50:36.658
Are those guys still bullying you?

50:37.367 --> 50:40.328
If they keep doing that,
you can ask for our help.

50:40.412 --> 50:41.288
I'm fine.

50:54.217 --> 50:56.386
<i>Lights out in ten minutes.</i>

50:56.470 --> 51:00.891
<i>- Please prepare for bedtime.</i>
- Pass it to me.

51:00.974 --> 51:02.267
Go under.

51:09.483 --> 51:11.443
Is this really necessary?

51:11.526 --> 51:13.445
I don't like sleeping under there.

51:13.528 --> 51:17.115
Once the lights go out,
somebody might attack us.

51:17.199 --> 51:19.034
What? Who?

51:19.117 --> 51:21.578
The prize money still goes up
if we kill each other.

51:22.412 --> 51:24.164
It's part of the game they designed.

51:24.915 --> 51:27.250
Gi-hun, I think you're overreacting here.

51:27.334 --> 51:30.420
Even if that were true,
people wouldn't do that.

51:30.504 --> 51:32.047
In the previous games,

51:32.964 --> 51:35.717
dozens of people
killed each other at night.

51:37.177 --> 51:38.053
Right here.

51:39.346 --> 51:40.931
You have no idea

51:41.014 --> 51:42.808
how people can change…

51:44.935 --> 51:46.603
in this place.

51:48.146 --> 51:53.026
All right, I guess I didn't know
what I was talking about. I'm sorry.

51:56.655 --> 51:59.282
We need to take turns keeping watch
after lights-out.

52:00.534 --> 52:03.870
I'll take the first watch.
You should decide the order for the rest.

52:26.643 --> 52:28.311
Where are you going?

52:28.395 --> 52:30.981
To the bathroom.

52:32.190 --> 52:35.402
You always go to the bathroom
in the middle of the night.

52:37.404 --> 52:38.446
Should I come with you?

52:38.530 --> 52:43.493
No. Why would you want to come
to the ladies' room?

52:43.577 --> 52:45.370
Will you be okay alone?

52:45.453 --> 52:50.292
I'm a little scared of the people here.

52:57.549 --> 52:58.675
Look.

53:04.055 --> 53:05.348
Whoa.

53:05.432 --> 53:07.350
- What…
- Listen.

53:07.434 --> 53:10.312
This is the <i>binyeo</i>
your grandmother gave me.

53:11.146 --> 53:14.733
I put it in just in case
I need to protect myself.

53:15.442 --> 53:18.862
If somebody messes with me, I'll just go…

53:20.655 --> 53:21.489
Of course.

53:22.699 --> 53:25.994
Madam Jang Geum-ja,
who survived the Korean War.

53:28.079 --> 53:29.206
Very impressive, ma'am.

53:36.046 --> 53:36.963
Mr. Seong.

53:40.133 --> 53:41.551
I need to use the bathroom.

53:42.135 --> 53:44.387
It's too dangerous to go by yourself.

53:45.805 --> 53:47.015
We can go together.

54:01.947 --> 54:04.282
We need to use the bathroom.

54:04.366 --> 54:07.077
No. Entry and exit
are restricted at this time.

54:07.160 --> 54:11.581
Please. I'm not feeling very well.

54:11.665 --> 54:13.917
No. Entry and exit
are restricted at this time.

54:14.000 --> 54:14.918
Look.

54:16.127 --> 54:17.337
Mr. Triangle.

54:17.837 --> 54:23.426
Even though you're wearing a weird mask,
you're still human, aren't you?

54:23.969 --> 54:28.139
In the outside world,
you might have a sister like her

54:28.223 --> 54:30.433
and a mom like me.

54:31.059 --> 54:34.854
When ladies say
they need to use the bathroom,

54:34.938 --> 54:38.692
it's for reasons they can't tell you.

54:38.775 --> 54:40.986
If you can't understand that,

54:41.069 --> 54:45.198
you shouldn't even call yourself human.
You really shouldn't.

54:48.827 --> 54:49.953
Listen.

54:51.913 --> 54:55.333
Ever since I entered my 60s,
I've had bladder control issues.

54:55.417 --> 54:58.295
I can't go out without wearing a diaper,

54:58.378 --> 55:01.214
but I couldn't bring
any of the things I need here.

55:01.298 --> 55:04.759
Do you really have to make me wet myself?

55:05.427 --> 55:09.264
Imagine if I was your mother,
Mr. Triangle.

55:09.347 --> 55:12.017
You wouldn't do that to your mother.

55:12.976 --> 55:15.854
I came here because of my son's debt.

55:15.937 --> 55:18.606
I should at least get to pee
when I want, shouldn't I?

55:19.232 --> 55:22.402
What did I do
in my previous life to deserve…

55:25.780 --> 55:27.574
Well, thank you.

55:28.700 --> 55:30.660
Can I come too?

55:30.744 --> 55:32.370
Oh, that's okay.

55:32.454 --> 55:35.206
She's a woman. Her name is Hyun-ju.

55:36.041 --> 55:37.959
It's fine. Let's go.

55:38.960 --> 55:40.628
Come quick.

55:41.129 --> 55:43.590
Thank you, Mr. Triangle.

55:49.346 --> 55:51.264
Hold on to me if you need help.

55:54.184 --> 55:55.226
I'm okay.

55:59.522 --> 56:01.775
In a place like this in your condition…

56:01.858 --> 56:04.778
Your mom and dad must be worried sick.

56:06.738 --> 56:07.655
I don't have any.

56:09.449 --> 56:10.575
I have no parents.

56:21.252 --> 56:22.295
Listen.

56:22.379 --> 56:25.715
If you need help with anything,
just let me know.

56:28.176 --> 56:29.386
I'm okay.

56:34.766 --> 56:37.352
Is she sick or something?

56:40.146 --> 56:41.564
She's pregnant.

56:42.899 --> 56:45.276
I think she's almost due.

57:03.962 --> 57:05.672
Gi-hun, I'm up.

57:10.051 --> 57:12.220
You should get some sleep. I'll take over.

57:12.887 --> 57:14.305
I'm not that tired.

57:15.682 --> 57:17.308
Get some more sleep.

57:28.820 --> 57:29.946
I'm sorry.

57:30.864 --> 57:32.198
Let's not talk about it.

57:33.825 --> 57:35.243
I know it wasn't your fault.

57:36.494 --> 57:37.829
No, it's not about that.

57:42.250 --> 57:46.171
I'm sorry I didn't lend you money
when you came to my pub before.

57:48.465 --> 57:52.427
If I had found some way to help you,
your mom might still be alive now.

57:53.678 --> 57:56.598
Man, but I really
didn't have any money then.

58:00.685 --> 58:01.561
I know.

58:03.271 --> 58:05.023
I've never resented you for that.

58:07.484 --> 58:10.778
Is that why you came here before?
To pay for your mom's treatment?

58:16.618 --> 58:19.454
So why did you come back?

58:20.205 --> 58:23.500
If I were you,
I would have put everything behind me

58:23.583 --> 58:25.293
and started a new life with the money.

58:29.464 --> 58:30.507
If…

58:33.635 --> 58:35.720
I died right before your eyes,

58:38.097 --> 58:39.182
and you…

58:40.767 --> 58:42.143
won all the money,

58:43.561 --> 58:44.979
how would you feel?

58:47.482 --> 58:50.360
Come on, don't say that.
We'll make it out together.

58:50.443 --> 58:52.445
That's why I came back.

58:54.113 --> 58:55.949
To make it out with everyone.

58:57.617 --> 58:59.118
To end this game.

59:02.205 --> 59:03.122
But

59:04.207 --> 59:05.959
I don't know anymore.

59:08.670 --> 59:11.089
I don't know what more I can do here.

59:13.383 --> 59:16.761
I ruined your plan
by pressing that button.

59:16.844 --> 59:18.638
I told you it's not your fault.

59:24.394 --> 59:27.981
Hey, do you remember
when we went on strike?

59:28.064 --> 59:31.901
We were occupying the factory,
and management told us to come out.

59:32.402 --> 59:34.821
They said anyone who came out voluntarily

59:36.030 --> 59:38.866
would be let off the hook
and receive more severance pay.

59:39.534 --> 59:41.244
How could I forget?

59:42.537 --> 59:46.249
When I was on night watch,
I wanted to go out. Guess why I didn't.

59:47.125 --> 59:51.546
You were sleeping beside me,
and you were talking in your sleep.

59:53.214 --> 59:55.758
"Mom, I'm hungry. Give me some food."

59:56.759 --> 59:59.053
"Mom, I'm hungry. Give me some food."

59:59.137 --> 1:00:01.848
You were sobbing in your sleep.

1:00:07.478 --> 1:00:09.897
- I cried in my sleep?
- Yes.

1:00:09.981 --> 1:00:11.024
Asking for food?

1:00:11.107 --> 1:00:11.983
Yeah.

1:00:12.066 --> 1:00:13.693
So you stayed because of me?

1:00:13.776 --> 1:00:18.197
Yeah. I was watching you, and I thought,

1:00:19.032 --> 1:00:22.785
"Man, look at this poor little wuss."

1:00:22.869 --> 1:00:25.246
"If he wakes up and sees that I'm gone,

1:00:25.330 --> 1:00:29.250
he'll start crying and won't even
be able to go the bathroom."

1:00:29.334 --> 1:00:31.628
Then I knew I couldn't fucking leave you.

1:00:31.711 --> 1:00:34.005
You're so full of shit.

1:00:34.088 --> 1:00:35.381
No, I swear on your mom.

1:00:35.465 --> 1:00:37.675
Why on my mom? Swear on your own.

1:00:37.759 --> 1:00:39.802
Whoever's mom it is, it's true.

1:00:39.886 --> 1:00:43.139
I got fired and ended up like this
because I stayed.

1:00:43.222 --> 1:00:47.060
You always blame me
for every bad thing that happens,

1:00:47.143 --> 1:00:50.521
losing money on the horses
and for your failed chicken shop.

1:00:50.605 --> 1:00:51.856
What else? Getting married?

1:00:51.939 --> 1:00:54.817
No, I got married because I wanted to.
I got divorced because of you.

1:00:54.901 --> 1:00:57.570
Hey, I got divorced because of you.

1:00:57.654 --> 1:00:59.989
Because you'd always
invite me out for drinks.

1:01:00.073 --> 1:01:02.575
And you're the one
who got me into horse racing.

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:05.453
All right. Quiet down.

1:01:07.163 --> 1:01:10.333
You're finally acting like
the Seong Gi-hun I know.

1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:16.005
You've been acting like
a different person.

1:01:21.386 --> 1:01:22.261
Gi-hun.

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:28.810
After the next game,
let's get out of here, okay?

1:01:31.062 --> 1:01:32.605
Let's go drink soju like old times.

1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:37.068
You're buying.

1:01:41.406 --> 1:01:45.076
People really don't change.

1:01:45.159 --> 1:01:47.954
Seong Gi-hun,
the cheapskate of Ssangmun-dong.

1:01:49.163 --> 1:01:50.331
The biggest cheapskate.

1:01:51.833 --> 1:01:53.084
The king of cheapskates.

1:01:55.461 --> 1:01:58.047
"The cheapskate of Ssangmun-dong."
That takes me back.

1:02:18.317 --> 1:02:19.527
Is she still in there?

1:02:20.528 --> 1:02:21.487
Yes.

1:02:28.619 --> 1:02:31.664
Hello? Are you all right?

1:02:33.791 --> 1:02:37.086
Are you okay in there? Is something wrong?

1:02:51.225 --> 1:02:52.727
Oh, dear. What's wrong?

1:02:52.810 --> 1:02:56.731
Are you in pain? Is your belly hurting?

1:02:56.814 --> 1:02:58.983
Oh, no. Your baby must be coming.

1:02:59.066 --> 1:03:01.944
Listen, tell me where and how it hurts.

1:03:04.363 --> 1:03:05.531
I'm scared.

1:03:15.541 --> 1:03:16.584
It's okay.

1:03:18.669 --> 1:03:19.670
It's okay.

1:03:20.963 --> 1:03:21.839
It's okay.

1:03:24.008 --> 1:03:27.303
Everything is going to be okay.

1:03:29.305 --> 1:03:33.351
You and your baby
are going to be all right.

1:03:33.434 --> 1:03:34.894
Don't worry.

1:03:40.691 --> 1:03:42.819
Team 2, be careful too.

1:03:42.902 --> 1:03:45.530
If you find anything suspicious,
contact us right away.

1:03:45.613 --> 1:03:47.490
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1:03:47.573 --> 1:03:50.535
Captain Park, be careful out there.

1:03:55.289 --> 1:03:57.124
Team 2 will search up north.

1:03:57.208 --> 1:03:59.168
We'll head out to the southwest.

1:03:59.252 --> 1:04:00.294
Okay.

1:04:00.378 --> 1:04:02.421
We have to find it in the next four days.

1:04:02.505 --> 1:04:03.339
Don't worry.

1:04:03.965 --> 1:04:07.677
Captain Ko over there is a local too.
He knows the area inside and out.

1:04:08.553 --> 1:04:11.681
And we've got enough fuel
and food for a week.

1:04:12.306 --> 1:04:13.808
- Let's give it a go.
- All right.

1:04:13.891 --> 1:04:15.434
You've got some soju too, right?

1:04:16.686 --> 1:04:20.147
I'll catch some fish with this at night.
You can slice it up nicely for us.

1:04:20.231 --> 1:04:22.525
Hey, do you think
you're on a fishing boat?

1:04:23.442 --> 1:04:27.446
Stay on your toes
until we find that island.

1:04:29.824 --> 1:04:32.660
When it gets dark,
we won't be able to do anything anyway.

1:04:32.743 --> 1:04:34.620
What are we supposed to do all night?

1:04:35.705 --> 1:04:38.583
Are you going to sing and dance for us?

1:04:44.589 --> 1:04:46.132
All right, let's set sail!

1:04:46.215 --> 1:04:49.886
The team that finds it first
gets a bonus! Good luck!

1:04:49.969 --> 1:04:51.596
- Let's go!
- Good luck!

1:04:58.144 --> 1:05:02.148
<i>The third game will begin momentarily.</i>

1:05:02.231 --> 1:05:06.444
<i>All players, please get out of bed</i>
<i>and get ready.</i>

1:05:07.028 --> 1:05:08.738
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

1:05:09.906 --> 1:05:13.826
<i>The third game will begin momentarily.</i>

1:05:13.910 --> 1:05:18.039
<i>All players, please get out of bed</i>
<i>and get ready.</i>

1:05:21.459 --> 1:05:24.337
Hey, brother. Can I have one too?

1:05:25.796 --> 1:05:27.590
You don't want to know.

1:05:27.673 --> 1:05:29.842
Once you take it,
you'll never be normal again.

1:05:31.010 --> 1:05:34.764
If you get out of here,
don't get involved with them ever again.

1:05:37.767 --> 1:05:39.936
Why did you team up with them then?

1:05:40.019 --> 1:05:42.980
Because idiots like them
are easier to deal with.

1:05:44.357 --> 1:05:48.194
What about me?
Why did you team up with me?

1:05:49.111 --> 1:05:50.237
Because…

1:05:51.948 --> 1:05:53.699
I thought you wouldn't deceive me.

1:05:54.492 --> 1:05:55.326
What?

1:05:58.496 --> 1:06:02.375
Anyway, I'm getting out
once the prize money reaches 200 million.

1:06:03.417 --> 1:06:05.836
I don't know your situation,
but think carefully.

1:06:08.464 --> 1:06:10.383
You won't last long in here.

1:06:37.994 --> 1:06:42.456
<i>All soldiers,</i>
<i>please proceed to your stations.</i>

1:06:53.050 --> 1:06:54.593
- Wow.
- Yeah!

1:07:13.029 --> 1:07:14.030
Young-mi.

1:07:18.075 --> 1:07:18.993
I'm sorry.

1:07:21.454 --> 1:07:22.538
It's okay.

1:07:23.748 --> 1:07:27.418
We can all win the game
and make it out together.

1:07:41.766 --> 1:07:44.602
<i>Welcome to your third game.</i>

1:07:45.436 --> 1:07:48.397
<i>The game you will be playing is Mingle.</i>

1:07:49.315 --> 1:07:51.192
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

1:07:51.692 --> 1:07:54.820
<i>The game you will be playing is Mingle.</i>

1:07:54.904 --> 1:07:57.907
Hey, we'll be mingling together.

1:07:57.990 --> 1:07:59.867
Doesn't that sound like so much fun?

1:08:01.869 --> 1:08:07.416
<i>All players,</i>
<i>please step onto the center platform.</i>

1:08:07.500 --> 1:08:10.503
<i>When the game starts,</i>
<i>the platform will begin to rotate,</i>

1:08:10.586 --> 1:08:12.671
<i>and you will hear a number.</i>

1:08:12.755 --> 1:08:16.300
<i>You must form groups of that size,</i>

1:08:16.383 --> 1:08:19.845
<i>go into the rooms,</i>
<i>and close the door within 30 seconds.</i>

1:08:19.929 --> 1:08:23.265
Oh, this game? We used to play
something similar on school trips.

1:08:23.349 --> 1:08:24.809
We formed groups by hugging.

1:08:24.892 --> 1:08:27.603
Yeah. Instead of hugging,
we go into those rooms.

1:08:27.686 --> 1:08:29.355
I know this game.

1:08:29.438 --> 1:08:33.317
How should we play this?
Is there a strategy?

1:08:33.400 --> 1:08:36.112
If the number is four,
we can stay together.

1:08:36.195 --> 1:08:38.614
If it's two, you and me pair up.

1:08:38.697 --> 1:08:42.451
If the number is bigger than five,
we'll get the additional people we need.

1:08:42.535 --> 1:08:45.412
But what if it's smaller than five?

1:08:46.455 --> 1:08:48.207
Like three or four.

1:08:48.290 --> 1:08:50.543
We'll figure it out as we go.

1:08:50.626 --> 1:08:53.587
No matter what happens, don't panic.
Let's stay calm.

1:08:53.671 --> 1:08:54.839
Let's trust each other.

1:08:54.922 --> 1:08:56.882
We'll all make it out together. Here.

1:09:05.516 --> 1:09:06.892
One, two, three.

1:09:06.976 --> 1:09:08.144
- Go!
- Victory at all costs!

1:09:09.562 --> 1:09:12.189
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

1:09:21.907 --> 1:09:26.537
<i>Round and round</i>

1:09:26.620 --> 1:09:31.000
<i>Let's go around in circles and dance</i>

1:09:31.083 --> 1:09:35.462
<i>We will clap our hands and sing</i>

1:09:35.546 --> 1:09:40.134
<i>La-la-la-la, let's have fun dancing</i>

1:09:40.217 --> 1:09:44.680
<i>Ring-a, ring-a, ring-a</i>
<i>Ring-a, ring-a-ring</i>

1:09:44.763 --> 1:09:49.226
<i>Ring-a, ring-a, ring-a</i>
<i>Ring-a, ring-a-ring</i>

1:09:49.310 --> 1:09:53.480
<i>We will go hand in hand</i>

1:09:53.564 --> 1:09:58.152
<i>And have fun jumping around</i>

1:12:21.879 --> 1:12:26.884
