00:38.288 --> 00:40.499
<i>Ever wonder
what it's like to drown?</i>

00:44.044 --> 00:45.504
<i>Story of opposites.</i>

00:47.589 --> 00:50.133
<i>There's peace in water.</i>

00:51.009 --> 00:56.515
<i>Like it's holdin' you,
whisperin' in low tones to let it in.</i>

00:58.224 --> 01:02.228
<i>And every problem in the world
will fade away.</i>

01:10.278 --> 01:13.990
- <i>But then there's this thing...</i>

01:13.990 --> 01:16.577
<i>...in your head, and it's raging.</i>

01:17.828 --> 01:20.121
<i>Lighting every nerve with madness.</i>

01:20.121 --> 01:22.040
<i>- To fight.</i>

01:22.999 --> 01:25.376
<i>- To survive.</i>

01:26.837 --> 01:29.548
<i>And all the while,
this question lingers before you:</i>

01:32.759 --> 01:34.260
<i>"Have you had enough?"</i>

01:36.096 --> 01:40.892
<i>It's funny. You could pass a lifetime
without ever facing a choice like that.</i>

01:41.685 --> 01:43.604
<i>But it changes you forever.</i>

01:45.689 --> 01:48.609
<i>For that, I thank you...</i>

01:50.360 --> 01:52.237
<i>old friend.</i>

03:20.617 --> 03:22.035
Vander?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.995
We don't have much time.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.205
How did you find me?

03:25.205 --> 03:28.166
I'm proud of you. Always have been.

03:28.166 --> 03:32.504
I'm sorry, I... This is the only way
to protect the others.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.047
- Vander.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.593
You've got a good heart.
Don't ever lose it.

03:37.593 --> 03:40.220
No matter how the world
tries to break you.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.180
Protect the family.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.473
What are you--

03:44.808 --> 03:46.768
No.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.314
-  Vander.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.358
- Let me out. This isn't right.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.901
I'm guessing that's for me.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.287
You gonna let us make the arrest or not?

04:06.788 --> 04:10.416
You'll oblige a doomed man one last smoke.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.715
Won't you?

04:19.425 --> 04:21.553
I'm not putting you away, Vander.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.847
The Council needs its pound of flesh.

04:23.847 --> 04:27.225
Without you down here, it all falls apart.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.687
Benzo will handle things.

04:31.229 --> 04:36.527
He may not have my devilish charm,
but he runs a tight ship.

04:36.527 --> 04:39.696
Vander, no. You can't do this.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.032
You won't be coming back for a long time.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.492
- I know.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.245
-  Why?
- Mm.

04:48.163 --> 04:51.374
- It's the only way.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.836
- Benzo, open the damn door.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.802
What's happening?

05:07.516 --> 05:09.184
Hey. Stop right there!

05:23.448 --> 05:25.075
What the devil...

05:26.702 --> 05:27.619
No.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.511
Silco?

05:45.178 --> 05:50.350
You animal. Go crawl back
into whatever hole you came out of.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.602
Benzo, stay back.

05:51.602 --> 05:54.605
You never did know when to walk away.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.065
- Wait.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.399
No!

06:03.154 --> 06:05.115
Hmm. Stubborn to the end.

06:08.910 --> 06:13.164
What the hell have you done?
This wasn't the deal!

06:14.875 --> 06:16.292
Deal's changed.

06:19.755 --> 06:20.756
No.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.224
No!

07:21.525 --> 07:24.903
This entire time, I thought
I needed to dampen the oscillations.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.698
The crystals will only stabilize
at high frequency.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.282
- You have to--
- Crank it.

07:30.742 --> 07:34.037
Yes. Yes. You have to... crank it.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.289
- It works.
- Eh... On paper.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.792
Well, we could test it
if we had access to my equipment.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.711
Which is being destroyed tomorrow.

07:41.628 --> 07:45.256
- What?
- Oh. I... Yeah. I, I meant to tell you.

07:46.007 --> 07:49.427
That research is everything.
My... my whole life.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.304
Maybe if we showed them the equations,

07:51.304 --> 07:53.515
- they'd let us--
-  We need more than promises.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.516
We need proof.

07:54.516 --> 07:58.103
Not without the crystals.
The enforcers took them all. They're gone.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.523
Yeah. Locked away in Heimerdinger's lab.

08:03.609 --> 08:07.237
No. No. No. You heard the Council.
If we're wrong...

08:07.237 --> 08:08.655
Better be right then.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.658
Why? Why would you risk this?

08:12.158 --> 08:14.995
Do you think it was my life's ambition
to be an assistant?

08:14.995 --> 08:17.498
Scientists seek discoveries.

08:17.498 --> 08:20.458
Ways to make the world a better place.

08:20.458 --> 08:24.462
This Hextech dream of yours
has the potential to do that.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.217
Our Hextech dream.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.245
I saw everything.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.165
Be... Benzo. They...

09:01.875 --> 09:03.334
What about Vander?

09:04.169 --> 09:05.921
They took him.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.301
-  Where?

09:38.787 --> 09:41.331
It's a little crude, I'll admit.

09:41.331 --> 09:44.459
The base violence necessary for change.

09:44.459 --> 09:48.672
But we both know
topside won't listen to anything else.

09:54.803 --> 09:59.099
Even with your monsters,
you won't win a war against Piltover.

09:59.099 --> 10:03.103
I don't have to.
I just need to scare them.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.607
They won't dare set foot
in the underground again.

10:07.190 --> 10:11.236
You'll get people killed. For what? Pride?

10:11.236 --> 10:13.530
For respect.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.826
Opportunity. Everything they've denied us.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.621
You had my respect.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.749
The Lanes' respect, but that...
that was never enough for you.

10:23.749 --> 10:28.419
We shared a vision, Vander.
A dream of freedom.

10:29.212 --> 10:34.259
Not just for the Lanes, but the whole
of the underground, united as one.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.763
The nation of Zaun.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.517
Do you even remember?

10:43.351 --> 10:44.435
I trusted you.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.232
And you betrayed me.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.113
What I did to you...

10:57.533 --> 11:01.953
I've never forgiven myself.
You were my brother.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.124
No, you still don't understand.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.586
Can you imagine what it's like?

11:10.796 --> 11:12.798
<i>When your blood mixes with the filth</i>

11:12.798 --> 11:16.217
<i>and the river toxins
eat through your nerves.</i>

11:18.512 --> 11:20.722
<i>Oh, I hated you for what you'd done.</i>

11:22.348 --> 11:26.102
<i>But as time passed, so did my hate.</i>

11:28.313 --> 11:30.190
And I was left with an understanding.

11:31.399 --> 11:35.696
The only way to defeat a superior enemy
is to stop at nothing.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.989
<i>To become what they fear.</i>

11:40.742 --> 11:44.037
I hated you, but you kept my respect.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.415
Until you made peace with them.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.627
Played lapdog
after everything we suffered.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.755
I had no choice.

11:53.755 --> 11:54.965
Perhaps.

11:55.924 --> 11:56.883
But now you do.

11:58.009 --> 12:01.179
Shimmer. We have the power.

12:01.179 --> 12:04.224
We can finally realize our dream,

12:06.392 --> 12:07.644
brother.

12:08.520 --> 12:09.771
Look at what you've done.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.149
Benzo. These kids.

12:13.149 --> 12:18.655
In fighting topside,
you'd sacrifice everything that we are.

12:18.655 --> 12:21.908
It's not the way. Can't you see that?

12:22.951 --> 12:29.541
Kill me if you have to,
but please spare the Lanes.

12:30.416 --> 12:34.170
You'd die for the cause,
but you won't fight for one?

12:36.632 --> 12:40.051
I'm just... not that man anymore.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.096
I'll show you what you really are.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.770
Hmm.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.176
So far, so good.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.182
Hmm. Willing to risk exile
for your endeavor.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.684
That's quite the conviction.

13:28.684 --> 13:29.601
Councilor.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.812
- What a surprise to see you, huh?
- Wait a minute, this isn't my bedroom.

13:31.812 --> 13:32.729
How could I have...

13:34.022 --> 13:36.817
Please. We can prove that it works.

13:36.817 --> 13:40.278
Hmm. You couldn't do so earlier today,
how is tonight any different?

13:40.987 --> 13:43.114
We figured out how to stabilize it.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.284
You're the Professor's assistant.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.411
No, he's my new partner.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.916
Even if you manage to prove your theory,
the Council would destroy it.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.711
Heimerdinger will recognize the potential.

13:55.711 --> 13:57.462
He already does.

13:57.462 --> 14:00.131
It scares him. It scares them all.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.174
What about you?

14:02.008 --> 14:05.887
I recognize that any worthwhile venture
involves risk.

14:15.731 --> 14:18.859
Councilor, this technology, it's real.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.820
And no matter what happens here,
it's going to change our world.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.739
We should be the ones to lead it.

14:23.739 --> 14:27.951
Piltover, the land of progress,
equality, innovation.

14:27.951 --> 14:31.580
I know it sounds impossible,
but when have we ever let that stop us?

14:32.163 --> 14:35.125
Please, just give us a chance.

14:39.588 --> 14:45.343
One night, gentlemen. Impress me,
or I'd suggest you pack your bags.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.971
- Harold.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.848
Oh. Oh.

14:50.348 --> 14:54.185
Oh, Councilor Medarda,
you... you nearly scared me to death.

14:54.185 --> 14:57.648
Ah. Another late night.
The work just doesn't end.

14:57.648 --> 15:00.316
Well, I suppose that's a sign
of good business, huh?

15:09.785 --> 15:12.287
Well, if the enforcers hit tonight,
we'll be ready...

15:12.871 --> 15:14.080
- I think.
-  Dibs on the bat.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.583
-  No, no, no, no. I found it.
-  But I called it.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.502
-  But I found it.
-  Respect the dibs.

15:18.502 --> 15:19.545
- I called it already.
-  Respect the...

15:19.545 --> 15:22.881
- Stop being such a big baby.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.007
Vi?

15:24.716 --> 15:26.051
- Where's the--
-  Oh, you're back.

15:35.351 --> 15:38.939
Hey. Those are Vander's.
Slow down. What's going on?

15:40.023 --> 15:42.317
- Benzo's dead.
- Dead?

15:42.317 --> 15:44.444
- They took Vander.
-  Who took Vander?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.530
I don't know. But I need to help him.

15:46.530 --> 15:47.656
We're going with you.

15:49.032 --> 15:53.161
Whatever killed Benzo...
was like nothing I've ever seen.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.873
It tore him apart.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.293
You're not doing this alone, Vi.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.837
He's our father too.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.923
Do we know where they took him?

16:04.923 --> 16:06.382
Ekko followed them.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.512
The old cannery next to the docks.
He said...

16:16.059 --> 16:17.978
I need you to sit this one out, Powder.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.521
What?

16:19.521 --> 16:21.648
- You're not coming.
- I'm not afraid.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.608
It's too dangerous.

16:22.608 --> 16:25.276
But families stick together.
You said it yourself.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.696
- I know what I said...
- I want to fight. I can help.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.030
You're not ready.

16:33.368 --> 16:34.911
You're all I have left.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.372
I can't lose you.

16:40.416 --> 16:44.420
Here. If they come for you,
take this and run.

16:45.005 --> 16:49.092
Where ever you are, light it up,
and I'll find you. I promise.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.739
It's all here.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.628
It's time to crank it.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.338
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

17:42.228 --> 17:44.815
I don't think it's gonna hold!
Look at the buildup!

17:44.815 --> 17:46.900
The resonance will stabilize it.

17:47.568 --> 17:48.777
Trust me.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.238
Hey, you seeing this?

18:47.168 --> 18:48.378
I can help them.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.099
Let's get Vander and get out.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.984
I told you it would work.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.486
All yours.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.531
Wow.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.157
It's never done that before.

19:17.741 --> 19:20.076
All right. Here we go.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.510
Disengage!

19:55.612 --> 19:57.531
Incredible.

20:21.471 --> 20:23.264
- Vi.

20:23.932 --> 20:25.016
What are you doing here?

20:25.726 --> 20:26.852
We're breakin' you out.

20:28.687 --> 20:30.981
- Mylo.
- On it.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.403
-  How... how did you get in?

20:38.780 --> 20:40.365
There's guards everywhere.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.910
It was easy. We found an open window and...

20:44.410 --> 20:45.453
Oh, god.

20:46.162 --> 20:48.540
You have to get out. Now.

20:48.540 --> 20:49.541
Welcome.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.513
You have my congratulations.

21:03.764 --> 21:07.768
But I'm afraid
this will be a very short reunion.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.770
Hmm.

21:12.230 --> 21:13.649
Have you heard the rumor?

21:14.775 --> 21:17.778
Vander the coward
fled town with his children.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.405
And they were never seen again.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.326
Claggor, see if you can find
another way out of here.

21:25.326 --> 21:26.452
Okay.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.789
You don't have to do this.

21:28.789 --> 21:29.956
Yes, I do.

21:33.627 --> 21:34.503
Vi.

22:41.987 --> 22:42.821
Mylo.

22:46.491 --> 22:49.536
Take a breath. You can do this.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.927
We're gonna get you out.

23:34.455 --> 23:35.874
Ready to rise to the surface?

24:15.080 --> 24:16.665
Mylo, hurry.

24:26.424 --> 24:27.342
Vi.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.221
Silco. Let her go.

24:31.221 --> 24:33.181
This is between you and me.

24:33.181 --> 24:34.558
You had your chance.

24:48.196 --> 24:50.198
- Vi.

25:11.344 --> 25:12.345
You did good.

25:16.892 --> 25:19.936
-  Open up.
- Stop this lunacy at once.

25:19.936 --> 25:22.523
- They're almost through. No pressure.
-  Open the door.

25:22.523 --> 25:24.190
That sounds like pressure!

25:29.821 --> 25:31.782
Open it.

25:57.558 --> 26:00.060
Excuse me. Underfoot.

26:23.291 --> 26:25.877
You've actually done it.

26:25.877 --> 26:29.339
But just because it can be done,
doesn't mean...

26:29.339 --> 26:31.550
Will you please stop hovering?

26:32.634 --> 26:34.803
I'm not sure how to do that, sir.

26:36.597 --> 26:41.059
This is not what Piltover's future
looks like, my dear boys.

26:42.018 --> 26:44.145
That's for the Council to decide.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.233
Perhaps it's time.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.861
For the era of magic.

26:50.861 --> 26:54.197
Uh, Hextech. For the era of Hextech.

27:09.212 --> 27:12.674
-  You have to work. For me. Okay?

30:10.686 --> 30:11.520
Kill them.

30:26.076 --> 30:28.119


32:32.744 --> 32:35.539
I knew you still had it in you.

32:52.222 --> 32:53.599
Find the girl.

33:57.453 --> 33:59.164
Silco!

34:30.320 --> 34:32.030
Vander.

34:32.989 --> 34:35.909
- Vander...

34:38.244 --> 34:40.038
Take care of Powder.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.211
No!

35:08.900 --> 35:10.276
Vi, it worked.

35:10.861 --> 35:12.195
- What?
-  Did you see me?

35:12.195 --> 35:14.990
My monkey bomb finally worked.

35:16.825 --> 35:17.951
You did this?

35:26.502 --> 35:27.418
Why?

35:28.169 --> 35:29.129
Why did you do this?

35:30.296 --> 35:31.507
I... I didn't...

35:32.298 --> 35:33.383
I was saving you.

35:37.721 --> 35:40.390
I only wanted to help.

35:40.390 --> 35:43.393
I only wanted to help.
I only wanted to help.

35:43.393 --> 35:45.979
- I only wanted to--
- I told you to stay away.

35:45.979 --> 35:49.399
- Please. Please. Please--
- I told you to stay away!

35:50.233 --> 35:52.861
No. Why did you leave me?

35:52.861 --> 35:56.823
Because you're a jinx. Do you hear me?
Mylo was right.

35:56.823 --> 36:01.369
No. No. No. No. Violet, please.

36:13.006 --> 36:14.883
Violet, please.

36:25.018 --> 36:27.729
Vi! Vi, come back!
Please come back!

36:27.729 --> 36:31.066
Please, Violet. I need you. Please.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.414
Violet...

36:47.624 --> 36:50.460
Violet. Please.

37:17.320 --> 37:18.196
Powder.

37:18.905 --> 37:20.365
- Pow--
-  Shh.

37:20.365 --> 37:22.909
-  He'll kill you if he hears you.

37:22.909 --> 37:24.911
Come on. Let's go.

37:46.057 --> 37:48.685
Hello, little girl.

37:49.435 --> 37:51.437
Where's your sister?

38:05.410 --> 38:06.662
She left me.

38:14.127 --> 38:18.214
She is not my sister anymore.

38:37.776 --> 38:39.069
It's okay.

38:42.072 --> 38:43.198
We'll show them.

38:46.159 --> 38:47.493
