WEBVTT

00:25.817 --> 00:28.862
-  You wanted to see me, Professor?
-  Ah. Come in, Jayce.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.864
-  Can you believe it?

00:30.864 --> 00:33.659
Our city is about to turn 200 years old.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.077
A bicentennial.

00:37.245 --> 00:40.541
It's shaping up
to be an amazing Progress Day.

00:43.835 --> 00:49.132
"Stanwick Padidly"?
Huh, I don't know much about him.

00:49.132 --> 00:52.969
Everything he built either exploded,
melted, or toppled over.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.764
And yet, here he stands.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.268
Stanwick set his personal ambitions aside

01:00.268 --> 01:02.896
and focused on something
far more important.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.690
Our future.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.442
He realized nothing he could accomplish

01:07.442 --> 01:10.361
could compare to the contributions
of his students.

01:10.361 --> 01:12.113
I had no idea.

01:13.824 --> 01:15.576
That was his sacrifice.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.411
A dear friend.

01:19.204 --> 01:23.124
The Council has recommended you give
the Progress Day speech this year.

01:23.124 --> 01:26.127
What... But you always give that speech.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.672
I... I could never take your place.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.757
I agree with them.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.844
Your Hexgates have done wonders
for our city.

01:33.844 --> 01:39.224
Brought scholars from distant lands.
Reignited passions in arts and science.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.560
You deserve this honor.

01:43.854 --> 01:47.524
I... I will do my best
to make Piltover proud, Professor.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.234
It's short notice, I know,

01:49.234 --> 01:53.196
but perhaps there's something in the lab
you might be able to share?

01:53.196 --> 01:55.031
People love a grand reveal.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.785
Viktor and I have just the thing.
The next chapter of Hextech.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.829
Come to the lab this afternoon,
I'll show you.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.413
I'll look forward to it.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.833
You certainly have something
to live up to, my boy.

<i>Happy Progress Day.
Happy Progress Day.</i>

04:27.350 --> 04:31.354
Our most famous protégé, Jayce Talis.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.232
The visionary behind the Hexgates,

04:34.232 --> 04:38.319
a beacon of trade and prosperity
for our great City of Progress.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.237
Excuse me.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.823
Sorry, sorry. Yeah. Excuse me.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.201
- He's a very busy man.

04:49.665 --> 04:52.208
- Cait.
- Serves you right.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.589
You still avoiding her?

04:57.589 --> 04:58.507
I'm working.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.008
Oh, I can see that.

05:00.592 --> 05:03.887
I mean, there's so much crime
to thwart outside your family's tent.

05:03.887 --> 05:07.432
I can only imagine the strings she pulled
to have me posted here.

05:07.432 --> 05:08.934
It's your fault really,

05:08.934 --> 05:11.895
for not following her into a career
"more befitting your station."

05:13.021 --> 05:15.774
She'd do anything to keep me
from seeing the real world.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.109
Well, at least you'll have front-row seats
to the speech.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.028
Speech?

05:20.028 --> 05:22.488
Mm-hmm.
I'm giving the big address tonight.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.826
Hmm. We really have descended to anarchy.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.953
Have fun herding the drunkards.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.122
Happy Progress Day.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.707
Uh, shipping manifest?

06:15.166 --> 06:17.919
From your friend. Downtown.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.563
Let's go!

06:37.397 --> 06:39.065
Ah, shit. The Firelights.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.792
We have five minutes
till they're out of there.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.134
You ever seen
this much Shimmer before?

07:07.177 --> 07:10.722
They're expanding.
Check for more below. Burn it all.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.574
-  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Open up.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.828
Open the door.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.294
Oh, no. She's here.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.625
What the...

08:48.236 --> 08:49.279
Hi.

09:23.564 --> 09:24.480
Vi?

09:25.649 --> 09:27.108
I can't lose you.

09:30.529 --> 09:32.280
Why did you leave me?

09:32.280 --> 09:34.950
<i>Because you're a jinx.</i>

09:39.162 --> 09:41.081
-  <i>I want to fight.</i>
-  <i>You're not ready.</i>

09:46.712 --> 09:47.838
No.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.142
You were supposed to guard the cargo.

11:03.038 --> 11:04.623
You think he will approve?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.458
Heimerdinger believes
science should be used

11:07.458 --> 11:09.252
to improve lives as much as we do.

11:09.252 --> 11:10.796
We just need to show him it's safe.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.550
And what about the Council?

11:15.425 --> 11:18.053
We stabilized the crystal like they asked.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.096
Built the Hexgates like they asked.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.058
It's our turn to decide
the future of Hextech.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.771
Professor. I'm so glad you could make it.

11:27.771 --> 11:31.817
Wouldn't miss it for the world, my boy.
What do we have on the docket?

11:34.570 --> 11:36.196
It all began with this.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.158
A crystal of magical energy,

11:40.158 --> 11:43.078
too volatile to be handled
outside our workshops.

11:43.078 --> 11:46.289
Hextech was supposed to bring magic
into the life of the common man.

11:46.289 --> 11:49.710
And now, it finally can.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.421
A Hextech Gemstone.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.684
-  Wait.

12:11.857 --> 12:13.609
Holy sprockets.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.738
We've found a means
to fortify the crystals.

12:17.738 --> 12:22.951
This new version is stable
and absolutely safe.

12:25.537 --> 12:29.791
We present to you
the next chapter of Hextech.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.211
We can now design portable devices.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.462
Oh...

12:37.758 --> 12:40.844
The Gemstone can power virtually anything.

13:00.656 --> 13:03.199
The Atlas Gauntlets.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.662
The mining colonies in the fissures
can work faster and without fatigue.

13:09.164 --> 13:10.456
The Hex Claw.

13:12.042 --> 13:16.046
A mechanical arm,
equipped with a powerful ray of light.

13:23.929 --> 13:27.390
Imagine what our artificers could do
with such a device.

13:27.974 --> 13:31.311
I want Hextech to be a tool
for us to build a new world.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.648
- And now, it's finally possible.

13:38.694 --> 13:41.988
Anyway, this is our presentation.

13:41.988 --> 13:46.367
Quite amazing, gentlemen.
You should be very proud.

13:46.952 --> 13:51.164
Obviously, there are a few kinks
to iron out and screws to be tightened,

13:51.164 --> 13:55.251
but give it a decade of careful research,
and it will be ready.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.503
A decade?

13:56.503 --> 14:00.507
Oh, don't worry, my boy.
It zips past you in the blink of an eye.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.383
With respect, Professor.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.386
We can be improving lives
with Hextech now.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.098
A breakthrough like this
takes time, Viktor.

14:08.098 --> 14:11.267
Putting that kind of power
into everyone's hands is dangerous.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.812
Keep at it and I'm sure
you will discover a way

14:13.812 --> 14:16.648
to safeguard Hextech against misuse.

14:28.577 --> 14:33.499
There must've been four, five of them.
I don't know how they got inside.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.827
You're from the undercity.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.790
I didn't do anything. She's crazy.

15:56.790 --> 15:57.999
- Easy.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.293
She shot me.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.838
Who shot you? Who were you working for?

16:03.672 --> 16:06.550
- I can't. He'll kill me.
- Who?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.260
-  I can protect you.

16:09.886 --> 16:13.056
Caitlyn Kiramman,
why does that not surprise me?

16:13.682 --> 16:15.976
Interfering in an investigation, again.

16:16.727 --> 16:19.104
You're supposed to be guarding
your mother's tent.

16:19.104 --> 16:24.025
I was, Sheriff, but she doesn't need it.
And clearly, this takes priority.

16:24.025 --> 16:26.319
I realize you're used
to getting your way, Kiramman,

16:26.319 --> 16:28.279
but we have a chain of command
for a reason.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.948
I understand.

16:29.948 --> 16:32.659
But there's more going on here
than just the smuggling.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.537
- If I could just question him I could--
-  I'll take it from here.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.247
Since you're looking for more work,

16:37.247 --> 16:39.666
you can take the graveyard shift tonight
at the fair.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.669
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.130
I want this one on a boat
to Stillwater prison.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.381
Yes, sir.

17:30.551 --> 17:31.760
She fired on us.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.345
There are always mishaps in battle.

17:34.888 --> 17:38.349
The Firelights were her target
and most are dead.

17:39.142 --> 17:43.021
It wasn't a mishap,
she froze up and lost her shit.

17:43.605 --> 17:45.398
I could've handled those brats.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.443
- She's a problem and we all know it.
-  We?

17:50.028 --> 17:50.904
Who's we?

17:53.699 --> 17:56.618
I expect better from you than excuses.

17:56.618 --> 17:59.621
It was your job to make sure
things went smoothly.

18:00.664 --> 18:04.042
You failed. Don't disappoint me again.

18:12.425 --> 18:17.556
The world's growing smaller
every day, thanks to the Hexgates.

18:17.556 --> 18:19.933
And now, we're cut off.

18:19.933 --> 18:23.019
The topsiders are leaving us
further and further behind.

18:24.855 --> 18:25.897
What happened?

18:26.648 --> 18:27.899
She already told you.

18:29.359 --> 18:30.694
I'm asking you.

18:34.364 --> 18:37.075
One of those Firelight wackos
was a girl.

18:37.075 --> 18:40.954
- With pink hair.
-  Hmm...

18:48.754 --> 18:50.421
Your sister's gone.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.133
You know that as well as I do.

18:53.133 --> 18:56.386
I know. I know. Sisters, right?

18:56.386 --> 18:59.640
You can't live with 'em, can't stuff
'em back in the ol' babymaker.

19:01.850 --> 19:04.435
Today's screw-up will set us back weeks.

19:06.730 --> 19:07.898
I'm sorry.

19:07.898 --> 19:11.652
- I need to know that I can rely on you.
- Phew.

19:12.611 --> 19:15.614
I'm doing this for us, Jinx. All of us.

19:16.114 --> 19:20.786
The sons and daughters of Zaun
deserve more than their runoff.

19:22.245 --> 19:23.622
It won't happen again.

19:24.665 --> 19:25.666
I know.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.595
Sevika will clean up today's mess.

19:38.595 --> 19:42.808
Sevika? That ogre couldn't clean
a dust bunny with a blowtorch.

19:42.808 --> 19:47.187
She'll suffice.
You should focus on your gadgetry.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.438
Ugh.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.023
Take some time.

19:50.566 --> 19:52.859
I don't need time.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.572
Take it anyhow.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.179
Fundraiser's going well.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.099
Your mother would be proud.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.101
Hmm... Would she?

20:26.643 --> 20:28.186
Tired of mingling?

20:28.186 --> 20:31.690
Hmm. These people have nothing new
to offer me.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.985
The only one actually worth my time
is him.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.904
The golden boy.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.365
Ah, he's won Piltover's heart.

20:41.366 --> 20:43.744
Oh, speak of the devil.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.676
Could I borrow you for a minute?

21:11.271 --> 21:13.023
To what do I owe the pleasure?

21:14.775 --> 21:16.568
It's Heimerdinger.

21:16.568 --> 21:18.194
When is it not?

21:18.194 --> 21:19.780
We've shown him our research.

21:20.363 --> 21:22.032
He thinks we need more time.

21:22.032 --> 21:23.575
It's Progress Day.

21:23.575 --> 21:25.201
Representatives from all over the world

21:25.201 --> 21:28.539
have come to see what new wonders
the City of Progress has to offer.

21:28.539 --> 21:31.750
If there's a time to present
a new creation, it is now.

21:33.752 --> 21:34.878
Great.

21:37.589 --> 21:43.053
Heimerdinger is a great scientist.
But he's old. He only ever sees the past.

21:43.762 --> 21:46.264
Piltover needs a leader who looks forward.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.559
Someone like you.

21:48.559 --> 21:50.226
You really believe that?

21:51.269 --> 21:55.231
Hextech has the potential
to change everything.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.650
The world is ready.

21:56.650 --> 21:59.194
And I've already spoken
to several potential investors.

21:59.194 --> 22:00.111
Investors?

22:00.111 --> 22:01.404
Of course.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.699
Everyone wants Hextech for themselves.

22:04.575 --> 22:06.201
It's your speech.

22:06.201 --> 22:08.829
Give the people a glimpse of the future.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.636
It wasn't her.

22:29.641 --> 22:30.475
It wasn't.

22:34.771 --> 22:38.609
I know. Just...
just some wannabe street trash.

22:39.234 --> 22:41.111
I got confused, that's all.

22:41.111 --> 22:44.197
Now, he thinks I'm weak.

22:45.991 --> 22:47.408
"Sevika will clean it up."

22:47.408 --> 22:50.453
Sevika's a regular Johnny-on-the-spot.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.916
I'm not weak.

23:01.923 --> 23:03.550
And I'm gonna show him.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.845
Oh, I'm gonna show him. You'll see.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.233
Where were you?

23:20.233 --> 23:22.528
They were asking
if I could do the address.

23:22.528 --> 23:24.863
You should come up with me.
We're partners.

23:24.863 --> 23:28.909
No, no. Not in front of all of them...

23:30.493 --> 23:32.704
You... have your speech prepared?

23:33.622 --> 23:34.540
Uh-huh.

23:35.248 --> 23:38.168
An inspiration
to Piltover's future

23:38.168 --> 23:40.504
and that of all humanity.

23:40.504 --> 23:44.925
Please join me in welcoming to the stage...

23:45.551 --> 23:47.636
- Jayce Talis.
- Guess it's time.

24:27.718 --> 24:28.802
Uh, good evening.

24:30.470 --> 24:34.099
I know many of you probably didn't expect
to see me here today.

24:34.099 --> 24:36.309
And believe me,
I'm just as shocked as you are.

24:43.650 --> 24:47.946
My family and I are simple people.
In our factory, we made hammers.

24:48.572 --> 24:51.575
They were probably used to cut the stones
you're standing on right now.

24:52.701 --> 24:55.954
No one in my life
expected very much of me.

24:55.954 --> 25:01.042
And that is precisely what makes
this moment so extraordinary.

25:02.127 --> 25:05.296
A few years ago, the Hexgates
opened their ports to the world

25:05.296 --> 25:10.010
and made Piltover prosper beyond anything
we could have ever imagined.

25:17.518 --> 25:19.686
But... we're not done yet.

25:32.533 --> 25:36.036
This year, we've created something new
for you.

25:39.247 --> 25:41.457
Something that... um...

25:48.549 --> 25:51.760
That we will share with you...

25:55.388 --> 25:56.472
...when the time is right.

26:01.562 --> 26:03.980
Things that will bring an end
to your hardships.

26:03.980 --> 26:06.482
Whether you're the scion
of our high houses,

26:06.482 --> 26:08.777
or an honest laborer from the underground.

26:08.777 --> 26:12.488
We vow to keep pressing forward,
for we are the City of Progress.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.449
And our future is bright.

26:43.394 --> 26:44.605
That it, then?

26:44.605 --> 26:47.232
I thought that Talis boy
was some kind of genius.

26:47.232 --> 26:49.818
Last year, didn't he launch a blimp
halfway across the continent?

26:49.818 --> 26:51.236
Airship, actually.

26:51.236 --> 26:55.532
An airship has a rigid metal hull.
It's not a blimp.

26:55.532 --> 26:57.242
It's a balloon, ain't it?

26:57.242 --> 26:59.202
Sure as hell looks that way.

27:00.120 --> 27:03.999
Pardon us, if we aren't quite
so refined as you, milady.

27:04.916 --> 27:07.085
What are you
even doing here, Kiramman?

27:07.085 --> 27:09.505
Don't you have a cocktail party to attend?

27:13.341 --> 27:14.175
Fire.

27:14.676 --> 27:15.927
Fire!

27:22.225 --> 27:24.269
-  What's happening?
- Get the fire brigade.

27:29.190 --> 27:33.153
Help. In here, please. Help me.

27:41.411 --> 27:45.666
Help. It's so hot, please. I'm trapped.

27:49.169 --> 27:52.255
I'm a helpless little girl,
and I've set the building on fire.

27:52.255 --> 27:55.801
By accident. Totally by accident.

28:02.015 --> 28:03.809
Get out. Now.

28:03.809 --> 28:06.102
Also, I brought this dynamite.

28:06.687 --> 28:08.229
Goodbye.

28:42.097 --> 28:43.306
<i>The Gemstone is gone.</i>

28:44.057 --> 28:46.434
<i>Along with some of our research papers.</i>

28:48.019 --> 28:49.938
<i>The situation is still developing.</i>

28:50.438 --> 28:53.525
<i>No one in the undercity
has claimed responsibility yet.</i>

28:54.985 --> 28:56.778
How did it come to this?

29:01.407 --> 29:05.453
Hmm. For too long
has the underground been left unchecked.

29:05.453 --> 29:06.913
We've lost touch.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.332
They may not be
your preferred constituents,

29:09.332 --> 29:10.917
but they're still our people.

29:11.502 --> 29:15.005
The undercity cannot be controlled.
Not by us.

29:15.005 --> 29:16.965
So where does that leave us?

29:18.675 --> 29:19.593
Mr. Talis?

29:19.593 --> 29:22.470
Could the trenchers build a weapon
with the stolen crystal?

29:22.470 --> 29:24.430
Shimmer, body replacements...

29:24.430 --> 29:28.309
We've seen their ingenuity
over the years, of course, they can.

29:31.980 --> 29:33.649
If the right person got a hold of it,

29:33.649 --> 29:36.484
it's possible
they could utilize its energy.

29:36.484 --> 29:38.695
We need to address this immediately.

29:40.488 --> 29:41.489
I agree.

29:42.073 --> 29:45.201
It was my responsibility
to safeguard this technology and I failed.

29:45.869 --> 29:47.996
My mistake cost people their lives.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.875
I have come before you to recommend
that we suspend all Hextech operations

29:51.875 --> 29:53.627
until the situation is resolved.

29:54.127 --> 29:57.673
Including our laboratories,
the refinery and the Hexgates.

29:57.673 --> 29:59.591
Have you lost your mind?

29:59.591 --> 30:02.093
The Hexgates must remain open.

30:02.093 --> 30:05.597
Piltover's status
as a global shipping lane depends on it.

30:05.597 --> 30:07.683
Thousands would lose their income.

30:07.683 --> 30:11.603
But shouldn't the safety of Piltover
be our first priority?

30:11.603 --> 30:14.064
You would sacrifice your life's work?

30:14.064 --> 30:18.694
Without the Hexgates, my goods
cannot reach foreign markets till winter.

30:18.694 --> 30:20.529
Am I to tell the Noxians

30:20.529 --> 30:23.198
their next shipment of wine
will be vinegar?

30:23.198 --> 30:26.201
Councilors.
It appears we are at an impasse.

30:26.785 --> 30:30.246
If we shut down the Hexgates,
the city will suffer.

30:30.246 --> 30:31.832
But if we do nothing,

30:31.832 --> 30:35.251
we leave ourselves vulnerable
to malefactors.

30:35.251 --> 30:37.253
More lives may be lost.

30:38.379 --> 30:43.259
Perhaps the time has come
to explore a more radical solution.

30:43.259 --> 30:44.970
What are you suggesting?

30:47.138 --> 30:51.309
Mr. Talis has demonstrated
his commitment to our safety.

30:51.309 --> 30:54.437
He's willing to sacrifice
his own enterprise.

30:54.437 --> 30:57.398
And it seems to me only Mr. Talis

30:57.398 --> 31:00.485
has the knowledge necessary
to secure the Hexgates.

31:00.485 --> 31:03.905
I propose that a new chair
be brought forth,

31:04.489 --> 31:07.576
and that House Talis be elevated
to this august body.

31:07.576 --> 31:09.536
- What?
-  As a Councilor,

31:09.536 --> 31:14.290
he will have the resources
necessary to protect all our investments.

31:14.290 --> 31:17.836
Councilor Medarda,
this is highly irregular.

31:17.836 --> 31:20.964
The Council has held seven seats
for generations.

31:20.964 --> 31:23.466
Does the boy have any experience?

31:23.466 --> 31:27.345
Only that of a scientist.
Like Heimerdinger.

31:33.852 --> 31:36.312
I believe Councilor Medarda is right.

31:36.813 --> 31:39.775
Hextech security should be
administered by a scientist.

31:40.316 --> 31:41.860
I second the motion.

31:41.860 --> 31:44.029
Well then, shall we vote?

31:50.536 --> 31:53.329
<i>♪ Come and play ♪</i>

31:53.329 --> 31:56.457
<i>♪ But I might shoot you ♪</i>

31:56.457 --> 31:58.835
<i>♪ In your face ♪</i>

31:58.835 --> 32:03.214
<i>♪ Bombs and bullets will do the trick ♪</i>

32:04.257 --> 32:05.091
Jinx!

32:05.091 --> 32:08.219
<i>♪ We need here is a little bit of panic... ♪</i>

32:08.219 --> 32:10.556
Jinx! Jinx!

32:11.765 --> 32:12.724
Jinx!

32:12.724 --> 32:14.059
That's me.

32:14.059 --> 32:18.188
Half a dozen enforcers, dead. Enforcers.
Dead.

32:18.188 --> 32:20.356
- Yeah...
-  A building blown to pieces.

32:20.356 --> 32:22.317
Oh, yeah.

32:23.902 --> 32:27.155
Do you have any idea what you've done?

32:27.155 --> 32:30.200
Actually, I do.

32:38.792 --> 32:40.752
Happy Progress Day!

33:08.864 --> 33:09.990
Hey.

33:10.574 --> 33:12.242
How are you feeling?

33:14.745 --> 33:16.454
I've had a break in the case.

33:16.454 --> 33:18.039
Shouldn't you be resting?

33:18.039 --> 33:19.457
While the trail is hot?

33:19.457 --> 33:21.793
Listen, you know how I've suspected

33:21.793 --> 33:25.046
there is a single mind
behind the undercity's violence?

33:25.046 --> 33:26.507
The great conspiracy.

33:26.507 --> 33:29.843
I think whoever attacked the square
is our suspect.

33:29.843 --> 33:33.388
The same symbols showed up at the botched
smuggling operation at the Hexgates.

33:33.388 --> 33:34.973
- The Hexgates?
- Keep up.

33:34.973 --> 33:38.602
All this time, they've kept their dealings
localized to the undercity.

33:38.602 --> 33:42.188
Low priority.
The attack on the square changes things.

33:42.188 --> 33:43.439
They've overstepped.

33:43.439 --> 33:45.025
If I can figure who made this,

33:45.025 --> 33:47.861
it could lead me directly
to whoever's behind it all.

33:47.861 --> 33:50.947
The answer is here,
staring me in the face.

33:51.907 --> 33:53.158
I can feel it.

33:55.786 --> 33:58.288
How do you intend to prove any of this?

33:59.706 --> 34:04.252
If I can just work this out.
Marcus will have to listen.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.714
If there's one thing
I've learned about the Council,

34:07.714 --> 34:09.340
they need more than just theories.

34:10.133 --> 34:12.928
Since when did you concern yourself
with the Council's opinion?

34:14.345 --> 34:15.471
Since I...

34:16.389 --> 34:17.516
became a Councilor.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.228
You're serious.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.147
When? Why?

34:24.731 --> 34:27.108
Have they discovered how to govern
with grease and a spanner?

34:27.108 --> 34:34.115
Ha ha. I was actually hoping
you might consider joining my staff.

34:36.618 --> 34:38.161
"House Talis Security."

34:39.705 --> 34:42.624
That's a ceremonial position.
I'd live behind a desk.

34:42.624 --> 34:44.626
You almost died, Cait.

34:44.626 --> 34:46.878
I just... I just want you to be safe.

34:46.878 --> 34:49.339
Thanks, but I already have a job.

34:50.173 --> 34:52.217
No. You don't.

34:53.343 --> 34:55.512
After the attack,
your parents spoke to the Sheriff.

34:57.556 --> 34:58.849
This is the best I could do.

34:59.641 --> 35:03.604
I don't need charity, Councilor.
Yours or my parents'.

35:03.604 --> 35:05.606
- Cait.
- Get out.

35:35.552 --> 35:37.470
I need to speak
with one of the inmates.

35:38.013 --> 35:41.558
Oh, folks in here
aren't usually very talkative.

35:42.100 --> 35:44.144
This one was hit by friendly fire.

35:44.144 --> 35:47.939
He's got reason to talk.
Must have been sent in today?

35:49.065 --> 35:53.319
Oh. Inmate 2135.

35:54.070 --> 35:57.533
<i>Yeah, I'm, uh, afraid that's not possible.</i>

35:57.533 --> 36:00.160
- Why not?
- Uh, well, there's been...

36:00.160 --> 36:02.704
- <i>an incident.</i>
-  <i>What kind of incident?</i>

36:02.704 --> 36:05.165
-  <i>The...</i>

36:05.165 --> 36:07.083
<i>...not so pretty kind.</i>

36:09.628 --> 36:12.088
<i>You don't understand,
I have to talk to him.</i>

36:12.589 --> 36:17.636
<i>Oh, you'll be able to.
As soon as he can move his jaw again.</i>

36:18.637 --> 36:19.721
<i>Who assaulted him?</i>

36:47.415 --> 36:48.542
Who the hell are you?
