WEBVTT

00:22.856 --> 00:25.150
You really went to the undercity
to get these?

00:25.150 --> 00:26.359
Weren't you afraid?

00:26.359 --> 00:28.444
A little danger is worth the risk,
don't you think?

00:29.195 --> 00:30.155
- Oh.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.239
Uh, careful.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.199
That's your parents' money
you're dropping.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.204
Powder, we've gotta go!

00:38.204 --> 00:40.957
-  Hello? Is someone in there?

00:43.919 --> 00:44.836
Hey, open up!

01:13.782 --> 01:14.825
Jayce?

01:16.910 --> 01:17.911
Jayce!

01:31.049 --> 01:32.050
Mom!

01:33.301 --> 01:35.011
Mom. Mom, wake up.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.931
Mom.

01:39.474 --> 01:43.061
Help! Please, someone, help us!

01:43.729 --> 01:46.272
Help! Please!

02:07.460 --> 02:09.254
No. Wait. Wait.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.490
How?

03:46.977 --> 03:50.146
<i>♪ I wake up to the sounds
Of the silence that allows ♪</i>

03:50.146 --> 03:53.191

04:34.440 --> 04:36.067
<i>♪ Look out for yourself ♪</i>

04:40.864 --> 04:42.783
Let's go over it again.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.577
You have to believe me.
I didn't do this.

04:45.577 --> 04:50.165
Relax, kid. We know it was a break-in
but that doesn't explain this.

04:50.165 --> 04:54.252
There's a lot of restricted items here
and I don't see any permits.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.712
You wanna tell me how you got them?

04:55.712 --> 04:58.590
Hey, hey! Be careful with that, please.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.552
I believe someone
should have said that earlier.

05:02.511 --> 05:03.887
What happened here?

05:05.847 --> 05:07.182
Science, I guess?

05:07.182 --> 05:11.186
Last time I checked,
science didn't require illegal equipment.

05:11.186 --> 05:16.232
Nor was this approved by the Academy.
Who authorized your research?

05:16.232 --> 05:19.528
It was an independent study.
Who are you anyway?

05:19.528 --> 05:21.905
I'm assistant to the Dean of the Academy,

05:21.905 --> 05:25.158
who it may serve you to remember
is also head of the Council.

05:25.158 --> 05:30.080
He sent me here to ensure
that anything dangerous is removed safely.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.625
Which, according to my list, includes you.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.794
What? How am I dangerous?

05:35.794 --> 05:38.171
Uh, that's for the council to decide.

06:07.826 --> 06:10.787
Imprisonment. What a curious principle.

06:10.787 --> 06:14.666
We confine the physical body,
yet the mind is still free.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.960
I do love a good conundrum.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.881
I remember the first time
I saw you at the Academy.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.799
You reminded me of myself.

06:22.799 --> 06:27.679
A scientist ready to forge
a new vector of experimentation.

06:28.514 --> 06:31.349
But sometimes we venture too far.

06:31.349 --> 06:35.020
No great science
should ever put lives in danger.

06:35.854 --> 06:39.315
Be honest, now.
What manner of inquiry was this?

06:39.315 --> 06:41.234
Professor Heimerdinger, I...

06:41.234 --> 06:44.237
I believe I've discovered
something truly incredible.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.657
A way to harness magic through science.

06:46.657 --> 06:47.658
Magic?

06:47.658 --> 06:48.742
Yes.

06:48.742 --> 06:49.868
No.

06:49.868 --> 06:50.869
No?

06:50.869 --> 06:53.163
The Arcane is dangerous, Jayce.

06:53.163 --> 06:56.166
A force of nature.
Science cannot control it.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.710
But maybe it can.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.421
I'm close to a breakthrough, I know it.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.173
How old are you, my boy?

07:04.090 --> 07:06.802
- I'm... I'm 24.
- Ah.

07:07.553 --> 07:10.430
Well, I am now 307 years old.

07:10.430 --> 07:14.560
All my life,
I've pursued the mysteries of science,

07:14.560 --> 07:18.605
only to discover
some are better left unsolved.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.775
This, I'm afraid, is one of them.

07:21.775 --> 07:25.821
Own your mistakes before the Council,
admit your work was dangerous,

07:25.821 --> 07:28.657
but speak nothing of magic.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.202
Do that and I theorize you'll get away

07:32.202 --> 07:34.955
with, um, how do you say,
a slap on the wrist.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.022
Remind me why we bother with this dump.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.651
Vander said to lay low.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.071
Enforcers never come down here,
so this is as good a place as any.

08:08.071 --> 08:11.867
Oh, what's the matter, Mylo?
You worried Powder's gonna beat you again?

08:11.867 --> 08:14.285
Hey, if she didn't keep
fixing these things,

08:14.285 --> 08:15.453
I wouldn't keep missing.

08:26.757 --> 08:29.593
You guys know I wouldn't take you
on a job you couldn't handle, right?

08:29.593 --> 08:32.303
Are you kidding?
That was the best job we've ever done.

08:33.805 --> 08:35.807
Maybe just don't take Powder next time.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.559
Um...

08:58.955 --> 09:01.166
- Get back.

09:01.166 --> 09:05.003
- Tell me where I can find them.
- Topsider business ain't my concern.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.463
It's every one
of you trencher's concern now.

09:07.463 --> 09:09.132
Give me a name.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.475
- Hey, guys? You should see this--

09:30.529 --> 09:31.487
Search them.

09:36.827 --> 09:39.162
Go ahead, idiots. We've got nothing.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.353
-  Stop!

10:03.353 --> 10:04.730
Get them!

10:14.364 --> 10:16.658
-  Come on!

10:23.582 --> 10:24.625
Get them!

10:35.051 --> 10:35.969
Over here!

10:47.022 --> 10:50.066
- You need to hide those crystals.
-  Yeah, no shit.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.655
The House Ferros received your letter.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.364
They insist business is steady.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.158
Steady is stagnant, Elora.

10:58.158 --> 11:01.369
They wished me to remind you
that it's thanks to their innovations

11:01.369 --> 11:03.371
that you are the richest person
in Piltover.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.708
Yet I remain the poorest Medarda.

11:06.708 --> 11:10.336
Excellent choice, Councilor Medarda.
Supreme challenge.

11:10.336 --> 11:14.508
- If I may...
- We need something revolutionary, Elora.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.468
Something to put Piltover on the map.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.932
- What of today's trial?
- His name is Jayce of House Talis.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.142
A House? Remind me.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.435
They're toolmakers.

11:25.435 --> 11:28.229
I believe they came to renown
for their design of the...

11:28.229 --> 11:30.857
- collapsible pocket wrench.

11:30.857 --> 11:34.194
- But Heimerdinger favors him?
- As far as I can tell.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.571
Hmm.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.405
This one.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.574
But that's...

11:38.574 --> 11:41.034
Well, that's a child's toy.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.620
Good.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.000
The boy's got ambition.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.836
It's why we supported him
in the first place.

11:50.836 --> 11:53.714
Ambition?
Darling, he nearly blew up our daughter.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.800
Jayce had nothing
to do with that. He was robbed.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.385
- We need to help him.
-  Caitlyn's right.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.388
We've known Jayce for years.
Besides, we're his patrons.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.517
If anyone is meant
to speak up for him, it's us.

12:06.602 --> 12:10.188
We should hit them back.
We've got the numbers to beat them.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.357
Yeah. Let's teach them
what it means to mess with us.

12:12.357 --> 12:13.650
Yeah!

12:20.657 --> 12:23.493
- You sure that's what you want?
-  Let's do it.

12:24.119 --> 12:27.831
We crossed that bridge once before,
and we all know how that ended.

12:27.831 --> 12:29.625
You're just protecting your kids.

12:31.251 --> 12:35.839
I'm protecting our people.
I'd do the same for any one of you.

12:35.839 --> 12:39.467
We look out for each other.
It's the way it's always been.

12:40.176 --> 12:43.680
This will blow over.
We just need to stand together.

12:43.680 --> 12:47.475
The Vander I knew,
the one who built the underground,

12:47.475 --> 12:49.477
wouldn't be afraid to fight.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.485
- Do I look afraid?
- No.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.613
You look weak.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.452
Why isn't he doing anything?

13:06.452 --> 13:09.122
We kicked the Enforcers' butts
with just the four of us.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.082
Imagine what the whole
of the Lanes could do.

13:11.082 --> 13:14.920
- Jeez, even Powder wants to fight.
- So, why aren't we?

13:23.554 --> 13:24.930
Spill it, Ekko.

13:24.930 --> 13:25.931
Um...

13:25.931 --> 13:31.645
Oh, okay. Well, um, Vander's got a deal
with the Enforcers.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.313
What deal?

13:50.956 --> 13:52.833
For your birthday, Councilor.

13:52.833 --> 13:56.211
Ah, Mel, this is too kind.

13:56.211 --> 13:59.631
I'm told it was built only
for the sharpest of minds.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.759
And I bought you some Ginko nuts.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.053
Don't you know I'm allergic?

14:05.053 --> 14:06.179
What are you trying to do?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.430
- Kill an old man?

14:39.921 --> 14:41.673
Jayce Talis.

14:44.300 --> 14:49.389
You are accused of illegal experimentation
and endangering the citizens of Piltover.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.058
What do you have to say for yourself?

14:56.772 --> 15:00.776
The materials were far more dangerous
than I was aware of,

15:00.776 --> 15:05.488
and I... I now know my actions
were against Academy regulations.

15:05.488 --> 15:10.201
What I did endangered people.
It was reckless, and for that, I'm sorry.

15:10.201 --> 15:15.290
I ask the Council's forgiveness,
and I hope that I can continue my studies.

15:15.290 --> 15:19.377
As Jayce's patron of many years,
I can speak for his character.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.087
I believe that one day,

15:21.087 --> 15:23.423
he will be a great contributor
to our society.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.592
He destroyed a building.

15:25.592 --> 15:29.345
Is this the sort of contribution
we can expect?

15:29.345 --> 15:30.722
If you were a scientist,

15:30.722 --> 15:34.350
you'd know you can't make a prototype
without breaking a few wrenches.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.188
Do you have anything to show
for your work besides an explosion?

15:38.188 --> 15:40.857
Uh, no. It came to nothing.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.569
So, you're saying
your study was meaningless?

15:43.569 --> 15:46.530
- It was revolutionary!
- Revolutionary how?

15:46.530 --> 15:50.200
All I see is a boy meddling with things
he doesn't understand.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.994
The Academy seems
to have loosened its standards.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.622
This is a fine line.
If we condone this, what's next?

15:55.622 --> 15:56.915
Ridiculous, really.

15:56.915 --> 15:58.875
The Council has more
important matters to deal with.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.002
Perhaps we should just finish this...

16:01.002 --> 16:03.797
I was trying to create magic.

16:09.970 --> 16:10.971
Magic?

16:10.971 --> 16:13.724
Arcane talents are something
you're born with.

16:13.724 --> 16:15.976
They can't be fabricated.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.019
Actually, I believe it is possible.

16:18.854 --> 16:21.231
Has anyone even tried it before?

16:24.109 --> 16:28.989
The Arcane is the curse of our world.
My race was nearly destroyed by it.

16:28.989 --> 16:33.368
Surely, we, the pioneers of science,
can use it for good.

16:33.368 --> 16:37.330
We're the champions of discovery.
Why fear it when we can master it?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.373
Jayce, enough.

16:38.373 --> 16:42.418
This is the city of progress,
think of the wonders we could create.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.546
- Let me prove--
-  Enough!

16:45.672 --> 16:47.883
You don't understand what's at stake.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.385
But how can you?

16:51.052 --> 16:53.555
That's a burden that only I here carry.

16:54.598 --> 16:55.807
Time.

16:57.893 --> 17:01.062
<i>I've seen this power in the wrong hands.</i>

17:01.563 --> 17:07.193
<i>It corrupts, consumes,
lays waste to civilizations.</i>

17:09.404 --> 17:13.491
That cannot happen here, my boy.
It must not.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.369
Heimerdinger is right.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.956
Piltover was founded to escape
the warmongering of mages,

17:19.956 --> 17:22.292
- not cultivate it.

17:22.292 --> 17:26.254
The Ethos is clear.
He must be banished from Piltover.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.551
Please, let me speak!

17:35.597 --> 17:38.892
As a lower house, my voice
doesn't carry much weight here.

17:38.892 --> 17:42.521
But as a mother,
I have a voice that matters deeply.

17:43.564 --> 17:46.316
My son isn't in his right mind.

17:47.108 --> 17:50.028
His entire life,
he's chased an impossible dream.

17:50.987 --> 17:55.075
What he did was, uh, foolish and unwise.

17:55.909 --> 18:00.288
But he has a good heart.
Please, let him come home.

18:00.288 --> 18:04.751
A crime like this can't be overlooked.
The boy must be punished.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.254
A violation of the Ethos
calls for banishment,

18:08.254 --> 18:12.342
but I can sympathize with a young man's
dream to change the world.

18:12.926 --> 18:16.680
Perhaps in this matter,
a lesser sentence may suffice.

18:16.680 --> 18:20.726
I move that Jayce be summarily expelled
from the Academy

18:20.726 --> 18:23.645
and remanded to the care of his parents.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.480
All those in favor?

18:41.454 --> 18:44.082
You may take your son home, Mrs. Talis,

18:44.082 --> 18:47.544
but he is to never set foot
on Academy grounds again.

19:20.952 --> 19:25.456
First time I've been invited to the Lanes.
It better be worth my time.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.252
Ah, you see, that's your weakness, Marcus.

19:29.252 --> 19:33.507
You carry your chin so high,
you fail to see the opportunity below.

19:33.507 --> 19:34.716
Who are you?

19:35.258 --> 19:37.761
You're looking for four children,

19:37.761 --> 19:40.889
the ones running circles
around Piltover's finest.

19:40.889 --> 19:42.223
What about it?

19:42.891 --> 19:47.187
Don't look so concerned.
I'm about to make your day.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.617
-  Can I come in?

20:04.496 --> 20:05.664
Hmm.

20:06.164 --> 20:10.043
I still remember the look on your face
when you found these.

20:13.589 --> 20:18.301
Jayce, please. If I hadn't spoken,
you'd be lost to me.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.221
I had to say something.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.057
Magic saved your life.

20:24.600 --> 20:30.146
Yes, but it won't save yours now.
You need to let it go.

20:30.731 --> 20:32.733
I could've convinced the Council.

20:33.233 --> 20:36.945
If my own family won't help me,
I'll find someone who will.

20:48.123 --> 20:50.291
Oh. That foolish boy.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.504
Yeah, I must admit,
his theory intrigues.

20:53.504 --> 20:56.089
If dangerous ideas
didn't excite the imagination,

20:56.089 --> 20:57.758
we would never wander astray.

20:57.758 --> 21:02.804
Could it work? Could these stones
really invoke magic?

21:02.804 --> 21:05.223
Nonsense. It's far too unstable.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.308
Could you stabilize it?

21:07.308 --> 21:09.561
Me? Why would I?

21:09.561 --> 21:11.437
That only leads to more problems,

21:11.437 --> 21:13.732
and that poor boy
has enough of them already.

21:13.732 --> 21:18.779
There. Come tomorrow morning,
his research will be safely disposed of.

21:19.487 --> 21:20.446
Lock up.

21:21.823 --> 21:26.703
No, no, no. Magic is far too dangerous
in the wrong hands.

21:30.541 --> 21:31.917
Will he live?

21:32.918 --> 21:34.169
Long enough.

21:44.429 --> 21:45.972
Beautiful, aren't they?

21:47.683 --> 21:51.477
Yet, up there on the surface,

21:51.477 --> 21:53.772
no one even knows they exist.

21:54.523 --> 21:55.982
They're monsters.

21:59.528 --> 22:01.279
There's a monster inside all of us.

22:03.073 --> 22:06.910
What? No. No, no! It'll kill me!

22:10.163 --> 22:13.166
I'd like to let you in
on a very important secret

22:13.166 --> 22:15.794
I learned when I was about your age, boy.

22:17.629 --> 22:19.840
You see, power,

22:20.423 --> 22:24.553
real power doesn't come to those
who were born strongest,

22:24.553 --> 22:27.180
or fastest, or smartest.

22:28.223 --> 22:29.766
No.

22:29.766 --> 22:35.271
It comes to those
who will do anything to achieve it.

22:37.190 --> 22:40.819
- It's time to let the monster out.

23:26.156 --> 23:27.574
They won't see you.

23:28.825 --> 23:30.368
Your name's no good now.

23:31.411 --> 23:36.625
My dad says you're a misfit,
and that we can't be friends anymore.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.044
So, why are you out here?

23:40.295 --> 23:42.714
I'm a misfit too, I suppose.

23:43.757 --> 23:44.925
What will you do?

23:47.010 --> 23:49.429
Join the Talis hammer business, I guess.

23:49.429 --> 23:51.139
You can't do that.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.475
No, I can't.

23:56.853 --> 24:00.023
Come inside, Caitlyn. Now.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.701
I'm sorry. I just wanted to explain...

24:10.701 --> 24:12.327
I think you've done enough.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.294
<i>You said this was a robbery.</i>

24:21.294 --> 24:23.839
- Did they take anything dangerous?
-  Hard to say.

24:23.839 --> 24:27.718
We don't exactly know what we did find,
let alone what we didn't.

24:27.718 --> 24:31.179
This mention of magic
has the people afraid.

24:31.179 --> 24:33.640
The culprits must be apprehended.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.392
We're doing our best, Councilor.
I assure you.

24:36.392 --> 24:40.522
Your attitude makes me question
if your best is up to the task.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.398
Oh, we'll find them. Don't worry.

24:42.398 --> 24:47.112
We've conducted exhaustive interrogations,
frozen commerce for half the district.

24:47.112 --> 24:48.822
With all due respect, Councilor,

24:48.822 --> 24:51.658
don't you think
we've pushed them hard enough?

24:51.658 --> 24:53.910
Do whatever it takes.

24:53.910 --> 24:56.705
Turn the undercity upside down
if you have to.

24:56.705 --> 24:58.790
Just find them!

25:10.927 --> 25:12.888
Welcome to The Last Drop.

25:21.396 --> 25:24.065
- What can I get you?
- Four sump-rats will do.

25:26.067 --> 25:27.027
Search the place.

25:31.197 --> 25:34.993
While you're wasting your time,
how about a proper drink?

25:34.993 --> 25:37.287
I'll take the strongest shit you got.

26:37.097 --> 26:39.683
Mm. You be careful with that.

26:41.351 --> 26:44.354
Nearly forgot.
I ran into an old friend of yours.

26:44.354 --> 26:46.690
He had some stories.

26:56.491 --> 26:59.077
You weren't always the peacekeeper,
were you?

27:02.080 --> 27:06.209
Yeah, well,
you can't escape the past. Right?

27:07.210 --> 27:09.588
Be a shame if I had to put them on again.

27:10.631 --> 27:14.259
Cast iron's, well, it's hard to clean.

28:07.604 --> 28:10.023
You people down here are all the same,

28:10.023 --> 28:12.609
mistaking arrogance for bravery.

28:13.193 --> 28:15.737
You think you're standing up
for something,

28:15.737 --> 28:17.405
but we all know there is a crime

28:17.405 --> 28:20.366
behind every coin
that passes through this place.

28:23.119 --> 28:27.666
You're just a small man
in a little hole the world forgot to bury.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.962
And I'm gonna bury the lot of you.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.310
- Are you all okay?

28:47.310 --> 28:49.813
No, we're not okay.
They almost saw Powder.

28:49.813 --> 28:52.941
- What if they took her?
- No one is taking any of you.

28:52.941 --> 28:56.152
- Never let that happen.
- It's already happening.

28:56.152 --> 28:59.656
You heard him, they won't stop.
We need to fight back.

29:01.658 --> 29:04.745
And if you won't, I will.

29:07.498 --> 29:09.666
I've heard this kind of talk before.

29:38.153 --> 29:39.237
Why are we here?

29:41.197 --> 29:42.991
You still don't understand.

29:42.991 --> 29:46.411
What I don't understand
is how you can work with them.

29:47.287 --> 29:49.831
We were here. We saw what they did.

29:50.707 --> 29:55.962
I grew up knowing I'm less than them,
that my place is down there.

29:56.838 --> 30:01.051
I want Powder to have more than that,
and I'm willing to fight for it.

30:02.385 --> 30:07.348
So was I. I was angry, just like you.

30:07.348 --> 30:12.187
I led us across this bridge,
thinking things could change.

30:13.939 --> 30:15.148
If I hadn't...

30:15.982 --> 30:19.069
your parents would still be alive.

30:20.571 --> 30:24.490
I know you wanna hurt the topsiders
for what they've done to us.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.868
But who are you willing to lose?

30:26.868 --> 30:29.496
Mylo? Claggor?

30:30.413 --> 30:31.748
Powder?

30:38.463 --> 30:41.132
Nobody wins in war, Vi.

30:48.473 --> 30:49.474
What are we gonna do?

30:50.976 --> 30:52.435
The Enforcers will come back.

30:54.145 --> 30:59.484
I... I don't know.
I'll, uh, I'll figure it out.

31:50.827 --> 31:51.995
Am I interrupting?

31:55.874 --> 32:01.046
The hell's your problem? What's that?
Another list with my name on it?

32:01.046 --> 32:05.216
Actually, yes,
but only because you signed your notes.

32:05.216 --> 32:10.180
Every page, I might add.
Eh, a little egotistical, don't you think?

32:10.180 --> 32:12.808
Is that why you came? To insult me?

32:14.142 --> 32:18.814
No, no, I was... I was intrigued
by what you said at the trial.

32:18.814 --> 32:20.649
That makes you the only one.

32:20.649 --> 32:23.151
Yes, well, I wanted
to talk about your work.

32:23.151 --> 32:25.904
This Hextech theory of yours.

32:25.904 --> 32:27.739
It's not a theory.

32:27.739 --> 32:33.244
I saw with my own eyes what magic can do,
the lives it could save.

32:33.244 --> 32:36.206
You've no idea how beautiful it is.

32:37.624 --> 32:41.086
And now it's gone. No one believed me.

32:42.170 --> 32:44.214
Nobody's ever believed in me.

32:45.632 --> 32:47.801
A poor cripple from the undercity.

32:48.885 --> 32:51.680
I was an outsider the moment
I stepped foot in Piltover.

32:52.639 --> 32:56.434
I didn't have the benefits
of a patron or a name.

32:57.393 --> 32:59.187
I simply believed in myself.

33:00.480 --> 33:04.943
Which is why I'm here
because I think you're on to something.

33:05.569 --> 33:08.404
I want to help you complete your research.

33:08.404 --> 33:10.574
No one thinks it can be done.

33:11.617 --> 33:15.662
When you're going to change the world,
don't ask for permission.

33:30.218 --> 33:31.845
I don't even know your name.

33:33.138 --> 33:34.430
It's Viktor.

33:41.938 --> 33:44.816
- Vi, where you been?
- Rumor is the Lanes are gonna fight.

33:51.823 --> 33:53.742
Look, I made them for the Enforcers.

33:53.742 --> 33:57.120
These are smoke bombs,
and those two are full of nails.

33:58.664 --> 34:01.374
They're gonna work this time, I know it.

34:03.043 --> 34:04.085
Me too.

34:11.885 --> 34:15.931
You know, Powder,
what makes you different makes you strong.

34:16.807 --> 34:18.642
Always remember that, okay?

34:26.357 --> 34:29.986
What the hell were you thinking,
going into The Last Drop?

34:29.986 --> 34:33.990
- Do you have any idea what you've done?
- I was getting results!

34:33.990 --> 34:36.492
-  You heard the Council.
- You're a fool.

34:36.492 --> 34:38.870
There is no stopping what happens now.

34:44.918 --> 34:46.712
Maybe it's not too late.
