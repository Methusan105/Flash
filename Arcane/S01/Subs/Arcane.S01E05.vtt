WEBVTT

00:43.835 --> 00:45.796
- Hmm.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.266
That was quite some shooting, Kiramman.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.228
Did my parents pay you to let me win?

01:43.854 --> 01:46.732
Hmm... That's a serious accusation.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.109
You held your shot, I saw you.

01:50.276 --> 01:52.654
The trophy is yours. You earned it.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.156
You haven't answered my question.

01:55.866 --> 01:59.119
No, your parents didn't pay me.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.996
I just thought you deserved it.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.127
I'm an enforcer.

02:07.669 --> 02:12.007
For me, knowing how to handle this weapon
means being able to protect people.

02:12.633 --> 02:16.512
To be of service to the city.
And that's trophy enough.

02:17.137 --> 02:21.349
Begs the question, young Kiramman.
What are you shooting for?

02:31.276 --> 02:32.736
I took a look at your file.

02:33.319 --> 02:37.282
There's no record of you or your crimes.
What are you here for?

02:37.282 --> 02:38.867
My sunny personality.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.370
You attacked an inmate. Why?

02:42.954 --> 02:43.789
Why not?

02:44.289 --> 02:47.167
He was a witness
in an ongoing investigation.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.710
Hmm, bummer.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.505
This was a waste of time.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.506
Couldn't have put it better.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.801
Hey, give Silco a kiss
on that winning eye of his, will you?

02:58.845 --> 03:00.847
Silco? The industrialist?

03:01.347 --> 03:03.016
Okay, this is getting old.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.435
Can you just send in whoever's gonna kick
the shit out of me,

03:05.435 --> 03:06.937
so I can get on with my night?

03:14.319 --> 03:15.862
Does this mean anything to you?

03:21.702 --> 03:23.161
- Where did you get this?

03:25.539 --> 03:29.793
- My question first. He worked for Silco?
- Uh, they all do.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.128
How can anyone not know that?
Where did you find this?

03:32.754 --> 03:35.632
There was an attack. This is evidence.

03:36.132 --> 03:39.595
I need proof if I'm to believe
what you're saying about Silco.

03:40.512 --> 03:44.140
I could get it for you.
Just not from in here.

03:46.184 --> 03:49.187
In what mad world
would I trust someone like you?

03:49.187 --> 03:50.897
Someone like me?

03:50.897 --> 03:55.151
You enforcers are all the same.
Just asshole criminals in fancy uniforms.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.028
You know what? Find Silco yourself.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.488
I will, thank you.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.908
Hmm... Undercity's gonna eat you alive.

04:08.331 --> 04:11.877
I've got orders from Councilor Talis,
concerning Inmate 516.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.588
Not cooperative, huh?

04:15.255 --> 04:18.091
You, uh, you want us
to have a chat with her?

04:18.967 --> 04:20.552
- No.
- Oh.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.679
It's for her release.

04:23.179 --> 04:26.099
Huh. Since when's he a Councilor?

04:26.099 --> 04:27.809
Since today.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.566
How many chats have you had with her?

04:36.359 --> 04:39.445
You know, I never even thought to count.

05:16.441 --> 05:19.778

05:19.778 --> 05:22.823

06:12.831 --> 06:15.542
These brave Enforcers
sacrificed their lives

06:15.542 --> 06:17.753
to defend the values of our great city.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.381
To some, they are mothers...

06:23.216 --> 06:26.261
fathers, sons...

06:29.640 --> 06:30.641
daughters...

06:32.643 --> 06:36.187
but to all, they are heroes.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.215
Who was this, Daddy?

07:11.056 --> 07:12.015
A good woman.

07:15.268 --> 07:21.107
You said you could control her.
I lost six officers. Six!

07:22.776 --> 07:26.446
She pushed it too far this time.
The Council's up in arms.

07:26.446 --> 07:30.534
I can't make this go away for you
unless you give me something to work with.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.995
- Arresting her would be doing you a favor.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.413
I don't need favors.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.333
I need you to do your job.

07:42.170 --> 07:45.048
The Firelights have been a thorn
in both our sides.

07:45.048 --> 07:49.010
They ambushed my shipment at the Hexgates
on the same day as the attack.

07:49.553 --> 07:53.139
It seems to me
the Council has its culprit.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.433
Oh, that's tidy for you.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.478
What if I'm not interested
in playing along?

07:59.855 --> 08:03.984
We've accomplished a lot together, Marcus.
Sheriff.

08:04.735 --> 08:07.028
And there is more yet to achieve.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.490
I hope you can remain a part of it.

08:16.580 --> 08:21.334
For their families.
From an anonymous, concerned citizen.

08:37.768 --> 08:40.061
Yesterday's smuggling fiasco was nothing.

08:40.061 --> 08:43.023
These manifests are full of discrepancies,
dating back months.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.108
This is a poor use of our time.

08:45.734 --> 08:46.985
I'm a Councilor now, Viktor.

08:46.985 --> 08:50.488
It's my responsibility to make sure
the Hexgates are safe and protected.

08:50.488 --> 08:55.536
What about our pledge to improve lives,
for those in need? For the undercity?

08:57.162 --> 09:00.541
Look, I'm sorry I didn't announce
our other projects in my speech.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.751
- Soon, we can do everything we--
- Soon?

09:02.751 --> 09:06.087
There are people
who need our help now, Jayce.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.799
You wanted to see me?

09:09.299 --> 09:10.884
Have your people ever reviewed these logs?

09:11.510 --> 09:13.386
- Mr. Talis, I assure you--
- Councilor.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.055
And the only assurance I need is that

09:15.055 --> 09:17.558
you will search and seize
any unauthorized merchandise.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.268
I've made a list
of suspicious transactions.

09:20.936 --> 09:22.270
All due respect, Councilor,

09:22.270 --> 09:24.064
- today's your first day--
- Second.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.231
Right.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.609
You sure you don't want to confer
with the other Councilors before--

09:27.609 --> 09:29.945
This corruption runs deep, Sheriff.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.738
I intend to root it out.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.450
Have you made any progress
with the stolen Gemstone?

09:35.450 --> 09:39.663
- Yes. Chief suspect is an undercity gang.

09:39.663 --> 09:41.289
They call themselves the Firelights.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.833
They operate like phantoms,

09:42.833 --> 09:45.711
doing hit-and-runs on civilians
and disappearing into the night.

09:45.711 --> 09:49.255
-  How soon till we track them down?
-  I've got my best officers on it.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.851
Viktor? You all right?

10:01.768 --> 10:05.772
A... a headache. I just...
I need to get to the lab.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.115
Boring...

10:15.741 --> 10:19.494
Boring. Wow. Super boring...

10:22.330 --> 10:23.790
Here we go!

10:24.958 --> 10:27.168
It's all about these runes.

10:27.168 --> 10:32.423
They form some kind of math-y,
magic-y gateway.

10:33.008 --> 10:38.639
To the realm of heebie-jeebies.
And this... Turns it on.

10:39.931 --> 10:42.142
So... here goes.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.382
No!

11:14.966 --> 11:18.219
No! It was a mistake! It was a mistake.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.355
I heard the bathysphere has a nice view.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.693
That could be a good way
to get a lay of the land.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.195
Too risky.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.281
What...

12:50.854 --> 12:52.981
- Nice jacket.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.122
Welcome to the Lanes.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.582
You almost got me killed.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.751
My little sister could do that
when she was seven.

13:12.751 --> 13:15.253
All us fissure folk can.
Don't you want to blend in?

13:26.598 --> 13:27.933
You had a vision?

13:27.933 --> 13:30.351
What if we've been looking at it
backwards?

13:30.351 --> 13:33.354
We've been trying to discover
runes that invoke specific effects

13:33.354 --> 13:35.857
and then molding them
to a useful function.

13:35.857 --> 13:38.527
Tools, as you like to put it. But, but...

13:38.527 --> 13:43.448
If the legends are true,
mages aren't bound to single functions.

13:43.448 --> 13:46.201
It's said the Arcane speaks through them.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.037
I'm still not following.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.540
They think. They adapt.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.292
You think Hextech can... learn?

13:59.631 --> 14:01.049
Are you sure this is safe?

14:01.049 --> 14:02.467
Of course not.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.986
Oh, Jericho! Have I missed these.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.783
Hmm?

14:27.283 --> 14:28.368
No. Thank you.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.203
You're missing out.

14:30.996 --> 14:32.330
Are you going to question him?

14:32.330 --> 14:34.249
About what? The meat?

14:35.792 --> 14:37.460
Definitely not above board.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.881
Silco. His connections?
Isn't that why we're here?

14:40.881 --> 14:43.884
We're here because I'm hungry.
Do you know what prison food is like?

14:43.884 --> 14:45.594
No, of course, you don't.

14:46.386 --> 14:50.599
Unbelievable. I didn't break you
out of jail to eat... slop.

14:50.599 --> 14:54.686
I knew this was a terrible idea.
You don't actually know anything, do you?

14:55.186 --> 14:56.897
Mm. Better than I remember.

15:09.618 --> 15:10.827
Hmm.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.130
I haven't been here in years.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.174
Since my parents brought me
for the winter fest.

15:24.174 --> 15:27.636
We're not here for the performance.
Your House is in trouble.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.765
That merchant formerly enjoyed
certain leniencies

15:31.765 --> 15:36.645
with regard to her trade in exchange
for her generous Academy patronage.

15:36.645 --> 15:39.397
By leniencies you mean corruption?

15:39.397 --> 15:41.608
Hmm, Amara's harmless.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.027
Oh, look at those two stooges.

15:44.027 --> 15:47.197
Councilors Hoskel and Salo.
Don't they hate each other?

15:47.197 --> 15:50.951
Hmm. But they share a taste
for the finer Noxian spirits,

15:50.951 --> 15:53.870
technically an illegal import.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.914
I tightened our security.

15:55.914 --> 15:59.501
And in so doing,
put a target on your back.

16:00.168 --> 16:04.631
There are those who covet your power
over the wealth the Hexgates afford.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.676
And would take any opportunity
to seize it from you.

16:08.426 --> 16:11.137
You've just made yourself
everyone's common enemy, Jayce.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.006
<i>Oh, what's the matter, Mylo?</i>

16:46.006 --> 16:48.008
<i>You worried Powder's gonna beat you again.</i>

17:35.430 --> 17:36.472
<i>Vander.</i>

17:37.348 --> 17:39.184
<i>Because you're a jinx!</i>

17:40.852 --> 17:42.563
<i>What makes you different makes you strong.</i>

18:35.907 --> 18:37.367
Hmm.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.621
Well, that place does look like
it has bodies buried in the basement.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.208
You don't know anything.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.974
I can't compromise the safety
of the Hexgates for collateral.

19:00.974 --> 19:05.562
No one's asking you to.
These are simply favors amongst friends.

19:05.562 --> 19:09.274
I never wanted anything to do
with politics. You pushed this on me.

19:09.274 --> 19:12.653
You're a symbol of the future now, Jayce,
whether you like it or not.

19:12.653 --> 19:16.072
With that comes the potential
to shape your own destiny.

19:16.823 --> 19:21.662
The Council assumes you'll fail.
Time to prove them all wrong. Once again.

19:24.623 --> 19:27.125
Welcome, Amara. How's little Rohan?

19:27.125 --> 19:30.546
Councilor Medarda. Councilor Talis.

19:31.171 --> 19:34.049
He's just as precocious as ever.

19:36.217 --> 19:40.847
I had quite a shock this morning.
Enforcers banging on my door.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.976
Oh, I hope you'll understand,
Jayce had to make a show of safety.

19:44.976 --> 19:48.647
But he's here now to negotiate
all his deals personally.

19:49.147 --> 19:52.233
Councilor Talis is willing to reinstate
former trade privileges

19:52.233 --> 19:54.235
to those who share his vision.

19:54.235 --> 19:55.987
Can we count you amongst them?

19:55.987 --> 19:59.825
Councilor Bolbok seems to think other
arrangements would be more profitable.

19:59.825 --> 20:01.660
The man's a fool.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.870
With him, you'd be investing in the past.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.790
With us, you'd be investing in the future.

20:09.125 --> 20:12.504
You know, Councilor Medarda's right.
The Hexgates are only the beginning.

20:13.129 --> 20:16.925
In fact, we're currently looking
for new partners in our Hextech research,

20:16.925 --> 20:19.052
and as a supporter of House Talis,

20:19.052 --> 20:22.097
you'd be the first in line
to any of our advancements.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.564
How can I say no
to such an auspicious offer?

20:33.358 --> 20:34.860
Hextech partners?

20:35.360 --> 20:36.486
Has a nice ring, doesn't it?

20:37.070 --> 20:40.574
Mm. Your audience awaits, Councilor.

20:47.288 --> 20:48.665
He's been quite the investment.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.793
Indeed. Better than expected.

21:40.050 --> 21:42.343
The one place all the secrets are spilled.

22:00.696 --> 22:02.363
Oh.

22:03.574 --> 22:06.367
How exactly do you propose
we go about this?

22:06.367 --> 22:09.037
-  Let 'em think you work here.

22:09.705 --> 22:10.956
Excuse me?

22:11.582 --> 22:12.624
I will not.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.501
You know what your problem is?

22:14.501 --> 22:16.086
Please. Tell me.

22:16.086 --> 22:18.547
You expect everyone
to give you what you want.

22:18.547 --> 22:20.215
If you really want people to talk to you,

22:20.215 --> 22:23.426
you have to let them think
you have what they want.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.095
And what do I have?

22:27.556 --> 22:29.182
You're hot, cupcake.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.645
So what'll it be, man or woman?

22:33.645 --> 22:35.981
- Um...

22:37.148 --> 22:38.024
Hi.

22:38.024 --> 22:41.152
I'm Pim. What's your name?

22:41.152 --> 22:47.158
Matilda. But you can call her
whatever you want.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.746
Ah, yes. Matilda.

22:50.746 --> 22:54.040
My parents named me Matilda.

22:54.040 --> 22:58.253
After my great-grandmother Matilda,
the, uh...

23:02.132 --> 23:03.174
Would you believe it?

23:10.891 --> 23:14.144
Sheriff, what a lovely surprise.

23:15.145 --> 23:17.272
The Hextech wonder boy
is on the Council now,

23:18.064 --> 23:19.983
and he's asking questions.

23:20.526 --> 23:22.653
It's only a matter of time
before he finds the truth.

23:23.904 --> 23:26.156
What is truth, but a survivor's story?

23:26.156 --> 23:29.075
If I'm discovered, we're both finished.

23:29.951 --> 23:33.079
Good thing you've located proof
of the Firelights' involvement.

23:39.419 --> 23:40.754
This has gone too far.

23:43.882 --> 23:47.135
Hmm? Imagining yourself a hero?

23:47.636 --> 23:52.140
One final act to make you the martyr
you've always seen yourself as?

24:00.566 --> 24:02.483
Then what are you waiting for?

24:15.455 --> 24:17.499
- Ah, he's faltering.

24:17.499 --> 24:20.001
You need to weaponize the Hextech soon.

24:20.502 --> 24:24.339
Once we've cracked their prize,
topside will have no power over us.

24:24.923 --> 24:28.802
I can't do it.
Just... give it to the doctor.

24:28.802 --> 24:31.805
You're the only one
I can trust with this, Jinx.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.934
I keep... seeing them. That day.

24:40.355 --> 24:43.066
Fear haunts us all, child.

24:45.110 --> 24:49.155
Sweetheart, I was real sad
to hear about Vander.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.618
And the kids. Just terrible.

24:52.618 --> 24:55.411
By the looks of it, no one down here
lifted a finger to stop Silco.

24:55.954 --> 25:01.167
A few tried but Silco's got the muscle...
and the money.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.711
He took over the Last Drop.

25:03.378 --> 25:04.212
I saw.

25:04.921 --> 25:07.591
Things have changed
without Vander looking out for us.

25:08.299 --> 25:11.970
Have you heard anything about Powder?
I think Silco has her.

25:14.097 --> 25:15.390
I have to find her.

25:17.142 --> 25:19.227
Silco's number two's a regular.

25:19.728 --> 25:21.980
I can have Miguel tell you
where to find her.

25:22.898 --> 25:24.065
I owe you.

25:27.110 --> 25:28.153
It's nothing.

25:31.990 --> 25:34.367
I've only ever imagined the gardens...

25:34.367 --> 25:36.244
This is all I've seen.

25:50.258 --> 25:51.217
You did well today.

25:52.093 --> 25:53.261
I had a good teacher.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.223
It's only a matter of time
before those old fools on the Council

25:57.223 --> 25:59.225
- officially accept your research.

26:00.852 --> 26:03.021
My father put hammers
in the hands of the people,

26:03.021 --> 26:05.315
and they built this magnificent city.

26:05.982 --> 26:09.485
Imagine the wonders they could create
if we put magic in their hands.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.238
The world will never be the same.

26:14.365 --> 26:16.535
The Medardas usually only take
from the world.

26:17.410 --> 26:20.205
We're not often in the position
to give anything back.

26:22.207 --> 26:23.667
I couldn't have done it without you.

26:27.588 --> 26:28.755
Hmm.

26:52.487 --> 26:53.947
It's beautiful.

26:53.947 --> 26:56.533
I can't figure out why it's not working.

26:56.533 --> 26:57.659
You will.

26:59.953 --> 27:03.874
Are you headed home soon?
I thought we could walk together.

27:04.374 --> 27:07.252
I'm, uh, probably going
to sleep here tonight.

27:07.753 --> 27:11.339
Again? You know
there's always tomorrow, right?

27:12.173 --> 27:13.717
Good night, Miss Young.

28:09.690 --> 28:10.732
Mm.

28:59.531 --> 29:01.575
I almost drowned in these waters.

29:01.575 --> 29:04.285
You told me a million times.

29:04.285 --> 29:07.288
Vander wasn't the man
you thought he was.

29:07.288 --> 29:09.875
Right, he was like a brother to you,

29:09.875 --> 29:13.378
and he turned his back
and blah, blah, blah.

29:13.378 --> 29:15.005
Did I miss anything?

29:15.005 --> 29:18.466
I've got a new one for you.

29:24.681 --> 29:28.476
That day, I let a weak man die.

29:37.318 --> 29:39.404
And another was reborn.

29:40.656 --> 29:46.578
Betrayal, that pain that feels like
it'll eat you from the inside out,

29:46.578 --> 29:51.416
can either break you or forge you
into something greater.

29:52.417 --> 29:54.961
You need to let Powder die.

29:55.754 --> 29:58.464
So the fear of pain
will no longer control you.

30:01.092 --> 30:05.013
You're strong now.
Just like you were always meant to be.

30:06.389 --> 30:07.516

32:03.339 --> 32:06.259

Vi?

32:30.158 --> 32:31.535
You filthy traitor.

32:32.035 --> 32:33.912
Vander had his chance.

33:00.606 --> 33:02.357
I see you never learned patience.

34:24.690 --> 34:27.776
Where's my sister?
Where's he keeping her?

34:27.776 --> 34:30.654
Keeping her? You mean Jinx?

34:32.363 --> 34:33.532
She works for him.

34:46.002 --> 34:47.420
She's like his daughter.

35:00.601 --> 35:02.102
I'll give her your regards.

35:27.002 --> 35:28.294
Why did you let her go?

35:28.294 --> 35:29.963
Do you ever say "thank you?"

35:29.963 --> 35:32.633
- He's gonna know we're here now.
- Whose fault is that?

35:38.764 --> 35:39.890
You're an all-right shot.

35:40.682 --> 35:42.267
I'm an excellent shot.

35:42.267 --> 35:45.061
You gonna help me out, cupcake?

35:45.646 --> 35:49.482
Stop calling me that. My name is Caitlyn.

35:49.482 --> 35:51.317
But you're so sweet.

35:51.818 --> 35:52.986
Like a cupcake.

35:52.986 --> 35:55.572
Shut up.

36:18.344 --> 36:19.846
You're making a mess.

36:39.575 --> 36:40.659
The sister.

36:41.284 --> 36:42.452
She's back.

36:45.121 --> 36:46.247
From the dead?
