WEBVTT

00:35.118 --> 00:36.286
You didn't have a choice.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.081
He knew what he was signing up for.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.002
We're done here.

00:44.586 --> 00:47.756
We haven't even scratched the surface.
Silco's still out there.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.761
Do you not understand?
I am part of this now!

00:54.304 --> 00:57.223
The next parents who get a message
their kid isn't coming home...

00:58.308 --> 01:00.060
I don't even know where to take it.

01:00.644 --> 01:02.062
Do we just leave him here?

01:02.813 --> 01:04.773
You've always been a part of this.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.442
You just never had to look it in the eye.
One dead kid?

01:07.442 --> 01:09.736
There's hundreds more where he came from,
thanks to Silco,

01:09.736 --> 01:12.739
and thanks to people like you
who stuck their heads in the dirt.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.076
- This is over.
- Not for me.

01:18.995 --> 01:20.747
Take those off.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.046
Make me.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.261
I can't let you leave with them.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.931
Then, I guess you're gonna need
to kill another trencher.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.824
You won't make it alone.

03:36.424 --> 03:39.469
Been a while
since topside's gotten this bold.

03:39.469 --> 03:43.431
Say what you want about the late Sheriff.
He had his uses.

03:43.431 --> 03:45.601
Too bad Jinx didn't think so.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.186
We'll buy another.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.355
You gonna do anything

03:50.355 --> 03:53.274
about that piece of shit
that murdered my boy?

03:53.274 --> 03:56.737
Let me guess, "Jinx will take care of it."

03:56.737 --> 04:00.156
Just like she's been taking care
of everything else.

04:01.282 --> 04:06.329
We all mourn the loss of your son, Renni.

04:06.872 --> 04:13.670
At least, we have the solace of knowing
he died fighting for our cause,

04:13.670 --> 04:20.426
instead of some petty personal dispute,
as so often occurs here.

04:20.426 --> 04:24.139
You're one to talk
about sacrificing for the cause.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.850
Where is Jinx anyhow?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.478
Help her with the body.

05:10.018 --> 05:10.852
<i>Viktor...</i>

05:11.477 --> 05:14.272
<i>I know this will probably
never see the light of day,</i>

05:14.856 --> 05:18.944
<i>but watching how you work so tirelessly
to make the world a better place...</i>

05:19.653 --> 05:22.823
<i>Well, I couldn't forgive myself
if I didn't try.</i>

05:24.783 --> 05:27.035
<i>Everyone's gotta do
their part, right?</i>

06:10.370 --> 06:11.454
Okay.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.182
Noxian wine is bold by comparison.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.768
The grapes are hardened by the climate.

06:32.768 --> 06:36.855
But then, so is everything
that manages to survive in Noxus.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.318
- Mel, would you like--

06:44.487 --> 06:46.823
- Leave.

06:52.704 --> 06:55.331
- Hmm.
- Stay away from Jayce!

06:55.331 --> 06:56.833
You really are fond of him.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.587
Better yet, march back to your ship
and get the hell out of my city.

07:02.005 --> 07:04.633
Get ahold of yourself.
I taught you better.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.109
We're in trouble, Mel.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.697
The man who killed your brother
doesn't believe the score is settled,

07:26.697 --> 07:28.990
and his resources exceed ours.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.578
If there is a chance Hextech
can be weaponized, we must have it.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.996
Piltover isn't your testing ground.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.749
I've only accelerated
the process you started.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.586
I wanted to protect the city
from people like you.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.798
I can't believe you'd start a war
just to cover your ass.

07:44.798 --> 07:48.384
I would set the world ablaze
to protect our family.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.636
No.

07:49.636 --> 07:53.807
I stopped being part of this family
the moment you cast me out.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.436
Why? Why did you do it?

07:59.229 --> 08:00.897
Because you weakened me!

08:00.897 --> 08:04.275
I couldn't endure the look in your eyes
whenever I made the decisions,

08:04.275 --> 08:07.362
the necessary decisions to keep us safe!

08:14.536 --> 08:15.954
We need that weapon, Mel.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.791
Let the war unfold.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.753
And you come home,

08:23.461 --> 08:25.296
take your place at my side.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.800
It's where you belong.

08:40.103 --> 08:41.271
I'm sorry.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.066
I don't know where you'd have preferred.

08:48.529 --> 08:49.445
I'm sorry.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.022
Am I interrupting?

09:36.952 --> 09:39.621
Remember the Distinguished Innovators
competition?

09:40.914 --> 09:44.000
I remember you notching gears
in the carriage over.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.088
They started cranking the engine
and the whole thing was rattling.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.465
I thought a loose cog
was gonna take someone's eye out.

09:51.717 --> 09:53.426
At least, you didn't throw up.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.097
Everything made sense then.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.143
You have to destroy it.

10:03.729 --> 10:04.563
I know.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.189
The Hexcore.

10:08.692 --> 10:11.319
I... I can't do it.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.906
You have to. Please.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.620
What about your disease?

10:19.620 --> 10:21.705
- Without the Hexcore--

10:23.206 --> 10:24.916
Promise me.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.380
Okay. Okay.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.423
I promise.

10:34.217 --> 10:37.137
We lost ourselves. Lost our dream.

10:37.721 --> 10:42.684
In the pursuit of great,
we failed to do good.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.146
<i>We have to make it right.</i>

10:49.357 --> 10:52.110
- I'm busy.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.383
When you took Vander out of play,
I thought,

11:15.383 --> 11:19.638
"Now here's a man who understands
what it takes to run an enterprise."

11:19.638 --> 11:22.641
The attitude, the instinct, the eye.

11:23.141 --> 11:24.726
The whole package, you were.

11:25.561 --> 11:28.772
Always two steps ahead.

11:29.690 --> 11:32.651
But time's lapped you, old man.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.073
You're with him, are you?

11:38.657 --> 11:40.325
You screwed up, Silco.

11:43.745 --> 11:46.164
You're too young to remember
what the undercity was

11:46.164 --> 11:49.042
before it became an "enterprise".

11:49.960 --> 11:50.961
We had nothing.

11:51.837 --> 11:54.172
You know
what bore us through those times?

11:56.299 --> 11:57.593
Loyalty.

11:58.510 --> 12:02.013
Brothers and sisters back-to-back
against whatever the world threw at us.

12:02.889 --> 12:06.852
Now I'm forced to share the air
with parasites like you,

12:07.978 --> 12:10.396
who leach off their legacies.

12:11.022 --> 12:14.025
Today's the day you die, Silco.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.820
That's a risk I've known all my life.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.907
But I still believe in loyalty.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.606
I would have had your son killed for this.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.358
Though I suppose we're ahead
on that account.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.194
- Get out.

13:04.409 --> 13:05.661
Were you tempted?

13:06.411 --> 13:08.288
Not for a worm like him.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.584
But he won't be the last.

13:26.056 --> 13:26.973
Hmm.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.834
Perfect place for an ambush.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.464
And you without your hammer.

14:02.634 --> 14:05.971
I was reminded recently of what
brought us together in the first place.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.431
The threats beyond our walls.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.142
This city has a short memory.

14:11.810 --> 14:12.811
"Progress."

14:14.354 --> 14:16.690
Far be it from me to stand in the way.

14:36.001 --> 14:38.545
"Free trade routes, blanket amnesty,

14:38.545 --> 14:41.339
unrestricted access
to the Hexgates, sovereignty."

14:41.965 --> 14:44.342
Do you really think you're in a position
to demand all this?

14:44.342 --> 14:47.345
I give you credit for your stunt, boy.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.389
Didn't think you had the stomach.

14:49.973 --> 14:52.601
But the big display
followed by a request for parley,

14:53.393 --> 14:54.936
you're tipping your hand.

14:57.814 --> 14:58.982
You're afraid.

14:59.775 --> 15:00.817
I am afraid.

15:01.442 --> 15:04.279
Today, I got a glimpse
of what war between us might look like.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.616
Your people wouldn't stand a chance.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.701
The Council couldn't care less.

15:11.286 --> 15:13.539
I'm trying to save you from annihilation.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.126
Well, well.

15:18.877 --> 15:22.005
Not the fresh-faced Academy pledge,
are you?

15:22.839 --> 15:24.925
You want peace, this is the price.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.845
You'll discontinue
the production of Shimmer?

15:28.845 --> 15:30.013
Half there already.

15:30.639 --> 15:31.723
Return the Gemstone.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.434
And I need Jinx.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.770
She has to pay for what she's done.

15:37.854 --> 15:40.899
They weren't her crimes.
She was working for me.

15:41.608 --> 15:45.529
Believe me, if I had it my way,
it'd be you rotting in Stillwater,

15:46.404 --> 15:49.365
but we can't make a deal
with a snake and cut off its head.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.034
We both have our shitty parts to play.

15:52.536 --> 15:55.622
Get me Jinx.
And I'll give you your nation of Zaun.

16:28.905 --> 16:29.990
Astonishing.

16:30.616 --> 16:33.577
You say all this came about
in your own brief lifespan?

16:34.327 --> 16:37.789
How were you able to accomplish
so much so quickly?

16:37.789 --> 16:41.126
You'd be surprised what you can pull off
when your life depends on it.

16:43.419 --> 16:44.963
Uh, why this form?

16:44.963 --> 16:49.009
Surely, there are more efficient
and safer methods of transportation.

16:50.468 --> 16:51.970
Firelights!

16:51.970 --> 16:53.471
- Huh?
- Hmm?

16:58.309 --> 17:00.436
-  Oh.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.981
It's not enough to give people
what they need to survive,

17:03.690 --> 17:05.776
you have to give them
what they need to live.

17:16.537 --> 17:19.540
A thousand times
I've imagined this moment.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.333
Never like this.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.128
All we ever wanted.

17:26.254 --> 17:27.839
The boy didn't even haggle.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.760
And what do I lose but problems?

17:33.929 --> 17:36.097
Oh, it all makes sense now, brother.

17:50.445 --> 17:54.407
Is there anything so undoing
as a daughter?

18:25.271 --> 18:27.691
-  Damn it.

18:31.653 --> 18:32.779
-  Piss off.

19:08.774 --> 19:11.067
Everyone out.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.890
Well, your guard needs working.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.353
I wish I could say it gets easier, kiddo.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.480
But I'd be lying.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.858
What I can say is...

21:15.441 --> 21:16.902
She still needs you.

21:16.902 --> 21:18.529
They all do.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.740
- So what do you say?

21:27.913 --> 21:29.039
That's my girl.

22:39.651 --> 22:40.986
Silco.

22:54.625 --> 22:56.001
Bravo, sis.

23:01.673 --> 23:02.924
<i>Councilors...</i>

23:03.634 --> 23:05.677
My recent unsanctioned activities

23:05.677 --> 23:08.138
in the underground
have shown me two things.

23:08.930 --> 23:11.642
I'm not fit to govern the people
who live there.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.602
And neither are you.

23:14.352 --> 23:16.813
Our opportunity
to demonstrate our compassion,

23:17.397 --> 23:18.565
our dedication,

23:19.482 --> 23:21.818
our solidarity has passed.

23:23.737 --> 23:25.405
They're right not to trust us.

23:25.906 --> 23:28.283
You're walking a fine line, Jayce.

23:29.535 --> 23:33.038
With respect, I don't give a shit
what any of you think of me anymore.

23:36.082 --> 23:36.958
Except you.

23:37.959 --> 23:38.877
You were right.

23:39.545 --> 23:40.671
You were always right.

23:41.922 --> 23:44.633
My days here are numbered,
but I've come with Viktor,

23:45.300 --> 23:48.929
my partner and a Zaunite,
with one final proposal.

23:51.056 --> 23:54.434
Jayce has brokered a peace with Silco.

23:55.435 --> 23:59.272
In exchange for the undercity's
independence.

23:59.856 --> 24:02.984
What? Nonsense! We have procedures...

24:38.478 --> 24:41.064
Really thought I buried this place.

24:42.440 --> 24:45.110
But I should have known better.

24:46.277 --> 24:47.362
Powder?

24:47.362 --> 24:50.406
Nothing ever stays dead.

24:54.035 --> 24:55.411
Are we alone?

24:56.663 --> 24:58.414
-  For now.

24:59.415 --> 25:00.834
Maybe forever.

25:02.878 --> 25:04.420
Wanna know a secret?

25:06.047 --> 25:07.883
Silco thinks he made Jinx,

25:08.383 --> 25:13.555
with all his rants
and his hard-won lessons.

25:13.555 --> 25:16.474
"Excise your doubts, Jinx."

25:16.474 --> 25:18.351
"Be what they fear, Jinx."

25:18.351 --> 25:22.606
Like everything was the same
as when Vander left him.

25:23.356 --> 25:26.234
But he didn't make Jinx.

25:27.653 --> 25:28.862
You did.

25:31.281 --> 25:32.699
I'm sorry, Powder.

25:33.867 --> 25:35.326
I never meant to leave you.

25:36.286 --> 25:37.663
You never left.

25:38.664 --> 25:40.331
I always heard you.

25:40.331 --> 25:45.003
Shadows in the streets,
prickles on the back of my neck.

25:46.379 --> 25:48.256
Your voice.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.592
Pushing me.

25:50.592 --> 25:53.804
Picking me up
when all the colors were black.

25:55.263 --> 25:57.098
You're the reason I'm still alive.

25:58.266 --> 26:00.936
I spent so many nights
in that shitty prison.

26:00.936 --> 26:05.023
On the freezing floor,
hungry, bloody, counting the hours.

26:06.567 --> 26:07.859
The only thing...

26:08.443 --> 26:11.863
The only thing that kept me going
was the thought of getting back to you.

26:16.535 --> 26:19.412
Are we still sisters?

26:20.956 --> 26:23.917
Nothing is ever going to change that.

26:28.213 --> 26:31.341
- I always knew you'd come back.
- What's going on?

26:46.732 --> 26:49.735
- No.
-  He took everything from us.

26:50.611 --> 26:52.988
Right here, he stabbed Vander in the back.

26:52.988 --> 26:54.781
Just like he planned to do with me.

26:58.201 --> 27:01.538
<i>All the time saying
you abandoned me when he knew the truth.</i>

27:02.956 --> 27:04.165
Liar.

27:06.209 --> 27:08.670
Mm. We're missing someone.

27:33.486 --> 27:34.487
Huh?

27:39.618 --> 27:41.995
I paid your girlfriend
a visit this morning.

27:42.954 --> 27:44.623
What did you do?

27:45.499 --> 27:47.668
- I made her a snack.
- Huh?

27:53.006 --> 27:54.925
No!

27:54.925 --> 27:57.218
-  Sheesh.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.054
I'm not that crazy.

28:10.231 --> 28:12.734
Powder! Leave her out of this.

28:18.574 --> 28:20.283
-  Now...

28:22.410 --> 28:24.162
Where should I sit?

28:27.082 --> 28:29.626
That's your choice, really.

28:38.009 --> 28:40.261
Make her go away. Please.

28:41.012 --> 28:43.306
- Send her on her way and--

28:44.182 --> 28:46.643
And you can have Powder back.

28:47.477 --> 28:48.854
Mm.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.398
- I can't.
- Ah.

28:53.567 --> 28:55.652
No! Powder, listen.

28:55.652 --> 28:58.113
We... we can just go.

28:58.113 --> 29:00.448
- We'll leave and never come back.

29:01.032 --> 29:02.117
Where would we go?

29:02.701 --> 29:05.411
No, no, no. She's not saying that.

29:06.246 --> 29:08.248
It's true, we'll put this behind us.

29:08.248 --> 29:09.916
You'll never have
to see him again, Powder.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.797
What do you have to say about that?

29:18.091 --> 29:20.468
Her name is Jinx!

29:20.468 --> 29:21.803
She's lying.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.014
You'll be with her a day
before she realizes

29:24.014 --> 29:27.100
you aren't that girl anymore
and turns her back on you.

29:27.100 --> 29:28.184
Mm-hmm.

29:29.144 --> 29:30.937
You aren't lying?

29:30.937 --> 29:33.774
You wouldn't lie to me. Not again.

29:33.774 --> 29:34.941
I'm not lying.

29:34.941 --> 29:37.318
I'm on your side. I promise.

29:44.325 --> 29:47.287
Shut up! We're talking!

29:47.287 --> 29:49.665
The topsiders offered me everything.

29:49.665 --> 29:52.375
Independence, a seat at the table.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.503
All in return for you.

29:54.503 --> 29:56.505
They can all burn.

29:57.005 --> 30:00.926
Everyone betrays us, Jinx. Vander. Her.

30:01.677 --> 30:03.094
They will never understand.

30:04.930 --> 30:06.264
It's only us.

30:08.183 --> 30:10.018
You're my daughter.

30:11.019 --> 30:12.563
I'll never forsake you.

30:14.439 --> 30:16.525
-  Drop the gun!

30:30.413 --> 30:32.624
No. Please.

30:42.133 --> 30:43.051
<i>It's time to leave them.</i>

30:43.051 --> 30:45.804
- No! Stop!

30:46.805 --> 30:48.515
Drop the gun.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.441
- Wait! She's my sister.

31:00.694 --> 31:02.403
Vi, she's too far gone.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.376
No, no, no.

31:25.093 --> 31:26.344
- Look out!

31:32.350 --> 31:34.728
You see, now finish it.

31:35.478 --> 31:37.564
Damn it! Powder, wake up!

31:38.106 --> 31:40.901
Remember who you are! I know you remember!

31:43.069 --> 31:47.699
-  Picture Mylo! Claggor!
- Stop.

31:47.699 --> 31:49.951
-  Vander!
- Shut up! Don't listen to her!

31:49.951 --> 31:52.621
- Dad!

31:52.621 --> 31:55.123
-  <i>Mom!</i>

31:55.791 --> 31:58.043
- Me!

32:01.462 --> 32:02.631
No!

32:42.087 --> 32:43.755
No...

32:43.755 --> 32:45.423
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

32:45.423 --> 32:48.927
I'm sorry...

32:52.013 --> 32:54.307
I never would have given you to them.

32:55.726 --> 32:56.977
Not for anything.

32:59.270 --> 33:00.438
Don't cry.

33:01.439 --> 33:03.108
You're perfect.

33:34.055 --> 33:35.265
Powder?

33:37.809 --> 33:38.977
It's okay.

33:41.730 --> 33:42.898
We'll be okay.

34:07.964 --> 34:12.010
I thought maybe you could love me
like you used to.

34:16.056 --> 34:19.309
Even though I'm... different.

34:25.816 --> 34:27.526
But you changed too.

34:29.277 --> 34:30.403
So...

34:31.863 --> 34:33.364
Here's to the new us.

35:13.530 --> 35:14.656
<i>We'll show them.</i>

35:16.366 --> 35:17.868
<i>We will show them all.</i>

35:29.087 --> 35:32.382
I support Councilor Talis' proposal
for peace.
