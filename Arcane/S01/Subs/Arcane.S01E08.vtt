WEBVTT

00:33.992 --> 00:35.451
When I was ten,

00:35.451 --> 00:37.621
your grandfather brought me
to the aftermath

00:37.621 --> 00:39.372
of the Battle of Hildenard.

00:39.372 --> 00:44.503
He offered me a gold coin for every blade
I retrieved from the fallen.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.505
Said we needed the steel.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.632
But I knew it was a lie.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.844
He wanted me to know death.

00:53.804 --> 00:57.057
Kino says war is a failure of statecraft.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.601
Your brother thinks
he can talk his way out of anything.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.853
He fancies himself a fox among the wolves.

01:01.853 --> 01:05.774
But mark me, child,
if you want to last in this world,

01:05.774 --> 01:10.028
you must learn to be both the fox
and the wolf.

01:12.531 --> 01:14.199
We'll paint the walls in gold.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.118
Import crystal chandeliers.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.287
Advisors will enter here,

01:19.287 --> 01:23.291
but the regent
will have her own, secret entrance.

01:23.291 --> 01:26.127
She should have a kind, fat face.

01:26.127 --> 01:31.592
Clever, to charm her subjects,
but pliable so we can mold her.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.426
Perhaps, she could be my daughter.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.054
You'd give me a throne?

01:36.054 --> 01:41.852
I will give you the world, child,
if you prove you can take it.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.575
What should we do with her?

02:03.331 --> 02:05.125
She won't make trouble for us.

02:05.709 --> 02:09.129
Strip her of her possessions
and send her to the far colonies.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.636
-  She's a symbol of the old regime.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.429
Kill her now,
and only one must die.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.307
Let her live and you may need
to kill thousands.

02:21.307 --> 02:24.185
We can show the people we are merciful.

02:42.370 --> 02:43.872
A wolf has no mercy.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.983
- Will you be okay?

03:12.818 --> 03:14.736
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.830
Jinx!

03:57.904 --> 03:58.989
It's gone.

03:58.989 --> 03:59.990
What?

04:03.034 --> 04:04.620
<i>It was all for nothing.</i>

04:44.535 --> 04:47.203
<i>♪ I wake up to the sounds

04:47.203 --> 04:50.290

05:46.680 --> 05:48.181
Sir, we've secured the area.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.351
I've got orders to escort you
back into the city.

05:52.227 --> 05:53.228
Sir?

05:54.479 --> 05:55.689
Are you all right?

06:35.478 --> 06:38.690
Who lives here?
Another Councilor friend of yours?

06:43.153 --> 06:44.738
Caitlyn!

06:44.738 --> 06:48.241
Oh. We were so worried.
Thank goodness you're safe!

06:48.241 --> 06:49.660
And you found a stray.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.745
This is Vi.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.497
She's from the undercity.

06:53.497 --> 06:54.623
So I see.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.501
Could we have a word, Caitlyn?

06:58.251 --> 06:59.419
In private.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.677
You have to speak
to the Council.

07:06.677 --> 07:08.512
Speak to the Council?

07:08.512 --> 07:11.014
You understand you've broken several laws?

07:11.014 --> 07:13.224
She was doing what she thought was right.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.603
I'll take responsibility.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.479
You're a Councilor's daughter.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.857
Your actions reflect on the entire body.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.943
My actions?

07:22.943 --> 07:25.153
You know what else
reflects on the Council?

07:25.153 --> 07:28.239
Its citizens living on the streets.
Being poisoned.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.076
Having to choose between a kingpin
who wants to exploit them

07:31.076 --> 07:33.453
and a government that doesn't give a shit.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.788
- Caitlyn!

07:37.248 --> 07:40.711
I'm sure our daughter could use
some rest after her adventures.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.260
- I'll schedule an audience.

07:50.679 --> 07:51.930
Thank you.

07:51.930 --> 07:55.433
You and your friend
can address the Council yourselves.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.394
I'd suggest you prepare accordingly.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.087
-  Her injuries are severe.
-  You think I can't see that?

08:24.921 --> 08:25.756
Huh.

08:26.339 --> 08:31.512
I believe I can save her,
but the process will be demanding.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.765
-  Sometimes death is a mercy.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.975
She can take it.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.144
And before I begin, I must know...

08:40.186 --> 08:42.063
Are you prepared to lose her?

08:43.732 --> 08:45.567
- Jinx?

08:46.067 --> 08:48.361
- Jinx!

08:49.655 --> 08:53.992
She won't die, Doctor.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.201
She can't.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.706
I understand.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.171
Please understand,
this is for your own sanity.

09:11.802 --> 09:14.304
I, too, once had a daughter.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.071
Silco isn't taking guests.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.280
Not a problem.

09:32.280 --> 09:36.076
Wasn't here for him.
Thought I might bend your ear.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.998
You know when I ask my mates
what Silco's up to,

09:41.998 --> 09:44.751
your name's first out of their mouths.

09:44.751 --> 09:48.839
"Sevika's out in the harbor,"
or "Sevika paid the knuckleheads a visit."

09:49.673 --> 09:51.216
You're a scary lady.

09:53.468 --> 09:54.595
Get to your point.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.305
Run a tight ship, don't you?

09:57.305 --> 09:59.516
Except it's not your ship.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.310
It's his and Jinx's.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.020
This is your plan?

10:04.020 --> 10:07.315
Undermine Silco
by making a half-assed play at my ego?

10:08.191 --> 10:09.400
Gotta hand it to you, Finn.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.403
Every time I think you can't get dumber,
you dig a new low.

10:13.739 --> 10:17.033
Let's be plain, then. He's slipping.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.285
The undercity's devolving to chaos.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.873
And somehow, I get the feeling
he isn't up there balancing booksheets.

10:24.583 --> 10:28.169
Jinx gets a whim,
suddenly his spine's made of jelly.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.172
And here you are, shoveling his shit.

10:32.423 --> 10:35.677
Ego is one thing, brain's another.

10:41.683 --> 10:45.145
You aren't the only one dissatisfied
with his performance.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.607
There's bigger fish than Silco.

11:22.432 --> 11:26.687
Mel. Elora.
You didn't have to come out to meet me.

11:26.687 --> 11:29.648
- What are you doing here, Mother?
- Can I not visit?

11:29.648 --> 11:32.233
I've heard stories
of Piltover's hospitality.

11:33.484 --> 11:37.322
You didn't sail halfway across
the continent to sample the local cuisine.

11:37.322 --> 11:40.909
- It's been over a decade, Mel.
- Since you banished me?

11:40.909 --> 11:42.493
Such drama.

11:42.493 --> 11:46.414
I sent you here to oversee
our family's interests and grow yourself.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.499
Which you have.

11:47.499 --> 11:51.044
You said, "Perhaps, your sentimentality
will be more at home

11:51.044 --> 11:53.880
with those soft-spined
idealists overseas."

11:55.841 --> 11:57.551
You have your father's memory.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.803
Don't try to ingratiate yourself with me.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.138
- Mel.
- Or that.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.478
Your brother's gone.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.108
What happened?

12:14.693 --> 12:17.696
He crossed the wrong man.

12:18.739 --> 12:19.823
I was distracted.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.243
That's a mistake I can't take back.

12:26.997 --> 12:30.667
Your Jayce Talis has turned his eye
to Hextech weaponry.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.418
I knew it.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.045
War is coming.

12:34.045 --> 12:37.132
You've let the problems
of your undercity fester too long.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.759
Piltover isn't like Noxus.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.762
War isn't our first and every recourse.

12:41.762 --> 12:46.182
I sponsored Hextech to protect the city,
not burn it to the ground.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.977
It's not conjecture, it's a fact.

12:48.977 --> 12:52.856
Weapons can't be unmade
and they are always used.

12:52.856 --> 12:56.735
I'm here to help guide you
to the right decisions.

12:56.735 --> 13:00.405
- I don't need your guidance.
- We'll see.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.449
Miss Medarda?

13:04.492 --> 13:05.493
- Yes?
- Yes?

13:08.830 --> 13:10.582
He's for me, dear.

13:14.753 --> 13:17.172
I'm off to sample the local cuisine.

13:29.851 --> 13:33.605
We'll present our case
to the Council tonight.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.651
You did all this yourself?

13:38.484 --> 13:40.028
Without even going down there?

13:42.531 --> 13:45.784
And I thought Powder could get obsessed.

13:48.579 --> 13:51.790
What happened to her, it's not your fault.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.713
When my parents were still alive...

13:59.756 --> 14:01.508
me and Powder
used to share a bed like this.

14:02.092 --> 14:05.011
Except, maybe, half the size.

14:06.054 --> 14:11.059
We played a game where we pretended
to be bigger and bigger monsters.

14:12.435 --> 14:16.982
So she would say, "I'm a slug monster
with venom for ooze."

14:18.233 --> 14:22.696
And I'd say, "Well, I'm a slug-eating crab
with razor spikes."

14:24.990 --> 14:29.620
Sometimes, I... I'd get carried away
and she'd get scared.

14:32.581 --> 14:35.291
I didn't want her to start crying
and wake my parents up, so...

14:35.917 --> 14:38.211
I pretended to chase my own monsters away.

14:39.838 --> 14:40.714
I'd say...

14:41.882 --> 14:44.384
"No monster's gonna get you
when I'm here."

14:46.052 --> 14:47.846
Then a real monster showed up.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.225
And I just ran away.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.646
I left her.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.426
You know, Powder,
you're stronger than you think.

15:27.052 --> 15:28.011
Vi?

15:29.680 --> 15:31.723
<i>I'm so sorry, Powder.</i>

15:31.723 --> 15:34.225
- <i>Your sister is jinx.</i>
- No!

15:35.727 --> 15:37.062
<i>Jinx.</i>

15:37.062 --> 15:38.980
No, no. No!

15:40.774 --> 15:43.193
I understand this must be painful.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.111
No!

15:45.111 --> 15:48.364
- I'm afraid it will only get worse.
- Wait!

15:49.032 --> 15:52.786
No!

16:25.527 --> 16:27.028
What have you done?

16:28.363 --> 16:29.781
I saved her life.

16:47.508 --> 16:48.800
Hey, watch it, furball.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.426
Move.

17:22.626 --> 17:23.710
Oh.

17:24.503 --> 17:25.587
Hmm.

17:26.171 --> 17:28.089
- Hmm.

17:29.550 --> 17:30.842
Huh?

17:31.342 --> 17:32.594
Hmm...

17:35.096 --> 17:36.264
Like this.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.685
Get away from her.

17:41.937 --> 17:43.271
Bye...

18:02.373 --> 18:04.585
Oh, ingenious.

18:05.126 --> 18:08.338
Though these blades
seem improperly pitched.

18:08.964 --> 18:10.340
You're wrong.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.843
It's designed for the fissures.

18:13.510 --> 18:14.928
The air is denser.

18:14.928 --> 18:15.846
Oh.

18:15.846 --> 18:18.223
- Are you all right, lad?

18:18.223 --> 18:21.685
Yeah, I'm fine, I just sprained my ankle.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.396
Are you Councilor Heimerdinger?

18:26.356 --> 18:28.984
It's just Heimerdinger now.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.319
What are you doing
on this side of the river?

18:32.278 --> 18:34.280
I wanted to offer my assistance

18:34.280 --> 18:36.575
to the citizens of the undercity, but...

18:37.075 --> 18:40.078
it seems I'm unwelcome.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.208
- What is it?
- We're having the exact same day.

18:47.168 --> 18:51.422
That looks like more than a sprain.
You need medical attention.

18:51.422 --> 18:54.718
I have to get home.
It isn't safe for me here.

18:55.636 --> 18:59.347
I don't know how I'm gonna get there
with my leg busted, and, well...

18:59.931 --> 19:01.224
you're holding my ride.

19:14.445 --> 19:17.616
Do they teach military history
at your Academy, Mr. Talis?

19:18.283 --> 19:20.661
It's, um, Councilor Talis.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.954
And I'm not sure.

19:22.954 --> 19:25.499
The Alornian General
Sonnem Parlec

19:25.499 --> 19:28.502
used to find ways
to meet his enemies blindfolded.

19:29.085 --> 19:31.838
He said a man's mind
hides behind his body.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.841
Somehow, I doubt he ever tried this.

19:35.509 --> 19:36.718
You're Mel's mom.

19:37.468 --> 19:38.804
Among other things.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.558
Squeeze, child.
You won't break it.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.852
I do have other matters,
so if you'll excuse me...

19:45.852 --> 19:48.104
The threat
of the undercity is real.

19:48.104 --> 19:51.441
- Your leadership is impotent.

19:51.441 --> 19:54.778
We may not be Noxus, but Piltover
isn't as helpless as you think.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.697
Who said anything about Piltover?

19:56.697 --> 20:00.867
The Council is the problem.
The mind hiding behind the body.

20:00.867 --> 20:05.205
Navigating your current crisis
requires expertise you lack.

20:05.872 --> 20:09.292
Do you know what the success rate
for senior Academy inventors is?

20:09.292 --> 20:10.460
Three percent.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.921
We're no strangers to failure.

20:12.921 --> 20:16.633
What makes this the City of Progress is
that we keep trying until we get it right.

20:17.217 --> 20:21.096
So thank you for your advice,
Mrs. Medarda, but I have a city to run.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.431
Wait.

20:28.478 --> 20:31.523
I see why this province
and my daughter have fallen for you.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.067
You have the passion of youth.

20:34.568 --> 20:37.237
I have experience.

20:37.237 --> 20:41.199
I want you to succeed here, Jayce,
to grace the world with Hextech.

20:41.199 --> 20:46.079
But if you don't accept certain realities,
I fear you'll end up like General Parlec.

20:46.079 --> 20:50.000
Slaughtered with your eyes closed.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.713
Three of my suppliers have said

20:54.713 --> 20:57.215
they intend to delay shipments until fall

20:57.215 --> 20:59.467
to give things "time to cool off."

20:59.467 --> 21:01.970
We have greater concerns
than a dip in profits.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.931
The Sheriff betrayed us.
We need better information.

21:04.931 --> 21:08.519
We need to act.
Before anyone else gets killed.

21:09.144 --> 21:11.647
Perhaps Marcus
was operating independently.

21:11.647 --> 21:15.066
What could anyone in the undercity
offer him that he didn't have up here?

21:15.066 --> 21:16.777
It's not what they offered him,

21:17.360 --> 21:19.154
it's what he had to lose.

21:21.031 --> 21:24.450
Councilors, my daughter
has a unique insight into our situation.

21:25.035 --> 21:25.952
Thank you.

21:27.328 --> 21:31.082
Councilors, this is Vi.
She was born in the undercity.

21:31.583 --> 21:34.586
Even though we failed her
in countless ways,

21:34.586 --> 21:38.590
she risked everything to show me
what life is really like down there.

21:39.174 --> 21:42.928
People are starving, sick,
ravaged by Shimmer.

21:43.804 --> 21:45.221
They live in constant fear

21:45.221 --> 21:48.058
of the coordinated efforts
of violent crime lords.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.351
One man leads these efforts.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.520
Silco.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.773
We've done investigations of Silco.

21:54.773 --> 21:57.483
They yielded no such level
of organization.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.611
And who led these investigations?

22:01.530 --> 22:03.114
What does this Silco even want from us?

22:03.114 --> 22:05.951
He believes the undercity
should be independent.

22:05.951 --> 22:08.119
He calls it the Nation of Zaun.

22:10.622 --> 22:13.041
What about these?
Do you know who made them?

22:13.041 --> 22:14.751
No, well...

22:15.335 --> 22:17.504
-  Uh...
- Her name is Jinx.

22:18.046 --> 22:19.631
This Jinx has the Gemstone?

22:21.132 --> 22:23.677
- Then we have to go in by force.
- That could trigger war.

22:23.677 --> 22:27.055
- There are good people down there.
-  Hmph. Bad ones too.

22:27.055 --> 22:30.100
Even if we wanted to invade,
they have Shimmer.

22:30.684 --> 22:32.102
We have Hextech.

22:32.728 --> 22:33.979
What happened to you?

22:33.979 --> 22:36.732
We've been talking about talking
for weeks now.

22:36.732 --> 22:39.025
They're still cleaning the blood
off the bridge.

22:39.025 --> 22:42.112
- When do we say enough is enough?
- Jayce, you don't know war.

22:42.696 --> 22:43.572
I do.

22:43.572 --> 22:48.451
It must be our last resort.
There may be a diplomatic solution.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.162
She's right.

22:58.504 --> 23:01.006
What? You want to negotiate with him?

23:01.006 --> 23:04.050
It may be the only way
to avoid further bloodshed.

23:04.050 --> 23:07.345
This is insane.
Did you learn nothing?

23:07.345 --> 23:09.389
You can't talk to him!

23:09.389 --> 23:12.601
He hates you. Everything you stand for.

23:13.184 --> 23:15.228
He will never back down.

23:18.189 --> 23:21.902
- Enforcers, please escort them out.
- Forget it.

23:21.902 --> 23:24.320
I remember
where your fancy damn door is.

23:36.667 --> 23:38.293
Vi! Wait!

23:38.794 --> 23:41.296
Wait! Where are you going?

23:41.296 --> 23:43.464
I don't know. Back where I came from?

23:43.464 --> 23:45.842
Seems like that's
what everyone up here wants.

23:45.842 --> 23:48.053
- I can fix this.
- You can't!

23:48.053 --> 23:50.847
This is how things are.
How they've always been.

23:50.847 --> 23:53.433
I was so stupid to think it could change.

23:53.433 --> 23:57.395
There must be something else
we can do. Some other way.

23:57.395 --> 23:59.731
We'll make a new plan. We have to try.

24:00.356 --> 24:02.984
We tried. Okay? It wasn't enough.

24:02.984 --> 24:06.279
Topside and bottom. Oil and water.
That's all there is.

24:07.072 --> 24:08.281
What about us?

24:10.826 --> 24:11.910
Oil and water.

24:12.452 --> 24:13.662
Wasn't meant to be.

24:15.413 --> 24:18.667
- You're just saying that.
-  Do yourself a favor, Cupcake.

24:19.543 --> 24:23.213
Go back to that big,
shiny house of yours and just...

24:24.422 --> 24:26.967
forget me, okay?

25:28.987 --> 25:32.240
Viktor, I've been working
on a private project

25:32.240 --> 25:34.660
for a couple weeks now.

25:34.660 --> 25:36.369
No.

25:50.801 --> 25:54.888
Viktor, I've been working on this
for a year now and...

25:57.265 --> 25:58.224
Viktor.

26:10.486 --> 26:14.407
Viktor, I was hoping you might take a look
at something I've been working on.

26:19.746 --> 26:20.831
Viktor...

26:20.831 --> 26:24.375
I was inspired by your...

26:24.876 --> 26:26.795
Everything you do inspires me.

26:35.345 --> 26:36.262
Viktor!

26:57.618 --> 26:59.244
Viktor!

27:23.519 --> 27:26.396
Sky? Sky? No.

27:26.396 --> 27:29.983
No! That... that can't... that can't...

28:13.318 --> 28:15.779
You want to make Silco pay
for what he's done?

28:17.280 --> 28:18.699
I could have you arrested.

28:19.407 --> 28:21.451
You guys really like
to bandy that threat around.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.037
You ever been to Stillwater?

28:24.037 --> 28:25.747
-  No.

28:25.747 --> 28:29.084
So you just wave an arm,
have someone dragged off,

28:29.084 --> 28:31.461
don't bother to find out
what it does to someone

28:31.461 --> 28:35.882
being stuffed in a stone box
for weeks, or months, or even years?

28:38.093 --> 28:42.180
- Yeah. I want to make Silco pay.
-  I want in.

28:42.806 --> 28:43.890
There is no in.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.643
- You heard the Council.
- Fuck the Council.

28:46.643 --> 28:48.353
You said you were tired of doing nothing.

28:48.353 --> 28:51.648
That's the only sensible thing
that came out of anyone's mouth tonight.

28:52.232 --> 28:53.525
I'm not a vigilante.

28:53.525 --> 28:56.069
No, you're a victim.

28:59.030 --> 29:02.033
- Huh...

29:07.623 --> 29:10.709
This so people notice you when you
raise your hand in the boardroom?

29:10.709 --> 29:13.587
- We built them for mining the fissures.

29:13.587 --> 29:15.296
- Hmm.

29:15.296 --> 29:17.549
Someone close to me had a pair of these.

29:19.134 --> 29:23.013
You're the first person Caitlyn
looked for when we made it to topside.

29:23.013 --> 29:24.973
Of everyone up here,

29:24.973 --> 29:28.268
you're the one she trusted
to do something.

29:31.938 --> 29:34.274
What do you want me to do? Arrest him?

29:34.775 --> 29:37.152
Silco controls
the undercity with Shimmer.

29:37.152 --> 29:38.695
Shut down his supply,

29:38.695 --> 29:41.907
and it's only a matter of time
before his own people turn on him.

29:41.907 --> 29:43.158
And how do we do that?

29:43.158 --> 29:45.285
Take out
his manufacturing facilities.

29:45.285 --> 29:47.788
Hit them hard and fast,
before he can react.

29:52.584 --> 29:53.585
So...

29:54.460 --> 29:56.379
We got a deal, pretty boy?

30:31.873 --> 30:33.500
-  Come on.
- Over the bridge.

30:36.211 --> 30:37.212
Secured!

30:41.341 --> 30:42.258
Get back!

30:42.258 --> 30:43.719
You little punk.

30:48.599 --> 30:50.058
Hey!

31:25.636 --> 31:26.928
- Hmm.

31:54.831 --> 31:55.999
Hmm.
