WEBVTT

00:14.305 --> 00:16.182
Whoo!

00:20.353 --> 00:22.939
Come over here, come on!

00:47.130 --> 00:48.214
Sky?

02:03.081 --> 02:04.583
Don't be afraid.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.418
You built this?

02:10.213 --> 02:11.882
Why aren't you playing with the others?

02:16.302 --> 02:17.638
Hm.

02:18.179 --> 02:21.224
Loneliness is often the byproduct
of a gifted mind.

02:21.850 --> 02:22.851
What is it?

02:23.644 --> 02:27.814
Hmm? Oh. This is Rio.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.526
She's a rare mutation that I cultivated.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.277
Here.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.738
- Go on.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.258
Hmm.

02:55.258 --> 02:58.011
- She's dying.

02:58.929 --> 03:04.100
I'm attempting to prevent that.
The mutation must survive.

03:04.810 --> 03:05.686
Can I help?

03:06.728 --> 03:08.396
You want to assist me?

03:10.023 --> 03:11.191
Very well.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.154
We can be loners together.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.756
Good to see some things haven't changed.

03:35.882 --> 03:39.886
Seems just yesterday I stumbled upon
an aspiring young scholar

03:39.886 --> 03:41.304
from the undercity here,

03:41.805 --> 03:45.141
ruminating in his steel oasis.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.311
I heard your prognosis.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.647
I'm terribly sorry, my boy.

03:53.024 --> 03:55.235
Do you contemplate death, Professor?

03:56.111 --> 03:57.821
Only that of friends.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.032
I suppose your legacy
has been well-secured.

04:01.032 --> 04:03.284
As one of Piltover's founders,

04:03.284 --> 04:05.912
what haven't you to show
for your remarkable life?

04:09.958 --> 04:13.795
You should be proud
of what you've accomplished, Viktor.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.134
Figments.

04:19.134 --> 04:23.429
My contributions will be short-lived,
even in your memory.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.642
I have seen many students.

04:27.601 --> 04:32.939
It's a sad truth that those
who shine brightest often burn fastest.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.545

04:54.545 --> 04:58.089

05:59.109 --> 06:00.694
I didn't know you were an artist.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.533
Hm. There's quite a lot about me
you don't know.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.746
Listen, I'm sorry
for disappearing last night.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.624
- Duty calls.

06:23.424 --> 06:24.510
Viktor's dying.

06:32.267 --> 06:35.186
I think it has something to do with gasses
in the fissures where he grew up.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.898
Exactly the sort of thing
we wanted to fix with Hextech.

06:40.025 --> 06:44.362
Improving lives. Solving real issues,
not just trade disputes.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.448
Viktor saved my life once.

06:47.448 --> 06:50.118
Now, he needs me
and there's nothing I can do.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.871
I hate feeling so useless.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.290
I didn't realize you were so close.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.417
He's like my brother.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.881
Why did you come to me with this?

07:03.381 --> 07:04.299
I just...

07:04.925 --> 07:07.468
Nothing feels impossible
when I'm with you.

07:11.515 --> 07:13.767
I'm an exile from my family.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.685
What?

07:15.351 --> 07:16.186
Why?

07:16.812 --> 07:19.189
I fell short of Medarda standards.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.817
I don't believe that for a second.

07:22.984 --> 07:23.944
Do you?

07:26.237 --> 07:28.198
You should be with him, Jayce.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.117
We can't change
what fate has in store for us,

07:31.117 --> 07:35.121
- but we don't have to face it alone.

07:36.832 --> 07:38.416
It's a beautiful painting.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.984
-  Chuck!

08:48.111 --> 08:50.906
Thieram. Uh... My name's Thieram.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.448
Nice try, Chuck.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.620
What's all the hubbub?

08:56.620 --> 08:59.205
Uh. Boss wants us to grab someone up.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.457
Someone? Anyone?

09:01.457 --> 09:03.794
- Who are you grabbing?
- Some girls.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.630
I mean, I mean not...
I'm not grabbing girls.

09:06.630 --> 09:09.675
Oh, other than the... those ones... I guess.

09:09.675 --> 09:13.178
Focus. Who are they?
Why wasn't I invited to the party?

09:13.178 --> 09:14.930
Uh, I don't know.

09:14.930 --> 09:18.433
They... they got in a fight with Sevika.
They did a number on her.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.351
Oh really? Which number?

09:20.351 --> 09:22.228
It's like a saying...

09:22.854 --> 09:25.148
You're doing great, Chuck.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.900
Here, for your troubles.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.045
Silco's goons aren't far behind.

09:47.713 --> 09:48.714
We have to keep moving.

09:53.384 --> 09:54.886
What the hell is that?

09:54.886 --> 09:56.054
The sign.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.474
Never mind, just help me to the edge.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.572
- Can you do this in your--

10:23.248 --> 10:24.457
Shit.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.591
Come on!

10:37.137 --> 10:38.847
Come on. Let's go!

10:44.853 --> 10:46.021
We lost her.

10:48.815 --> 10:49.816
Lost who?

11:25.561 --> 11:28.897
I feel like you and I
got off on the wrong arm.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.943
Maybe we should try the other.

11:34.485 --> 11:38.239
No need. It's your sister.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.869
She's back. She's looking for you.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.330
It's not what you think.

11:45.330 --> 11:48.750
She's with some girl enforcer.
Guess she replaced you.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.377
You're lying!

11:51.377 --> 11:53.421
Why bother?

11:53.421 --> 11:56.842
Her back in town, it's only a matter
of time before you implode

11:56.842 --> 11:59.302
and Silco finally gets the message

11:59.302 --> 12:02.305
that you're about as good for our cause
as you were for your family.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.390
- Jinx.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.359
Ten outta ten, toots!

12:14.359 --> 12:18.446
I think I know
just how to deliver that message.

12:49.561 --> 12:53.189
Ah, about time Daddy joined us.

12:53.690 --> 12:57.443
You were so busy,
little Ren here saw me in.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.209
Let's talk outside.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.837
Can't you see we're playing?

13:16.672 --> 13:20.175
You remember our old friend Vi, don't you?

13:20.175 --> 13:23.720
Vander's daughter. She was about your age.

13:23.720 --> 13:28.809
Her father went on a long trip and Daddy
here assured me that she left with him.

13:30.101 --> 13:34.064
But it seems she never made it.
Isn't that sad?

13:34.648 --> 13:38.359
Could you imagine being separated
from your father?

13:39.736 --> 13:43.031
She's... in a safe place.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.908
She's in the Lanes.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.202
That's not possible.

13:47.202 --> 13:53.083
There's an enforcer with her. A girl.
Roughly the same age.

13:53.083 --> 13:57.671
Caitlyn. She's a Kiramman. Just like them,
she does whatever she wants.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.715
I... can't control her.

14:02.050 --> 14:04.385
Then of what use are you?

14:05.721 --> 14:06.722
I'll track her down.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.057
I can fix this.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.476
Please.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.980
Everyone makes mistakes, right?

14:15.981 --> 14:19.526
What's important
is that we don't repeat them.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.362
- My people are tracking Vi and this...

14:22.362 --> 14:26.575
...Caitlyn.
They cannot be allowed to resurface.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.077
Do we understand each other?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.204
Hmm.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.217
Hmm.

14:46.302 --> 14:50.641
Oops. Ah. So sorry. Accidents happen.

15:00.483 --> 15:01.484
Watch.

15:08.158 --> 15:11.077
It responds to organic matter.

15:20.671 --> 15:21.713
Incredible.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.925
This is unlike anything
we've ever seen, Jayce.

15:24.925 --> 15:29.596
It, it, it could be the key to augmenting
physiology, extending life...

15:29.596 --> 15:32.641
- Curing you.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.729
It's happened to everyone.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.566
I can't determine why.

15:41.983 --> 15:45.403
They're... rejecting the transmutation.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.706
- We'll solve this.
- There may not be time.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.792
We're in uncharted waters here and...

15:59.876 --> 16:03.505
I can feel my body... eroding.

16:05.215 --> 16:08.384
I'll have Sky bring Heimerdinger.
He might know something that could help.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.638
In the meantime, we'll do what we do best.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.778
What is this place?

16:26.778 --> 16:28.279
It's where the kind of people
you topsiders

16:28.279 --> 16:32.200
- don't want to think about, wind up.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.921
It was never this big, though.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.341
There.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.131
I know you have your reservations
about me,

17:28.131 --> 17:30.717
but this only works
if we can trust each other.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.178
It doesn't work. It never has.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.180
You topsiders always find a way
to screw us.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.559
I suppose topside is to blame
for all your misfortunes.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.728
-  No.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.439
Not all of them.

17:44.439 --> 17:47.609
We aren't monsters, you know.
We're people, just like you.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.236
You don't know anything about me.

17:52.823 --> 17:54.115
I shouldn't have left you.

17:55.033 --> 17:59.120
It's all right.
Despite it all, I can tell...

18:00.246 --> 18:01.582
you have a good heart.

18:02.708 --> 18:05.376
-  <i>You've got a good heart.</i>

18:10.674 --> 18:11.967
What is that?

18:14.469 --> 18:16.304
I'm calling it the Hexcore.

18:17.681 --> 18:23.061
It's an adaptive rune matrix.
Hextech that evolves.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.897
It's groundbreaking.

18:25.897 --> 18:29.150
What's most exciting
is that it reacts to biological matter.

18:29.150 --> 18:32.320
There are stories of healing magic.
Our samples thus far have perished...

18:39.703 --> 18:41.162
You must destroy it.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.498
What?

18:44.124 --> 18:48.587
Please, if ever you've put faith
in my guidance, hear me now.

18:48.587 --> 18:52.090
I've seen nations destroyed
by a single seed and it looked...

18:53.258 --> 18:55.093
exactly like this.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.470
Professor, this could save Viktor's life.

18:58.972 --> 19:03.727
Viktor, something's different.
You've changed. What did you do?

19:03.727 --> 19:05.771
What do you mean, Professor?

19:07.480 --> 19:11.151
It's that thing. It must be destroyed!

19:11.735 --> 19:14.154
- Wait.
- No. I won't let you.

19:14.154 --> 19:17.824
- Jayce, this is a violation of the Ethos.

19:17.824 --> 19:21.494
I will have it destroyed
one way or another.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.498
That's your opinion.
We'll see if the Council agrees.

19:35.717 --> 19:37.844
I might know someone else who could help.

19:37.844 --> 19:41.056
You do what you have to.
I need to get ready.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.100
For what?

19:57.155 --> 19:59.115
- Is she all right?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.952
Wait, wait, wait! Easy. Easy.

20:01.952 --> 20:04.037
That's Vi, right?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.958
I'm a friend.

20:09.501 --> 20:13.922
Or at least I was. I mean,
I... I owed her old man my life.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.675
Probably more than that.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.343
I guess.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.805
- She's bleeding. She needs a doctor.

20:22.806 --> 20:25.266
Not so simple to come by around here.

20:25.266 --> 20:26.727
- Hey.

20:26.727 --> 20:28.186
I'm sorry.

20:28.186 --> 20:34.109
Oh, oh. But, ah, I do know someone else
who might be able to help.

20:34.651 --> 20:36.695
Come with me.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.583
Ailment?

20:49.583 --> 20:51.084
Uh...

20:53.504 --> 20:55.255
Uh... she's been stabbed.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.137
She makes potions.

21:02.137 --> 21:04.139
Helps people here with...

21:04.139 --> 21:06.391
...with this.

21:07.392 --> 21:10.604
Shimmer. Why would you take something
that does that to you?

21:12.188 --> 21:16.151
I just... wanted to feel what it was like...

21:16.151 --> 21:20.238
To be somebody.
To make other people afraid.

21:21.239 --> 21:22.407
- Instead of--

21:22.407 --> 21:24.785
-  Trade.

21:52.688 --> 21:54.940
- Thank you, I really--

21:56.107 --> 21:59.736
Let's go. I think Vi will be happy
to see a friendly face.

21:59.736 --> 22:03.156
No, no. You go ahead.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.576
She knew me when I was still...

22:06.076 --> 22:09.788
Anyway, I don't want her
to see me like this.

22:10.288 --> 22:16.211
Just tell her, uh, tell her I'm sorry.
About everything.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.713
Okay?

22:31.309 --> 22:33.394
I found this on one of the Firelights.

22:33.394 --> 22:37.148
It matches fragments we found
outside your lab and at the Hexgates.

22:39.025 --> 22:42.863
I... have reason to believe
they're planning more attacks.

22:43.572 --> 22:45.741
Well, how has this threat
gone unnoticed for so long?

22:46.241 --> 22:49.620
Since the Hexgates were completed,
the fissures haven't been a priority.

22:49.620 --> 22:53.164
Oh, we'll settle that later. For now,
we need to prevent any further attacks.

22:53.164 --> 22:56.752
Short of searching everyone
who crosses the bridges.

22:56.752 --> 22:58.504
I don't know how we can.

22:59.671 --> 23:01.006
Then, that's what we'll do.

23:01.006 --> 23:05.802
- Are you certain? This sort of an order--
- Do it. We have to protect the city.

23:12.559 --> 23:13.560
One other thing.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.813
I saw Caitlyn Kiramman had a prisoner
released on your order.

23:18.524 --> 23:20.441
Is there anything I can assist with?

23:22.443 --> 23:25.864
No. No, uh, we've got it covered.

23:27.365 --> 23:30.827
Councilors, we have lost our way.

23:32.120 --> 23:35.791
This city was founded
to be a bastion of enlightenment.

23:35.791 --> 23:40.336
In a world that cannibalized itself
over power and pride.

23:40.962 --> 23:42.338
But we've forgotten.

23:42.338 --> 23:46.552
Loosened our morals in favor
of comfort and convenience.

23:46.552 --> 23:48.970
Traded honor for prestige.

23:49.638 --> 23:51.139
We were once one tribe.

23:51.932 --> 23:54.392
Now we are Houses divided.

23:54.893 --> 24:01.399
I believe, if we set aside our greed
and arrogance, we can be one again.

24:01.983 --> 24:05.486
It will take vigilance.
We must hold each other accountable.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.113
And who holds you accountable?

24:07.781 --> 24:08.990
What?

24:08.990 --> 24:11.159
Shimmer is rampant in the undercity.

24:11.159 --> 24:14.245
Attacks at the Hexgates
and in the Academy Square.

24:14.245 --> 24:18.875
Enforcers fear to set foot in the Lanes.
All under your watch.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.753
Jayce, you forget yourself.

24:21.753 --> 24:22.838
I'm sorry, Professor,

24:22.838 --> 24:25.131
but healing this city
will take more than just speeches.

24:25.716 --> 24:28.844
Time and again,
you've warned us what not to do.

24:28.844 --> 24:33.515
But let me ask you this,
what's your plan to fix this?

24:33.515 --> 24:35.601
I see what this is about.

24:35.601 --> 24:39.145
Your Hextech projects need more time.
More safeguards.

24:39.145 --> 24:44.109
Humans don't live for centuries.
We can't wait for progress.

24:44.776 --> 24:49.197
We need a leadership
focused on the future, not the past.

24:49.740 --> 24:51.533
You are the true Father of Piltover,

24:52.117 --> 24:54.494
and your years of service
can never be repaid.

24:55.996 --> 24:59.082
I believe it's time we gave
the beloved founder of our city...

24:59.833 --> 25:01.668
a well-deserved retirement.

25:02.252 --> 25:04.337
Jayce, don't do this.

25:05.672 --> 25:06.590
Hmm.

25:14.222 --> 25:17.308
It has to be unanimous.
All in favor?

25:24.190 --> 25:27.653
With my deepest respect and appreciation,
Professor.

25:58.767 --> 25:59.643
Vi.

26:13.364 --> 26:16.535
- Easy, easy, easy.

26:19.788 --> 26:21.331
We need you back on your feet.

26:22.165 --> 26:25.168
What was the name Sevika gave you? Jinx?

26:29.965 --> 26:32.801
Right. Jinx. How could I forget?

26:32.801 --> 26:34.886
We're going to have
to be more careful now.

26:34.886 --> 26:37.388
- Silco will be watching--

26:49.150 --> 26:50.401
You used to live here?

26:51.194 --> 26:52.988
Who's Powder?

26:55.198 --> 26:58.827
My sister. I thought she died, but, no.

26:59.327 --> 27:00.704
I have to try and find her.

27:01.580 --> 27:03.915
How do you not know
if your sister is alive or dead?

27:04.457 --> 27:07.711
It's hard to check up on people
from inside a concrete cell.

27:07.711 --> 27:09.505
What, you don't have parents?

27:10.255 --> 27:13.592
No! They were killed by enforcers.

27:38.742 --> 27:40.619
Vander's prodigy.

27:48.418 --> 27:52.130
I've regretted that we never had
the opportunity to speak.

27:57.844 --> 27:59.680
What have you done with my sister?

28:00.556 --> 28:03.141
- I've freed her.

28:03.141 --> 28:07.437
Candidly, I thought you were the prize
of your secondhand family.

28:07.979 --> 28:09.189
But Jinx...

28:13.193 --> 28:15.445
Oh. She is more than I ever imagined.

28:25.163 --> 28:30.001
I'm gonna find her and erase whatever
fucked-up delusions you put in her head.

28:30.001 --> 28:34.590
But first, I'm gonna bring
your bullshit empire down all around you.

28:37.050 --> 28:40.261
You don't know your limits, girl.
It's what got Vander killed.

28:40.261 --> 28:44.474
What drove your sister away.
And it's why I'm here right now.

28:46.017 --> 28:47.352
- Yeah, well...

28:49.980 --> 28:51.523
You talk too much.

29:30.103 --> 29:33.189
<i>Wherever you are,
light it up and I'll find you.</i>

31:41.359 --> 31:43.111
Rio will live.

31:43.779 --> 31:44.780
You did this?

31:44.780 --> 31:50.451
I thought you understood.
The mutation must survive.

32:17.353 --> 32:19.064
I understand now.

32:34.287 --> 32:37.833
How many problems can one girl cause?

33:19.541 --> 33:21.001
-  Powder?

33:33.680 --> 33:35.348
-  Vi?

33:35.348 --> 33:36.558
Oh, Powder!

33:47.611 --> 33:49.320
I'm so sorry, Powder. I...

33:49.320 --> 33:53.241
I tried to come back. I promise, I did.
But I... I got arrested.

33:53.241 --> 33:54.576
Marcus?

33:54.576 --> 33:56.494
I don't know. I... It doesn't matter.

33:56.494 --> 33:58.830
I just... I never thought I'd see you again.

34:01.374 --> 34:02.918
Are you real?

34:04.586 --> 34:08.882
Yes, of course. It's me, Vi, your sister.

34:08.882 --> 34:10.926
I'm here. I'm right here.

34:12.177 --> 34:16.640
Things changed when you left. I changed.

34:17.558 --> 34:21.978
I know, Pow-pow, I know.
You did what you had to do to survive.

34:22.478 --> 34:25.774
Me too. It's okay.

34:25.774 --> 34:28.193
What matters is we're together.

34:36.577 --> 34:37.953
Who's she?

34:37.953 --> 34:38.870
Who are you?

34:38.870 --> 34:41.372
- It's okay. She's a friend.

34:41.372 --> 34:45.210
Sevika wasn't lying?
You're with an enforcer?

34:48.213 --> 34:50.131
Your sister is Jinx?

34:50.131 --> 34:53.384
Caitlyn, just listen,
we can work this out.

34:53.384 --> 34:56.387
This is a trick! You're playing me!

34:56.387 --> 34:59.015
Shut up! I'm in no mood.

34:59.641 --> 35:00.684
We didn't say anything.

35:00.684 --> 35:01.935
I wasn't talking to you!

35:01.935 --> 35:03.604
Powder, it's okay.

35:03.604 --> 35:05.606
Stop calling me that.

35:05.606 --> 35:09.067
It's Jinx now. Powder fell down a well.

35:09.067 --> 35:10.235
You're not a jinx.

35:10.235 --> 35:12.821
- God, I never should have--
- Stop talking to me like I'm a child!

35:12.821 --> 35:14.573
Was that why you came?

35:14.573 --> 35:16.407
For this stupid stone?

35:16.407 --> 35:19.452
No, I don't even know what that is, I...

35:19.452 --> 35:22.205
You're a class act, Sister.

35:22.205 --> 35:26.459
Sister. Thought I missed her.
Bet you wouldn't miss her.

35:26.459 --> 35:29.796
Powder! I'm here for you. Only you.

35:29.796 --> 35:32.591
You can fire that thing if you want,
but I'm not going anywhere.

35:32.591 --> 35:35.093
I'm not going to abandon you again.

35:38.471 --> 35:41.141
- Everyone, shut up, I need to think.

35:41.141 --> 35:43.184
Do you hear that?

37:20.824 --> 37:23.076
- Powder.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.794
- Powder!

37:48.226 --> 37:50.436
-  Take her.

38:11.625 --> 38:12.876
Vi?

38:14.878 --> 38:16.129
No!
