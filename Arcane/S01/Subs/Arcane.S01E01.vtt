Aw, man.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.496
Hey, Powder.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.373
- Come take a look.

04:53.126 --> 04:53.960
Whoa.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.421
It's nice getting above it all, huh?

05:17.568 --> 05:20.153
One day, I'm gonna ride
in one of those things.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.823
And one day,
I'm gonna shoot one of 'em down.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.201
Vi, are, are you sure about this?

05:26.201 --> 05:28.494
-  Look, if we get caught, we're--
-  We're not gonna get caught.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.623
We'll be in and out before anyone notices.

05:35.627 --> 05:39.464
All right, everybody, follow me.
Just don't look down.

06:01.945 --> 06:04.280
Couldn't we have at least
just walked there?

06:04.280 --> 06:06.032
Gotta stay out of sight for this one.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.124
Called it.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.876
- This is on you, Vi.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.085
- I'll get her.
- No.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.336
Powder, look at me.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.006
What did I tell you?

06:21.798 --> 06:23.049
That...

06:23.049 --> 06:24.676
...I'm ready.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.762
That's right! So?

06:35.270 --> 06:36.229
Phew!

06:47.032 --> 06:48.158
Thanks.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.138
What if Vander finds out
we're all the way up here?

07:10.138 --> 07:11.264
Look around you.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.767
You think anyone topside's going hungry?

07:13.767 --> 07:16.311
Besides, this is exactly the sort of job
Vander would've pulled

07:16.311 --> 07:17.395
when he was our age.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.943
I'm going. Are you with me or not?

07:25.361 --> 07:27.531
Vander's gonna kill us.

07:27.531 --> 07:28.907
Yeah, only if we screw up.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.242
So don't screw up.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.342
- All clear.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.681
Who locks their balcony?

07:55.433 --> 07:56.267
Hmm.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.357
Whew.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.234
There's tons of enforcers
down there.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.736
Means we're in the right place.

08:06.361 --> 08:07.988
You gonna get that door open
any time soon?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.405
Working on it.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.575
Seeing as I'm the only one
who knows how to pick locks,

08:11.575 --> 08:13.326
- I suggest--

08:17.664 --> 08:18.915
Animals.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.978
You know, Claggor, for once you're right.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.023
We are definitely not supposed to be here.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.781
Hmm.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.126
Must be an inventor.

09:03.627 --> 09:04.628
Huh.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.174
Whoa, I think this is a real Valdiani.

09:12.844 --> 09:15.346
Oh, yeah? What about this?

09:17.390 --> 09:18.809
That's a nose hair trimmer.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.062
Keep an eye out for anything
that looks valuable, Powder.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.023
Before Mylo fills the bag with junk.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.823
Uh... guys?

09:35.408 --> 09:37.994
Wait, Vi, how the hell
did we find this place?

09:37.994 --> 09:40.455
- It was a tip from Little Man.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.415
- Little Man?
- Just leave it.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.500
Come on.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.587
How can anyone
have so much stuff?

09:46.587 --> 09:48.797
Simple, just get born lucky.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.405
Woo-hoo!

10:17.450 --> 10:20.453
Mm.

10:30.506 --> 10:31.422
Huh.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.721
Whoa.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.540
-  Mylo.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.124
Powder, we gotta go.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.793
-  Hello?

11:07.793 --> 11:09.503
Is someone in there?

11:17.093 --> 11:19.429
-  Come on.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.350
We'll be fine. Just get back on the roof.

11:44.496 --> 11:45.914
Hold on!

11:48.834 --> 11:50.627
Whoa! Look out!

11:52.504 --> 11:53.839
Watch out!

12:00.929 --> 12:01.763
Hey.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.975
- Shit.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.654
Stop right there!

12:20.448 --> 12:23.284
-  Get them off!

12:25.370 --> 12:26.747
-  Faster!

12:27.664 --> 12:30.375
-  Hey! Hey!

12:30.375 --> 12:32.669
-  Look out!

12:34.880 --> 12:37.048
Down there!

12:37.048 --> 12:38.299
You can't get away!

12:52.773 --> 12:54.357
-  Hey!
-  Come on!

12:55.651 --> 12:57.235
Oh.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.033
-  This way!

13:03.033 --> 13:04.159
Keep going!

13:14.044 --> 13:16.254
-  Go, go, go!

13:28.058 --> 13:29.350
Oh, man, not again.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.435
I just got this shirt--

13:48.537 --> 13:51.456
Thought last time was the last time
we were gonna do this.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.249
Well, this time's the last time.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.877
Guys, what was that?
What the hell happened back there?

13:58.213 --> 13:59.840
I don't know. I didn't do anything.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.634
You could fill a damn library
with all the things you didn't do.

14:02.634 --> 14:07.430
Guys, we just emptied a Piltover penthouse
right under the enforcers' noses.

14:07.430 --> 14:12.185
So, if you're done beating yourselves up,
let's get this home.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.379
- Nice haul?
- You could say that.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.048
I heard there was some action
across the river.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.677
Someone, uh,
someone really kicked the nest, huh?

14:45.677 --> 14:46.845
Is that so?

14:51.224 --> 14:55.103
But now you're, you're tracking
this mess of yours through my streets.

14:55.103 --> 14:58.774
- Your streets? What makes you think--
- Listen, we don't want any trouble, okay?

14:58.774 --> 15:01.359
Hear that, Deckard?
They don't want any trouble.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.821
You know, in my experience,
trouble finds you.

15:05.656 --> 15:07.574
There's no reason this has to get ugly.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.620
How about you share
a little taste of your treasure there

15:11.620 --> 15:14.790
- and we'll call it even?
- No, no, no. We worked too hard to...

15:20.378 --> 15:21.838
Just a taste?

15:21.838 --> 15:23.757
Just a--

15:26.051 --> 15:27.302
Huh?

16:23.399 --> 16:24.400
- Huh.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.492
This day's turning out all right
after all.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.620
Wait!

17:26.880 --> 17:28.423
Wanna see how that ends?

17:42.353 --> 17:43.188
Where's Powder?

17:48.735 --> 17:50.779
Oh! Oh! You little...

17:59.913 --> 18:01.331
- Oh!

18:13.218 --> 18:15.053
Come on, Mouser, I need you!

18:25.522 --> 18:27.858
-  No.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.970
- You did what?
- I'm sorry.

18:56.970 --> 19:00.724
I tried to fight him off with Mouser,
but... she didn't work.

19:00.724 --> 19:03.644
- Who saw that coming?
- We never should have gone over there.

19:03.644 --> 19:05.854
Doesn't matter. The stuff's gone.

19:06.730 --> 19:09.941
It's all right, Powder.
At least you're okay.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.986
Okay? What about us?

19:12.986 --> 19:15.531
I get my face bashed in,
and she just gets a pass?

19:15.531 --> 19:16.447
Yup.

19:25.290 --> 19:29.169
Every time. Every time she comes,
something goes wrong.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.505
She jinxes every job.

19:31.505 --> 19:33.674
Just drop it, Mylo.

Well, I, uh, suppose
that concludes our business, then.

21:16.735 --> 21:20.030
Mm. I suppose it does.

21:21.072 --> 21:22.365
Wait...

21:22.365 --> 21:23.909
Uh, wait a minute.

21:23.909 --> 21:25.076
This, uh...

21:25.076 --> 21:28.246
uh, this... isn't what we agreed on, so...

21:28.246 --> 21:31.958
Well, demand for your wares has dropped
since we made our arrangements.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.168
This is the new value.

21:33.168 --> 21:35.170
Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We, um...

21:35.170 --> 21:36.880
we shook on it.

21:36.880 --> 21:37.798
Ten thousand.

21:37.798 --> 21:40.341
- Such are the risks of business.
- Ten.

21:41.342 --> 21:42.343
It's a fair price.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.470
I think you should take it.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.723
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

21:46.723 --> 21:49.392
I can't do that. I can't do that!

21:56.441 --> 21:57.568
Make your choice.

22:03.406 --> 22:05.366
You folks need anything?

22:05.366 --> 22:06.577
Leave us.

22:06.577 --> 22:08.203
You sure about that?

22:08.203 --> 22:09.788
- Sounded to me like--
- Piss off.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.082
Ah.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.047
I think I know what you need.

22:19.590 --> 22:22.968
- You don't seem to listen, barman--
- A bit of advice.

22:22.968 --> 22:25.512
Don't threaten the guy
who pours the drinks.

22:30.308 --> 22:32.352
So you're Vander.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.564
Hound of the Underground.

22:36.314 --> 22:39.317
I expected something... younger.

22:41.737 --> 22:44.405
We were expecting traders
who would honor their word,

22:44.405 --> 22:46.157
so I guess we're all disappointed.

22:46.157 --> 22:48.451
You got us all wrong, my friend.

22:48.451 --> 22:51.371
We were just... negotiating.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.624
Now you're speaking my language.

22:53.624 --> 22:56.918
How about you just give Huck
the rest of what you owe him,

22:56.918 --> 23:00.130
and I'll let you walk out of here
in one piece?

23:05.468 --> 23:07.971
Do we, uh... have a deal?

23:14.352 --> 23:17.564
This is vile.

23:18.356 --> 23:19.775
You'll learn to love it.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.199
Welcome to the Lanes.

23:33.288 --> 23:35.123
Vander learns none of this.

23:35.123 --> 23:38.001
No worries there.
Powder took care of the evidence.

23:38.001 --> 23:42.088
I tried, okay? You don't get it.
You're older, you're bigger.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.215
- It, it isn't fair.
- So stick with us!

23:44.215 --> 23:45.801
Take a punch or two.

23:50.639 --> 23:53.391
-  Everyone all right?
-  Never better.

23:53.391 --> 23:54.475
Good.

23:55.435 --> 23:59.397
I don't suppose you can explain why it is
that I'm hearing about an explosion

23:59.397 --> 24:00.941
and a foot chase topside?

24:01.441 --> 24:04.027
Four children fleeing the scene.

24:07.030 --> 24:08.489
What the hell were you thinking?

24:08.489 --> 24:10.366
That we can handle a real job.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.743
A real job?

24:11.743 --> 24:13.704
We got our own tip, planned a route,
nobody even saw.

24:13.704 --> 24:15.872
- You blew up a building.
- That wasn't...

24:15.872 --> 24:18.709
Did you even stop to think about
what could have happened to you?

24:18.709 --> 24:20.502
Eh? To them?

24:27.968 --> 24:29.385
Where did you even get this tip?

24:31.012 --> 24:34.182
- We just heard it at Benzo's shop.
- From?

24:35.601 --> 24:37.268
- Little Man.

24:37.268 --> 24:40.856
I took us there.
If you wanna be mad, be mad at me.

24:40.856 --> 24:43.900
But you're the one who always says
we have to earn our place in this world.

24:43.900 --> 24:47.988
I also told you time and time again,
the Northside's off-limits.

24:48.572 --> 24:50.907
- We stay out of Piltover's business.
- Why?

24:50.907 --> 24:54.077
They've got plenty, while we're down here
scraping together coins.

24:54.077 --> 24:56.705
When did you get so comfortable
living in someone else's shadow?

25:00.416 --> 25:01.752
Everyone out.

25:10.385 --> 25:11.219
Sit down.

25:11.219 --> 25:14.472
- I'm fine.
-  Sit. Down.

25:22.523 --> 25:23.899
Those kids look up to you.

25:25.316 --> 25:26.317
Yeah, I know.

25:26.317 --> 25:28.319
You know, but you don't know.

25:28.319 --> 25:30.697
When people look up to you,
you don't get to be selfish.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.908
- I'm not--
- You say run, they run.

25:32.908 --> 25:34.492
You say swim, they dive in.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.912
You say light a fire,
they show up with oil.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.749
But whatever happens, it's on you.

25:43.334 --> 25:46.046
Just like it's on me
what happens to us down here.

25:46.046 --> 25:50.842
We make ourselves a problem for Piltover,
and they will send the enforcers.

25:50.842 --> 25:53.011
So? Why answer to them?

25:53.011 --> 25:55.597
These are our streets.
Someone should remind them of that.

25:55.597 --> 25:58.016
You're not hearing me. That path?

25:59.059 --> 26:00.018
This?

26:00.602 --> 26:02.145
It's not gonna solve your problems.

26:03.063 --> 26:04.230
Just makes more of them.

26:05.816 --> 26:07.025
We clear?

26:12.280 --> 26:14.908
- How'd you get this?

26:15.576 --> 26:17.035
Some idiot was following us.

26:17.869 --> 26:19.788
On our side? Who?

26:20.413 --> 26:23.124
I don't know. He was after the stuff.

26:23.124 --> 26:24.334
Where is it now?

26:26.753 --> 26:27.921
We lost it.

26:29.214 --> 26:30.090
All of it?

26:31.216 --> 26:32.342
Good.

26:33.844 --> 26:36.137
Nothing can tie you
to what happened up there.

26:36.847 --> 26:39.683
You're gonna have to lay low
for a bit, understand?

26:40.642 --> 26:41.602
Okay.

26:43.103 --> 26:44.646
We're gonna be fine, right?

26:45.146 --> 26:46.397
I'll take care of it.

26:53.947 --> 26:57.993
Oh, you did put that idiot
on his ass, though, right?

26:58.577 --> 26:59.578
Mm.

27:10.005 --> 27:12.173
Get up, Claggor. We're going out.

27:12.173 --> 27:14.259
Wait, now?

27:15.802 --> 27:16.845
Hey, hey, that's mine!

27:16.845 --> 27:19.472
- You wanna be treated like adults, right?

27:20.056 --> 27:23.143
Then you should know better than
to come back from a job empty-handed.

27:24.269 --> 27:26.522
I'm gonna have a little word
with your informant.

27:28.439 --> 27:32.235
All right, give me the details
of exactly what happened up there.

27:51.379 --> 27:52.338
She's a problem.

27:52.338 --> 27:53.715
Mylo, I'm really not...

27:53.715 --> 27:55.592
Do you remember
what was in that bag?

27:55.592 --> 27:58.554
The biggest payout
we've ever seen and she just lost it.

27:58.554 --> 28:00.138
She made a mistake.

28:00.138 --> 28:02.057
Name one time she hasn't.

28:02.057 --> 28:04.518
-  She's young.
-  Don't bullshit me.

28:04.518 --> 28:06.520
You were twice the person at half her age.

28:07.646 --> 28:09.815
You know what, Mylo? You're right.

28:10.398 --> 28:12.483
There's a bunch of things Powder
just can't do.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.570
-  You don't have to tell me twice.

28:15.946 --> 28:18.949
- Like, complain about everything.
- What?

28:18.949 --> 28:21.868
- And brag nonstop.
- Okay, okay, I see where this is going.

28:21.868 --> 28:24.496
Pick fights with the group
when we need to focus.

28:24.496 --> 28:25.413
Vi, I...

28:25.413 --> 28:28.416
And tell strangers on the street
that we got a nice haul?

28:28.416 --> 28:31.127
- I, I didn't mean to--
- Powder's my problem, okay?

28:31.127 --> 28:32.963
Your problem is never knowing
when to shut up.

28:32.963 --> 28:35.256
But I'm gonna help you with that. Ready?

28:35.256 --> 28:36.800
You see this look on my face?

28:36.800 --> 28:39.469
This will always mean
it's time to shut up.

28:39.469 --> 28:41.137
But... I...

28:50.689 --> 28:51.732
Nobody comes in.

28:54.150 --> 28:55.068
We're closed.

28:55.569 --> 28:56.820
Well, open up.

28:57.738 --> 29:01.199
For good. You can take
your worthless junk elsewhere.

29:01.199 --> 29:03.034
Just as well.

29:03.034 --> 29:05.662
Owner's the shittiest businessman I know.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.877
- Ekko. What's going on with that thing?

29:11.877 --> 29:14.671
Give me a few seconds.
The cannon pinion's still busted.

29:14.671 --> 29:17.173
Finish it later. Vander and I need a word.

29:17.173 --> 29:19.050
- But--
-  Uh-uh. Off you go.

29:24.848 --> 29:26.808
-  Claggor.
-  He-he-hey, Little Man.

29:27.350 --> 29:28.434
You're a little early.

29:28.935 --> 29:31.647
My guys are still roundin' up
this month's collections.

29:31.647 --> 29:34.024
Won't have numbers until next, um...

29:34.816 --> 29:35.692
Whoo.

29:36.777 --> 29:38.862
Why are you muckin' about with this?

29:38.862 --> 29:40.822
I assume you've heard.

29:40.822 --> 29:42.824
Yeah, me and half the undercity.

29:42.824 --> 29:46.620
How could they be so stupid?

29:46.620 --> 29:49.164
The younger folk think
it's the right thing to do.

29:49.164 --> 29:51.082
Yeah, and Vi's one of them.

29:51.082 --> 29:54.044
Throws herself at trouble
wherever she can find some.

29:54.044 --> 29:56.129
Eh, they're growing up, Vander.

29:56.797 --> 30:00.509
Looking to write their own stories.
You can't protect them forever.

30:02.135 --> 30:03.303
Someone was following them.

30:03.303 --> 30:06.848
- Whole lot of someones, from what I heard.
- Not enforcers.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.560
- Someone on our side.
- Who?

30:11.477 --> 30:14.064
There's worse things
than enforcers out there.

30:15.524 --> 30:16.650
We both know that.

30:18.527 --> 30:20.278
Yeah, I was hopin' you'd be working today.

30:20.278 --> 30:22.155
- Did you guys go?
- Sure did.

30:22.155 --> 30:24.950
Hey, listen, how did you find that place?

30:24.950 --> 30:27.536
- I just--
- Whoa, did you fight the enforcers?

30:27.536 --> 30:29.412
What? Oh, no. Eh, just some bums.

30:29.412 --> 30:31.456
Oh, did Vi kick their asses?

30:31.456 --> 30:33.500
Yeah, I mean,
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

30:33.500 --> 30:36.545
Oh, she showed me
a couple moves to practice. Look.

30:39.172 --> 30:41.299
- Yeah, it's... it's coming along.
- Ya!

30:41.299 --> 30:43.384
Hey, so, how'd you find
that place, anyway?

30:43.384 --> 30:45.679
Uh, this weirdo came into the shop.

30:45.679 --> 30:48.640
Bought a whole bunch of stuff
Benzo only keeps there for display.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.976
He paid in gold and didn't even haggle.

30:50.976 --> 30:53.854
I charged him double price. Sucker.

30:53.854 --> 30:57.357
- But how did you know where he lived?
- Uh, followed him.

30:57.357 --> 30:59.526
- How else?
- Oh. Right.

31:00.611 --> 31:01.778
Oh, crap.

31:05.365 --> 31:07.993
- Uh...
- They'll be fine. Go.

31:11.872 --> 31:12.873
Well, hello.

31:24.885 --> 31:26.386
-  Evening, friends.

31:27.262 --> 31:28.722
Shit.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.686
Something I can help you with?

31:34.686 --> 31:38.398
Some trencher trash attacked one
of the buildings in the Academy district,

31:38.398 --> 31:39.983
but you already knew that.

31:39.983 --> 31:42.027
We're looking for the culprits.

31:42.027 --> 31:43.111
Got a description?

31:43.111 --> 31:47.073
Yeah, it's exactly who you're picturing
in that thick head of yours.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.325
Mm. You think my head is thick?

31:49.325 --> 31:51.494
Uh, just past the average.

31:51.494 --> 31:52.871
Listen, you shady son of a...

31:52.871 --> 31:55.707
How about you go
for a little walk, Marcus?

31:55.707 --> 31:57.292
Cool off a bit.

31:58.459 --> 31:59.460
Go.

32:28.281 --> 32:29.658
Lovely chap you've brought.

32:35.371 --> 32:36.540
Don't mind the kid.

32:36.540 --> 32:38.625
Doesn't know when to pipe down.

32:38.625 --> 32:41.211
Some things are the same
topside and bottom.

32:46.174 --> 32:48.093
You know this crossed a line upstairs.

32:48.093 --> 32:49.385
Was anyone hurt?

32:49.385 --> 32:52.388
A building was blown to bits.
What do you think?

32:54.390 --> 32:57.519
Those who did this will be dealt with.

32:57.519 --> 33:00.271
That workshop belonged to the Kirammans.

33:01.106 --> 33:03.108
You know what kind of stuff
they had in there?

33:03.775 --> 33:06.236
Makes this place look like a candy shop.

33:07.028 --> 33:09.740
The Council needs someone
to make an example of.

33:09.740 --> 33:11.575
People need to feel safe.

33:11.575 --> 33:13.409
Yeah, topside people.

33:13.409 --> 33:15.286
We had a deal, Vander.

33:15.286 --> 33:19.374
You keep your people off my streets,
and I stay out of your business.

33:21.417 --> 33:23.879
Give me a name. We'll do things quiet.

33:23.879 --> 33:25.964
No one will know you were involved.

33:25.964 --> 33:27.508
I can't do that.

33:28.091 --> 33:30.802
You don't seem to grasp
how serious this is.

33:30.802 --> 33:33.263
If I don't put someone
behind bars tonight,

33:33.263 --> 33:37.392
the next time I come down here,
I'll have an army of enforcers with me.

33:37.392 --> 33:39.603
We both know how that'll go.

33:39.603 --> 33:43.607
I'm sorry, Grayson,
but I can't offer up my own people.

33:49.404 --> 33:52.240
If you change your mind,
this will reach me.

33:53.742 --> 33:54.868
And only me.

34:21.269 --> 34:22.688
What are you calling this one?

34:25.273 --> 34:26.567
Whisker.

34:29.277 --> 34:31.738
- You wanna talk about today?
- What's the point?

34:32.447 --> 34:35.033
I ruined everything. I always do.

34:35.033 --> 34:36.409
Nobody said that.

34:36.409 --> 34:40.497
No. Just that you were
"twice the person" at half my age.

34:41.498 --> 34:43.166
You heard them.

34:43.166 --> 34:45.168
I'm not a fighter.

34:45.168 --> 34:46.587
You don't have to be.

34:48.171 --> 34:52.008
Look, I've got these and you've got those.

34:52.509 --> 34:53.677
They never work.

34:54.595 --> 34:55.512
They will.

34:56.930 --> 34:58.515
- Come with me.
- What?

34:59.265 --> 35:00.308
Come on.

35:15.699 --> 35:16.742
What are we doing here?

35:18.076 --> 35:19.953
See that gutter running along the canal?

35:28.211 --> 35:31.172
That's where Claggor got his foot
stuck running from enforcers.

35:33.049 --> 35:35.260
They thought it was funny,
so they left him there.

35:36.469 --> 35:38.263
He was out all night before we found him.

35:40.724 --> 35:41.683
That sign?

35:44.770 --> 35:46.354
-  You see it?
-  Uh-huh.

35:46.897 --> 35:48.815
Mylo tripped over his own paint bucket

35:48.815 --> 35:51.610
and nearly fell off trying to draw
a giant middle finger.

35:52.778 --> 35:55.321
-  His ass made that splotch.

35:57.533 --> 35:58.491
And that?

36:01.036 --> 36:05.040
When I was a kid, some guy took
my favorite toy and threw it up there.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.627
I used to come out here at night
and stare at it,

36:09.961 --> 36:14.550
hoping maybe the wind
or a bird might knock it down.

36:17.177 --> 36:18.804
We've all had bad days.

36:20.889 --> 36:24.267
But we learn. And we stick together.

36:27.854 --> 36:29.480
Oh, I forgot.

36:30.649 --> 36:31.733
These were in my pocket.

36:32.568 --> 36:35.153
- They're from the apartment.
- What are they?

36:37.155 --> 36:38.156
I don't know.

36:39.324 --> 36:41.284
- Should we show Vander?
- No.

36:46.081 --> 36:48.041
Let's keep this our little secret.

36:49.334 --> 36:53.213
Mylo's wrong, Powder.
You're stronger than you think.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.549
And one day...

36:56.717 --> 36:58.760
this city's gonna respect us.

37:32.961 --> 37:35.922
You were supposed to follow them
and not interfere.

37:36.464 --> 37:38.967
I'm sorry.

37:39.467 --> 37:41.469
They just caught us by surprise.

37:41.469 --> 37:45.682
Now his accomplice
is asking questions about you.

37:46.975 --> 37:49.477
That's not a risk I'm willing to take.

37:52.063 --> 37:57.110
The kids. It was their fault,
the explosion in the upper city.

37:57.653 --> 37:58.987
That was them?

37:58.987 --> 38:02.699
Yeah. The topsiders
are up in arms looking for 'em.

38:03.617 --> 38:05.911
Vander's in trouble.

38:11.457 --> 38:14.044
Smartest thing you ever said, boy.

38:14.795 --> 38:15.921
Get him a meal.

38:17.673 --> 38:19.591
But keep him off the streets.

38:23.386 --> 38:25.263
Our timeline has moved up.

38:25.972 --> 38:27.599
It's almost ready.

38:29.851 --> 38:30.977
Show me.

38:39.069 --> 38:40.361
Feeding time.

38:46.159 --> 38:47.452
And the side effects?

38:48.995 --> 38:50.872
Stabilizing.

39:29.661 --> 39:31.622
You have a subject in mind?

39:34.791 --> 39:36.459
Someone just volunteered.
