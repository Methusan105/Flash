WEBVTT

01:03.564 --> 01:05.607
I knew it was a mistake trusting you.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.693
You've been a real picnic yourself.

01:07.693 --> 01:11.905
I'm not the one who walked us
into, not one, but two of Silco's traps.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.365
-  This isn't Silco, it's someone else.

01:14.365 --> 01:15.742
How do you know?

01:15.742 --> 01:17.160
'Cause we'd already be dead.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.411
Oh, very nice.

01:18.411 --> 01:21.289
When were you planning to tell me
that your lunatic sister works for him?

01:21.289 --> 01:22.708
Just as soon as you came clean about

01:22.708 --> 01:24.042
what the hell
you're really doing down here.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.961
-  I told you the truth.
-  Bullshit.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.337
What was that glowing stone?

01:29.464 --> 01:30.549
That's what I thought.

01:33.969 --> 01:35.261
What's going on?

01:35.261 --> 01:38.014
-  Hey, stop! Get your hands off of me!
-  Leave her alone!

01:38.014 --> 01:39.516
-  Let me go!
-  Vi?

01:40.517 --> 01:41.685
Vi!

01:42.310 --> 01:44.771
Vi!

02:01.997 --> 02:03.289
Hey.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.673
You shy? Or just ugly?

02:32.611 --> 02:34.029
You look good for a dead girl.

Ekko?

03:48.269 --> 03:49.688
What do you know about this?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.776
Nothing. What the hell is this all about?

03:54.776 --> 03:57.445
What were you doing with Jinx?

03:57.445 --> 03:58.780
Her name is Powder.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.533
And I just found her
when you and your goons showed up.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.244
It's me. Vi.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.454
Same person who used to take you down
to the junk heap

04:06.454 --> 04:08.624
and hose you down
when you got covered in grease.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.918
That was a long time ago.

04:12.919 --> 04:13.962
People change.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.964
Yeah. I'm getting that.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.009
Are you working for Silco?

04:20.468 --> 04:21.845
Fuck. You.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.471
I thought you were dead.

04:23.471 --> 04:26.307
Now you show up with a Piltie
and give her a tour of the Lanes?

04:26.307 --> 04:29.185
You were following us?
Why didn't you say something?

04:29.185 --> 04:30.687
I didn't know if I could trust you.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.815
So... so you just come out swinging?

04:34.399 --> 04:36.192
Gee, I wonder who I learned that from?

04:36.192 --> 04:39.404
Ah, well, you shoulda learned more.
You still punch like a little boy.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.532
And you still block with your face.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.578
I remember when
you wouldn't stand up to me.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.667
I missed you, little man.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.879
How long have you had those off?

04:56.505 --> 04:58.089
How long have you been whining?

05:04.846 --> 05:06.557
Hmm. Fascinating.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.228
I would very much like to see the device.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.774
This, uh, Hexcore.

05:16.357 --> 05:19.778
That may be difficult to arrange.

05:21.446 --> 05:26.284
I've tried every combination of runes,
but... it's always the same.

05:26.827 --> 05:30.497
The subject, wither and rot.

05:30.497 --> 05:34.543
Uh, perhaps the error resides
not with your calculations but...

05:35.126 --> 05:36.878
with your subjects.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.422
Nature has made us intolerant to change,

05:39.422 --> 05:44.595
but fortunately,
we have the capacity to change our nature.

05:44.595 --> 05:48.056
- And this is... Shimmer?
-  A variant.

05:48.557 --> 05:52.728
It should provide everything one needs
to survive a violent transition.

05:52.728 --> 05:54.813
Will it work on plants?

05:54.813 --> 05:57.649
You aren't here about the plants, are you?

05:58.567 --> 06:00.986
I know the look of a doomed man.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.655
I must warn you.

06:04.656 --> 06:07.618
If you take this path,
they will despise you.

06:08.493 --> 06:13.373
Love and legacy are
the sacrifices we make for progress.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.085
It's why I parted ways with Heimerdinger.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.551
- Jayce will understand.
- Perhaps.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.588
Hammer work is such a delicate art.

07:01.588 --> 07:02.881
How'd you find me?

07:02.881 --> 07:06.552
You're the de facto head of the Council.
People notice where you go.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.512
Huh. Don't remind me.

07:08.512 --> 07:11.181
This border shutdown
has people agitated.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.516
They should be.

07:14.518 --> 07:17.979
Marcus brought this to me.
It's an explosive.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.023
I tried taking it apart
and it nearly killed me.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.025
Whoever built it
knows exactly what they're doing.

07:22.818 --> 07:26.572
This and Shimmer. It's hard to believe
what they're capable of.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.119
Is that what's really bothering you?

07:35.497 --> 07:39.084
He was my mentor, Mel. And I betrayed him.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.964
Everything you said about him was true.

07:44.715 --> 07:48.218
My family cast me out
and yet, part of me still loves them.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.680
Heimerdinger will understand eventually.

07:52.556 --> 07:55.892
It's your time now, Jayce.
No more red tape.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.730
You can bring Hextech to the masses,
just like you've always dreamed.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.110
Hmm. First, I have to save Viktor.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.194
Where is he?

08:06.820 --> 08:07.988
I don't know.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.949
He disappeared.
He does that sometimes.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.035
- No sign of Caitlyn either.
-  The Kiramman girl?

08:14.035 --> 08:16.454
It's just...

08:16.454 --> 08:20.375
- Uh, never mind.
- Hey. We'll get through this.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.837
I'll stall the Council
but they'll soon need their leader.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.589
In the meantime...

08:27.758 --> 08:29.593
Try not to lose your nuts.

08:41.980 --> 08:46.359
All our business is down. Enforcers are
searching anyone who crosses the bridge.

08:47.110 --> 08:51.364
Marcus is following my orders.
Preventing Vi and Caitlyn from returning.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.991
Or he's finally flipped.

08:53.659 --> 08:54.951
Hmm.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.707
The chembarons scheduled an assembly.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.293
Oh.

09:04.085 --> 09:07.923
- I've had enough headaches.
- It didn't sound like a request.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.513
- Where are you going?

09:14.513 --> 09:15.764
I need to find Jinx.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.140
- Sir.
- What?

09:17.849 --> 09:20.727
I got more in common
with cave lice than Jinx.

09:21.853 --> 09:27.150
But let's just say I didn't always see
eye-to-eye with my old man.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.611
And?

09:30.987 --> 09:33.865
She'll come to you when she's ready.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.162
Hmm.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.721
-  <i>You lost her.</i>

09:56.304 --> 09:59.349
I didn't lose her! They took her.

09:59.349 --> 10:02.644
<i>She cares about
that enforcer, you saw it.</i>

10:04.312 --> 10:07.649
She was there for me! Not the enforcer.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.359
<i>Remember her name?</i>

10:09.359 --> 10:11.945
Why would I remember her name?

10:13.947 --> 10:16.074
Well, she's just some stupid topsider!

10:30.130 --> 10:30.964
Caitlyn.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.403
Pow.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.995
Come on. Go!

11:04.164 --> 11:05.331
I got it.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.000
Whoo-hoo!

11:07.668 --> 11:09.294
Is that real tree?

11:09.294 --> 11:10.629
Pretty cool, huh?

11:10.629 --> 11:13.214
When I first saw it,
I knew this was the place.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.802
If a single seed could make it down here,
so could we.

11:17.594 --> 11:18.887
You built all this?

11:19.387 --> 11:20.430
Not alone.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.600
- After Vander...

11:24.100 --> 11:24.976
...died,

11:25.561 --> 11:27.646
Silco flooded the lanes with Shimmer.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.190
He didn't care
what it did to people.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.734
Everyone here was an addict or a victim.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.028
Hi.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.905
They needed
somewhere safe to start again.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.369
I should have been there.
For you. For everyone.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.956
That's a good way to drive yourself crazy.

11:47.207 --> 11:51.169
If I just went with you that day,
maybe none of this would have happened.

11:51.670 --> 11:55.507
Or maybe you'd be dead. Or... changed.

11:56.007 --> 11:57.383
Powder's gone, Vi.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.427
All that's left is Jinx
and she belongs to Silco.

11:59.427 --> 12:03.014
You're wrong. She's still in there.
I can reach her.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.140
You can't.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.562
I know my sister.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.609
I got one more thing to show you.

12:25.704 --> 12:28.624
This is everyone we've lost.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.293
The price of our freedom.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.588
Some of it was Enforcers.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.757
Most was Silco.

12:38.634 --> 12:42.846
Your sister works for him not because
she has to, but because she wants to.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.431
I'm sorry, but that's who she is now.

13:00.405 --> 13:01.657
Get down!

13:01.657 --> 13:02.949
-  Let us through!
-  Come on!

13:12.083 --> 13:13.418
We understand.

13:13.418 --> 13:14.753
Just stand down!

13:15.879 --> 13:19.007
- Thank you for alerting me, Sheriff.
-  Not a problem, Councilor.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.218
Jayce, what is this?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.347
Do you have any idea how this looks?

13:26.347 --> 13:28.934
I order a blockade
and my own partner violates it?

13:30.519 --> 13:33.354
You ordered this? Why?

13:33.354 --> 13:36.525
There are people down there
who seem hell-bent on destroying us.

13:36.525 --> 13:37.693
What were you doing?

13:38.401 --> 13:41.071
I was consulting a friend
about our quandary.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.864
I told you, I knew someone.

13:42.864 --> 13:45.033
Well, you didn't say
they were from the undercity.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.785
What difference does that make?

13:46.785 --> 13:49.079
What diff... They're dangerous.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.915
I'm from the undercity.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.625
You're right.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.169
I'm sorry.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.462
I've had a lot on my plate.

13:58.547 --> 13:59.840
Was your friend able to help?

14:01.382 --> 14:02.467
No.

14:02.467 --> 14:06.471
No, he said, "Nature was resistant
to this sort of tampering."

14:07.180 --> 14:08.890
All right, we'll keep at it.

14:30.036 --> 14:33.832
First, this wild attack
in the heart of Piltover.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.834
Now, the border's closing.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.087
We're bleeding money and for what?

14:39.087 --> 14:43.967
His dreams of rebellion?
He's losing control.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.301
If we stand together...

14:46.136 --> 14:48.304
We aren't due for an assembly.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.435
We should be.

14:54.435 --> 14:58.481
Ever since your stunt topside,
profits have been plummeting.

14:58.481 --> 15:01.527
He's right.
Merchandise is frozen at the border.

15:01.527 --> 15:03.737
Topsiders are too afraid to cross.

15:03.737 --> 15:07.699
We're all wondering,
what's your plan to fix this?

15:09.743 --> 15:12.245
You're all wondering, are you?

15:14.831 --> 15:18.418
Way I see it, we should cut a deal
and give back the Gemstone.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.672
Better to have some trade
than none at all.

15:23.674 --> 15:27.010
The border issue is temporary.
Jinx will deal with it.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.887
Huh.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.973
Rumor is, your dog's off her leash.

15:32.683 --> 15:37.896
How you meant to bring Piltover to heel
if you can't handle your own people, huh?

15:50.241 --> 15:51.535
What's that?

15:54.496 --> 15:57.541
Oh, you don't recognize it?

15:59.751 --> 16:01.837
Have you forgotten
where we came from?

16:03.046 --> 16:04.506
The mines they had us in?

16:06.925 --> 16:10.178
- Air so thick it clogged your throat.

16:11.221 --> 16:12.764
- Stuck in your eyes.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.977
 But I pulled you all up
from the depths.

16:16.977 --> 16:20.480
- Offered you a taste of topside.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.775
And fresh air.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.655
I gave you life.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.490
Purpose.

16:33.952 --> 16:36.913
But you've grown fat and complacent.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.959
Too much time in the sun.

16:51.762 --> 16:56.850
We came from a world where there
was never enough to go around, Finn.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.022
That is why we fight.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.815
Do you remember?

17:06.026 --> 17:09.988
Sorry. Please.

17:10.656 --> 17:13.366
Please.

17:20.624 --> 17:21.875
Don't forget again.

17:35.305 --> 17:36.431
Good meeting.

17:59.538 --> 18:02.040
I've had word from
our friends overseas.

18:02.541 --> 18:05.335
This threat from the undercity
is drawing attention.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.464
Piltover looks vulnerable.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.595
It's too soon. Jayce isn't ready.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.727
There's one other thing.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.730
This arrived for you.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.173
- Hmm?

19:03.393 --> 19:04.936
What have you done with Vi?

19:08.481 --> 19:12.903
Listen, let her go. I brought her here.
It's me you want.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.156
- My hero.
- You're...

19:16.823 --> 19:20.035
But I thought you...
I thought they were hurting you!

19:21.119 --> 19:22.996
Vi tells me I can trust you.

19:23.955 --> 19:26.291
You get
a pass back topside, that's it.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.458
Let's go.

19:39.304 --> 19:40.722
Let me help you with that.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.934
Where've you been, Jinx?

19:44.935 --> 19:50.732
Oh, you know.
Here, there, chasing down dead ends.

19:50.732 --> 19:55.111
And guess what? They're not all dead.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.530
I can explain.

19:57.405 --> 20:00.951
- Don't move, silly. I might hurt you.

20:01.785 --> 20:06.081
I didn't know. Marcus never told me
she was in Stillwater.

20:06.081 --> 20:09.000
- But you found out she came back.

20:09.585 --> 20:11.670
- You lied.

20:13.129 --> 20:15.924
- I wanted to protect you.
- From what?

20:15.924 --> 20:21.221
She and the enforcer are back
for the crystal. Not for you.

20:22.222 --> 20:25.100
- Have you forgotten how she left you?

20:25.684 --> 20:29.855
Who found you? Who cared for you?
Gave you a home?

20:30.355 --> 20:35.318
I am your family.
Everyone else betrays us.

20:36.319 --> 20:39.280
-  I need you.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.158
-  Now more than ever.

20:45.621 --> 20:47.581
You have to complete the weapon.

21:10.395 --> 21:11.522
It's beautiful.

21:12.230 --> 21:14.858
If your people had your way,
it'd be rubble and ash.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.569
It's a misunderstanding.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.946
They think you work for Silco.

21:19.946 --> 21:25.035
Your people hunt us like animals.
Silco pays them to do it.

21:25.911 --> 21:28.329
That's not possible. You're wrong.

21:28.914 --> 21:30.541
Say that one more time.

21:30.541 --> 21:34.044
Ekko, she believes what she's saying,
okay? She's not your enemy.

21:34.044 --> 21:36.296
Oh, yeah? Then what's this?

21:38.464 --> 21:41.635
You got it.
You have to let me take that back.

21:42.678 --> 21:45.055
- What is it?

21:45.055 --> 21:46.347
It's a Gemstone.

21:46.848 --> 21:49.976
It was stolen during the attack.
By your sister.

21:50.561 --> 21:52.270
You just forgot to mention that?

21:52.854 --> 21:55.691
With this, someone
with the right knowledge could build...

21:56.191 --> 21:58.068
any Hextech device.

21:59.277 --> 22:03.615
If enforcers are becoming
more... aggressive, that's why.

22:05.116 --> 22:07.077
We could beat Silco with this.

22:07.661 --> 22:09.162
That won't solve things.

22:09.162 --> 22:12.916
Easy for you to say. Your people
aren't dying all around you.

22:14.543 --> 22:17.337
Ekko, it's wrong what's been done to you.

22:18.589 --> 22:20.841
You'd be well
within your rights to keep it.

22:21.424 --> 22:22.759
I couldn't blame you.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.555
But... if you do,

22:26.555 --> 22:28.974
this cycle of violence will never stop.

22:30.559 --> 22:33.353
This is our best shot
at setting the record straight.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.647
This city needs healing.

22:36.397 --> 22:38.149
More than I ever realized.

22:38.692 --> 22:41.152
Please, let me help you.

22:44.322 --> 22:45.240
You got a plan?

22:46.199 --> 22:47.868
I have a friend on the council.

22:48.493 --> 22:50.370
Let me take the Gemstone to him.

22:52.330 --> 22:55.375
He'll listen to me.
Your people wouldn't have to hide anymore.

22:57.711 --> 23:00.589
One condition.
I'm the one who gives it to them.

23:04.635 --> 23:07.513
Um, the form is crude, but...

23:08.179 --> 23:11.224
uh, the engineering is... inspired.

23:11.224 --> 23:12.809
You think they could crack Hextech?

23:13.852 --> 23:16.104
Mm. It's a leap.

23:16.104 --> 23:20.526
It's been suggested that they may
have found a way to utilize the Gemstone.

23:21.026 --> 23:24.863
If we are to assume the worst, that would
mean they've turned it into a weapon.

23:24.863 --> 23:26.865
Well, do we know this for certain?

23:27.448 --> 23:29.242
We can't afford to wait to find out.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.412
Wait. What are you suggesting?

23:34.831 --> 23:37.125
We should prepare our own countermeasures.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.419
You want us to build weapons?

23:39.419 --> 23:43.464
Absolutely not.
That is not why we invented Hextech.

23:44.049 --> 23:46.051
We would shatter
any attempt at peace.

23:46.051 --> 23:48.554
- Heimerdinger would never go for this.
- Heimerdingers' inaction

23:48.554 --> 23:51.056
is what brought us here.
You said so yourself.

23:52.015 --> 23:55.310
The peace is already broken, Jayce.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.854
I'm only asking you to prepare
to defend your people.

23:58.479 --> 24:00.732
If we're lucky,
we'll never need to use it.

24:05.529 --> 24:06.655
The decision is yours.

24:15.789 --> 24:19.250
Ridiculous.
You cannot be considering this.

24:20.210 --> 24:23.296
What if she's right? Are we just
gonna stand by while they attack us?

24:23.296 --> 24:25.966
We're scientists, not soldiers.

24:26.466 --> 24:28.719
We have the knowledge to defend ourselves.

24:28.719 --> 24:31.137
We agreed Hextech was to improve lives...

24:31.137 --> 24:32.556
...not to take them.

24:32.556 --> 24:34.057
We may not have a choice.

24:50.782 --> 24:53.577
There is always a choice.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.330
I need to think.

25:53.720 --> 25:54.805
What are they?

25:55.346 --> 25:58.809
We call them firelights.
Never seen so many though.

26:30.173 --> 26:32.968
I'm worried I have to do something
I never thought I would.

28:00.096 --> 28:01.139
Vi?

28:04.726 --> 28:06.311
I can't leave her again.

28:07.688 --> 28:08.980
You can't change her.

28:09.565 --> 28:10.607
I have to try.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.737
Don't get yourself killed.

28:17.573 --> 28:18.740
No promises.

28:26.456 --> 28:30.836
It's been real, Cupcake.
Thanks. For everything.

28:38.927 --> 28:42.931
- Shut up. It's just a goodbye hug.

28:44.140 --> 28:47.185
She wouldn't do that. Not again.

29:12.544 --> 29:13.795
-  Halt!

29:13.795 --> 29:16.047
What the hell is this?

29:19.342 --> 29:23.346
Sir! I have proof.
Silco's behind everything.

29:29.603 --> 29:30.604
Show me.

29:34.733 --> 29:35.734
No.

29:36.568 --> 29:37.402
Hmm.

29:39.362 --> 29:40.196
Shit.

30:01.885 --> 30:02.886
Caitlyn!

30:12.688 --> 30:13.647
Liar.

30:15.607 --> 30:17.901
I told you to leave this alone.

31:59.711 --> 32:02.338
Tell my...

32:02.338 --> 32:04.883
Tell my daughter I...

33:14.452 --> 33:15.912
Go!

33:35.348 --> 33:40.311
Oh, look who it is. The boy savior.

33:59.915 --> 34:00.832
Hah.

34:57.263 --> 34:58.557
Yes!

35:23.790 --> 35:25.751
No.
