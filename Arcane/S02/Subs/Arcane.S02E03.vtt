14:26.541 --> 14:29.208
because you pissed the Arcane off
with all your demands?

14:29.791 --> 14:31.250
That's-- That's not what I…

14:31.333 --> 14:36.458
Oh, the lad may be onto something.
Every action sparks a reaction.

14:36.541 --> 14:38.208
Oh, ball sockets.

14:38.750 --> 14:41.625
Do you think this could actually
be a result of overuse of Hextech?

14:42.208 --> 14:47.250
I've seen miracles spring
from the hands of mages many times,

14:47.333 --> 14:49.708
but so often,

14:49.791 --> 14:51.666
they turned to horrors.

14:51.750 --> 14:55.291
I'd always presumed
it was due to mankind's…

14:55.833 --> 14:58.375
turbulent relationship with power.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.916
But perhaps it is a property
of the Arcane itself.

15:05.708 --> 15:09.500
We tested our Hextech under
every conceivable condition for years.

15:09.583 --> 15:11.375
If there's some reaction taking place,

15:11.458 --> 15:14.041
how come we've never seen
any sign of it until now?

15:14.125 --> 15:19.291
And why would it appear
on a tree, deep underground?

15:21.625 --> 15:22.625
Hmm.

15:26.666 --> 15:28.666
[dramatic music playing]

15:50.958 --> 15:51.958
[door opens]

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
[footsteps approaching]

15:58.541 --> 15:59.916
[Elora] Your source panned out.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.125
I've confirmed Salo met privately
with members of several houses today.

16:04.708 --> 16:07.250
I should have been first
to bring this to you.

16:07.791 --> 16:09.625
I promise I wouldn't have missed it.

16:09.708 --> 16:12.041
It's just such a bold move.

16:12.125 --> 16:13.875
And at this moment, it's…

16:13.958 --> 16:15.041
[Mel] Foolish.

16:16.208 --> 16:18.666
Of course, your mother
is anything but a fool.

16:19.208 --> 16:21.208
There must be an angle I'm missing.

16:21.708 --> 16:22.625
Hmm.

16:23.708 --> 16:25.791
Did you look into the other matter?

16:25.875 --> 16:29.791
There's a rat's nest of misinformation
surrounding your brother's passing.

16:30.375 --> 16:32.958
Whomever he crossed knows
how to cover their tracks.

16:33.500 --> 16:37.833
Moreover, they've managed to strip
your mother of most of her holdings.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.541
She's desperate.

16:42.125 --> 16:44.500
Which makes her all the more dangerous.

16:45.958 --> 16:47.375
What are we going to do?

16:50.500 --> 16:54.000
Summon the apothecary.
I'll want his opinion of this.

16:54.083 --> 16:55.583
And check in on Amara.

17:04.166 --> 17:06.250
[Ekko] This is still part of the Hexgates?

17:07.291 --> 17:10.291
We must be at least 200 feet
below the surface.

17:10.833 --> 17:12.958
[Jayce] The entire structure is a channel,

17:13.041 --> 17:15.750
focusing the Hextech energy
into a precise beam.

17:18.875 --> 17:20.875
[suspenseful music playing]

17:33.416 --> 17:34.708
[distorted laughter]

17:39.458 --> 17:40.416
Cait.

17:41.375 --> 17:42.791
If you see an opening…

17:45.041 --> 17:46.083
take the shot.

17:46.625 --> 17:47.833
[Caitlyn] Vi.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.125
[Jayce] <i>How do you</i>

18:06.208 --> 18:08.708
[Ekko] <i>Read what I could,</i>
<i>deduced what I couldn't.</i>

18:08.791 --> 18:11.958
<i>Plus, I didn't think the Topside</i>
<i>would trust anything that important</i>

18:12.041 --> 18:13.291
<i>below the surface.</i>

18:18.125 --> 18:19.875
[dramatic music playing]

18:24.958 --> 18:27.875
I thought the gemstone mesh
was installed aboveground.

18:27.958 --> 18:29.208
[Jayce] The mesh is aboveground,

18:29.291 --> 18:31.916
but we weren't sure what would happen
if the gate overloaded,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
so we installed a failsafe at the base.

18:34.083 --> 18:37.208
So instead of it exploding
in your neighborhood,

18:37.291 --> 18:38.416
it would blow up in ours.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.416
We're miles from the main fissures.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.208
These are the same utility ducts
that carry our water

18:43.291 --> 18:45.125
and facilitate our ventilation.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.791
That would explain it affecting the tree.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.708
Inconceivable.

18:49.791 --> 18:53.250
[Ekko] You know, you say we should
feel like we're all one people.

18:54.375 --> 18:57.500
But whenever it rains,
we're the ones that get wet…

18:58.041 --> 18:59.166
What the…?

19:04.125 --> 19:05.125
Jinx!

19:05.208 --> 19:06.625
[echoing] <i>Jinx! Jinx! Jinx!</i>

19:06.708 --> 19:08.208
[Jinx] Finally got the name right.

19:11.041 --> 19:13.791
Guess there really isn't
a crack in the earth

19:13.875 --> 19:16.000
where you won't find me.

19:16.083 --> 19:17.541
What is this place?

19:17.625 --> 19:20.958
[Jinx] Don't you remember
the old Janna bedtime stories

19:21.041 --> 19:22.833
Vander used to tell us?

19:23.375 --> 19:25.750
[in melodramatic voice]
Miners trapped underground.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.666
Air running thin!

19:27.750 --> 19:33.041
But then some wispy wind woman
wafts to their rescue.

19:33.666 --> 19:34.875
[Jinx snickers]

19:34.958 --> 19:38.458
Wild the kind of crap people get up to
when you choke them out.

19:39.375 --> 19:43.083
We used the Grey to clear the streets.
To keep people safe.

19:43.166 --> 19:44.250
"We."

19:44.791 --> 19:48.333
Never thought my sister
would turn bluebelly.

19:48.916 --> 19:51.166
Never thought mine would orphan kids.

19:51.250 --> 19:55.541
[Jinx] Ha! Why not?
Done it to myself enough.

19:55.625 --> 19:57.875
But plastering my face all over

19:57.958 --> 20:01.250
so someone else would do your dirty work?

20:01.833 --> 20:03.916
Poisoning our air?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.125
[Jinx whistles]

20:05.208 --> 20:08.208
You've turned a leaf, sister.

20:08.291 --> 20:11.541
I'm done blaming myself for your mistakes.

20:11.625 --> 20:14.958
Done pretending you're my sister.
You're not.

20:15.041 --> 20:16.583
You killed her.

20:16.666 --> 20:19.416
I'm not gonna let you
stain her memory anymore.

20:21.125 --> 20:22.833
[Jinx] Then stop me.

20:24.916 --> 20:27.333
'Cause no matter what I do,

20:27.916 --> 20:29.708
I just can't seem to die.

20:30.500 --> 20:31.333
[whispers] I'm sorry.

20:32.791 --> 20:33.958
I'm sorry too.

20:44.916 --> 20:46.708

21:01.041 --> 21:02.750
[Jinx] I know you're sweet on her.

Hope you got a chance to, you know…
