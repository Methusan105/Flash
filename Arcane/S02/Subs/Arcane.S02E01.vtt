to assist Councilor Salo, Mother.

06:34.583 --> 06:36.083
As we are at war,

06:36.167 --> 06:40.250
I thought it prudent to solicit the advice
of such an experienced veteran.

06:41.125 --> 06:43.708
Let us address the matter at hand.

06:43.792 --> 06:46.167
Our people are scared, suffering.

06:46.250 --> 06:49.583
They need to know their leaders
have the situation under control.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.667
An unprecedented show of force.

06:51.750 --> 06:56.125
We flood the undercity with Enforcers,
armed with Hextech.

If we follow your plan,
we risk unifying them against us.

07:23.667 --> 07:26.125
So, what is your solution? Chastisement?

07:26.667 --> 07:27.875

07:27.958 --> 07:30.042
We use their division against them.

I'm sorry, Mel. I'm not comfortable
trusting our fates to chance.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.125
Jinx has proven elusive.

07:40.208 --> 07:43.833
Our healing can only begin
once she's been brought to justice.

If I may? In crises such as these,

I'll agree to endorse the invasion.

But I draw the line at Hextech.

I can do this myself.

to take on more than I could handle,

19:48.792 --> 19:50.250
Took on his whole gang?

19:51.875 --> 19:53.292
Cait said all that?

19:53.375 --> 19:57.083
She said if every Enforcer
had a heart like yours,

19:57.167 --> 19:58.792
we could take on Noxus itself.

19:58.875 --> 20:00.167
[Maddie chuckles]

20:00.250 --> 20:02.792
Then she threatened
to withdraw her family's funding.

20:03.333 --> 20:06.125
Anyhow, I'm glad you're joining up.

20:07.250 --> 20:08.208
Hmm.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.708
[Maddie] After the sheriff betrayed us…

20:11.792 --> 20:14.375
Well, let's just say…

20:15.750 --> 20:18.458
it's nice to know
there are still good ones left.

20:23.792 --> 20:26.417
[fanfare playing]

20:39.750 --> 20:40.875
[man] Officer Nolen.

20:42.667 --> 20:44.000
[Maddie] Duty calls.

20:44.917 --> 20:46.125
A real honor, Vi.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.458
[snoring]

20:50.333 --> 20:51.333

[snoring]

21:03.250 --> 21:05.250
[solemn music playing]

21:07.667 --> 21:09.708
-Go ahead, ma'am.
-This way, ma'am.

21:09.792 --> 21:12.250
-Stop.
-[guard] Please keep moving, folks.

21:43.125 --> 21:44.167
Mm-hm.

21:52.458 --> 21:55.542
One of the many privileges
of serving as your councilor

21:56.083 --> 21:59.917
is having the occasion now and again
to stand behind this podium

22:00.500 --> 22:02.042
to behold so many

22:02.583 --> 22:07.125
joined together not by birth or dictum
but by all that we share.

22:08.292 --> 22:09.583
Our hope.

22:11.458 --> 22:12.958
Our curiosity.

22:14.875 --> 22:18.958
Our compulsion to leave behind us
a world better than that before.

22:20.333 --> 22:24.083
These things we share
are what make us one people.

22:37.167 --> 22:42.250
Today we share an unthinkable loss.

22:43.875 --> 22:45.625
Councilor Irius Bolbok,

22:46.333 --> 22:48.000
Councilor Torman Hoskel,

22:48.083 --> 22:51.417
and Councilor Cassandra Kiramman
were taken from us.

22:53.958 --> 22:56.000
But they shall not be forgotten.

22:59.458 --> 23:00.833
We commissioned this statue

23:00.917 --> 23:03.792
so we may remember them
for their countless contributions…

23:06.292 --> 23:08.208
their lifetimes of service.

23:10.083 --> 23:13.042
Not for the craven act
that stole them away.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.833
[guard] Ma'am, you can't go in…

23:14.917 --> 23:16.333
[distorted dialogue]

23:19.208 --> 23:21.583
[Mel] Though we've suffered
a terrible blow,

23:22.792 --> 23:26.500
I assure you,
the rule of law prevails in Piltover.

23:27.042 --> 23:29.500
-No.
-[Mel] We will find those responsible.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.792
And they will account for their crimes.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.500
Awful, isn't it?

23:40.375 --> 23:42.417
Losing a loved one.

None of you are safe.

26:54.417 --> 26:56.292
Get the counselors out of here.

26:56.375 --> 26:57.375
I have an idea.

26:57.458 --> 26:58.833
What are you doing?

31:46.833 --> 31:48.417
[Enforcer 1] Perimeter secured.

31:48.500 --> 31:49.333
We'll see.

32:03.458 --> 32:05.958
Thought you were gonna
get yourself killed.

32:10.708 --> 32:11.542
[child sobbing]

32:11.625 --> 32:13.000
[Enforcer 2] Here, come with me.

32:13.583 --> 32:14.583
A memorial.

32:14.667 --> 32:15.667
I got you.

32:16.250 --> 32:18.958
What kind of animals?

32:19.042 --> 32:20.958
They wanted the spectacle.

32:21.042 --> 32:22.708
They're trying to scare you.

32:22.792 --> 32:25.042
All they did is piss me off.

32:25.625 --> 32:26.458
You…

32:27.250 --> 32:30.042
You need to find a way
to call off the invasion.

32:30.125 --> 32:31.083
What?

32:31.167 --> 32:33.250
This battle was on your soil.

32:33.333 --> 32:35.542
Down there, you'll be on their terms.

32:35.625 --> 32:38.458
None of this is on our terms.

32:38.542 --> 32:41.750
-[Vi] Maybe you should change that.
-I don't know how, okay?

32:42.375 --> 32:45.250
She dies and leaves this giant hole,

32:45.333 --> 32:47.667
and I'm just supposed to fill it.

32:48.708 --> 32:50.667
Like she was never there to begin with.

32:51.167 --> 32:52.000
[Vi] Hey.

32:52.583 --> 32:53.417
You won't.

32:54.042 --> 32:55.750
The hole gets smaller, but…

32:56.792 --> 32:57.875
you never fill it.

33:03.583 --> 33:05.750
I was wrong to spring the badge on you.

33:07.125 --> 33:08.375
It's just…

33:08.458 --> 33:10.167
every way I slice it,

33:10.708 --> 33:12.667
if I go after your sister alone,

33:12.750 --> 33:14.792
one of us comes back in a box.

33:16.708 --> 33:18.208
It's all coming apart.

33:20.083 --> 33:21.000
[Vi] No, it isn't.

33:22.750 --> 33:23.833
We won't let it.

But here we are.

Does anyone still doubt that our enemy
is greater than one deranged individual?

How did they sneak so many
of these things into the ceremony?

to secure it.

[Salo] We can't afford

Address me with respect,
