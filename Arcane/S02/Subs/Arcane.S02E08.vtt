our own expressions.

An empath.

Able to sense others' inner selves

Even now you hide your true face

Regrettably, his fate wasn't

You killed him.

02:27.583 --> 02:31.666
I gave Ambessa every opportunity
to atone for her transgressions.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.833
She chose pride over progeny.

02:34.416 --> 02:37.000

For all her faults,

she has always done
what she thought was best for the family.

03:26.791 --> 03:28.833
Your brother thought so too,

Your birth,

This chain of events started with you.

In my confusion,
I was unable to reconcile this.

But I now understand.

It says something about the late Marcus

20:34.916 --> 20:39.750
that he found imprisoning your sister
to be a greater mercy than killing her.

20:40.458 --> 20:41.958
[Jinx] Killing isn't mercy.

long before Vander and me.

and accepted limitation.

to merit the blood in my veins.

There is no force in this world

Topside and bottom,

25:27.041 --> 25:29.000
to aid us in this coming war.

25:29.875 --> 25:31.458
