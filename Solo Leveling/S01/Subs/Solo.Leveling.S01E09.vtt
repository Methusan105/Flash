WEBVTT

00:06.360 --> 00:09.180
These stupid things are coming right at us, 
begging to be killed.

00:09.180 --> 00:12.370
Well, I love it! Let's wipe 'em all out!

00:14.640 --> 00:17.040
I'm not sure which ones 
are the real beasts.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.000
Old Man Song's a beast himself!

00:27.850 --> 00:32.340
That takes care of this group. 
You really have gotten stronger, Sung!

00:33.000 --> 00:35.130
And where did you get such a nice dagger?

00:36.500 --> 00:40.930
Now that I think about it, 
you haven't been hurt at all today, Jinwoo.

00:40.930 --> 00:42.730
I-Is that right?

00:42.730 --> 00:45.520
Here's hoping no one ends up needing my help.

00:45.520 --> 00:47.990
Well, I'm still counting on you.

00:47.990 --> 00:50.700
<i>He definitely has changed.</i>

00:51.310 --> 00:56.120
<i>Not just his appearance but even his aura... 
He's making it look easy now.</i>

00:56.120 --> 00:58.580
Did you start learning martial arts?

00:59.210 --> 01:01.120
Let's keep going.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.220
The path splits here.

02:35.830 --> 02:38.050
The dungeon's been easier than forecast,

02:38.050 --> 02:40.210
so it should be fine 
to split into three groups.

02:40.210 --> 02:44.530
There'd be additional risk, 
but we'd be able to finish sooner, too.

02:44.530 --> 02:45.940
I think that's a good idea.

02:46.290 --> 02:48.860
I'll take the prisoners down 
the path on the right.

02:48.860 --> 02:52.360
If you find the boss chamber, 
send someone to let us know.

02:52.820 --> 02:56.740
<i>I guess it's because I raised my perception 
ability, but I can tell already.</i>

02:57.640 --> 02:59.410
<i>The boss is down there.</i>

03:00.210 --> 03:02.770
<i>These goblins weren't getting me 
much experience, anyway.</i>

03:03.400 --> 03:04.550
Mr. Song.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.610
Let's head down the path to the left.

03:06.610 --> 03:07.500
Understood.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.550
That leaves the middle for us.

03:09.550 --> 03:10.590
Right.

03:21.690 --> 03:24.230
If these goblins are all 
there is, we'll be fine.

03:24.230 --> 03:27.340
I just hope we can finish this job safely.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.570
I'm sure we will.

03:29.320 --> 03:33.150
The Weakest Hunter only gets called in 
for low-rank dungeons, right?

03:33.150 --> 03:37.260
Except we made that same assumption 
once already, and look what happened.

03:39.850 --> 03:40.820
I've made up my mind.

03:41.380 --> 03:45.670
When this raid's over, 
I'm gonna apologize to Sung.

03:46.920 --> 03:50.920
It's been bugging you, too, right? 
How we ran away.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.160
We're grown men, professional hunters...

03:54.930 --> 03:57.120
Even if it was because of our families,

03:57.120 --> 04:00.400
that doesn't change the fact that 
we left one of our own behind.

04:00.760 --> 04:05.100
If we wanna keep being hunters... 
we need to face up to what happened.

04:07.310 --> 04:09.690
You think he'll forgive us?

04:09.690 --> 04:13.600
There's no chance. 
But I'm still gonna apologize.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.020
Come on, let's get going.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.670
What a joke! These goblins are way too easy!

04:22.000 --> 04:23.530
Is that all of them?

04:23.530 --> 04:25.250
You expected it to take longer?

04:25.250 --> 04:27.240
I wanna rack up some more kills!

04:29.500 --> 04:31.830
What if you were facing humans?

04:32.910 --> 04:34.590
Could you kill them just as easily?

04:35.690 --> 04:38.050
I don't really see the difference.

04:38.050 --> 04:40.330
Yeah. It's all the same shit.

04:41.510 --> 04:43.270
What did you want to discuss?

04:44.410 --> 04:47.730
Three men... assaulted my daughter.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.470
She hung herself afterwards,

04:50.470 --> 04:52.980
and my wife was hospitalized 
from the psychological shock...

04:52.980 --> 04:58.490
But these scum will be free in a few years, 
like nothing happened at all!

04:58.490 --> 05:01.490
Not only that, but they're hunters!

05:01.950 --> 05:04.530
Hunters are allowed to participate 
in raids while incarcerated

05:04.530 --> 05:06.600
to reduce their sentences, right?

05:07.470 --> 05:09.530
In what world is that fair?!

05:09.530 --> 05:12.510
When my daughter will never get to come home!

05:15.330 --> 05:16.340
And that is?

05:16.340 --> 05:18.630
I have three billion here.

05:18.980 --> 05:21.830
I want you... to...

05:22.620 --> 05:24.460
kill them, please.

05:25.420 --> 05:29.680
What happens in a dungeon 
stays in the dungeon, right?

05:30.270 --> 05:33.180
Please! I'm begging you!

05:36.270 --> 05:39.900
Here's what I'll tell the inspectors 
when I get out of here:

05:40.250 --> 05:45.480
The three of you were set upon 
by a pack of a hundred goblins.

05:46.740 --> 05:49.200
This path really goes all over the place...

05:49.200 --> 05:51.190
Are we even making any progress?

05:51.190 --> 05:53.420
You think we got the dud route?

05:53.420 --> 05:54.830
Here we go...

05:57.410 --> 05:59.250
Help... me...

05:59.250 --> 06:01.510
Hoping for a quick death?

06:01.960 --> 06:06.750
I was actually asked to make you 
suffer as much as possible first.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.740
Wh-What the hell are you doing?!

06:10.040 --> 06:12.640
Huh. I guess the paths met back up.

06:12.960 --> 06:16.960
Which means the left path 
was the one that led to the boss room.

06:17.490 --> 06:19.500
That'll save me some trouble.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.630
Hel—

06:21.850 --> 06:23.860
Guess I'll have to alter my plans.

06:29.540 --> 06:33.800
<i>That Kang Taeshik guy visited me in 
the hospital with his inspector boss.</i>

06:34.750 --> 06:37.580
<i>I hope he doesn't remember me.</i>

06:39.530 --> 06:40.420
Mr. Song!

06:40.420 --> 06:41.320
Right!

06:47.030 --> 06:48.760
What is this?!

06:51.120 --> 06:52.260
Jeongho!

06:55.000 --> 06:56.400
Mr. Kang...?

07:09.620 --> 07:12.120
Mr. Kim?

07:12.910 --> 07:14.870
Joohee, heal him.

07:15.470 --> 07:16.940
Hurry and heal him!

07:16.940 --> 07:18.540
R-Right!

07:21.570 --> 07:23.960
Mr. Kim! Please hang on!

07:24.280 --> 07:27.180
<i>This wasn't the work of a magic beast.</i>

07:27.620 --> 07:32.140
<i>The weapon's too sharp. And whoever used it 
avoided finishing him off... multiple times.</i>

07:32.590 --> 07:37.100
Don't... bother. I'm not gonna make it.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.470
What are you talking about?

07:39.900 --> 07:43.180
You need to survive. 
You have a family, don't you?

07:44.020 --> 07:45.570
You...

07:45.570 --> 07:51.030
You need to survive, no matter what! 
How else can I keep blaming you?!

07:51.850 --> 07:55.500
I'm sorry. I really am sorry.

07:55.500 --> 07:59.830
I didn't see it playing out like this.

08:00.460 --> 08:04.170
I wanted to give you... a proper apology.

08:04.870 --> 08:08.140
I'm real sorry, kid.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.240
I mean... it...

08:19.650 --> 08:21.000
Kim...

08:30.380 --> 08:32.530
Wow, you're fast.

08:34.530 --> 08:37.910
I had intended on taking out 
the healer first...

08:39.250 --> 08:41.670
But it looks like you were able 
to change her fate.

08:42.160 --> 08:45.030
Mr. Kang?! Did you do this?!

08:45.030 --> 08:46.380
What if I did?

08:46.380 --> 08:49.690
Aren't you from the Hunter's Association?!

08:49.690 --> 08:51.080
You think you can get away with—

08:51.080 --> 08:53.050
I've got the perfect little story.

08:53.860 --> 08:59.560
I was gonna say that it was a swarm 
of goblins, but here's my new angle:

09:00.220 --> 09:04.710
The prisoners were plotting an escape, 
so they killed the rest of you

09:04.710 --> 09:09.150
and then tried to ambush me while 
I was occupied fighting the boss...

09:09.530 --> 09:14.740
But they didn't have what it takes. 
And that's why I was the sole survivor.

09:14.740 --> 09:16.580
What do you think? Perfect, huh?

09:17.040 --> 09:18.200
You scum.

09:18.910 --> 09:22.370
You can't stand against him. I'll go.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.300
I'm borrowing this, Kim.

09:26.230 --> 09:28.800
<i>I haven't raised a sword against 
another person in a long time.</i>

09:29.170 --> 09:32.250
<i>He's B-Rank, a level above me. But still...</i>

09:32.810 --> 09:36.250
Ms. Joohee, could you cast a 
physical strength buff on me?

09:36.250 --> 09:37.600
R-Right!

09:37.880 --> 09:40.970
<i>Assassin types tend to have weak defenses.</i>

09:41.440 --> 09:43.100
<i>I'll aim for that.</i>

09:43.100 --> 09:48.360
A washed-up mage like you trying to rely 
on strength instead is gonna backfire.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.740
Right now, I'm a swordsman.

09:53.360 --> 09:57.740
But your skills are magic-focused! 
Taking up that sword won't help you!

10:00.890 --> 10:02.960
You might be surprised!

10:03.520 --> 10:05.080
Okay, you've got some moves.

10:05.540 --> 10:09.090
Even putting aside the buff, 
you really do know your stuff.

10:09.620 --> 10:12.340
<i>It was only for a moment, 
but he was able to keep up.</i>

10:13.420 --> 10:15.180
<i>If Mr. Song was a little faster...</i>

10:15.180 --> 10:19.600
Fast and accurate! I can see why 
you ditched magic for the sword!

10:20.830 --> 10:23.040
But that's about all you can manage.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.150
That pain-in-the-ass healer.

10:29.470 --> 10:31.360
Guess I had better deal with her after all.

10:35.820 --> 10:38.490
Turning your back on an armed opponent?!

10:38.490 --> 10:41.580
I guess you're no average old fart.

10:41.940 --> 10:44.820
I've trained S-Rank hunters before!

10:44.820 --> 10:47.080
In terms of blade technique, I won't be beat!

10:47.370 --> 10:50.870
Maybe, but the powers you've 
been given have their limits.

10:51.250 --> 10:56.760
Did you think a mage type like you 
could keep up with an assassin hunter?!

11:01.460 --> 11:02.570
Mr. Song!

11:04.860 --> 11:05.890
Oh, no...

11:05.890 --> 11:09.360
Your healer's useless, too.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.560
Game over.

11:21.700 --> 11:22.830
<i>Did that work?!</i>

11:23.240 --> 11:27.120
You took up that sword to make me 
lower my guard against magic...

11:27.620 --> 11:30.920
so that when I went for the kill, 
you could blast me.

11:30.920 --> 11:35.220
Pretty slick plan, for a senile old bastard.

11:35.220 --> 11:36.800
<i>I'm finished!</i>

11:37.740 --> 11:38.390
Now die.

11:44.850 --> 11:46.710
You again?

11:46.710 --> 11:47.940
Who the hell are you?!

11:48.950 --> 11:52.100
Sung Jinwoo, E-Rank.

11:53.420 --> 11:56.950
E-Rank? That's a load of crap.

11:56.950 --> 12:00.160
Sung? What was that just now?

12:00.160 --> 12:05.160
I could see a power type, even at E-Rank, 
being able to block like that.

12:05.160 --> 12:09.070
But the reaction time you'd 
need to pull it off twice...

12:09.070 --> 12:10.170
would require an assassin build.

12:10.590 --> 12:15.260
Not that it really matters, anyway. 
You've been hiding your skills, haven't you?

12:15.260 --> 12:17.680
Your little group seems to know each other.

12:17.680 --> 12:22.480
So you can't be a false ranker. 
They don't let any witnesses live.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.290
Which leaves only one possibility...

12:26.010 --> 12:27.440
You had a second awakening.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.520
You did, Sung?!

12:28.520 --> 12:29.690
A second awakening?!

12:30.390 --> 12:33.820
Then it must've happened 
after the double dungeon!

12:34.160 --> 12:35.730
<i>A double dungeon?</i>

12:36.040 --> 12:39.090
<i>Wait... Is he that weakling 
E-Rank from before?</i>

12:39.680 --> 12:42.890
<i>But he looks and acts like a different person.</i>

12:42.890 --> 12:45.700
<i>And the mana meter only read 10 
when we checked back then.</i>

12:46.180 --> 12:48.260
<i>If he had a second awakening, 
it must have been after.</i>

12:48.260 --> 12:51.670
<i>So how'd he survive the double dungeon...?</i>

12:52.130 --> 12:56.740
Well, whatever happened to you, I can tell 
you don't have a ton of hunting experience.

12:56.740 --> 12:59.590
So it falls to me to teach you the ropes.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.680
Why did you do this?

13:01.680 --> 13:03.760
You mean killing the prisoners?

13:04.250 --> 13:07.560
I was asked to by the father of their victim.

13:07.560 --> 13:11.210
They drove someone to suicide 
and didn't regret it at all.

13:11.210 --> 13:13.150
It's a bit of social justice, that's all.

13:13.150 --> 13:15.900
No. I was talking about Mr. Kim and Mr. Kang.

13:16.270 --> 13:17.440
Why kill them?

13:18.110 --> 13:21.660
Was it to silence them? Because you 
could've done that without torturing them.

13:22.220 --> 13:26.360
But you didn't do that. You toyed with them.

13:26.910 --> 13:29.620
I don't think you did this 
for the victim's sake at all.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.080
That's not what you really want.

13:34.650 --> 13:38.030
Sure, I can do that.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.490
But you've got the wrong idea.

13:41.010 --> 13:45.470
I'm a B-Rank hunter who has received 
offers from a number of major guilds.

13:46.150 --> 13:50.420
So why am I working for peanuts 
in the Hunter's Association?

13:50.930 --> 13:57.690
It's because I find people a <i>whole</i> 
lot more fun to kill than beasts!

14:00.840 --> 14:03.750
There's a limit to what even a 
reawakened E-Rank can pull off!

14:05.800 --> 14:06.620
Too slow.

14:06.620 --> 14:07.990
Impressive.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.160
He's so agile!

14:13.630 --> 14:17.570
Nothing at all like the Sung I remember!

14:20.260 --> 14:21.970
<i>We're matched in speed!</i>

14:22.400 --> 14:25.840
<i>We've got the same build 
and similar skill levels...</i>

14:26.170 --> 14:29.490
<i>But I have far more experience battling 
high-ranked opponents than you!</i>

14:29.490 --> 14:32.480
<i>That inexperience will be your downfall!</i>

14:38.900 --> 14:41.910
You've got grit, I'll give you that.

14:41.910 --> 14:43.310
Sorry...

14:43.310 --> 14:43.860
Eh?

14:43.860 --> 14:46.870
But could you be a little less bloodthirsty?

14:47.570 --> 14:51.040
Now you've done it. 
Even the system's noticed.

14:52.370 --> 14:54.970
Then again, I guess I should be grateful.

14:54.970 --> 14:58.590
The system's given me another reason 
to make sure you die.

14:58.590 --> 15:00.250
The system?

15:00.250 --> 15:01.670
<i>What the hell is he talking about?</i>

15:02.080 --> 15:04.630
<i>I should have the advantage here...</i>

15:11.150 --> 15:12.680
<i>He's even faster?!</i>

15:13.600 --> 15:16.650
<i>Poison? A special effect 
from that dagger of yours?</i>

15:21.230 --> 15:23.990
<i>I've got something special to show you, too!</i>

15:25.530 --> 15:27.030
<i>He vanished?!</i>

15:27.420 --> 15:30.990
I should be completely undetectable. 
You're a sharp bastard, all right.

15:31.400 --> 15:36.440
This is the Stealth skill. It conceals 
my sight, my sound, and even my smell.

15:36.440 --> 15:40.740
Only a tiny fraction of assassin 
hunters ever obtain this skill.

15:40.740 --> 15:45.480
Of course, no one knows I can use it, either.

15:45.480 --> 15:46.520
And the reason for that...

15:48.770 --> 15:53.720
is that no one who's seen me use it 
has ever lived to tell the tale.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.230
You won't be so fast now.

15:56.850 --> 15:57.850
Jinwoo—

15:57.050 --> 15:58.760
Keep your hands to yourself!

15:59.610 --> 16:02.150
You two are next.

16:02.570 --> 16:05.070
<i>At this rate, Sung's going to die!</i>

16:05.070 --> 16:09.290
Now, think you can dodge my next strike 
with an injured leg?

16:09.290 --> 16:12.240
Are you done talking now?

16:12.600 --> 16:14.030
Full recovery.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.000
<i>He healed in an instant?!</i>

16:18.000 --> 16:22.340
<i>I've never heard of a combat hunter 
who could use healing magic, too.</i>

16:22.650 --> 16:24.460
<i>What else does he have?!</i>

16:24.460 --> 16:27.550
<i>He's impossible to predict! 
This guy is dangerous!</i>

16:27.890 --> 16:30.120
<i>That's another of my emotions, gone.</i>

16:30.970 --> 16:34.850
I don't even need to get angry 
to kill filth like you.

16:36.240 --> 16:40.020
Oh, I see. You've killed before, too, huh?

16:41.670 --> 16:44.120
Man, I didn't know we were 
in the same business!

16:44.520 --> 16:45.770
<i>I see now.</i>

16:45.770 --> 16:50.610
<i>He must've been forced through a number 
of grave decisions in a short time.</i>

16:51.020 --> 16:53.830
<i>It wasn't just his appearance that changed.</i>

16:53.830 --> 16:58.580
When hunters awakened, their supernatural 
abilities turned the world on its head.

16:59.120 --> 17:03.590
Where we are is a place that only hunters 
can enter. Laws aren't worth shit here.

17:03.820 --> 17:06.160
Whoever's strongest comes out on top.

17:11.740 --> 17:15.710
<i>Is he tracking me from my bloodlust?</i>

17:15.710 --> 17:18.990
<i>But that won't let him know 
exactly where I'm coming from!</i>

17:23.980 --> 17:25.200
What the—

17:27.150 --> 17:29.780
Wait... Are you kidding me?

17:33.140 --> 17:36.560
What... the hell...

17:42.570 --> 17:45.720
You asked why I killed them, right?

17:46.500 --> 17:52.660
It's pointless to expect hunters, who thrive 
in mortal combat, to stick to normal morals.

17:53.300 --> 17:59.470
You're the same way. You and me, 
we're killing machines at this point.

17:59.910 --> 18:02.910
Which is why I'll die. Because I lost.

18:02.910 --> 18:05.560
It's just natural selection.

18:06.260 --> 18:08.460
But what the hell are you?

18:08.460 --> 18:12.030
You've got assassin skills, 
healing, and debuffs...

18:12.030 --> 18:13.530
I've never heard of anything like it.

18:13.910 --> 18:17.940
Couldn't tell you. I'd like to know, myself.

18:22.290 --> 18:28.210
Well, you just killed me, 
so your little E-Rank act is over.

18:28.210 --> 18:32.280
Let's say that I'm a hunter 
who gets stronger with every battle.

18:35.140 --> 18:39.960
Then I'd say your shadow stretches 
into some really nasty places...

18:40.440 --> 18:44.340
and you'll probably get as strong 
as those places are dark.

18:44.730 --> 18:47.400
You'd better watch yourself, though.

18:48.200 --> 18:55.880
If you gaze for long into an abyss, 
the abyss... gazes also into you.

19:01.870 --> 19:05.970
<i>He's right. I'm incomparably strong 
next to how I was before.</i>

19:06.640 --> 19:08.210
<i>But for some reason...</i>

19:08.880 --> 19:14.330
<i>the stronger I get, the more I feel 
something inside of me falling apart.</i>

19:14.330 --> 19:15.550
Jinwoo!

19:15.550 --> 19:17.420
Thank you so much.

19:17.830 --> 19:22.230
You really did it.
We only survived because of you.

19:22.230 --> 19:25.590
It's fine. You two should exit the dungeon.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.730
I'll handle the rest.

19:27.730 --> 19:30.020
What?! By yourself?!

19:30.710 --> 19:32.610
Then again... you're right.

19:33.470 --> 19:37.240
It's a shame we won't be able 
to lay Kim and Kang to rest.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.700
We'll be waiting outside.

19:50.540 --> 19:51.630
Manager Woo!

19:51.630 --> 19:53.970
I heard the report. Where are the survivors?

19:53.970 --> 19:55.340
Right this way.

19:55.340 --> 20:01.050
<i>I can't believe Kang was 
killing in secret all this time.</i>

20:01.400 --> 20:06.760
<i>He had always been a little sketchy, 
but as his supervisor, I was too careless.</i>

20:07.610 --> 20:09.100
This is the three of them.

20:10.930 --> 20:14.280
<i>Isn't he... the E-Rank hunter from before?</i>

20:14.750 --> 20:16.360
<i>He looks like a whole different person.</i>

20:17.240 --> 20:18.760
It's good to see you again.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.660
Aren't you the inspector...?

20:20.660 --> 20:25.400
Woo Jinchul. I want to apologize for what 
one of my men put you through.

20:26.050 --> 20:29.920
But first... I'd like 
to address the main issue.

20:29.920 --> 20:33.380
Which one of you defeated Kang?

20:33.380 --> 20:36.460
<i>I guess I won't be able to keep 
my secret any longer.</i>

20:36.970 --> 20:41.390
<i>Which means I'm gonna have to 
cancel my deal with Jinho...</i>

20:42.010 --> 20:43.350
It was me.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.320
I killed Mr. Kang.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.020
Pardon me, but I believe your rank was...?

20:49.020 --> 20:50.540
C-Rank.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.560
How were you able to beat 
a B-Rank like Kang?

20:53.560 --> 20:56.280
Why, with the help of my friend here.

20:57.450 --> 21:01.490
I see. Then you say you 
managed with a healer's help.

21:02.580 --> 21:05.170
<i>Kang was the cream of the crop among B-Ranks.</i>

21:05.170 --> 21:08.710
<i>By all rights, a C-Rank mage 
shouldn't have stood a chance...</i>

21:10.130 --> 21:11.540
Very well.

21:11.540 --> 21:16.000
I'll need to write this incident up, 
so if you could please come with me.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.860
<i>I can't get cocky just because 
I beat Kang Taeshik.</i>

21:20.180 --> 21:24.060
<i>I couldn't tell before, 
but this guy is A-Rank.</i>

21:24.060 --> 21:26.200
<i>As it stands, I'd be helpless against him.</i>

21:27.580 --> 21:30.360
Sorry if I overstepped my bounds there.

21:31.270 --> 21:35.230
But I imagine you've got a good reason 
for keeping your strength hidden.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.700
Well, think of it as my way 
of paying you back.

21:45.090 --> 21:46.530
<i>Three hours later,</i>

21:46.530 --> 21:50.250
<i>the man who hired Kang Taeshik 
to kill the prisoners turned himself in,</i>

21:50.250 --> 21:52.830
<i>which confirmed that 
we acted in self-defense.</i>

21:54.920 --> 21:56.880
What a day, huh?

21:57.630 --> 21:58.800
Jinwoo.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.950
Do you remember this?
