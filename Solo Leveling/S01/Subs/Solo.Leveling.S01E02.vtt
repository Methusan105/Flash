00:01.630 --> 00:03.320
<i>What is that thing?!</i>

00:05.470 --> 00:06.750
Let's get out of here!

00:06.750 --> 00:08.730
Wait! You might get killed, too!

00:08.730 --> 00:09.950
Then what are we supposed to do?!

00:09.950 --> 00:11.190
Is there no other way out?!

00:11.190 --> 00:12.800
How the hell am I supposed to know?!

00:12.800 --> 00:13.990
Two of us are already dead!

00:13.990 --> 00:17.300
Nobody move! If you do, it'll attack again!

00:22.370 --> 00:24.550
Joohee! Joohee!

00:24.930 --> 00:26.390
That was a close one.

00:27.410 --> 00:31.170
If you hadn't noticed what was happening, 
we'd all be dead.

00:32.270 --> 00:34.650
Didn't you yell because you'd figured it out?

00:34.650 --> 00:37.800
No... It just seemed dangerous...

00:39.340 --> 00:41.250
Mr. Song, your arm!

00:42.040 --> 00:44.210
If I grit my teeth, it's not too bad.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.910
Can you stop the bleeding, though?

00:48.840 --> 00:51.700
I was hoping to ask Joohee, but...

00:52.150 --> 00:53.650
she doesn't handle pressure well.

00:54.510 --> 00:58.660
That's why she only takes part in easy raids,
despite being a B-Rank healer.

00:59.300 --> 01:03.330
I've been through two or three 
B-Rank dungeons myself...

01:04.060 --> 01:08.580
And that might be an A-Rank foe... or even S.

01:09.630 --> 01:13.050
The commandments of the Cartenon Temple 
written on that tablet...

01:13.050 --> 01:17.720
"First, revere God. Second, praise God."

01:17.720 --> 01:20.100
"Third, prove your faith to God."

01:20.100 --> 01:23.010
"Those who do not follow these 
laws will not leave alive."

01:23.540 --> 01:26.230
Mr. Song... The god it's talking about...

01:26.720 --> 01:28.490
It's probably that thing, isn't it?

01:30.140 --> 01:33.770
<i>Over ten years ago, tunnels known as gates</i>

01:33.770 --> 01:37.530
<i>that connected our world to 
an alternate dimension appeared,</i>

01:37.530 --> 01:41.290
<i>giving rise to a number of supernatural 
phenomena throughout the world.</i>

01:43.580 --> 01:48.090
<i>Those who awaken to special powers, 
known as hunters, are a prime example.</i>

01:48.590 --> 01:54.190
<i>They are tasked with defeating the beasts 
that lie within the dungeons through gates,</i>

01:54.640 --> 01:58.670
<i>and a hunter's power, 
once active, never changes.</i>

01:59.500 --> 02:02.850
<i>But at times, on the other side of a gate,</i>

02:03.500 --> 02:06.650
<i>one finds monsters who inspire 
something beyond mere terror—</i>

02:06.650 --> 02:09.980
<i>something akin to absolute despair.</i>

03:41.950 --> 03:43.130
Did you watch it?

03:43.130 --> 03:44.280
Oh, the video?

03:45.830 --> 03:48.900
What were you doing? 
You almost got marked as late.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.020
Nothing special.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.170
Jinah, your brother's a hunter, right?

03:55.170 --> 03:56.580
Sure is.

03:56.580 --> 03:59.230
Well, that said, he's an E-Rank hunter...

03:59.230 --> 04:01.960
So he's always getting hurt real bad. 
It seems like a lot of trouble.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.370
He came home covered 
in bandages the other day!

04:04.850 --> 04:07.550
Why are you asking, anyway?

04:07.550 --> 04:08.880
No real reason.

04:09.860 --> 04:12.410
I bet I could do a better job...

04:13.470 --> 04:15.560
That thing is too strong to fight.

04:16.010 --> 04:18.250
Let's collect ourselves and 
search for a way out of here.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.280
It won't be—

04:18.790 --> 04:20.280
I'm not just gonna die in here!

04:20.750 --> 04:24.310
I finally managed to land a contract 
with a major guild!

04:24.310 --> 04:27.040
I can't afford to bite it like this!

04:27.040 --> 04:29.160
What are you doing?! You mustn't move!

04:29.160 --> 04:32.040
I can pull this off! 
I'm pretty confident in my speed.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.690
I'll get it before it gets me!

04:45.010 --> 04:46.340
Damn it!

04:48.020 --> 04:51.790
I think this means it could 
wipe us all out if it felt like it.

04:51.790 --> 04:55.690
Easily, too. Like stepping on a bug.

04:55.690 --> 04:59.720
Then why doesn't it kill us right now?

05:01.030 --> 05:03.360
<i>It has the strength to kill us, but it hasn't.</i>

05:03.710 --> 05:07.450
<i>There's something different about it compared
to most beasts, which attack on sight.</i>

05:10.200 --> 05:12.950
Mr. Song, what was the first 
commandment again?

05:12.950 --> 05:14.010
The commandments?

05:14.010 --> 05:17.500
I think the first one was to revere God.

05:18.630 --> 05:19.380
<i>God...</i>

05:21.290 --> 05:23.320
This dungeon has its own rules.

05:23.800 --> 05:24.840
What are you doing?!

05:24.840 --> 05:27.220
If I'm right about this...

05:27.630 --> 05:28.900
You need to stop—

05:31.880 --> 05:35.850
From how you look, you haven't 
given up on surviving this.

05:52.450 --> 05:55.290
Everyone! Bow your heads 
toward the statue, please!

05:55.950 --> 05:57.280
Bow our heads?

05:57.280 --> 05:58.750
What the hell are you talking about?

05:58.750 --> 06:00.790
Did you figure out something?

06:00.790 --> 06:05.780
I think so. As long as you keep 
your head low, it won't attack.

06:05.780 --> 06:08.550
"Revere God." Just like the commandment says.

06:12.870 --> 06:15.050
You're sure about this?

06:15.050 --> 06:16.890
Yes... For now.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.360
In that case...

06:25.070 --> 06:28.280
<i>This is gonna save us? This is all it takes?</i>

06:34.950 --> 06:37.160
<i>Damn, that's freaky!</i>

06:37.160 --> 06:39.120
<i>Its expression changed?</i>

06:42.270 --> 06:43.980
It's not doing anything.

06:44.970 --> 06:46.790
Hey! Don't just get up!

06:49.970 --> 06:53.050
Look! It's not attacking anymore!

06:54.860 --> 06:56.890
Is it really over?

06:56.890 --> 06:58.310
Are we safe now?

06:58.310 --> 06:59.100
All right!

06:59.510 --> 07:00.320
We're saved!

07:00.320 --> 07:01.310
We can go home!

07:02.110 --> 07:04.690
<i>No... There's still...</i>

07:11.700 --> 07:13.780
I thought it was over!

07:13.780 --> 07:17.540
Sung, what now?! You have 
some kind of plan, right?

07:17.540 --> 07:19.960
N-Not at all!

07:21.260 --> 07:24.420
But it's probably a bad idea to break 
the commandments they set!

07:24.760 --> 07:26.520
The second was to praise God!

07:26.520 --> 07:27.750
That's what we need to figure out!

07:27.750 --> 07:28.770
Praise him?!

07:28.770 --> 07:30.390
How, exactly?

07:30.390 --> 07:32.250
Let me give this a try.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.540
I've been studying ethnology.

07:35.540 --> 07:38.760
There are a few extolments 
for gods that come to mind.

07:41.310 --> 07:45.110
O God, our great ruler 
who brings order to the world...

07:45.110 --> 07:47.070
Is it working?

07:47.070 --> 07:49.190
I think it might be slowing down?

07:49.650 --> 07:51.910
Show us the path of truth.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.120
<i>Wait. That's...</i>

07:55.240 --> 07:58.080
Thy will be done...

07:58.810 --> 08:01.420
<i>Those words don't apply to this god!</i>

08:01.420 --> 08:04.590
We revere and honor thee!

08:04.590 --> 08:08.670
O God, our great ruler 
who brings order to the world!

08:13.930 --> 08:15.020
Shit!

08:15.020 --> 08:16.110
Run for it!

08:24.150 --> 08:25.550
It's too dangerous to bunch up!

08:25.550 --> 08:26.270
Spread out!

08:26.270 --> 08:27.130
Right!

08:28.670 --> 08:30.140
Let's run, Joohee!

08:32.020 --> 08:33.910
<i>I can't die like this!</i>

08:34.410 --> 08:36.600
<i>I've got family waiting for me!</i>

08:37.920 --> 08:40.040
I should be safe over here, right?

08:40.610 --> 08:42.800
Hey, Park! Behind you!

08:51.760 --> 08:54.470
Park!

08:55.300 --> 08:58.330
<i>Praise God... Praise God...</i>

08:59.060 --> 09:03.580
<i>What is there to praise about that thing?! 
It's basically a devil!</i>

09:04.480 --> 09:08.150
<i>But I can't leave Joohee alone.</i>

09:10.280 --> 09:11.870
<i>I need some kind of clue.</i>

09:12.560 --> 09:14.570
<i>Spears... Axes...</i>

09:18.360 --> 09:21.790
<i>Hammers... Swords... Instruments...</i>

09:22.520 --> 09:23.490
<i>Instruments?</i>

09:26.330 --> 09:29.950
Everyone! Run to the statues 
with instruments!

09:30.380 --> 09:31.170
The instruments?

09:36.340 --> 09:39.260
Is it... playing?

09:39.260 --> 09:43.020
Hey! The statues with 
instruments won't attack!

09:51.000 --> 09:52.650
Damn it all...

09:54.200 --> 09:56.480
Please, play your music! Hurry!

09:57.700 --> 10:00.020
<i>Does it not work if there's two people?</i>

10:00.020 --> 10:02.190
You stay here, Joohee!

10:02.190 --> 10:03.510
Jinwoo!

10:12.960 --> 10:14.000
<i>Over there!</i>

10:23.400 --> 10:25.020
Not there!

10:28.580 --> 10:29.900
No!

10:29.900 --> 10:32.110
Jinwoo!

10:43.270 --> 10:45.160
<i>Not... yet...</i>

10:48.930 --> 10:50.080
<i>Not yet!</i>

11:11.290 --> 11:13.710
<i>I guess this is what was meant by praise?</i>

11:20.190 --> 11:22.820
Jinwoo! Are you okay?!

11:23.650 --> 11:25.410
Yeah... Barely.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.220
Jinwoo...

11:32.570 --> 11:33.460
Yeah?

11:38.150 --> 11:39.440
Your leg...

11:42.550 --> 11:46.990
That's enough, Joohee. I'll be fine.

11:46.990 --> 11:50.380
What are you saying?! I'm going to heal you!

11:54.010 --> 11:55.210
Joohee...

11:56.960 --> 11:58.500
What a nightmare.

11:58.880 --> 11:59.820
It really is.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.450
It's a shame about your arm.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.810
But you made a careless call as our leader.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.270
I guess it's just karma.

12:08.270 --> 12:09.140
That's awful!

12:09.140 --> 12:10.260
Kim, you were the one who—

12:10.260 --> 12:11.710
Hey, we all decided together!

12:11.710 --> 12:13.870
And I remember how you voted.

12:14.670 --> 12:18.170
I was the one who made the final call.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.760
I'm responsible for everything 
that's happened here.

12:21.390 --> 12:23.740
<i>This is no time to be arguing.</i>

12:23.740 --> 12:25.420
<i>There's still one more commandment.</i>

12:27.810 --> 12:29.220
What's going on now?!

12:29.220 --> 12:30.380
An earthquake?!

12:33.270 --> 12:34.640
What the hell is that?!

12:35.040 --> 12:36.360
An altar.

12:37.690 --> 12:40.630
They come up all the time in legends...

12:40.630 --> 12:43.070
for offering treasure 
and sacrifices to the gods.

12:43.410 --> 12:46.330
The third commandment. 
"Prove your faith to God."

12:47.950 --> 12:51.740
Even an idiot like me knows 
what the move is here.

12:52.310 --> 12:57.100
We've gotta offer up a sacrifice, 
ain't that right, Sung?

12:59.120 --> 13:04.110
I saw a man who was bragging about his wife 
before we came in here split down the middle.

13:04.110 --> 13:05.890
And he wasn't the only one!

13:06.280 --> 13:08.750
You said it yourself, didn't you?

13:08.750 --> 13:11.100
Well, time to take responsibility, Leader.

13:11.690 --> 13:13.110
Kim, that's—

13:12.150 --> 13:13.720
Enough out of you, buddy!

13:15.070 --> 13:18.960
Fine. Let me go myself.

13:20.820 --> 13:23.140
<i>This isn't Mr. Song's fault alone.</i>

13:23.140 --> 13:25.530
<i>We took a vote to decide to come here!</i>

13:29.200 --> 13:31.230
What's happening now?

13:34.780 --> 13:38.170
Sung! Is there anything else I need to do?

13:38.610 --> 13:42.790
<i>What is this? Didn't we need a sacrifice?</i>

13:43.960 --> 13:49.290
Sorry. I'd like to examine the altar, 
so could you help me over to it?

13:51.520 --> 13:53.790
Get me right next to it, please.

13:53.790 --> 13:55.640
B-But then, won't we...

13:55.640 --> 13:57.690
I don't think anything will happen.

14:04.570 --> 14:06.610
Did you figure something out?

14:06.610 --> 14:08.030
Not yet, no...

14:08.640 --> 14:12.190
If we wait here, is anyone 
likely to come rescue us?

14:12.190 --> 14:14.940
The gate will have been open 
for a week as of today.

14:15.280 --> 14:18.330
They'll probably start moving again 
before anyone comes for us.

14:21.490 --> 14:24.450
<i>It takes seven days for a gate 
to open up all the way.</i>

14:26.600 --> 14:28.610
<i>That's what's called a dungeon break.</i>

14:29.460 --> 14:33.070
<i>When that happens, the beasts are 
able to cross over to the other side.</i>

14:33.810 --> 14:37.200
<i>The other objective of raids 
is to defeat the dungeon boss</i>

14:37.200 --> 14:40.560
<i>and shut the gate down 
before that time is up.</i>

14:41.680 --> 14:44.460
<i>Which means if we fail here...</i>

14:45.320 --> 14:48.110
<i>That thing will be able to enter our world.</i>

14:48.890 --> 14:49.820
Hello!

14:49.820 --> 14:53.260
Oh, Miss Sung! It's wonderful 
how you visit every day.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.210
Mom! I'm here again.

15:02.210 --> 15:04.890
Song-yi was late to class today.

15:04.890 --> 15:08.950
She said she'd had stuff to do, 
but I'm sure she just overslept!

15:11.400 --> 15:13.430
Oh, and in the national test...

15:17.370 --> 15:19.340
Could you two come over here, please?

15:19.940 --> 15:22.760
We probably need a flame 
to light up for each one of us.

15:23.240 --> 15:26.040
If anything's going to happen, 
it'll be after that.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.380
The door's open.

15:43.380 --> 15:44.720
Can we leave?

15:44.720 --> 15:46.170
Unless this is a trap, too...

15:51.090 --> 15:52.670
What was that sound?!

15:52.670 --> 15:54.940
Th-The statues are coming this way!

15:54.940 --> 15:56.560
What do we do?!

15:56.560 --> 15:59.270
Why are they coming after us?!

16:03.730 --> 16:05.240
No!

16:05.240 --> 16:07.320
Joohee, don't close your eyes!

16:07.320 --> 16:08.990
They won't move if you're watching them!

16:09.690 --> 16:12.090
It works like that old children's game.

16:12.090 --> 16:14.490
Everyone, keep your eyes on the statues!

16:27.630 --> 16:29.760
Nooo!

16:28.560 --> 16:29.760
Hey!

16:28.710 --> 16:29.750
Wait!

16:34.550 --> 16:36.200
What's going on here, Sung?!

16:36.200 --> 16:39.100
The door closed a bit, 
but I think she made it out!

16:39.600 --> 16:40.560
<i>Why?</i>

16:41.060 --> 16:43.940
<i>The blue flames have been 
dying out over time.</i>

16:43.940 --> 16:47.270
<i>One of the orange ones went out 
when someone escaped.</i>

16:47.840 --> 16:52.150
<i>The first order was to revere. 
The second was to praise.</i>

16:52.780 --> 16:54.410
<i>The third is to prove our faith...</i>

16:55.840 --> 16:57.600
<i>It must be a trap.</i>

16:57.600 --> 17:00.780
<i>Causing danger and fear, 
and then offering a false sense of hope...</i>

17:00.780 --> 17:04.480
<i>Maybe it's testing our faith in this god.</i>

17:04.850 --> 17:07.460
I can't... I can't do this!

17:09.500 --> 17:10.440
Jeongho!

17:10.440 --> 17:11.010
Hey!

17:13.010 --> 17:13.970
Don't!

17:19.130 --> 17:20.340
You can't move!

17:20.340 --> 17:22.890
If anyone else leaves, 
we'll have blind spots!

17:23.630 --> 17:25.390
What is happening here, Sung?!

17:25.390 --> 17:26.650
We need an explanation!

17:26.650 --> 17:30.400
As long as we keep our eyes on the statues 
and don't move, we'll be safe!

17:30.870 --> 17:35.360
The blue flames are a timer. 
When they're all gone, we'll all make it out!

17:36.490 --> 17:42.500
Isn't there a chance we'll be 
trapped in here once they go out, too?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.570
I'll be honest, I didn't expect you, 
our weakest member,

17:46.570 --> 17:49.070
to pull off as much as you've managed.

17:49.070 --> 17:53.650
The only reason we're alive 
at all is thanks to you.

17:53.650 --> 17:55.090
Kim...

17:56.320 --> 18:01.820
But I've got a family waiting for me! 
I can't die just yet!

18:01.820 --> 18:04.210
I wanna make it home alive!

18:04.210 --> 18:06.310
I can't take any more of this!

18:06.930 --> 18:08.340
I'm sorry!

18:13.590 --> 18:14.940
<i>Why?</i>

18:16.690 --> 18:17.670
<i>Not yet!</i>

18:18.050 --> 18:19.570
<i>We have to survive this!</i>

18:20.560 --> 18:23.520
<i>I've managed to make it before, somehow!</i>

18:27.220 --> 18:29.220
The two of you should go.

18:30.010 --> 18:31.460
Mr. Song?

18:31.460 --> 18:36.220
I think the doors will stay open 
as long as one of us remains here.

18:36.730 --> 18:39.220
You two still have long lives 
ahead of you. You should go.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.930
Joohee, look after Sung for me.

18:41.930 --> 18:43.460
R-Right!

18:45.370 --> 18:48.350
No... Oh, no... No...

18:48.720 --> 18:51.680
My legs... gave out on me...

18:52.830 --> 18:55.350
You must've over-exerted 
yourself healing Sung.

18:56.030 --> 18:58.530
Mr. Song. Take Joohee and go.

18:59.940 --> 19:01.200
I just said I'm going to stay—

19:01.200 --> 19:03.650
Then who's going to carry Joohee out?!

19:03.650 --> 19:05.450
There's no time. Hurry!

19:06.660 --> 19:08.110
You can't, Jinwoo!

19:08.110 --> 19:09.210
In that case, it should be me—

19:09.210 --> 19:12.000
I promised to take you out to eat, didn't I?

19:12.620 --> 19:14.490
Use this to buy yourself dinner.

19:14.950 --> 19:17.930
And when I get out of here, 
I'll be along to collect the change.

19:17.930 --> 19:19.960
How can you even say—

19:21.820 --> 19:25.790
I'm sorry. But it looks like 
we really are out of time.

19:25.790 --> 19:26.960
Please.

19:34.610 --> 19:37.780
<i>Good. I'm the only one who has to die.</i>

19:39.510 --> 19:41.100
<i>If I'd known this was gonna happen,</i>

19:41.100 --> 19:43.870
<i>I would've enrolled in a juicier 
life insurance package.</i>

19:49.640 --> 19:52.450
I'll take at least one of you down with me...

19:53.400 --> 19:54.880
So bring it on!

20:06.880 --> 20:08.880
<i>I've always been the weakest.</i>

20:09.430 --> 20:12.230
<i>And I've been mocked for it, 
time and time again.</i>

20:12.230 --> 20:14.190
<i>But I've always tried as hard as I could.</i>

20:18.760 --> 20:19.900
<i>And now...</i>

20:21.400 --> 20:22.360
<i>This is bullshit.</i>

20:23.220 --> 20:25.220
<i>It's bullshit! This is such bullshit!</i>

20:27.320 --> 20:30.000
<i>I tried to be stronger...</i>

20:31.060 --> 20:32.960
<i>but I couldn't.</i>

20:37.680 --> 20:42.380
<i>And even then, 
I gave it my all to get this far!</i>

20:49.230 --> 20:53.110
<i>You couldn't take any more? 
We all felt the same way!</i>

20:53.110 --> 20:55.880
<i>All you were doing was 
justifying your own selfishness!</i>

20:58.730 --> 21:01.390
<i>That gratitude was purely superficial.</i>

21:01.390 --> 21:05.740
<i>It's always the most selfish 
people who benefit the most!</i>

21:06.100 --> 21:10.250
<i>I have a family, too! 
I wanted to make it home alive, too!</i>

21:17.540 --> 21:20.170
<i>It's good that I'm the only one 
who has to die?</i>

21:26.810 --> 21:30.000
<i>How could you think that, 
you stupid hypocrite?!</i>

21:33.200 --> 21:36.940
<i>No. I don't wanna die.</i>

21:43.290 --> 21:47.240
<i>If... If I had one more chance...</i>
