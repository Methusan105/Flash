00:04.570 --> 00:06.940
You look like a different person, Jinwoo.

00:07.490 --> 00:10.170
When I haven't changed at all.

00:10.820 --> 00:12.510
Well, a lot has happened.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.100
And experience affects everyone differently.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.540
You're right.

00:19.290 --> 00:23.760
I think I might be too timid to be a hunter.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.710
I've tried to get over it, 
but it never works out.

00:30.290 --> 00:35.400
I should really be participating in A and 
B-Rank raids... or at least C-Rank.

00:35.700 --> 00:39.090
But I chose D and E-Rank ones on purpose.

00:40.670 --> 00:46.360
That's how I met you, and found myself 
healing you time and time again.

00:48.110 --> 00:52.070
At first, it was a little annoying 
how often you got injured...

00:52.710 --> 00:56.250
But you always managed to survive.

00:56.620 --> 01:02.170
I'll never forget the way that your eyes 
always seemed to radiate vitality.

01:03.570 --> 01:06.360
We promised to go out to eat somewhere, right?

01:06.840 --> 01:09.670
You can have this back.

01:10.470 --> 01:11.630
Wait...

01:11.630 --> 01:15.100
I'm going to retire.

01:17.090 --> 01:18.730
I'm moving back in with my parents.

01:19.240 --> 01:22.650
If you ever find yourself in the area, 
let me know, okay?

01:22.650 --> 01:24.150
I can show you around.

01:26.580 --> 01:29.940
I'll invite you out again, if that happens.

01:29.940 --> 01:31.140
Right.

01:45.650 --> 01:50.420
I don't believe an E-Rank like yourself 
could defeat a B-Rank like Kang Taeshik.

01:51.360 --> 01:55.670
You've already been examined 
for a potential reawakening, after all.

01:56.210 --> 01:58.970
But I feel I should warn you anyway...

01:59.620 --> 02:02.430
If you want to live a long life, 
be careful out there.

02:02.430 --> 02:03.940
What do you mean?

02:04.470 --> 02:07.720
After the incident where Hwang Dongsuk's 
strike team was wiped out,

02:08.140 --> 02:10.860
with you and the D-Rank hunter 
as the only survivors...

02:11.250 --> 02:17.240
Hwang Dongsuk's younger brother, 
Hwang Dongsoo, may be targeting you both.

02:18.730 --> 02:21.870
Hwang Dongsoo, the S-Rank hunter, is after me?

02:21.870 --> 02:25.490
Correct. It doesn't matter
what actually happened in there.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.530
All he cares about is that Hwang Dongsuk 
died, while you managed to survive.

02:32.920 --> 02:37.000
The law is powerless to deal with S-Ranks.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.340
They have the potential to bring forth 
either miracle or calamity.

02:42.140 --> 02:48.670
In other words, one of the monsters that 
even monsters fear is out for your blood.

02:49.970 --> 02:54.990
If possible, I'd recommend taking 
your family and leaving the country.

02:57.810 --> 03:01.240
<i>That's one more reason I need to get stronger.</i>

03:02.110 --> 03:03.810
<i>Because if I don't...</i>

03:04.650 --> 03:06.640
<i>I won't be able to survive.</i>

04:39.610 --> 04:44.680
Uh, Jinho? What am I looking at here?

04:46.080 --> 04:49.170
What do you mean? It's obvious!

04:49.170 --> 04:50.690
This is our strike team!

04:51.330 --> 04:55.710
I prioritized people who are qualified to be 
hunters but have reasons they can't work

04:55.710 --> 04:59.240
and people who are having trouble getting by 
when making my selections.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.730
You've got injured people... and drunks.

05:01.730 --> 05:03.890
That works better for us, right?

05:03.890 --> 05:07.300
We need a minimum of eight people 
to raid C-Rank gates, after all.

05:09.050 --> 05:11.940
Hey, you've got a kid here, too.

05:11.940 --> 05:17.110
As long as they've awakened, 
there's no legal issue with recruiting minors.

05:17.110 --> 05:18.120
Hey.

05:19.210 --> 05:20.850
That's kind of rude.

05:20.850 --> 05:23.310
I am a qualified hunter, y'know.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.090
But you're in high school, right?

05:26.090 --> 05:27.750
Do you have any raiding experience?

05:27.750 --> 05:29.780
N-No.

05:29.780 --> 05:31.270
What rank? E?

05:32.290 --> 05:34.270
So what if I am?

05:34.580 --> 05:35.760
I guess it doesn't matter.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.030
You'll be waiting out here anyway.

05:38.640 --> 05:41.520
Jinho and I will be the only ones 
going into the dungeon.

05:42.900 --> 05:46.400
Hey... Is it seriously going 
to be just the two of you?

05:46.400 --> 05:49.620
And does this job really pay three million 
just for waiting outside?

05:49.620 --> 05:52.910
Right. Three million per raid.

05:52.910 --> 05:55.460
Pretty sweet deal, considering 
you don't have to fight, right?

05:57.120 --> 05:59.050
The only stipulation 
is that you can't talk about it.

05:59.530 --> 06:02.530
If you publicize our deal, 
the contract specifies

06:02.530 --> 06:05.260
you'll have to pay back ten times that amount.

06:06.100 --> 06:09.650
<i>The Stealth rune stone that 
I got by beating Kang Taeshik...</i>

06:10.610 --> 06:12.430
<i>Might as well use it now.</i>

06:24.120 --> 06:26.320
<i>Okay. Looks like it worked.</i>

06:26.720 --> 06:28.180
I'm ready to go.

06:30.540 --> 06:32.790
What are you wearing now?

06:32.790 --> 06:36.590
A full set of buff-boosting armor 
made by an Italian manufacturer!

06:36.920 --> 06:40.250
If we're gonna hit the dungeon together, boss,

06:40.600 --> 06:42.820
I need to be at least this ready!

06:47.350 --> 06:50.550
I'm not trying to be mean here, 
but take that stuff off.

06:50.550 --> 06:52.000
Okay...

06:56.160 --> 06:59.520
Boss, can you help me get up?

07:02.010 --> 07:03.820
All right. Let's get going.

07:04.510 --> 07:06.320
This is kind of nerve-racking.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.180
You've, uh, still got something on your head.

07:09.180 --> 07:11.300
At least let me keep the helmet!

07:12.610 --> 07:15.580
Fine, fine. Let's go.

07:15.580 --> 07:16.350
Right!

07:17.230 --> 07:20.430
They're seriously going in alone. 
Is this gonna be all right?

07:20.430 --> 07:24.840
We did warn them. And the contract's been 
paid out already, so what's it matter?

07:26.570 --> 07:30.190
A D and an E-Rank taking on 
a C-Rank raid by themselves?

07:30.530 --> 07:34.850
Those two greenhorns don't have 
a damn clue what they're getting into.

07:40.850 --> 07:43.270
Is Song-yi skipping today?

07:46.560 --> 07:48.160
How long's it been?

07:48.160 --> 07:53.060
About an hour. Even a normal strike team 
would take at least two hours,

07:53.060 --> 07:54.200
so we've got a whileâ€”

07:56.460 --> 07:59.420
So they ran away. They're lucky to be alive.

07:59.420 --> 08:01.750
N-No! They didn't run away!

08:03.080 --> 08:04.980
The gate's starting to close!

08:05.810 --> 08:08.680
Are you kidding me? They beat the boss?!

08:09.010 --> 08:10.620
Where's the next gate?

08:10.620 --> 08:12.640
About an hour from here.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.770
Got it. Let's hurry on.

08:15.320 --> 08:19.240
We're moving, everyone! 
The goal is to hit three locations today.

08:20.420 --> 08:24.360
That means you could potentially earn nine 
million in one day. Are you coming or not?

08:24.950 --> 08:26.510
These guys...

08:26.510 --> 08:28.730
Who the hell are they?!

08:34.940 --> 08:37.090
Boss! I'm done mining!

08:37.090 --> 08:38.290
Got it!

08:38.290 --> 08:40.210
I better wrap up here, too.

08:46.950 --> 08:48.340
I'm heading out.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.650
Huh? More work today?

08:50.650 --> 08:53.050
Yep. Don't forget to lock up.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.080
<i>He was hiding a skill like that?</i>

09:24.620 --> 09:27.550
<i>Boss has gotten stronger again...</i>

09:27.990 --> 09:29.260
<i>This Stealth skill...</i>

09:29.830 --> 09:33.470
<i>It wasn't fun to earn, but it's useful.</i>

09:34.050 --> 09:36.660
<i>Fighting while unseen is really effective.</i>

09:40.440 --> 09:42.800
<i>My Dash skill leveled up, too.</i>

09:49.280 --> 09:52.740
<i>And my new skills, Advanced Dagger Wielding 
and Fatal Strike...</i>

09:54.650 --> 09:56.450
<i>They seem pretty useful!</i>

09:58.670 --> 10:00.430
Great work!

10:00.430 --> 10:04.420
Once I'm finished grabbing this stuff, 
we'll be done, so you can take it easy.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.470
Right. Thanks.

10:07.170 --> 10:09.360
<i>I've got some handy new skills.</i>

10:09.970 --> 10:14.670
<i>But I don't have enough mana 
to use them for very long.</i>

10:15.180 --> 10:17.890
<i>I'll need to work on my 
intellect ability going forward.</i>

10:19.140 --> 10:22.930
<i>Things are moving smoothly, 
so do I head to the Demon Castle next?</i>

10:24.900 --> 10:30.470
<i>No. Right now, I'd say I'm somewhere 
between B and A-Rank.</i>

10:30.990 --> 10:33.840
<i>Would I really be able 
to take that dungeon on?</i>

10:37.320 --> 10:40.790
"The Player has reached the required level"?

10:43.460 --> 10:45.350
A job-change quest?

10:47.170 --> 10:49.660
Take a look at this, Manager Ahn!

10:50.680 --> 10:52.630
What is it, Kichul?

10:52.630 --> 10:55.760
Well, it's about the C-Rank gates...

10:55.760 --> 10:57.590
One hundred and fifty million?!

10:57.960 --> 11:03.080
Someone's spending 150 million 
on the rights to C-Rank gates?

11:03.080 --> 11:06.580
Right. There's a strike team 
that's been spending

11:06.580 --> 11:09.860
nearly double the market rate 
on C-Rank gates...

11:10.320 --> 11:15.470
And the leader is... Yoo Jinho? 
Never heard of him.

11:15.860 --> 11:18.770
He's the younger son of Yoojin 
Construction's president.

11:18.770 --> 11:20.490
Yoojin Construction?

11:20.490 --> 11:22.700
This could put them in the red over time...

11:23.200 --> 11:26.250
Seems excessive for a rich kid playing hunter.

11:28.290 --> 11:30.460
Sung Jinwoo... E-Rank?

11:30.460 --> 11:33.870
Yes, sir. Their whole lineup 
seems thrown together.

11:33.870 --> 11:35.690
I have no idea what the plan is.

11:37.930 --> 11:40.940
<i>Hang on. I remember seeing 
this "Sung Jinwoo" name</i>

11:40.940 --> 11:44.030
<i>connected to the double dungeon incident...</i>

11:44.030 --> 11:46.770
<i>There's something here. I can smell it.</i>

11:50.610 --> 11:52.820
Sorry we're late!

11:52.820 --> 11:54.720
Nah, it's fine.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.900
You're ahead of schedule, even!

11:56.900 --> 12:00.420
Collecting the mana crystals 
took longer than I thought.

12:00.710 --> 12:02.120
Okay, let's get going.

12:02.450 --> 12:05.550
You've gotta be exhausted. 
You want me to drive?

12:06.370 --> 12:09.830
I've had nothing to do all day, so I'm 
honestly kinda bored. Would that be okay?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.550
Oh, I see.

12:10.910 --> 12:12.090
What is it?

12:12.090 --> 12:16.260
But the contract says you don't need 
to worry about doing anything, so it's fine.

12:12.660 --> 12:13.800
Nothing.

12:17.210 --> 12:19.720
You think this Sung Jinwoo 
hunter has reawakened?!

12:19.720 --> 12:21.530
I sure do.

12:21.530 --> 12:23.010
Based on what?

12:23.790 --> 12:28.270
Hunter Sung has been through three 
major disasters and survived every time.

12:28.820 --> 12:31.020
First, the double dungeon.

12:31.400 --> 12:35.030
Second, the wiping out of 
Hwang Dongsuk's strike team.

12:35.310 --> 12:39.450
And third, Kang Taeshik's murder spree.

12:40.460 --> 12:45.070
Every time, there was a large body count, 
but every time, he was among the survivors.

12:45.070 --> 12:48.140
The only explanation is that he reawakened.

12:48.140 --> 12:50.620
I guess you're right...

12:52.180 --> 12:55.050
So where are you headed, Manager Ahn?

12:55.800 --> 12:57.510
Isn't it obvious?

12:58.920 --> 13:01.500
I'm off to scout a promising rookie.

13:05.410 --> 13:09.250
What is this, a picnic?

13:10.650 --> 13:11.740
Mister.

13:12.190 --> 13:15.400
This area's off-limits, y'know?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.340
Ah, you'll have to forgive us!

13:17.340 --> 13:21.110
We saw a bunch of hunters and got curious.

13:21.110 --> 13:24.870
That's a gate, right? 
Is it safe for you to be so close?

13:25.270 --> 13:28.830
Don't treat me like a child. I'm a hunter.

13:28.830 --> 13:33.040
Then are you part of this strike team?

13:34.830 --> 13:35.850
Yes.

13:36.830 --> 13:38.070
But...

13:39.170 --> 13:44.200
<i>Hunter Sung! He must've left his group 
behind to tackle the dungeon himself!</i>

13:44.200 --> 13:48.670
<i>If my gut's right about this, he could be 
a huge find! Even bigger than that!</i>

13:49.140 --> 13:52.150
I see. Well, sorry for disturbing you.

13:52.150 --> 13:54.080
You be careful, now.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.190
Wait, are we leaving already, Manager?!

13:58.150 --> 14:02.110
The captain's back! 
Everybody get ready to head out!

14:04.960 --> 14:07.050
What's the schedule looking like for tomorrow?

14:07.050 --> 14:10.080
I remembered I have something 
to do. Can I get the day off?

14:10.080 --> 14:12.040
For tomorrow?

14:12.570 --> 14:16.650
I had reserved some gates... 
You want me to cancel them?

14:16.650 --> 14:20.260
Let's not go that far. 
It seems like a waste of money.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.970
I can hold onto them for another two days.

14:24.700 --> 14:27.180
Let's delay them for now, then.

14:27.620 --> 14:28.830
You got it!

14:29.150 --> 14:32.890
Sorry about the wait, everyone! 
Off to the next one we go!

15:06.340 --> 15:09.780
The same dream... again.

15:18.970 --> 15:20.500
It's almost time.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.070
Good work today!

15:31.530 --> 15:35.250
I apologize if this is sudden. Hunter Sung...

15:35.570 --> 15:36.530
It's nice to meet you.

15:36.530 --> 15:40.710
I'm Ahn Sangmin, manager of the White 
Tiger Guild's Second Administration Team.

15:41.010 --> 15:43.620
Could I trouble you 
for a moment of your time?

15:44.990 --> 15:47.880
I'm sure you already know this,

15:47.880 --> 15:53.040
but the White Tiger Guild 
is one of the country's best.

15:53.040 --> 15:56.660
However, we're always on the lookout 
for promising new talent.

15:57.100 --> 16:00.080
And to get directly to the point,

16:00.080 --> 16:06.070
if you'll join us, I'm willing to pay you 
double what Yoojin Construction is offering.

16:06.070 --> 16:10.660
If you have any additional conditions, 
I'd be happy to arrange those, as well.

16:10.660 --> 16:12.190
<i>How about that?!</i>

16:12.190 --> 16:16.200
<i>This is too good an offer for someone 
who was E-Rank just a while ago!</i>

16:16.570 --> 16:18.820
<i>He's bound to say yes!</i>

16:19.940 --> 16:23.290
How much is the White 
Tiger Guild's HQ valued at?

16:23.570 --> 16:24.710
Huh?

16:24.710 --> 16:29.380
Well, uh, I'd say somewhere 
around fifty billion...

16:29.380 --> 16:32.470
And that's what you're offering me?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.680
I... I don't follow.

16:39.130 --> 16:41.730
Th-Thirty billion?!

16:43.240 --> 16:44.690
Did you hear that?

16:45.090 --> 16:49.900
That's the market value of the building 
that Yoojin Construction has offered me.

16:50.280 --> 16:55.540
You offered to double that, so I was thinking 
a building worth fifty billion would do.

16:55.540 --> 16:58.660
I've got the documentation here, 
if you don't believe it.

16:59.650 --> 17:01.880
I, er, I must admit,

17:01.880 --> 17:05.160
an offer like that isn't something 
I'd be qualified to make on my own...

17:05.160 --> 17:07.090
I'd need to talk to my superiorsâ€”

17:07.090 --> 17:09.700
I think we're done here, then.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.480
<i>I was too desperate.</i>

17:13.480 --> 17:17.400
<i>I should've dug into his deal 
with Yoojin Construction first!</i>

17:17.850 --> 17:22.080
I am curious, though. 
Who did you hear about me from?

17:22.640 --> 17:26.130
You haven't been snooping around, have you?

17:27.820 --> 17:29.000
H-Huh?!

17:35.490 --> 17:39.050
<i>That... That was the Stealth skill!</i>

17:39.050 --> 17:41.920
<i>A reawakened with Stealth?!</i>

17:41.920 --> 17:46.180
<i>That'd explain the size of the offer 
Yoojin Construction made!</i>

17:46.710 --> 17:50.040
I-I do apologize for looking you up 
without any word.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.760
But I meant no harmâ€”

17:52.760 --> 17:54.010
Don't turn around.

17:55.440 --> 17:59.540
The tight dungeon market has led 
to a delay in rookie training,

17:59.540 --> 18:02.480
without which they can't be sent 
on raids as per Guild policy.

18:02.480 --> 18:08.050
I was investigating who was 
buying up so many gates

18:08.050 --> 18:10.990
when I came across your name, Hunter Sung.

18:11.370 --> 18:14.910
Who else knows about me?

18:16.850 --> 18:20.110
Just me and one of my subordinates.

18:20.740 --> 18:23.850
I'd rather keep a low profile.

18:23.850 --> 18:28.780
If people start hearing about me, Mr. Ahn, 
you two will be the first people I suspect.

18:29.490 --> 18:33.590
I'm obligated to make a formal report 
to the head of my guild...

18:33.590 --> 18:38.700
but I don't want to die. I'll make sure 
my subordinate keeps his mouth shut, too.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.220
I appreciate that.

18:41.450 --> 18:45.170
I guess monopolizing the C-Rank gates 
has been causing some trouble.

18:45.170 --> 18:49.270
I'm sorry, but we'll need to continue 
doing so for a while longer.

18:49.270 --> 18:54.200
That is a shame. It puts a real 
bottleneck on our developing hunters.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.460
How about a deal, then?

18:57.020 --> 18:58.990
A d-deal?

18:59.390 --> 19:03.450
I'm willing to sell you the rights 
to three of our C-Rank gates.

19:03.450 --> 19:05.780
If you pass on this, you may 
as well consider your guild

19:05.780 --> 19:07.710
locked out of C-Ranks 
for the foreseeable future.

19:07.710 --> 19:10.450
<i>He giving me the hard sell.</i>

19:10.450 --> 19:11.550
<i>But...</i>

19:11.550 --> 19:14.180
Understood. For how much?

19:14.740 --> 19:16.500
Three hundred million apiece.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.260
Three... Three hundred million?!

19:20.850 --> 19:26.230
The mana crystals and essence stones 
are only worth 200 million on a good day!

19:26.570 --> 19:28.860
Could you at least lower the price to twoâ€”

19:28.860 --> 19:29.810
All right.

19:32.070 --> 19:33.760
Consider it a deal.

19:34.160 --> 19:38.380
Th-Then we'll be taking three off your hands...

19:38.380 --> 19:42.120
Right. Three C-Rank gates, 
for a total of 600 million.

19:43.580 --> 19:45.500
A-All right, then.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.000
Transfer the money here by the end of the day.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.250
One other thing. You can have this.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.660
Close your eyes and open your mouth, please.

19:55.220 --> 19:58.180
It's okay. I won't hurt you.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.480
<i>No way! The cut is gone!</i>

20:09.480 --> 20:10.730
Good evening.

20:13.850 --> 20:20.000
If you're willing to show me all this, 
can I take it as a sign that you trust me?

20:20.410 --> 20:24.100
As long as you keep your mouth shut, yes.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.830
M-Manager!

20:29.610 --> 20:31.810
How'd it go? The scouting.

20:31.810 --> 20:34.050
Well, Kichul...

20:34.050 --> 20:38.360
I think he might be a bigger deal 
than I had even imagined.

20:42.950 --> 20:47.980
<i>Boss, I confirmed the transfer. 
The six hundred mill is really there.</i>

20:48.390 --> 20:52.650
<i>We were about to cancel these gates... 
How'd you sell them at such a crazy price?</i>

20:53.130 --> 20:54.830
<i>And to whom?</i>

20:55.160 --> 20:56.820
Let's call it a trade secret.

20:59.760 --> 21:02.620
What do you mean there are extra 
C-Rank gates in our jurisdiction?!

21:02.620 --> 21:03.650
Just that!

21:03.650 --> 21:06.870
The three we bought were the only ones 
that Yoojin Construction had purchased!

21:07.210 --> 21:10.070
And the rest are all selling 
for 70 million or less!

21:10.070 --> 21:11.580
He tricked you!

21:11.580 --> 21:13.660
Y-Yeah...

21:13.660 --> 21:17.660
<i>Not only did I fail at scouting him, 
but he scammed me, too!</i>

21:17.660 --> 21:19.300
<i>What a nightmare!</i>

21:19.960 --> 21:22.760
<i>I guess if you're strong enough, 
you become bold enough to do anything?!</i>

21:24.260 --> 21:26.720
A message? But from who?

21:27.430 --> 21:28.950
<i>This is Sung Jinwoo.</i>

21:28.950 --> 21:32.460
<i>With this, we're even. I'll forget 
the fact that you spied on me.</i>

21:34.400 --> 21:37.360
Okay. So that's how it is.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.860
That's one in his favor.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.200
This guy sure isn't to be messed with.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.520
Was that from Hunter Sung?

21:44.520 --> 21:45.590
Yeah.

21:46.160 --> 21:51.780
He might have raked me over the coals, 
but I've got Hunter Sung's contact info.

21:52.630 --> 21:55.560
I'll be satisfied with that for now.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.010
A job-change quest, huh?

22:01.850 --> 22:03.280
Should be interesting.
