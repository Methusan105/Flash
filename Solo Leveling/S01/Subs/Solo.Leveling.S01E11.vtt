00:07.830 --> 00:10.460
This should be far enough 
away from civilization,

00:10.870 --> 00:13.130
considering I don't know 
what's about to happen.

00:14.430 --> 00:16.080
<i>A job-change quest...</i>

00:16.630 --> 00:20.540
<i>That's the quest that showed up after 
I passed level 40 from the last raid.</i>

00:21.250 --> 00:25.000
<i>I've run into two dungeons 
accessible with key items before,</i>

00:25.490 --> 00:28.670
<i>but the only quests I've been forced 
to take on immediately</i>

00:28.670 --> 00:32.090
<i>were the penalty and emergency ones.</i>

00:33.240 --> 00:39.390
<i>This one, however, seems to be optional, 
and I've been given time to decide.</i>

00:39.390 --> 00:42.350
<i>Should I assume that means it's going 
to be that much more difficult?</i>

00:42.930 --> 00:47.650
<i>The logical assumption is that this is an 
important event that'll make me stronger</i>

00:49.740 --> 00:51.980
<i>by earning skills best suited to my job...</i>

00:54.740 --> 00:55.890
Yes.

01:08.270 --> 01:11.210
Oh, shoot, my daily quest...

01:11.910 --> 01:14.100
I guess I can do it when I get back.

01:14.670 --> 01:20.030
All right. Looks like 
the real game starts here.

01:20.030 --> 01:23.060
I wonder what's waiting for me inside?

01:24.020 --> 01:25.440
Should be interesting.

03:18.180 --> 03:19.830
I apologize for the delay.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.840
No, you're right on time, Jinsung.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.870
It's been a while, Jinho.

03:26.270 --> 03:27.440
Brother...

03:31.870 --> 03:34.150
The dungeon seems surprisingly normal so far.

03:37.820 --> 03:40.570
I can't use potions or full recovery?

03:41.010 --> 03:44.010
Or leave until the quest is finished.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.540
I'm gonna need to be pretty careful, then.

03:57.790 --> 03:59.690
An armor-type beast?

04:17.310 --> 04:18.500
<i>That didn't work?</i>

04:34.090 --> 04:35.200
No good.

04:38.510 --> 04:40.130
I've fought enemies...

04:46.970 --> 04:48.480
with hard exteriors before!

04:58.260 --> 05:00.670
I wasted a use of Fatal Strike...

05:01.250 --> 05:03.870
and when I can't recover mana 
or heal damage, too.

05:05.150 --> 05:06.070
But...

05:06.870 --> 05:10.970
It's not like they care, of course.

05:14.670 --> 05:16.300
What is it, Jinho?

05:16.300 --> 05:18.800
You've barely touched your food.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.560
Oh, nothing...

05:21.520 --> 05:25.070
Jinsung, how are things going 
with establishing the guild?

05:25.070 --> 05:30.110
I've heard the S-Ranks you've been 
making offers to have all declined.

05:30.540 --> 05:34.930
It's true that Hunters Min Byung-gu 
and Cha Hae-in turned me down,

05:34.930 --> 05:36.230
but it won't be an issue.

05:36.970 --> 05:41.760
I've got negotiations underway with 
European and Middle Eastern hunters.

05:42.890 --> 05:45.540
They're likely to sign 
if we agree to their terms.

05:45.540 --> 05:47.890
It'll be similar to the case 
of Hunter Hwang Dongsoo.

05:47.890 --> 05:48.910
You've got a point.

05:49.490 --> 05:52.010
<i>Hunters from overseas. Of course...</i>

05:54.530 --> 05:55.620
Jinho.

05:57.140 --> 06:00.500
I know you've been working on 
something of your own in secret.

06:01.010 --> 06:03.630
Buying up the rights to all these 
C-Rank raids at a high price,

06:03.630 --> 06:06.140
trying to establish your credentials.

06:06.450 --> 06:09.100
And that's fine, for a personal project, but...

06:10.610 --> 06:12.310
Don't even think about getting in my way.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.480
<i>He doesn't know about the boss.</i>

06:19.990 --> 06:23.080
<i>If he had any idea of the kind of power 
I have on my side...!</i>

06:31.560 --> 06:34.280
I guess even I get tired 
after this much combat.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.380
Better catch my breathâ€”

06:38.750 --> 06:39.860
The Stealth skill?!

06:40.930 --> 06:43.090
I've gotta deal with beasts 
that can use that, too?!

06:46.550 --> 06:48.560
On top of that, there's a mage...

06:48.560 --> 06:50.560
and one that uses light magic, at that.

06:51.010 --> 06:54.180
The stealth skill and light magic... 
What is going on here?

06:54.660 --> 06:59.310
That armor reminded me of the Kasaka, too. 
It's like I'm revisiting my past battles.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.780
This quest is even tougher than I imagined!

07:06.590 --> 07:09.920
<i>The different kinds of beast 
all have different weaknesses.</i>

07:10.520 --> 07:14.740
<i>Knights require strength, assassins take 
perception, archers need agility...</i>

07:16.050 --> 07:19.070
<i>Without enough strength, 
the knights won't take damage.</i>

07:21.800 --> 07:25.140
<i>Without enough perception, 
the assassins can't be detected.</i>

07:26.190 --> 07:29.200
<i>And the real issue is the mages.</i>

07:29.570 --> 07:34.600
<i>They probably need intellect as a counter, 
but I haven't really invested in that stat.</i>

07:34.920 --> 07:36.480
<i>Which means I don't have much mana.</i>

07:36.480 --> 07:38.980
<i>I need to conserve my skills...</i>

07:42.450 --> 07:44.360
<i>but my fatigue is starting to build up.</i>

07:44.820 --> 07:46.510
<i>I need to end this soon!</i>

07:58.870 --> 08:02.090
I see you're all here.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.450
The time has finally come.

08:14.980 --> 08:19.390
I'm just glad the beasts 
drop stuff like this, too.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.690
A High-Rank Knight's Chestplate?

08:25.110 --> 08:27.990
Come to think of it, I haven't really 
experimented with gear much.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.760
It can turn invisible?!

08:35.760 --> 08:37.930
I'm glad I don't have to stand out.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.000
Looks like it doesn't restrict 
my movement, either.

08:42.960 --> 08:47.560
It's kind of hard to tell without being 
fully restored, but my level has gone up.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.560
I've got plenty of gold and items, too.

08:50.920 --> 08:56.740
With my fatigue recovered, 
I may as well move onto the next stage.

09:04.660 --> 09:05.730
Now, then...

09:06.310 --> 09:10.430
How bad is it gonna be 
on the other side of this door?

09:14.740 --> 09:18.700
<i>But if I can't get out of here without 
getting through, I just have to press on.</i>

09:25.960 --> 09:28.180
<i>Something about that gust 
just gave me the chills...</i>

09:46.500 --> 09:48.240
Some kind of throne room?

09:56.060 --> 09:59.500
<i>This sight, these sounds, the way it feels...</i>

09:59.960 --> 10:01.710
<i>My entire body remembers.</i>

10:02.460 --> 10:06.360
<i>This is pressure on the level of what 
I felt during the double dungeon!</i>

10:12.210 --> 10:16.180
<i>And all of that intensity 
is coming from this guy!</i>

10:17.680 --> 10:20.230
<i>"Knight Commander Igris the Bloodred."</i>

10:21.000 --> 10:22.750
<i>Name's red, too...</i>

10:23.580 --> 10:26.860
<i>He really is nothing like 
the enemies I've fought so far!</i>

10:28.220 --> 10:30.810
<i>A knight who defends an empty throne...</i>

10:37.530 --> 10:38.240
<i>Here he comes!</i>

10:47.270 --> 10:50.800
<i>He chops through pillars 
like they're dry branches!</i>

10:59.180 --> 11:01.140
<i>This is beyond just strong!</i>

11:12.320 --> 11:15.060
<i>To be able to move this quickly, 
in that heavy armor...</i>

11:15.730 --> 11:17.110
<i>What a monster!</i>

11:28.670 --> 11:30.200
<i>Still no good!</i>

11:43.570 --> 11:45.350
<i>We're equals in terms of speed.</i>

11:45.780 --> 11:47.700
<i>But he's much more powerful.</i>

11:49.060 --> 11:51.550
<i>And because of that armor, 
my dagger isn't doing anything.</i>

11:52.030 --> 11:54.830
<i>Do I have any way of beating this guy?</i>

11:56.150 --> 11:58.570
<i>He's even more dangerous than I thought.</i>

11:59.110 --> 12:00.200
<i>Still...</i>

12:01.270 --> 12:03.660
I doubt I can win without a weapon,

12:04.520 --> 12:09.000
but this is the only way I can think of 
to deal any damage through that armor!

12:16.790 --> 12:18.510
I guess you're being chivalrous, huh?

12:19.730 --> 12:21.740
You must think this is gonna be easy.

12:26.390 --> 12:27.560
Come in.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.150
Chairman, you still haven't gone home?

12:31.470 --> 12:33.800
I don't feel like calling it a day just yet.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.850
So I've been dealing with 
a bit of work that's piled up.

12:36.850 --> 12:38.580
Likewise.

12:38.580 --> 12:41.620
I've been clearing some 
non-urgent items off my plate.

12:43.470 --> 12:45.110
So it's finally happening.

12:45.110 --> 12:46.080
Indeed.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.360
Speak of the devil.

12:49.890 --> 12:52.530
I'm here. Are you heading out soon?

12:52.530 --> 12:53.290
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

12:53.290 --> 12:55.520
I wanted to thank you before that.

12:55.520 --> 13:00.010
I'm grateful you approved this operation.

13:00.010 --> 13:01.760
<i>No thanks necessary.</i>

13:02.160 --> 13:05.550
It's all because you've kept Jeju Island's 
name afloat in the interviews

13:05.550 --> 13:09.190
you've been doing on TV and in print.

13:09.190 --> 13:14.280
That's kept it in the public's consciousness 
and is swaying their opinion.

13:14.890 --> 13:18.740
All I did was help tip the scales a bit.

13:19.130 --> 13:22.370
<i>You don't expect criticism 
for kicking a hornet's nest?</i>

13:22.370 --> 13:24.450
I'm prepared to take the brunt of that.

13:24.810 --> 13:26.430
Just be careful out there.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.780
Jeju Island is dangerous business.

13:28.780 --> 13:30.790
<i>I'm fully aware, sir.</i>

13:31.180 --> 13:33.760
This expedition is about 
assessing threat levels.

13:33.760 --> 13:38.200
We'll prod the enemy and see how 
and to what degree they respond.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.010
<i>As diligent as ever, I see.</i>

13:41.010 --> 13:43.410
The third raid on Jeju Island...

13:43.970 --> 13:46.440
To me, that battle...

13:47.720 --> 13:50.180
never really ended.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.150
<i>So fast!</i>

14:23.870 --> 14:27.880
<i>Even though I blocked, 
it felt like that took down 500 HP!</i>

14:28.630 --> 14:31.100
<i>I made the right move putting armor on.</i>

14:32.060 --> 14:35.170
<i>There's a chance taking it 
full on would've killed me.</i>

14:36.050 --> 14:38.680
<i>For him to deal this kind of damage 
even without his sword...</i>

14:38.680 --> 14:40.260
<i>He's too damn strong!</i>

14:43.450 --> 14:47.860
<i>If I can't compete in terms of power, 
then I'll boost my speed!</i>

15:04.840 --> 15:06.010
<i>I can't catch him!</i>

15:12.950 --> 15:15.100
<i>That passive skill boosted my defense!</i>

16:32.630 --> 16:34.030
That oughta do.

17:28.150 --> 17:29.560
I...

17:30.960 --> 17:32.290
haven't...

17:32.780 --> 17:36.080
lost yet!

17:57.260 --> 17:59.670
<i>That dagger can't change owners like that!</i>

17:59.670 --> 18:01.420
<i>It'll go back into my inventory,</i>

18:01.420 --> 18:02.440
<i>and then back into my hand!</i>

18:06.020 --> 18:07.030
<i>Too shallow!</i>

18:07.030 --> 18:08.230
<i>Have to stab deeper!</i>

18:37.650 --> 18:40.350
I won... right?

18:45.030 --> 18:47.440
That... was a close one.

18:49.900 --> 18:52.360
<i>My winning was pretty much a fluke.</i>

18:52.360 --> 18:55.880
<i>In terms of skills, ability, and experience...</i>

18:55.880 --> 18:58.820
<i>There was a real difference 
between us on every level.</i>

18:59.440 --> 19:01.540
One screwup, and I'd probably be dead.

19:02.990 --> 19:04.790
Four rewards, huh?

19:05.250 --> 19:08.140
A pouch with 1,500,000 gold in it.

19:08.450 --> 19:13.560
The same helmet that Igris had... 
and it's an S-Rank item!

19:14.050 --> 19:16.320
The key to the Demon's Castle 
was S-Rank, too,

19:16.320 --> 19:19.720
but I've never had gear 
of that quality before.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.930
It reduces physical damage by 15%,

19:22.930 --> 19:25.760
along with a 20-point boost 
to strength and vitality!

19:25.760 --> 19:26.940
That's tasty!

19:27.650 --> 19:30.400
Along with a rune stone 
for the Ruler's Hand...

19:30.840 --> 19:35.110
What kind of skill is that? 
I guess I'll figure it out later.

19:36.530 --> 19:37.740
But what about...

19:38.380 --> 19:39.950
this "instant teleportation stone"?

19:40.690 --> 19:42.920
It won't go into the inventory.

19:43.300 --> 19:46.180
Why give me a teleportation stone now?

19:48.070 --> 19:51.400
Is... Is the job-change quest...

19:52.240 --> 19:54.470
not over yet?

20:02.010 --> 20:05.080
"Survive as long as possible"? 
"Advancement points"?

20:05.080 --> 20:06.860
And what is a "higher class"?

20:09.560 --> 20:11.700
"Good luck," huh?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.940
Wait, am I facing infinite 
waves of enemies?!

20:19.870 --> 20:24.580
<i>If they were as strong as Igris, 
I would've been overwhelmed in seconds...</i>

20:25.090 --> 20:28.480
<i>But these guys? 
I can handle them easily enough.</i>

20:28.850 --> 20:31.740
<i>Still... There's an awful lot of them!</i>

20:47.450 --> 20:52.310
<i>Damn it! I keep fighting, but the gates 
keep puking up more!</i>

20:54.270 --> 20:56.780
<i>I think the key to this quest 
is how long you can last.</i>

20:57.150 --> 20:58.030
<i>In that case...</i>

21:00.590 --> 21:05.570
<i>Stealth costs 200 mana to activate, 
and then one for each second of use...</i>

21:07.010 --> 21:08.370
<i>I have 190 left.</i>

21:09.140 --> 21:11.460
<i>I'll buy as much time as I can!</i>

21:15.870 --> 21:17.510
<i>They saw through Stealth?!</i>

21:26.950 --> 21:28.830
<i>This is worse than I thought!</i>

21:28.830 --> 21:31.440
<i>I won't be able to use Stealth 
or Murderous Intent anymore!</i>

21:37.860 --> 21:39.050
<i>How long has it been?</i>

21:40.090 --> 21:41.490
<i>Only five minutes?!</i>

21:41.960 --> 21:43.340
<i>I can't keep going!</i>

21:43.340 --> 21:46.030
<i>I hate to do it, but I'd better use 
that teleportation stone...</i>
