WEBVTT

01:32.990 --> 01:34.870
Excuse me, Manager Woo.

01:35.530 --> 01:36.840
What is it?

01:36.840 --> 01:38.470
If you could take a look at this...

01:38.470 --> 01:43.000
It's about the raid on the C-Rank dungeon 
where six hunters were killed in action.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.750
The only survivors were a D and E-Rank.

01:45.750 --> 01:48.860
They probably fled the dungeon. 
Happens all the time.

01:48.860 --> 01:53.070
That's just it. Not only did they not flee, 
they defeated the boss before exiting.

01:53.910 --> 01:58.030
The D-Rank hunter, Yoo Jinho, 
seems to have had very expensive equipment,

01:58.030 --> 01:59.430
which could probably explain—

01:59.430 --> 02:03.390
I'm not seeing the issue. You should be able 
to find out the details easily enough.

02:03.390 --> 02:07.170
Well, the other thing is that the other hunter

02:07.170 --> 02:12.200
was the survivor from the recent double dungeon incident... Sung Jinwoo.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.240
Sung Jinwoo?

02:18.270 --> 02:22.790
Not only that, but one of the six 
deceased was Hwang Dongsuk.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.250
The infamous Hwang Dongsoo's older brother...

02:28.300 --> 02:30.520
I can see why you brought this to me.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.170
I'm home.

02:33.170 --> 02:34.780
Welcome back.

02:35.260 --> 02:36.990
Whoa, you brought gifts?!

02:36.990 --> 02:39.640
Fried chicken! Did you have 
a good day or something?

02:40.040 --> 02:43.280
I'm not sure about that just yet.

02:43.920 --> 02:47.090
But I'll be able to cover Mom's hospital bills 
and our expenses for a while.

02:47.630 --> 02:50.650
And you're normally such a cheapskate.

02:52.110 --> 02:53.240
Come to think of it,

02:54.530 --> 02:56.970
how did that thing the other day go?

02:57.930 --> 03:00.490
The raid, I mean. 
You got a big payday, right?

03:00.490 --> 03:02.910
But you weren't hurt too badly,

03:02.910 --> 03:05.550
so I was wondering 
if your party was really strong.

03:08.670 --> 03:11.260
Well... yeah.

03:11.260 --> 03:14.290
Must've been easy to beat the bad guys, then.

03:15.040 --> 03:19.090
<i>It really was easy. 
Putting aside the gap in strength...</i>

03:20.330 --> 03:24.090
<i>When the time came, I didn't hesitate at all.</i>

03:24.670 --> 03:28.650
<i>If anything, I resented them for thinking
they had a chance against me.</i>

03:29.700 --> 03:32.860
<i>The old me would've definitely 
looked for a way to escape.</i>

03:33.630 --> 03:36.070
<i>Has leveling up made me more bold?</i>

03:36.990 --> 03:40.510
<i>But those weren't magic beasts. 
They were human beings.</i>

03:41.590 --> 03:43.040
Jinwoo?

03:43.360 --> 03:45.480
Everything okay? You feeling all right?

03:46.060 --> 03:49.380
I thought I might've forgotten 
to get the change, but I was wrong.

03:49.380 --> 03:53.180
And you scared me for that?

03:57.880 --> 03:59.410
<i>It doesn't matter right now.</i>

03:59.410 --> 04:03.650
<i>My priorities are getting stronger 
for my family and staying alive.</i>

04:04.030 --> 04:06.500
<i>If I get put in the same situation, 
I'll do it again.</i>

04:08.670 --> 04:11.200
<i>What's this? "Harmful substance"?</i>

04:13.990 --> 04:15.190
<i>Detoxing?</i>

04:19.170 --> 04:20.270
I'm done eating.

04:22.050 --> 04:24.500
What, already? I'm gonna eat the rest, then.

04:24.500 --> 04:27.120
Just don't complain 
if you put on weight again.

04:38.050 --> 04:39.880
I'm not getting drunk at all.

04:40.580 --> 04:44.260
<i>A special ability from the system 
must be breaking the alcohol down.</i>

04:44.260 --> 04:46.110
<i>Is it some kind of status effect?</i>

04:48.330 --> 04:52.070
A blessing? Health and longevity...

04:52.810 --> 04:57.260
Disables toxic and abnormal conditions, 
and improves regeneration...

04:58.070 --> 05:01.870
That must be it. My reward 
for the double dungeon.

05:01.870 --> 05:04.660
So much happened that I never checked it.

05:05.440 --> 05:08.700
That explains why my missing limbs came back.

05:09.590 --> 05:12.170
There's so much I still don't know...

05:17.490 --> 05:20.880
Jinwoo, you've got a call 
from someone named Yoo Jinho.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.150
I'll be right there.

05:26.240 --> 05:29.020
You're drinking too much! 
That stuff's poison, you know.

05:29.020 --> 05:30.860
I'll be fine.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.270
Don't expect me to take care of you 
when I'm a doctor!

05:37.070 --> 05:39.690
Sorry to call you out of the blue like this.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.800
I didn't think we'd meet again.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.660
I'm glad, though! I owe you my life, boss.

05:45.660 --> 05:49.510
Well, giving me your share of the 
essence stones helped me out, too.

05:50.530 --> 05:53.960
Plus, you haven't told anyone 
about what happened.

05:55.160 --> 05:58.930
W-Well, you only did that because 
they tried to kill us, right?

05:59.280 --> 06:00.970
It was self-defense.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.880
So, what did you want?

06:05.510 --> 06:08.560
Boss, I'm thinking of putting 
together a strike team—

06:07.470 --> 06:08.560
No.

06:08.560 --> 06:12.060
Huh? I-If you could at least hear me out...

06:12.520 --> 06:15.520
I don't have time to spend 
humoring some trust fund kid.

06:15.990 --> 06:17.060
Just twenty—

06:17.060 --> 06:20.160
no, just nineteen raids!

06:20.160 --> 06:23.530
Nineteen raids? Are you trying 
to become a guild master?

06:24.010 --> 06:26.740
Just hear me out! Please!

06:32.160 --> 06:33.730
Go on.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.630
Right!

06:38.130 --> 06:42.550
As you've guessed, I'm trying 
to become licensed as a guild master.

06:42.550 --> 06:47.430
In order to do that, I need at least 
twenty raids' worth of experience.

06:47.430 --> 06:49.530
The other day was my first.

06:50.460 --> 06:52.840
I've done all the studying I need 
to inherit my family's company,

06:52.840 --> 06:55.080
so I'm confident the written test 
won't pose a problem.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.490
But... in terms of practical experience...

06:58.980 --> 07:01.610
You're the second son of the 
Yoojin Construction owner, right?

07:02.370 --> 07:05.200
I want to be a guild master 
for the sake of our company.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.570
My father's actually trying to put 
together a guild, you see.

07:08.570 --> 07:10.830
Yoojin Construction wants a guild?

07:10.830 --> 07:12.040
Right.

07:13.850 --> 07:18.500
<i>As dangerous as dungeons are, 
the treasures within them justify the risk.</i>

07:19.010 --> 07:22.450
<i>Essence stones and mana crystals 
are only the tip of the iceberg.</i>

07:22.450 --> 07:25.720
<i>The carcasses of higher-ranked 
magic beasts have a variety of uses—</i>

07:26.660 --> 07:30.220
<i>it's no exaggeration to say that everything 
inside a dungeon has monetary value.</i>

07:30.630 --> 07:33.550
If the idea is to have hunters 
in your employ clear dungeons

07:33.550 --> 07:34.900
so that the company benefits...

07:34.900 --> 07:36.730
That'd be a pretty effective business model.

07:37.020 --> 07:38.600
You hit the nail on the head.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.310
My father wants an S-Rank hunter 
to be the guild master,

07:41.310 --> 07:43.330
and my brother as second-in-command.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.280
He intends to run the guild like a business.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.400
An S-Rank? But there are only 
seven of them in the country.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.320
Right.

07:49.910 --> 07:54.910
Plus, the only one not already affiliated 
with a guild, Min Byung-gyu, has retired.

07:55.260 --> 07:57.620
Does he mean to poach one from another guild?

07:59.830 --> 08:01.870
That's a bad idea.

08:01.870 --> 08:04.560
You'd be making an enemy of 
whoever you end up poaching from.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.360
My brother hasn't awakened, 
so he can't be guild master...

08:08.360 --> 08:11.390
Which is why you want to get enough 
experience to get the job...

08:11.390 --> 08:13.210
and show up your brother?

08:13.550 --> 08:16.930
Boss, you're going to need help 
if you want to keep doing raids

08:16.930 --> 08:18.390
while hiding your power, right?!

08:18.750 --> 08:23.700
And my father would be more convinced 
if I succeeded alongside an E-Rank hunter

08:23.700 --> 08:25.360
instead of with someone highly ranked, too!

08:27.290 --> 08:31.280
<i>Boss is as strong as a B-Rank—
no, even stronger.</i>

08:31.280 --> 08:35.290
<i>Picking the wrong person for this 
would be dangerous, but if it's him—</i>

08:39.630 --> 08:40.670
Here.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.650
It's the building we'd planned to use 
as the guild's headquarters.

08:44.650 --> 08:47.010
The current market value is thirty billion.

08:48.510 --> 08:51.220
That's what I'm offering you in exchange 
for nineteen successful raids.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.950
<i>Nineteen C-Rank raids in exchange 
for thirty billion...</i>

08:54.950 --> 08:57.570
<i>There was a time when I would've 
jumped on an offer like that.</i>

08:57.570 --> 09:02.530
<i>But now that I'm the sole person 
who can level up, it changes things.</i>

09:03.110 --> 09:07.340
<i>If I keep growing, one day I'll reach S-Rank—</i>

09:07.340 --> 09:10.610
<i>no, I could even aim higher.</i>

09:11.110 --> 09:14.860
<i>Considering that, thirty billion 
would be chump change.</i>

09:14.860 --> 09:18.400
<i>Especially given the risk involved 
in working with someone else</i>

09:18.400 --> 09:23.290
<i>when I'm still not sure how 
leveling up might affect me.</i>

09:23.810 --> 09:25.000
I'm sorry.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.440
Wait a sec!

09:31.470 --> 09:35.470
If you work with me on this... 
I'll take your secret to the grave!

09:49.750 --> 09:54.910
I want details on the two survivors. 
Get me their info, quickly.

09:57.470 --> 09:58.870
Pardon me.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.960
I have the documents, Mr. Hwang.

10:04.990 --> 10:07.150
My big brother was murdered.

10:09.770 --> 10:11.400
Do you have evidence that—

10:11.400 --> 10:12.420
You got the intel?

10:13.820 --> 10:15.430
Right here, sir.

10:16.420 --> 10:20.300
Laura. What happens 
if I kill someone abroad?

10:20.930 --> 10:22.140
Are you being serious?

10:27.890 --> 10:32.320
If it's a country with an extradition 
treaty for hunter crimes,

10:32.320 --> 10:34.320
you'd face trial there.

10:34.740 --> 10:39.410
But if that's not the case, 
you'd be sent home for prosecution.

10:40.310 --> 10:41.670
And in that case...

10:41.670 --> 10:45.120
You may be able to negotiate 
for a reduced sentence.

10:46.570 --> 10:48.870
We're switching up my schedule.

10:48.870 --> 10:52.690
Sudden changes will 
disrupt guild business, sir.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.930
How long am I booked out?

10:54.930 --> 10:56.680
For the immediate future.

10:57.570 --> 11:00.130
Then it can wait. But pencil it in for after.

11:00.130 --> 11:03.520
Very good, sir. I'll add it to the schedule.

11:04.380 --> 11:09.770
Yoo Jinho, D-Rank hunter, 
and Sung Jinwoo, E-Rank...

11:12.920 --> 11:16.650
I'll just have to hope you survive 
until I've got time for you.

11:21.530 --> 11:24.370
Never saw you exercise much before.

11:24.370 --> 11:28.140
Well, doing nothing but studying 
can't be healthy, right?

11:28.950 --> 11:30.460
You sure it's not all the chicken?

11:38.240 --> 11:41.420
Hey, if we had thirty billion, 
what would you wanna do?

11:41.740 --> 11:43.140
Where's this coming from?

11:43.140 --> 11:44.520
Hypothetically speaking.

11:45.330 --> 11:49.110
Well, I'd put some aside for Mom's 
hospital bills, and for college tuition.

11:49.110 --> 11:50.120
Then what?

11:51.880 --> 11:55.610
Save it, I guess? I dunno! 
It doesn't seem realistic.

11:57.110 --> 11:58.280
I agree.

11:59.150 --> 12:00.920
Don't try and keep up with me, okay?

12:00.920 --> 12:03.200
Hey! Jinwoo!

12:07.100 --> 12:09.370
E-Rank or not, I guess he's still a hunter.

12:13.880 --> 12:14.890
Yes—

12:15.960 --> 12:17.510
Wait, no.

12:18.590 --> 12:19.900
Eleven kilometers?

12:20.710 --> 12:23.760
I wonder why it's still counting after I hit the goal.

12:28.900 --> 12:32.760
I see. I should test how high it goes.

12:36.790 --> 12:40.610
Jinwoo... I finally... caught up to you...

12:41.350 --> 12:43.100
I'm gonna run a bit more.

12:50.350 --> 12:53.790
It cuts off at double the goal. 
Better check the others...

13:01.460 --> 13:05.360
The daily quest became a secret quest?

13:06.010 --> 13:06.870
Yes.

13:08.130 --> 13:11.390
A choice of random loot boxes?

13:11.390 --> 13:14.730
Well, I'll wanna do the 
blessed random loot box first.

13:29.260 --> 13:30.760
Another key?

13:33.030 --> 13:36.880
The Demon's Castle... 
Acquisition difficulty S?!

13:45.450 --> 13:47.970
It can cure all illnesses 
with powerful magic...

13:48.830 --> 13:50.460
The Elixir or Life!

13:58.860 --> 14:04.260
<i>If this Elixir of Life can 
really cure any illness,</i>

14:06.150 --> 14:07.480
<i>then there's only one choice.</i>

14:16.310 --> 14:19.700
<i>If the acquisition difficulty 
matches the level of the dungeon...</i>

14:19.700 --> 14:21.550
<i>This will lead to an S-Rank dungeon.</i>

14:22.220 --> 14:26.470
<i>And if that's the case, there's going to 
be something on the level of Jeju Island,</i>

14:26.470 --> 14:29.470
<i>where those S-Rank hunters failed, 
waiting for me.</i>

14:38.520 --> 14:44.090
<i>Do I even have a chance 
against threats of that level?</i>

14:49.990 --> 14:51.830
<i>I'd be lying if I said I wasn't afraid.</i>

14:53.060 --> 14:54.750
<i>But if it gets too dangerous,</i>

14:54.750 --> 14:58.460
<i>I can use the teleportation stone 
I saved from the instance dungeon.</i>

15:05.880 --> 15:07.870
<i>If I give up, then it's over.</i>

15:08.350 --> 15:13.360
<i>I have to get stronger, level up more, 
and take it all back.</i>

15:15.140 --> 15:17.810
I am not going to die here!

15:39.740 --> 15:41.480
Hardly any damage!

15:41.480 --> 15:44.090
And that's with the bonus 
effects from my title!

15:50.900 --> 15:51.930
No good!

16:23.710 --> 16:25.150
<i>A warning?</i>

16:25.150 --> 16:27.510
<i>I lost a third of my life in an instant!</i>

16:35.040 --> 16:36.270
Its abilities are gonna be doubled?!

16:40.690 --> 16:42.020
<i>Too fast—</i>

16:46.220 --> 16:47.540
<i>I'm below half already!</i>

16:49.240 --> 16:52.030
I've got no choice. Total recovery!

16:57.080 --> 16:58.540
That worked!

17:42.870 --> 17:44.830
<i>I keep getting warnings.</i>

17:45.270 --> 17:49.080
<i>It's definitely trying to alert me 
about the danger so I don't die.</i>

17:49.530 --> 17:51.340
<i>Because I'm the Player...</i>

17:51.930 --> 17:56.010
<i>The more I think about it, 
this can't be a normal re-awakening!</i>

17:56.870 --> 18:00.230
If I could outlast its Rage status 
for three minutes...

18:00.650 --> 18:02.550
No. I can't. It's too dangerous!

18:04.470 --> 18:05.270
I have to use—

18:20.220 --> 18:22.630
How am I supposed to survive this?!

18:23.890 --> 18:26.380
<i>A few more hits and I'm done for.</i>

18:26.740 --> 18:28.230
<i>There has to be a way...</i>

18:29.340 --> 18:32.160
<i>The store? I'd forgotten about it!</i>

18:34.300 --> 18:36.250
<i>Three hundred a piece?</i>

18:36.250 --> 18:37.890
I'll take three.

18:43.530 --> 18:45.650
One potion only heals for a hundred...

18:46.020 --> 18:47.520
That won't be enough.

18:49.530 --> 18:50.690
<i>Poison...?</i>

18:51.350 --> 18:53.980
You're drinking too much! 
That stuff's poison, you know.

18:53.980 --> 18:55.490
I'll be fine.

18:57.310 --> 18:58.700
<i>I have to try it.</i>

19:16.380 --> 19:17.720
Okay.

19:28.190 --> 19:29.520
<i>I can still...</i>

19:30.980 --> 19:32.620
<i>move!</i>

19:37.240 --> 19:38.870
<i>The effect of its skill has worn off!</i>

21:28.330 --> 21:29.770
<i>I got an item?</i>

21:30.540 --> 21:31.980
<i>Another key?</i>

21:32.450 --> 21:36.280
Is this for the gate that 
Cerberus was protecting?

21:37.200 --> 21:38.150
What now...?

21:43.750 --> 21:46.460
A formula... for the Elixir of Life?

21:50.830 --> 21:53.790
<i>This helped me gauge how strong I am.</i>

21:53.790 --> 21:58.670
<i>If I go into that castle right now, 
I'll definitely die. But...</i>

21:59.150 --> 22:01.300
I'll be back soon.

22:02.130 --> 22:03.440
Count on it!

22:05.350 --> 22:05.800
