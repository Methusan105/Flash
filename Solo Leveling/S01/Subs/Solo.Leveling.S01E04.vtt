00:19.670 --> 00:21.760
<i>My body feels so light!</i>

00:26.610 --> 00:28.880
<i>Just when I thought I had survived!</i>

00:28.880 --> 00:30.840
<i>How long am I going to let 
myself be intimidated?!</i>

00:32.130 --> 00:33.930
I'm not dying!

00:38.390 --> 00:41.730
<i>Did increasing my strength ability 
make that much of a difference?</i>

00:43.920 --> 00:46.360
<i>But this thing's still stronger than me.</i>

00:50.340 --> 00:51.840
<i>No! My attacks aren't working!</i>

00:59.590 --> 01:01.500
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

02:41.890 --> 02:43.730
<i>I can't do this on my own.</i>

02:47.340 --> 02:49.120
<i>With no party, no healer...</i>

02:49.620 --> 02:51.330
<i>My bag's only got water and food in it.</i>

02:53.270 --> 02:54.540
<i>At this rate...</i>

02:56.140 --> 02:58.280
<i>If only I had a weapon with magic power!</i>

02:58.640 --> 02:59.530
<i>A weapon?</i>

02:59.840 --> 03:00.970
Inventory!

03:16.720 --> 03:19.180
<i>I don't know how this got in there.</i>

03:21.160 --> 03:24.230
<i>I think Kim said he paid three million for it?</i>

03:25.120 --> 03:26.940
<i>The kind of item I could never afford.</i>

03:27.730 --> 03:30.560
Well, this is an emergency. 
I'll put it to good use.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.280
Huh? The pain's fading.

03:35.970 --> 03:37.370
Now that I have a weapon...

03:38.390 --> 03:39.710
I'm not afraid!

03:42.810 --> 03:44.870
Huh? It's stuck!

03:47.080 --> 03:48.920
Come on! Get out of there!

03:58.390 --> 04:00.740
They don't call them steel-fanged 
for nothing, huh?

04:01.800 --> 04:03.780
I just got this sword!

04:04.980 --> 04:07.160
Chew on something else!

04:12.730 --> 04:14.150
I've gotta admit...

04:15.170 --> 04:16.710
Compared to what I ran into before,

04:17.810 --> 04:19.170
these guys aren't so bad.

04:36.020 --> 04:38.950
Huh? I'm level 2 now?

04:38.950 --> 04:41.510
That never changed during my daily quests.

04:42.420 --> 04:44.900
Oh, I know. It's because this is real combat.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.950
And my injuries healing from before...

04:47.390 --> 04:51.430
I guess all my stats go up 
by one when I level up.

04:52.060 --> 04:53.880
That's five points in total.

04:53.880 --> 04:58.750
Daily quests only net me three points, 
so fighting seems more efficient.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.150
I wonder how much a difference 
of one point makes?

05:03.150 --> 05:05.850
There are values for intelligence, 
perception, and such, too...

05:06.730 --> 05:08.800
But strength is the obvious one.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.880
I'm only at 32 there, but my body 
already feels a lot lighter.

05:13.740 --> 05:17.900
I'm speculating here, but I think that 
the higher my base abilities grow,

05:17.900 --> 05:20.590
the more points I'll gain.

05:22.260 --> 05:25.460
I really can get stronger.

05:28.300 --> 05:32.680
Maybe I'm overreacting, considering 
that it was just five small beasts...

05:34.640 --> 05:37.980
I wonder if they have any essence stones.

05:40.610 --> 05:43.690
I get items instead?

05:44.570 --> 05:46.980
<i>These weird things happening to me...</i>

05:47.550 --> 05:50.670
<i>If they follow the same kind 
of logic that a game does,</i>

05:51.080 --> 05:55.520
<i>then this dungeon and the magic beasts in it 
are different from what's inside the gates.</i>

05:57.440 --> 05:58.940
There's a store?

05:59.350 --> 06:00.340
Buy.

06:01.370 --> 06:04.020
I guess beginners get locked out?

06:04.680 --> 06:05.720
Sell.

06:10.380 --> 06:11.970
Twenty gold?

06:12.920 --> 06:15.590
I wonder how much money that's worth.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.300
Then again, this seems like 
an E-Rank dungeon,

06:19.300 --> 06:22.080
so twenty gold can't be worth that much.

06:23.210 --> 06:25.910
Okay, so what do I do now?

06:26.650 --> 06:29.190
I can't leave until I beat the boss.

06:29.510 --> 06:34.480
A teleportation stone will let me get out, 
but I don't know where to find those.

06:34.870 --> 06:37.240
If I stay too long, I'll run out of food.

06:41.330 --> 06:45.250
E-Rank or not, I don't think 
I can beat a boss on my own.

06:45.870 --> 06:49.220
Wait... Maybe if I level up enough first?

06:51.820 --> 06:55.170
Granted, I might die before I manage that.

07:08.180 --> 07:12.780
I shouldn't be afraid. 
I already know what dying is like!

07:29.510 --> 07:34.890
I'm not gonna go down easy. 
And I don't expect you guys to, either.

07:37.350 --> 07:41.350
I'd feel guilty if I killed you too fast!

07:43.020 --> 07:45.330
You qualify to become a hunter.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.110
Now I can afford Mom's treatment!

07:49.350 --> 07:51.640
<i>If I had one more chance...</i>

07:54.340 --> 07:58.030
<i>Let's fight... Let's make it intense!</i>

08:03.840 --> 08:06.840
<i>For as long as we're alive... 
As hard as we can!</i>

08:07.980 --> 08:10.050
<i>If I can get stronger...</i>

08:11.340 --> 08:14.640
<i>I'll gladly follow these ridiculous rules!</i>

08:23.900 --> 08:25.150
That can't be good, right?

08:25.520 --> 08:27.840
I wish the Association would 
do something already.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.880
Sword's not gonna last much longer.

08:42.010 --> 08:45.900
<i>At the end of the day, 
weapons are disposable, I guess.</i>

08:46.260 --> 08:50.510
<i>Even the expensive ones still end up 
like this after a few dungeon runs.</i>

08:50.930 --> 08:51.630
<i>Still...</i>

08:52.050 --> 08:54.420
This might be a good stopping point.

08:59.910 --> 09:02.430
I got 34 wolf fangs,

09:02.430 --> 09:05.680
two worn daggers, a traveler's cloak...

09:06.430 --> 09:11.230
and, surprisingly, a teleportation stone.

09:12.420 --> 09:14.000
Maybe I should leave?

09:15.700 --> 09:20.690
But I might never get the chance 
to get stronger this easily ever again.

09:21.180 --> 09:24.490
I don't know what'll happen to this dungeon 
when I use the teleportation stone.

09:24.490 --> 09:25.670
Will it vanish?

09:26.560 --> 09:31.630
Maybe it'll disappear without a trace, 
like a limited-time event in a game.

09:32.470 --> 09:36.870
Whatever happens, I seem to be wrapped up 
in something I don't understand.

09:38.190 --> 09:40.810
It's like I'm dancing atop the Buddha's palm.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.700
Do I move forward, or head back?

10:02.390 --> 10:04.240
Hello, this is Lee Joohee...

10:05.800 --> 10:09.940
From the Hunter's Association? 
I apologize about the other day.

10:12.440 --> 10:15.300
There was a dungeon break at the gate?!

10:15.300 --> 10:16.990
That's nearby.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.760
<i>If I hadn't turned down that offer...</i>

10:20.060 --> 10:24.040
<i>We've been assembling free 
hunters to deal with it, but...</i>

10:24.040 --> 10:26.900
<i>there's such a shortage of healers...</i>

10:32.060 --> 10:33.440
I understand.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.860
<i>The higher my level rose,</i>

10:37.460 --> 10:41.220
<i>the easier it became 
to defeat the magic beasts.</i>

10:49.740 --> 10:51.840
<i>The color of the text 
describing them has changed.</i>

10:52.700 --> 10:57.280
<i>I think white means they're relatively weak.
Orange means they're on equal footing with me.</i>

10:57.940 --> 10:59.890
<i>And red means they're strong.</i>

11:00.430 --> 11:04.850
<i>The Lycans that were red 
at first are white now.</i>

11:05.450 --> 11:07.980
<i>I guess I've become that much stronger.</i>

11:08.490 --> 11:13.430
<i>But even at my current level, l don't feel 
like I can take the one that's down here.</i>

11:14.100 --> 11:16.990
Maybe it's thanks to my perception 
ability being that much higher,

11:16.990 --> 11:18.780
but I can feel it.

11:19.650 --> 11:23.430
There's a monster down there... 
and it gives me goosebumps.

11:25.950 --> 11:28.460
I don't think I can gain 
any more levels around here.

11:29.310 --> 11:31.920
And if I fight needlessly, 
the sword won't last.

11:44.520 --> 11:48.230
Was the stairway in this 
station always this long?

12:02.650 --> 12:04.880
It doesn't look anything 
like the station I know.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.430
<i>So fast!</i>

12:17.270 --> 12:18.260
<i>The sword...</i>

12:24.300 --> 12:28.620
<i>Even after all that leveling up, 
its name is still...</i>

12:30.350 --> 12:31.470
<i>orange?!</i>

12:33.110 --> 12:35.360
You must be the boss around here.

12:36.180 --> 12:39.450
<i>There's no way this sword could 
penetrate those armored scales.</i>

12:39.770 --> 12:42.050
<i>And fighting empty-handed 
is out of the question.</i>

12:52.160 --> 12:54.980
<i>Between this speed and the way it 
throws its weight into each attack...</i>

12:54.980 --> 12:57.640
<i>I'll have to find a way around its defense!</i>

12:57.640 --> 13:00.660
<i>But what do I do against 
armor as thick as this?</i>

13:08.520 --> 13:11.270
<i>If it lands a clean hit on me, I'm dead.</i>

13:31.540 --> 13:34.400
<i>I thought I'd gotten a bit stronger...</i>

13:43.180 --> 13:46.640
<i>Is it still not enough?</i>

13:47.860 --> 13:51.110
<i>How much stronger do I need to get...</i>

13:51.770 --> 13:55.900
<i>before it makes up for a life 
spent being a laughing stock?!</i>

14:00.280 --> 14:02.240
"The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind"?

14:02.800 --> 14:05.750
I hear that's what they've been calling you.

14:06.140 --> 14:06.980
Yeah...

14:06.980 --> 14:10.760
It's unbelievable how childish 
some people can be.

14:11.450 --> 14:14.630
Work hard to prove them wrong.

14:16.860 --> 14:19.430
Right. I understand.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.760
I got called that because I'm weak.

14:40.450 --> 14:42.910
I get mocked because I'm weak!

14:45.350 --> 14:47.650
I'm ashamed of myself, okay?

14:49.080 --> 14:50.330
If you're strongâ€”

14:52.210 --> 14:56.000
If you have overwhelming strength, you go 
into every situation with an advantage.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.010
When you're powerless, there's nothing 
you can do around the strong...

14:59.010 --> 15:02.720
besides quiver in fear 
and stand around helplessly.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.310
You get looked down on when you're weak.

15:05.310 --> 15:09.830
You can be knowledgeable, you can 
be creative, you can be considerate,

15:10.310 --> 15:12.360
but when faced with the strong,

15:13.240 --> 15:15.440
none of it will save you!

15:16.010 --> 15:19.170
Kindness won't save me! 
So I'll become stronger!

15:19.170 --> 15:21.240
That's why I came this far!

15:35.130 --> 15:37.050
I've...

15:42.050 --> 15:45.200
gotta get stronger!

15:51.190 --> 15:52.560
<i>Not yet!</i>

15:53.600 --> 15:57.980
<i>Compared to that thing... 
Compared to the terror I felt back then...</i>

15:58.570 --> 16:00.440
<i>This will be easy!</i>

16:14.920 --> 16:18.130
<i>I focused specifically 
on increasing my strength!</i>

16:23.360 --> 16:24.840
<i>I should be able to...</i>

16:28.630 --> 16:30.970
I know that, here and now,

16:32.350 --> 16:35.380
I can kill you!

16:37.190 --> 16:42.040
Die!

17:12.440 --> 17:17.370
I guess I really have gotten a bit stronger.

17:26.010 --> 17:29.260
Got something nice out of it, too.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.090
This dagger's made from 
its fangs, not its bones?

17:34.390 --> 17:39.670
That's double the attack power of Kim's sword, 
and it has paralysis and drain effects, too.

17:40.170 --> 17:44.090
This thing, on the other hand, 
is way too scary to use.

17:44.090 --> 17:45.880
Better to hold on to it.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.960
I guess I beat the dungeon?

18:08.020 --> 18:10.870
<i>No one's around. I wonder what time it is.</i>

18:11.200 --> 18:14.080
Excuse me! You can't go in there.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.660
Didn't you hear the broadcast?

18:16.660 --> 18:17.940
What broadcast?

18:17.940 --> 18:20.170
Come on, don't play around...

18:20.690 --> 18:22.890
Wait, are you a hunter?

18:22.890 --> 18:24.910
Yes, I am.

18:24.910 --> 18:27.960
My apologies, then! 
Let me show you to the battle.

18:27.960 --> 18:28.960
This way, please.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.340
Oh, okay.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.670
<i>Did something else happen?</i>

18:38.090 --> 18:42.330
A dungeon break... I guess a magic beast 
made it out from a gate.

18:42.330 --> 18:47.690
It's mostly taken care of, 
but there's one big one left.

18:48.070 --> 18:50.550
<i>Maybe it's my improved perception ability...</i>

18:51.160 --> 18:55.120
<i>but I can sense it. The boss is over there.</i>

19:00.420 --> 19:04.500
No pictures, please! This is very dangerous!

19:06.000 --> 19:07.730
How much longer?!

19:07.730 --> 19:10.380
What if things get even worse?!

19:10.380 --> 19:14.390
Healers, make sure to focus 
on keeping the tank healthy!

19:14.390 --> 19:16.260
You don't have to tell us!

19:18.510 --> 19:20.810
What are our damage dealers doing?!

19:20.810 --> 19:23.620
This thing doesn't look like it's going down!

19:24.090 --> 19:26.650
Its defense is too strong!

19:27.060 --> 19:29.570
And we're short on hunters who can use magic!

19:29.570 --> 19:31.480
Excuse me! Coming through!

19:31.770 --> 19:34.700
<i>A hastily assembled team... 
It's no wonder they don't work together well.</i>

19:36.510 --> 19:38.080
<i>Low ranks, too.</i>

19:38.520 --> 19:42.470
<i>I see eight E-Ranks and two D-Ranks.</i>

19:42.910 --> 19:46.180
<i>One of the D-Ranks is a tank, which is why 
they haven't been able to finish this,</i>

19:46.180 --> 19:47.300
<i>and the battle's running long.</i>

19:48.120 --> 19:51.260
<i>The healers... Two D-Ranks and a B-Rank.</i>

19:52.290 --> 19:53.630
Lady, come on!

19:53.630 --> 19:57.550
You need to help someone! 
Aren't you a B-Rank healer?!

19:57.960 --> 19:59.520
Don't just stand there!

19:59.520 --> 20:00.770
R-Right!

20:03.380 --> 20:05.730
Seriously, stay focused!

20:10.960 --> 20:14.790
<i>One week later, she's still shaken up.</i>

20:15.280 --> 20:18.370
<i>Not that I can blame her. I'm the same.</i>

20:19.800 --> 20:21.000
<i>No.</i>

20:23.970 --> 20:25.570
<i>This is a D-Rank boss.</i>

20:26.790 --> 20:29.510
<i>Weaker than the one I just fought!</i>

20:30.890 --> 20:32.820
We're gonna be wiped out at this rate!

20:32.820 --> 20:34.880
We can't do this without 
a higher-ranked hunter!

20:35.390 --> 20:37.600
<i>If they can get through his defenses,</i>

20:38.290 --> 20:39.600
<i>they can win!</i>

20:43.680 --> 20:45.940
<i>An attack forceful enough to pierce stone...</i>

20:46.850 --> 20:48.360
<i>Take this!</i>

20:50.480 --> 20:52.630
Good! Its defenses are down!

20:52.630 --> 20:53.490
We can beat it!

21:02.070 --> 21:04.820
We did it... We actually did it!

21:06.100 --> 21:10.470
<i>None of our attacks were working. 
What suddenly shattered its defense?</i>

21:10.800 --> 21:14.130
<i>It wasn't us. We weren't 
doing any damage at all.</i>

21:14.930 --> 21:16.800
<i>What was that thing that came flying?</i>

21:18.770 --> 21:23.270
<i>A boss-level golem that over 
ten people couldn't scratch</i>

21:23.270 --> 21:25.280
<i>got taken down by </i>that<i>?!</i>

21:26.820 --> 21:28.240
Excuse me.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.300
Yes?

21:29.300 --> 21:31.770
Who threw that broken sword?

21:31.770 --> 21:34.190
Oh, it was the hunter who...

21:34.850 --> 21:37.270
Huh? He was just...

21:36.060 --> 21:38.490
<i>What incredible power.</i>

21:39.640 --> 21:41.840
<i>Was it some high-ranked hunter?</i>

21:48.980 --> 21:51.200

21:51.520 --> 21:55.020

seriously weakened already.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.470
Jinwoo...?
