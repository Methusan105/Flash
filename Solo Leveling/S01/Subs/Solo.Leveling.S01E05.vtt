00:02.980 --> 00:04.190
Oh my gosh, did you see him?

00:04.190 --> 00:06.400
I sure did! You mean the E-Rank, right?

00:08.150 --> 00:10.560
Doesn't he have the hottest body?

00:10.560 --> 00:13.620
His face is kind of average, 
maybe leaning toward cute.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.920
He's not that huge, but when you see 
under his clothes, it's like, "Whoa!"

00:18.920 --> 00:20.980
When did we get a patient like that?!

00:20.980 --> 00:22.540
I didn't see him before.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.890
He didn't stand out at first,

00:27.890 --> 00:31.480
but he's apparently been exercising 
and has gotten pretty cut.

00:31.480 --> 00:34.970
Seriously? There's no way 
it happened that fast.

00:36.180 --> 00:37.340
Excuse me.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.160
Mr. Sung Jinwoo...

00:41.310 --> 00:44.020
Oh, sorry.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.740
No! Pardon me, actually!

00:48.330 --> 00:51.530
<i>Those really are some incredible muscles.</i>

00:53.370 --> 00:57.340
<i>Did he always have such an amazing body?</i>

00:57.340 --> 00:59.860
Did you need something from me?

00:59.860 --> 01:01.420
Oh, right!

01:01.420 --> 01:04.810
You're going to be discharged today. 
How are you feeling?

01:04.810 --> 01:07.170
Pretty good, thankfully.

01:07.170 --> 01:08.310
I see!

01:08.310 --> 01:11.890
Well, come by reception when you're ready, 
and we'll handle the paperwork.

01:11.890 --> 01:13.800
Right. Thank you for everything.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.320
Excuse me!

01:17.320 --> 01:18.060
Y-Yeah?

01:18.930 --> 01:21.430
Could I get your contact info?!

01:21.850 --> 01:23.650
You want... my contact info?

01:23.650 --> 01:26.610
Yes. If you don't mind...

01:26.950 --> 01:30.280
<i>I guess it's to send me test results 
after I get released?</i>

01:30.280 --> 01:31.320
Understood.

03:07.110 --> 03:09.090
Good morning, everyone!

03:09.090 --> 03:11.380
I'm here with our special guest...

03:11.380 --> 03:13.670
Nice to meet you. I'm Baek Yoonho.

03:14.360 --> 03:21.170
Hunter Baek, you must keep busy as one of 
the only seven S-Rank hunters in the country.

03:21.170 --> 03:25.810
What's a hunter's life like when 
they're not exploring dungeons?

03:25.810 --> 03:28.700
That's a good question. 
There's a lot of training.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.770
You need to hone your skills, 
each and every day.

03:31.130 --> 03:35.510
If you were to lose touch with the feel 
of real combat, it could dull your instincts.

03:35.510 --> 03:38.600
Every day, then? That must be tough.

03:39.130 --> 03:44.870
In my case, I made a habit of training 
back when I was a firefighter.

03:45.220 --> 03:48.960
If I make even the slightest mistake, 
my comrades could get injured.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.540
<i>The thought of that keeps me on my toes.</i>

03:51.540 --> 03:52.800
<i>I see.</i>

03:54.370 --> 03:56.070
Oh, look at the time!

03:58.670 --> 04:00.350
Jinwoo?

04:00.350 --> 04:02.350
'Morning, Jinah...

04:02.350 --> 04:03.430
You're already up?

04:03.430 --> 04:07.440
I've been up. Be careful 
on the way to school.

04:07.440 --> 04:12.020
There's some leftovers from 
last night in the fridge... so...

04:13.070 --> 04:15.360
Have you been working out, Jinwoo?

04:16.020 --> 04:18.180
A little.

04:18.180 --> 04:21.780
And you seem taller. 
Did the exercise help with that, too?

04:22.480 --> 04:25.860
I guess men keep growing 
even when they're adults!

04:29.000 --> 04:30.590
I'm heading out.

04:31.790 --> 04:35.250
Hey. Don't forget an umbrella.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.720
It's nice out today. Plus, it'd be heavy.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.530
How's this little thing heavy?

04:39.530 --> 04:41.650
Aw, come on. Quit it.

04:41.650 --> 04:44.330
Better safe than sorry. There!

04:44.940 --> 04:47.490
Yeah, okay. I'm going now.

04:47.490 --> 04:48.610
Be safe!

04:52.930 --> 04:54.980
I can do my running later.

04:55.390 --> 04:58.840
Are these muscles from my stats?

04:59.330 --> 05:03.050
Maybe if I keep leveling up, 
I'll end up like a bodybuilder?

05:05.340 --> 05:08.040
I still haven't used my points from before.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.650
Where should I assign these...?

05:11.170 --> 05:16.270
Strength increases the damage I do. 
But if I can't land a hit, it's pointless.

05:16.270 --> 05:18.130
So maybe agility?

05:18.650 --> 05:20.800
I'll increase strength and agility.

05:20.800 --> 05:24.440
Vitality always helps, 
and perception comes in pretty handy.

05:24.440 --> 05:27.980
Intellect... seems like it'd have 
something to do with magic.

05:27.980 --> 05:29.400
Do I really need it?

05:30.260 --> 05:32.070
Okay, let's go with this.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.770
That should do.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.330
H-Hello! This is Sung Jinwoo!

05:39.330 --> 05:40.850
<i>You finally picked up.</i>

05:40.850 --> 05:43.610
I'm so sorry. I've actually 
been in the hospital.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.500
I know that this is about the rent, right?

05:45.500 --> 05:49.040
<i>Right. You hadn't paid for this month yet...</i>

05:49.290 --> 05:51.330
<i>But if you need, we can put it off for a bit.</i>

05:51.330 --> 05:53.880
N-No! I'll get it to you right away!

05:53.880 --> 05:57.940
<i>I see. Well, I'll be waiting. 
You be careful, now.</i>

05:57.940 --> 06:00.010
Right. Thank you.

06:01.900 --> 06:06.010
<i>I don't know if what I'm experiencing 
is a re-awakening...</i>

06:06.760 --> 06:10.220
<i>But now that I'm able 
to kill goblins with ease,</i>

06:10.510 --> 06:12.430
<i>making rent shouldn't be too hard.</i>

06:14.930 --> 06:18.860
That said... It's not exactly easy, either.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.960
To make good money, I need to 
go through higher-ranked gates.

06:22.960 --> 06:27.890
But no one's gonna let an 
E-Rank hunter into those.

06:28.580 --> 06:30.660
Maybe I could get re-appraised?

06:30.660 --> 06:33.680
A higher rank could get me into better gates,

06:33.680 --> 06:36.330
and maybe a bit of attention 
will help me earn more...

06:37.030 --> 06:41.800
<i>I'd definitely stand out, though. 
Re-awakenings are rare enough.</i>

06:42.130 --> 06:46.500
<i>I've never heard of a hunter who could 
level up and keep getting stronger.</i>

06:47.310 --> 06:49.900
<i>Which would probably mean 
even more scrutiny.</i>

06:50.270 --> 06:54.460
<i>The press would eat it up... and there's 
the saying about the nail that sticks out.</i>

06:55.010 --> 06:56.370
<i>I better not.</i>

06:56.370 --> 07:02.680
<i>Not until I can properly defend myself 
and learn what the deal is with this power.</i>

07:15.550 --> 07:16.580
Confirm.

07:18.300 --> 07:19.530
Hey, there!

07:22.610 --> 07:23.920
I'm Hwang Dongsuk.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.170
Sung Jinwoo.

07:25.170 --> 07:26.350
You're E-Rank, right?

07:26.350 --> 07:26.970
Right.

07:26.970 --> 07:30.680
Oh, I know this guy! He's actually famous!

07:31.170 --> 07:34.820
I think his nickname is 
"The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind."

07:34.820 --> 07:37.390
Whoa, are you serious?

07:36.500 --> 07:37.860
Okay, knock it off!

07:37.860 --> 07:40.120
Sorry about my people back there.

07:40.120 --> 07:43.000
No. I am actually E-Rank, so...

07:43.000 --> 07:44.490
Will that be a problem?

07:44.490 --> 07:49.110
Not at all. We need you to meet 
the quota more than anything else.

07:49.690 --> 07:52.510
I told you over the phone, 
but just to confirm...

07:52.510 --> 07:56.640
This is going to be a C-Rank dungeon,
and we need a minimum of eight people to enter.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.580
Among which at least half of the 
members need to be C-Rank.

07:59.920 --> 08:03.970
You won't be a combatant, so we won't 
be sharing the spoils with you...

08:03.970 --> 08:07.810
But we're prepared to pay you 
2,000,000 for participating.

08:09.570 --> 08:12.970
<i>Four C-Ranks and two sub-D-Ranks.</i>

08:13.480 --> 08:16.470
Understood. What do you need me to do?

08:16.470 --> 08:18.440
If you could help with our baggage.

08:18.770 --> 08:21.830
It's food to eat on the inside, 
along with spare clothing and gear...

08:21.830 --> 08:23.400
and a first aid kit.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.360
Wait... Are you doing this without a healer?

08:26.880 --> 08:31.660
I'm sure you know it's hard for 
independent parties to retain those.

08:31.660 --> 08:34.550
We do all our raids without a healer.

08:36.050 --> 08:40.790
<i>A squad with nothing but tanks 
and damage dealers... Seems crazy.</i>

08:41.320 --> 08:44.200
<i>And something about 
the lack of a healer bugs me.</i>

08:44.200 --> 08:46.960
If you could just sign the contract...

08:48.390 --> 08:53.470
<i>No liability for anything that happens 
inside of the dungeon, huh?</i>

08:53.470 --> 08:54.500
Here you go.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.430
Thanks.

08:58.010 --> 09:00.850
It looks like we're here for the same reason.

09:01.320 --> 09:04.430
I'm Yoo Jinho. Twenty-one years old, D-Rank.

09:04.430 --> 09:06.550
I'm here to meet the quota, too.

09:07.960 --> 09:12.000
<i>A D-Rank with gear like that? 
This kid's family must be rich.</i>

09:12.780 --> 09:14.990
Is this your first time in a C-Rank dungeon?

09:15.600 --> 09:18.000
It's okay! I'll keep you safe.

09:22.460 --> 09:24.000
Let's be on our way!

09:24.490 --> 09:27.190
Those bags look heavy. 
Are you gonna be okay?

09:27.650 --> 09:29.980
Thank you, but I'll be all right.

09:29.980 --> 09:33.510
I'm younger, so don't worry 
about being polite or anything.

09:34.550 --> 09:35.910
Got it.

09:35.910 --> 09:39.440
Did you hear about the president 
of the firm who was handling this site?

09:39.440 --> 09:43.080
He fled overseas two months ago 
with 900 billion he embezzled.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.940
The workers and investors were aghast.

09:47.010 --> 09:50.240
Oh, was I rambling without 
reading the mood again?

09:50.240 --> 09:53.720
I've never been great at social cues.

09:56.550 --> 09:57.580
This is it.

09:57.580 --> 10:00.990
Damn! Get a load of the size of that thing!

10:00.990 --> 10:03.540
Gates this big are pretty rare.

10:04.330 --> 10:07.400
Mr. Dongsuk, is this really a C-Rank dungeon?

10:07.400 --> 10:08.810
Seems kinda... big.

10:08.810 --> 10:14.010
The Association folks checked twice, 
and they say it's C-Rank. No doubt about it.

10:14.410 --> 10:18.190
That really is a huge gate. 
Are we going to be okay?

10:18.190 --> 10:20.640
The size of the gate 
doesn't matter that much.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.480
The level of magic power coming 
from within is the real indicator.

10:24.160 --> 10:27.870
That's what the Association 
measures to assign a rank.

10:27.870 --> 10:32.220
Anything dangerous, like B-Rank or higher, 
is handled by larger guilds.

10:32.220 --> 10:34.700
C-Rank ones and below shouldn't be that bad.

10:35.290 --> 10:37.530
You really know a lot, Jinwoo.

10:37.530 --> 10:39.660
I've been a hunter for a while now.

10:40.620 --> 10:43.890
<i>That said... I've never tackled 
a C-Rank dungeon before.</i>

10:44.310 --> 10:46.380
Everyone, follow me!

10:46.700 --> 10:47.680
Right!

10:47.680 --> 10:49.630
Let's go, Jinwoo!

10:50.740 --> 10:52.560
Yeah. Okay.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.040
Kyuhwan, we need some light.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.180
Got it.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.410
What is this place? 
There're no magic beasts...

11:07.410 --> 11:09.270
No light, either.

11:09.270 --> 11:12.280
Most dungeons are covered in glow stones.

11:12.660 --> 11:13.990
<i>A pitch-black dungeon...</i>

11:14.530 --> 11:16.820
<i>It reminds me of the Cartenon Temple.</i>

11:17.530 --> 11:20.720
Jinwoo, what are glow stones?

11:22.090 --> 11:27.110
They're rocks you tend to see in cave-like 
dungeons that give off a faint light.

11:27.570 --> 11:32.150
They cover the walls and floor, 
lighting up the inside.

11:32.500 --> 11:36.880
So there are essence stones that 
you recover from magic beasts,

11:36.880 --> 11:39.700
mana stones that you can mine from dungeons,

11:39.700 --> 11:43.350
and glow stones that light up caves?

11:43.350 --> 11:45.470
Seems easy to mix them up.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.090
You'll get used to it.

11:50.310 --> 11:53.660
There really doesn't seem to be anything.

11:53.660 --> 11:57.030
Jinwoo, are there dungeons 
without magic beasts?

11:59.950 --> 12:01.380
<i>This sound...</i>

12:01.760 --> 12:05.000
<i>They're here. They just haven't 
shown themselves yet.</i>

12:05.000 --> 12:05.870
Get ready!

12:05.870 --> 12:06.830
Right!

12:07.300 --> 12:11.950
<i>What creature lurks in large numbers 
in the darkness and is attracted to light?</i>

12:12.790 --> 12:14.800
They're insect-type beasts!

12:14.800 --> 12:15.550
Insects?!

12:15.550 --> 12:17.460
Damn it! Insect-types?!

12:17.460 --> 12:19.240
Mr. Dongsuk, do you see anything?

12:19.240 --> 12:20.840
No! Nothing!

12:20.840 --> 12:22.380
Damn it, is this an ant nest?!

12:22.380 --> 12:23.930
That'd be really bad!

12:23.930 --> 12:25.520
The noise is getting closer!

12:25.520 --> 12:26.980
Where are they?!

12:26.980 --> 12:28.740
There're too many tunnels!

12:29.710 --> 12:30.810
Above us!

12:34.790 --> 12:35.820
Kyuhwan!

12:38.130 --> 12:39.740
I'll draw their attention!

12:39.740 --> 12:40.620
Right!

12:40.620 --> 12:43.160
Stay close to me, Jinwoo!

12:45.580 --> 12:47.770
Come and get me, vermin!

12:51.000 --> 12:53.210
Wow... All of the bugs are 
headed toward Mr. Hwang!

12:53.210 --> 12:56.470
<i>A taunt skill? No wonder he's C-Rank.</i>

12:58.390 --> 13:00.450
Jinsuk! Eleven o'clock!

13:00.450 --> 13:01.260
Copy that!

13:01.970 --> 13:02.840
I should help—

13:02.840 --> 13:04.000
Stay back for now!

13:04.000 --> 13:04.930
Mind the countdown!

13:05.350 --> 13:08.520
Five... Four... Three...

13:08.520 --> 13:10.020
Two... One...

13:10.020 --> 13:11.060
Zero!

13:11.060 --> 13:12.450
Here comes a big one!

13:12.450 --> 13:14.270
Chew on this!

13:15.810 --> 13:17.690
Good! Now, let's wrap this up!

13:17.690 --> 13:19.030
Hell yeah!

13:19.350 --> 13:20.760
<i>They're well coordinated.</i>

13:20.760 --> 13:23.990
<i>It's easy to see that they've been 
working together for a long time.</i>

13:24.510 --> 13:28.910
<i>Still, it might be the lack of a healer, 
but they're a bit rough around the edges.</i>

13:30.320 --> 13:34.880
<i>As for Jinho... Looks like his gear 
is making up for any lack of skill.</i>

13:37.440 --> 13:39.540
<i>They're doing a fine enough job, but...</i>

13:41.130 --> 13:42.090
<i>Something...</i>

13:46.230 --> 13:47.590
<i>feels off.</i>

13:47.970 --> 13:49.600
Okay!

13:49.600 --> 13:51.890
Was that the last one? Jinsuk!

13:53.620 --> 13:56.360
Yes, sir. No survivors. We're all done.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.200
Good! All clear!

13:58.200 --> 14:00.860
We grab the essence stones 
and split them seven ways!

14:00.860 --> 14:02.530
Yeah!

14:03.590 --> 14:05.510
This is my favorite part of the job.

14:05.510 --> 14:06.490
Me, too.

14:06.940 --> 14:09.130
You really helped out earlier.

14:09.130 --> 14:11.560
If we had noticed them even a moment later...

14:11.560 --> 14:12.560
It's all right.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.170
How'd you know they were coming from above?

14:16.130 --> 14:17.130
Instinct.

14:17.810 --> 14:20.210
Well, those are sharp instincts 
you've got. They saved us.

14:20.210 --> 14:22.860
Mr. Dongsuk! Look at this.

14:23.390 --> 14:24.800
The wounds on these ones...

14:25.200 --> 14:27.060
That's not from a sword strike.

14:27.060 --> 14:30.340
That's what I thought, too. 
And they're not burns from magic, either.

14:30.340 --> 14:35.300
There's more than a few that 
look like they were torn to pieces.

14:35.300 --> 14:38.310
Maybe there was a turf battle 
with some other magic beasts?

14:38.310 --> 14:42.890
That'd imply there's something stronger 
than these things around here, right?

14:44.850 --> 14:47.920
<i>Something big enough to prey on these bugs...</i>

14:49.460 --> 14:53.230
Did you see me get that beast?!

14:53.230 --> 14:54.230
Yeah.

14:55.010 --> 14:58.520
Jinho. That sword and shield 
probably cost a lot, right?

14:58.520 --> 15:03.630
Oh, right. Since this is my first raid, 
my father got me something nice.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.090
I see. Well, I'm not exactly sure why...

15:07.660 --> 15:09.550
but we should be careful.

15:19.330 --> 15:21.550
What the heck was that?! A bomb?

15:21.550 --> 15:23.900
Calm down. That's something 
you hear all the time here.

15:26.380 --> 15:28.910
It's just the Guildmaster doing his training.

15:34.330 --> 15:38.250
Damn... He blew through 
that huge stone with one hit?

15:40.060 --> 15:42.550
That didn't even amount to a warm-up.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.620
Hey! Could someone clean up in here?

15:48.660 --> 15:50.140
This is a long path...

15:50.480 --> 15:51.780
The size of a dungeon...

15:51.780 --> 15:53.970
...has nothing to do with its rank, right?

15:53.970 --> 15:56.520
You mentioned its magic power rating before.

15:56.520 --> 16:00.700
Does that mean this dungeon 
is huge but mostly empty?

16:00.700 --> 16:01.520
Sure does.

16:01.930 --> 16:05.640
It must be hard lugging all that stuff 
around such a big dungeon.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.900
You sure you're okay, Jinwoo?

16:07.900 --> 16:10.090
It's not that much.

16:10.090 --> 16:14.240
And getting paid without having 
to fight is a pretty good deal.

16:15.340 --> 16:19.460
<i>A pretty good deal... Maybe too good.</i>

16:20.410 --> 16:22.170
<i>Something keeps bugging me.</i>

16:24.160 --> 16:27.920
<i>They're a battle-tested party... 
without a healer.</i>

16:28.380 --> 16:30.390
<i>One that needed extra members 
to fill the quota...</i>

16:30.740 --> 16:32.810
Another half-dead one.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.330
Nice!

16:35.330 --> 16:36.410
Thanks.

16:36.810 --> 16:38.630
This is a bit weird.

16:38.630 --> 16:42.560
We've covered a ton of distance, 
and we haven't seen a single healthy beast.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.850
Just ones that are injured or already dead.

16:45.850 --> 16:47.790
The boss has gotta be around here somewhere.

16:47.790 --> 16:50.030
Well, obviously, or a gate 
wouldn't have opened.

16:50.880 --> 16:51.760
Hang on.

16:52.130 --> 16:54.030
Kyuhwan, give us some light up ahead.

16:54.030 --> 16:54.830
Sure.

16:59.630 --> 17:02.390
That's gotta be the boss chamber down there.

17:02.390 --> 17:03.210
Let's go.

17:15.490 --> 17:16.900
What the...

17:16.900 --> 17:18.180
Damn!

17:18.180 --> 17:19.770
Mana crystals!

17:19.770 --> 17:22.020
Damn, just look at them all!

17:22.020 --> 17:24.180
They might not be worth 
as much as essence stones,

17:24.180 --> 17:27.900
but a haul like this? Even at a glance, 
there's probably a billion's worth.

17:28.310 --> 17:32.120
Y'know, Mr. Dongsuk, even your brother 
would be jealous of a score like this.

17:32.120 --> 17:36.170
Hey! Don't bring up his brother!

17:36.960 --> 17:39.440
<i>Dongsoo... It's like I told you.</i>

17:39.820 --> 17:42.770
<i>You don't always get to be right.</i>

17:42.770 --> 17:46.340
<i>And you'd better not think I'm always gonna 
show deference to you, little brother.</i>

17:46.860 --> 17:51.050
<i>I'm gonna use this haul 
to grow my strike team!</i>

17:51.370 --> 17:52.870
We really hit the jackpot.

17:52.870 --> 17:55.330
If we split this seven ways, 
it's gonna be over 100 million each.

17:55.330 --> 17:56.730
How are we gonna carry it all?

17:56.730 --> 17:59.990
Jinwoo, can I see the contract you signed?

17:59.990 --> 18:01.990
I'm pretty good with legal stuff.

18:01.990 --> 18:03.000
Sure.

18:03.940 --> 18:06.230
Excuse me, can I ask something?

18:06.980 --> 18:09.820
This is Jinwoo's contract.

18:09.820 --> 18:12.450
It only specifies that he doesn't 
get a share of the battle drops.

18:12.760 --> 18:16.410
Since mana crystals are excavated 
and not dropped by beasts,

18:16.410 --> 18:19.930
shouldn't this be split eight ways 
instead of seven?

18:19.930 --> 18:21.410
Of course!

18:21.410 --> 18:24.510
Let's split it evenly. I understand.

18:24.990 --> 18:28.630
Still, we'll need to deal with that first.

18:29.380 --> 18:30.570
The dungeon boss!

18:30.570 --> 18:34.340
I'm sure you realize this, but once the boss 
is defeated, the gate will close.

18:34.890 --> 18:39.400
We'll need to mine and haul the mana 
crystals out before fighting that spider.

18:39.930 --> 18:45.240
Luckily, it seems to be asleep, which gives 
us the perfect chance to start excavating.

18:45.650 --> 18:47.330
Chul-jin, where's the gear?

18:47.770 --> 18:52.160
I mean... I didn't expect there 
to be this many mana crystals.

18:52.160 --> 18:55.210
I left the transport stuff back with my ride.

18:55.210 --> 18:58.120
Damn it, don't I tell you to always bring it?

18:58.120 --> 18:59.820
I'm real sorry.

18:59.820 --> 19:03.870
I'm sorry, but could you two 
keep an eye on things here?

19:03.870 --> 19:05.640
We need to collect some equipment.

19:06.410 --> 19:09.210
But this is the boss chamber! 
And it'll be just me and Jinwoo!

19:09.210 --> 19:13.570
Don't worry. It seems to be asleep, 
probably on a full stomach.

19:13.570 --> 19:16.760
I doubt it'll wake up 
unless something bothers it.

19:16.760 --> 19:17.770
But...

19:17.770 --> 19:20.600
This is your first raid, right, Yoo?

19:20.600 --> 19:24.230
And this is Sung's first C-Rank dungeon.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.290
Just trust me!

19:26.690 --> 19:28.120
Okay?

19:28.720 --> 19:30.650
I need to discuss some stuff 
with my team, too,

19:31.070 --> 19:32.840
so we'll take a break while we're at it.

19:33.270 --> 19:37.980
<i>The regulations say you need eight members 
to tackle a C-Rank dungeon.</i>

19:37.980 --> 19:41.630
<i>Minus Jinho and I, there are 
six people in the strike team.</i>

19:41.990 --> 19:44.620
<i>We do all our raids without a healer.</i>

19:45.000 --> 19:47.480
<i>He said "all our raids,"</i>

19:47.480 --> 19:50.340
<i>which means they've tackled 
C-Rank dungeons before.</i>

19:50.860 --> 19:54.770
<i>So wouldn't they have regulars who 
they'd call up to meet the quota?</i>

19:55.460 --> 20:00.010
Kyuhwan... seal off the boss chamber.

20:05.140 --> 20:06.850
The entrance! But why?!

20:08.230 --> 20:10.770
Does this mean... they betrayed us?

20:10.770 --> 20:13.230
<i>I knew it. Those bastards...</i>

20:14.060 --> 20:17.240
You run into some real crooks 
in this line of work.

20:17.730 --> 20:21.520
Since it's dangerous,
accidents happen regularly enough, right?

20:21.870 --> 20:24.780
But since those accidents 
are totally isolated,

20:24.780 --> 20:29.210
you could also commit a crime, 
and it'd never come to light.

20:29.740 --> 20:32.630
There are no security cameras in dungeons,

20:32.630 --> 20:35.710
and if there are no living witnesses, 
there'll never be any evidence, either.

20:36.030 --> 20:41.210
Sometimes they use weak people as bait 
for enemies, or abandon them...

20:41.780 --> 20:45.140
like a lizard leaving its tail behind.

20:46.250 --> 20:50.580
They'd try to kill us just 
for some mana crystals?!

20:52.520 --> 20:56.810
If... If I hadn't mentioned 
the contract, maybe...

20:57.890 --> 21:00.240
<i>No. Either way,</i>

21:01.280 --> 21:04.780
<i>they were ready to kill us 
after one wrong move.</i>

21:05.430 --> 21:06.740
<i>More importantly...</i>

21:09.710 --> 21:12.210
P-Please get back, Jinwoo!

21:12.470 --> 21:13.810
I'll manage somehow...

21:14.390 --> 21:16.930
<i>We could get out from there, 
if we needed to.</i>

21:16.930 --> 21:19.130
<i>That's probably what 
Hwang's people have in mind.</i>

21:25.040 --> 21:29.140
<i>A C-Rank boss... and an E-Rank hunter.</i>

21:30.150 --> 21:32.230
<i>This thing is literally 
on a whole different level.</i>

21:37.760 --> 21:41.280
<i>A whole different... level...?</i>

21:43.020 --> 21:44.910
<i>I take it all back.</i>

21:44.910 --> 21:46.620
Jinho. Don't move.

21:47.270 --> 21:48.720
I'm gonna fight this thing.

21:48.720 --> 21:51.040
Wait, wh-what?

21:58.050 --> 21:59.730
I'll beat it.
