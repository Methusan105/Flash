WEBVTT

00:21.563 --> 00:24.899
-Now, you be firm this time, okay?
-Yes, dear.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.067
Oh!

00:27.485 --> 00:29.279
-You wanna…
-I just…

00:30.030 --> 00:31.906
Sorry. Try not to… Excuse me.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.302
<i>They're my real family.</i>

00:52.385 --> 00:53.970
<i>Do you even love me?</i>

01:00.268 --> 01:03.104
<i> They're my real family.</i>

01:04.355 --> 01:05.732
<i>Do you even love me?</i>

01:11.696 --> 01:12.822
<i>Do you even love me?</i>

01:12.906 --> 01:14.324
You know you can't be in here.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.701
You took away my briefcase, Herblet.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.954
-I have nowhere else to go.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.706
It's a new regime, Lila.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.501
-<i>They're my real family.</i>
And they're calling for your head.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.044
<i>Do you even love me?</i>

01:26.544 --> 01:29.380
-Oh, I get it.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.176
Ding-dong, the bitch is dead,
so make her daughter pay instead?

01:33.259 --> 01:34.344
Not exactly fair.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.304
-That's…

01:36.387 --> 01:39.682
Um, we can drop you off
in any time period--

01:39.766 --> 01:40.725
Fine.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.311
West Berlin.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.188
1989.

01:47.482 --> 01:50.026
-Uh, <i>sehr gut.</i>

01:50.110 --> 01:52.237
-Okay.
-Look at it.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.613
That's a bullet.

01:53.696 --> 01:54.948
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

02:48.293 --> 02:49.919
<i>Oh, you clever thing.</i>

02:50.753 --> 02:53.548
<i>Look who found</i>
<i>Mother's little escape plan.</i>

02:54.090 --> 02:57.802
<i>Whatever's chasing you,</i>
<i>Lila darling, keep running.</i>

02:58.386 --> 03:00.388
<i>Don't stop for a normal life.</i>

03:00.889 --> 03:03.641
<i>"Normal" isn't meant for girls like us.</i>

03:04.350 --> 03:07.061
<i>And remember, trust no one.</i>

03:07.562 --> 03:08.855
<i>Except for me.</i>

03:09.647 --> 03:11.482
<i>XO, Mom.</i>

03:24.746 --> 03:25.914
Keep walking!

03:27.498 --> 03:28.333
Hey.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.963
Can I borrow your sledgehammer?

03:47.727 --> 03:51.147
-Let's get started.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.690
Where's your mum?

05:58.358 --> 05:59.984
She left with the bass player.

06:00.693 --> 06:01.527
Mm-hmm?

06:03.071 --> 06:04.238
When's she coming back?

06:04.864 --> 06:05.740
A week.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.368
She does this sometimes with bass players.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.995
We followed one here from Atlanta, and…

06:11.621 --> 06:13.206
Mums are the worst.

06:14.415 --> 06:15.792
Tell me about it.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.585
I'll be fine though. You don't gotta stay.

06:20.296 --> 06:21.339
Neither do you.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.008
Hey.

06:24.884 --> 06:28.346
What do you say you and I go to America
and terrorize an old friend of mine?

06:29.389 --> 06:30.390
Could be fun.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.103
-Hmm…

06:37.438 --> 06:39.315
Sure. I'm down.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.026
Cool.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.746
Oh.
What the hell, old man?

07:36.330 --> 07:40.084
Did you kill me
and lock me in the trunk of your car?

07:40.168 --> 07:44.005
I did indeed.
And you remained dead for 22 minutes.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.090
-Totally vulnerable!

07:46.174 --> 07:48.384
I could have taken
every one of your organs.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.302
Why?

07:49.385 --> 07:51.429
The point is,
if the world is truly ending,

07:51.512 --> 07:53.890
then you're running out of time
to master your gifts.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.224
Oh!

07:55.808 --> 07:57.518
-We have work to do!
-No, Dad!

08:41.896 --> 08:42.897
Did you tell him?

08:44.106 --> 08:45.149
Who, Viktor?

08:46.108 --> 08:46.943
Not yet.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.819
Man.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.863
He is not gonna take this well.

08:52.156 --> 08:53.950
-I did what had to be done.
-I'm just saying.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.410
Should've been a family decision.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.542
And which family is that, Brutus?

09:03.501 --> 09:04.794
Nice uniform, by the way.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.796
You look like an un-popped zit.

09:14.011 --> 09:16.764
Should we… find you someone to talk to?

09:16.847 --> 09:19.392
I'm fine.
You're the one having an identity crisis.

09:19.475 --> 09:23.062
Oh, really? Is "fine" what you call
what you did to me at the hotel?

09:25.356 --> 09:26.399
Luther.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.611
Ben is calling a family meeting.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.697
Oh, right. Yeah, good. Agreed.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.032
Both families.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.160
Do you think you could get
your people to work together?

09:39.954 --> 09:41.706
Oh, you're being serious. Um…

09:42.373 --> 09:43.416
Uh…

09:44.000 --> 09:44.917
I'm in.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.378
She's in. Okay.

09:49.505 --> 09:52.717
What the hell are you doing?
Stanley is gone! We need to face this!

09:52.800 --> 09:54.093
Just check the chimney!

09:54.176 --> 09:57.263
He's not in the bloody chimney!
He's been Kugelblitzed!

09:57.346 --> 09:59.765
Whose fault is that, huh?
You're the one that brought him here!

09:59.849 --> 10:02.685
Congratulations.
You're both mildly terrible parents.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.856
Can we focus? Come on.
How did this thing open before?

10:06.939 --> 10:09.442
-I don't know. It was already kinda open.
-"Already kinda open."

10:09.525 --> 10:12.236
Diego, you should have been an engineer.
It's a lost opportunity.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.697
Why'd you wanna go in there anyway?
It's just sushi and death.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.866
When we met future me
in the Commission bunker,

10:16.949 --> 10:18.993
I warned myself about Oblivion.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.120
-Now, Pogo told me--
-Wait, whoa, whoa!

10:21.203 --> 10:23.414
-Pogo's alive?
-Different Pogo, but yes.

10:23.497 --> 10:26.542
The monkey said
Dad spent years training the Sparrows

10:26.626 --> 10:29.503
for some kind of
super-secret mission into…

10:29.587 --> 10:30.588
Oblivion?

10:31.172 --> 10:34.759
So, I come back here
and find that you two sentient STDs

10:34.842 --> 10:36.427
have actually been in there.

10:36.510 --> 10:39.055
Everything's leading to Oblivion.
So we have to go in there.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.724
-Hell no! Not happening.
-No way! We barely got out alive.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.435
Yeah? So what?
This is about more than just you two.

10:44.518 --> 10:45.895
Says the guy with all his fingers.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.898
I didn't get this
by giving a mummy a hand job, all right?

10:48.981 --> 10:51.692
I went in there,
and I lost my fingers to this thing with…

10:51.776 --> 10:53.444
with a knife and on a chain.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.906
Hey, look, Diego might be
90% moron and 10% pelvic thrusts,

10:56.989 --> 10:58.532
but he's right about Oblivion, okay?

10:58.616 --> 11:02.119
We're not just gonna waltz back in there
just because you say so.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.705
Good. Because you're coming with us.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.207
This should be interesting.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.000
-Where to?
-Sparrow Academy.

11:08.084 --> 11:11.587
The world's ending, so I think it's time
we put our petty bullshit aside

11:11.671 --> 11:13.130
and work together on this Kugelblitz.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.423
Yeah? Or what?

11:15.841 --> 11:18.386
Or Stanley won't be
the last of us to disappear.

11:19.845 --> 11:20.846
Come on.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.318
Lovely to meet you.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.703
Stabbed herself in the eye.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.413
-Welcome.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.289
-Please make yourselves at home.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.125
Bitch, this <i>is </i>our home.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.127
-Excuse me?
-Uh, jellybean?

11:51.210 --> 11:53.003
Where the hell
is Viktor and Klaus?

11:53.087 --> 11:55.214
With our luck,
probably Kugelblitzed by now.

11:55.297 --> 11:57.967
-You're a dark little dude sometimes.
-Ooh, what happened to your hand?

11:58.634 --> 12:01.721
We don't have time for idle chitchat.
Everyone, sit down.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.098
-"Please" would be nice.

12:04.181 --> 12:05.182
No.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.189
So, uh…
This is kinda nice, right?

12:13.065 --> 12:14.525
All of us here together.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.694
One big happy family.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.989
-I feel like I'm sweaty. Am I sweating?
-No, you're fine.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.283
Look, I know
there's been bad blood between us.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.785
Whatever. Bygones, right?

12:26.203 --> 12:27.037
Question?

12:27.121 --> 12:29.248
Yeah, if I kill you,
do we get our Ben back?

12:31.083 --> 12:31.917
Hypothetically.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.420
Keep talking, and your hand won't be
the only thing bleeding.

12:34.503 --> 12:38.966
Okay, if the testosterone twins are done,
I'd like to get back to a plan.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.010
Where is he?

12:42.470 --> 12:43.512
Viktor.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.516
What did you do to Harlan?

12:47.600 --> 12:48.851
They didn't do anything.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.603
I did.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.647
I killed Harlan.

12:56.734 --> 12:57.735
What…

13:00.654 --> 13:03.449
I… I don't… I don't understand.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.701
-Why?
-Because he didn't deserve to live.

13:06.702 --> 13:09.121
What? Because <i>they </i>said so?

13:09.205 --> 13:11.248
You don't have to listen to them.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.374
20 bucks on the little one.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.210
They don't get to tell us
what to do.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.586
I'll take that action.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.340
You coulda talked to me.
We could've figured out something else.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.884
So, what, you could lie to us again
and take his side?

13:21.967 --> 13:22.968
That's not what happened.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.930
Oh, no,
that's exactly what happened.

13:27.556 --> 13:31.101
I know Harlan killed all of our mothers.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.394
-What?
-Whoa.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.938
-What?
-Shit.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.358
Bloody plot twist.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.402
Who told you that?

13:40.486 --> 13:41.403
Harlan.

13:41.487 --> 13:45.366
After <i>you </i>lied about it to my face.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.744
Is that true, Viktor?
Harlan started all this?

13:50.037 --> 13:52.873
Yeah, but he didn't mean
to hurt anyone. He--

13:52.957 --> 13:54.083
How do you know?

13:55.584 --> 13:57.211
Because I knew him.

13:57.294 --> 14:00.923
And he was sweet
and kind until I made him like us.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.050
Okay? So, I screwed him up.

14:03.133 --> 14:06.387
And if you need someone to blame,
I'm right here--

14:06.470 --> 14:08.013
What makes you think I don't?

14:10.140 --> 14:12.226
This wasn't about saving the world.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.106
This was about hurting me.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.317
Payback for--

14:21.735 --> 14:22.862
Go on.

14:25.656 --> 14:26.490
Say her name.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.993
You know what? Maybe we should all just
take a minute-- Okay.

14:29.076 --> 14:32.079
-Did killing Harlan bring Claire back?
-Did protecting him bring Sissy back?

14:32.162 --> 14:34.415
-It was just as personal for you--
-I didn't kill anyone!

14:34.498 --> 14:38.794
But you risked everyone!
Do you know what that felt like?

14:38.878 --> 14:42.006
Watching you fight harder to protect
the man who helped destroy my daughter

14:42.089 --> 14:43.632
than you ever did to bring her back?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.634
I don't know how to bring Claire back.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.596
Okay? No one does.
But I was there for you.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.723
-I tried. I was--
-To what?

14:50.806 --> 14:51.891
Help me grieve?

14:52.600 --> 14:55.769
God, this whole family is so quick
to tell me to suck up my pain

14:55.853 --> 14:57.813
and so worried about fixing yours!

14:58.397 --> 14:59.815
Somebody had to pay

14:59.899 --> 15:01.650
because you never seem to.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.904
Destroy the world,
kill Pogo, almost kill me,

15:04.987 --> 15:05.821
and for what?

15:05.905 --> 15:08.407
So we can all run around
and clean up your mess?

15:08.490 --> 15:09.533
I'm sick of it.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.993
Take it easy, Allison.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.914
-Okay, I--
-Shut your mouth!

15:14.997 --> 15:15.998
Allison.

15:17.708 --> 15:21.837
Every time I build a new life for myself,

15:21.921 --> 15:25.758
you end the world and take it from me!

15:25.841 --> 15:28.093
How are you doing this
without saying, "I heard a rumor"?

15:28.177 --> 15:30.971
Just a little residual gift from Harlan.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.265
All right, that's it.
Knock off the power shit, Allison.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.809
-It's not okay!

15:40.689 --> 15:43.484
We should have left you in the basement.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.860
Whoa! Allison, all right!

15:55.621 --> 15:56.455
You okay?

15:57.581 --> 15:58.415
I'm fine.

16:00.876 --> 16:01.919
Let's continue.

16:02.419 --> 16:03.253
Sweet.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.172
You guys fight just like us.

16:06.632 --> 16:07.633
Nah, man.

16:09.510 --> 16:10.928
We don't fight like this.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.835
So tell me.
What do we like to do together?

17:24.918 --> 17:26.086
For fun.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.006
I don't understand the question.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.300
Didn't we take any family trips
in your timeline?

17:31.383 --> 17:32.384
With our dad?

17:32.468 --> 17:33.844
Hell no.

17:33.927 --> 17:36.180
That guy put the "dick" in dictator.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.766
No, no. It was all about
the missions with him.

17:38.849 --> 17:39.892
Just mission after mission…

17:39.975 --> 17:42.519
How is it you don't understand
the first thing about your powers?

17:42.603 --> 17:44.188
Did you learn nothing at the Academy?

17:44.271 --> 17:48.025
Well, things kinda went sideways
at the ol' Academy early on.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.151
How so?

17:50.360 --> 17:52.362
Five got lost in time.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.615
Just… gone.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.618
Ben died during the Jennifer incident.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.204
-Tragic.
-Oh, tragic? I'm not finished.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.748
You drugged your daughter. For years.

18:02.831 --> 18:07.461
You turned Luther
into a half-monkey moonboy freak thing.

18:07.544 --> 18:10.714
You locked me in a box full of ghosts.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.966
And then you killed yourself

18:13.050 --> 18:15.677
so that none of us
would ever get any answers.

18:15.761 --> 18:16.595
I see.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.932
What I'm saying is,
you were a terrible father.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.476
-Yes. Picked that up. Thank you.
-Good.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.853
-High time I made it up to you.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.814
-Starting now.

18:26.897 --> 18:30.442
You just murdered me
and stuffed me in the trunk of your car.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.529
-I have notes, Dad.
-Let's not quibble over details.

18:33.612 --> 18:34.530
A new proposal.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.240
I help you master your powers,

18:36.323 --> 18:38.867
you stop blaming me
for the sins of your other father.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.744
Allow us a new start.

18:42.830 --> 18:47.126
All right, but I told you,
I can't control how long I'm dead.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.461
It's just one of those
mystery-of-life things.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.379
Nonsense.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.965
-Dying well is a skill like any other.
-I'm telling you…

18:53.048 --> 18:55.884
You simply need the right coach.
Do you trust me?

18:58.804 --> 19:00.639
Yeah. I trust you.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.232
Near-immortality
is an unbelievable gift.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.693
Yet, you come back to life
at unpredictable intervals

19:12.776 --> 19:15.737
outside of your control,
with the reflexes of a wet noodle.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.282
Thoroughly unable to defend yourself
or your team.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.993
Somehow, you've turned an asset
into your liability.

19:21.076 --> 19:24.663
Yeah, well, not that I care
about your opinion,

19:24.746 --> 19:27.624
but if I were to improve myself,

19:28.667 --> 19:29.668
how would I do it?

19:29.751 --> 19:33.922
First, let's sharpen your reflexes.
Practice makes perfect.

19:34.006 --> 19:34.840
Stand there.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.718
When you're fast enough
to catch this ball,

19:37.801 --> 19:39.219
you will have succeeded.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.306
Why not? Okay.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.932
But just so you know,

19:44.016 --> 19:46.727
I have the hand-eye coordination
of a drunk kitten.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.354
See?

19:49.438 --> 19:50.439
Ha-ha!

19:56.153 --> 19:59.156
Klaus Hargreeves.
Reanimation training.

19:59.656 --> 20:02.451
Trial commencing 1:15 p.m.

20:12.711 --> 20:16.256
Reanimation after death,
eighteen minutes, six seconds.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.888
You tricked me.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.973
See? Too slow!

20:25.057 --> 20:26.058
Again!

20:26.141 --> 20:29.019
You're a terrible father!

20:29.102 --> 20:30.395
Again! Catch!

20:36.693 --> 20:38.654
Eleven minutes and six seconds.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.864
Better, but not good enough.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.867
Concentrate, Klaus.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.577
You can do it. Again!

20:50.290 --> 20:52.876
Nine minutes
and twenty seconds.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.587
It hurts.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.720
I think
you're getting the hang of it, boy!

21:09.101 --> 21:10.477
Again!

21:17.818 --> 21:19.611
I think I figured this out.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.867
-Six minutes.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.371
-Four minutes.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.707
Two minutes. Excellent!

21:34.459 --> 21:36.295
-Faster. Faster!

21:36.378 --> 21:37.796
-Faster.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.770
See? Never doubted you.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.356
Now you're ready.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.153
Ready for what?

22:26.887 --> 22:28.096
Beautiful, isn't it?

22:29.264 --> 22:30.432
Oh, wow.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.101
That's what took Stanley.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.312
Along with a few other billion people.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.357
Yeah, who I didn't know
and don't care about.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.567
Right. So it's all about you.

22:40.650 --> 22:41.943
All of us are irrelevant.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.987
This thing's gonna take
the whole damn universe.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.238
What is it made of?

22:45.322 --> 22:48.200
Micro black holes collapsing
at increasingly short intervals.

22:48.283 --> 22:50.952
-Why aren't we getting sucked inside?
-We don't know.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.163
You shouldn't exist here,
and neither should this.

22:53.246 --> 22:56.124
An impossibility
for an impossibility.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.835
The universe is a sucker for balance.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.880
Grace has been tracking the waves.
Next one is due in three hours.

23:01.963 --> 23:03.924
-All right, so what do we do?
-We trap it.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.301
-Dyson sphere?
-Yeah.

23:07.511 --> 23:08.762
Okay.

23:09.262 --> 23:10.514
Confinement factor?

23:11.348 --> 23:13.475
0.98 at peak energy flux.

23:13.558 --> 23:14.643
Tensile strength?

23:14.726 --> 23:16.728
UTS ceiling
of 10,000 gigapascals.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.147
-Should I be finding this hot?
-No!

23:19.231 --> 23:21.775
-What do you think, Five?
-Could work.

23:21.858 --> 23:23.568
Or we could all die horribly.

23:27.489 --> 23:28.323
I'm in.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.659
-You're not the one we need.
-Excuse you?

23:30.742 --> 23:34.830
For this to work,
we need Sloane, Lila, Christopher, and--

23:34.913 --> 23:35.914
Viktor.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.417
Of course.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.351
<i>You're family, Viktor.</i>

23:57.769 --> 23:58.895
And there's nothing…

23:59.813 --> 24:02.107
nothing that would make me love you less.

24:10.740 --> 24:13.493
What… Whatever it is you came to say,

24:14.202 --> 24:16.705
I'm not coming down to help
if Allison's still there.

24:18.331 --> 24:19.958
Just came to get my jacket.

24:21.543 --> 24:26.423
Have you been waiting for someone
to come chase after you this whole time?

24:27.299 --> 24:28.633
Wow!

24:29.134 --> 24:30.510
That's so embarrassing.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.264
Well, it's official. Our Ben was better.

24:34.806 --> 24:35.932
So I'm told.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.018
But didn't he die?

24:38.935 --> 24:42.939
You know, people say we have egos,
but you're the real messy bitches.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.692
Letting the world burn
because you're angry at your sister?

24:45.775 --> 24:46.735
Outstanding.

24:46.818 --> 24:49.154
-That's not what I'm doing.
-Don't care.

24:49.237 --> 24:50.530
Won't matter much longer anyway.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.658
In a few days,
we'll all be, uh, Kugel-toast.

24:54.367 --> 24:57.787
And I guess
Harlan will have died for nothing.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.290
Nice work.

25:03.543 --> 25:07.005
Stop crying on my bedsheets, emo.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.466
It's gross.

25:36.826 --> 25:40.247
Come on. I thought we were gonna go home.

25:42.457 --> 25:45.544
You have a gift
you refuse to fully use.

25:46.169 --> 25:49.089
Tell me. Why do you, of all people,
fear the dead?

25:49.172 --> 25:50.006
Oh, I don't know.

25:50.090 --> 25:53.426
Maybe because some asshole
in the real world locked me

25:53.510 --> 25:58.014
in a box of ghosts as a kid,
as a little kid.

25:58.098 --> 26:01.893
Exactly! We can't change the past,
but we can confront it.

26:03.478 --> 26:06.356
Here, your gift became your nightmare.

26:06.439 --> 26:09.359
A man is not a man
until he slays the demons of his youth.

26:09.442 --> 26:13.947
Oh yeah. Good one, Obi-Wang,
but my demons are literal.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.991
All the more reason to face them.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.745
You lost something vital here.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.500
It's time you take it back.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.194
Just champagne.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.530
Absolute wankers.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.369
Speaking of wankers, uh…

27:02.120 --> 27:05.457
Any inside tips
on how to get your stupid brother to

27:07.208 --> 27:08.335
accept my apology?

27:10.420 --> 27:12.088
People don't want apologies.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.715
They want confessions.

27:13.798 --> 27:16.926
They want you to stand there
and list the shitty ways you've hurt them

27:17.010 --> 27:18.219
so they know you understand.

27:19.304 --> 27:22.057
Unless you're Viktor,
in which case nothing's ever good enough.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.935
Yeah. That was a bit exciting.

27:26.519 --> 27:29.356
Um, how do you feel about all of…

27:30.190 --> 27:31.191
Fine.

27:31.941 --> 27:34.611
I prefer the hoppy bitterness
of a good Guinness.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.868
You know, I thought killing Harlan
would make me feel better.

27:42.661 --> 27:43.703
Or worse.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.248
Jesus, just something.

27:47.749 --> 27:48.750
But

27:50.210 --> 27:51.252
it didn't.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.924
Or maybe you're feeling everything
all at once,

27:56.007 --> 27:58.635
and it all just kind of cancels out.

28:00.095 --> 28:03.473
No, I think I'm finally starting
to understand everything.

28:04.557 --> 28:05.558
How do you mean?

28:07.977 --> 28:10.397
Well, the way I see it,
in a few days, we'll all be dead.

28:10.897 --> 28:13.525
Or in some new timeline

28:13.608 --> 28:16.277
where Harlan
probably never even existed anyway.

28:21.074 --> 28:24.369
It's all bullshit.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.372
I mean, none of it… none of it's real.

28:29.833 --> 28:30.834
Nothing stays.

28:31.376 --> 28:34.462
Shit. You've got the spins.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.592
Okay, look.

28:41.386 --> 28:46.182
Fapping about with time travel,
it's a massive head trip, I grant you, but

28:47.308 --> 28:49.269
things <i>are</i> still real.

28:49.352 --> 28:52.105
They're just moving by so fast,

28:52.188 --> 28:54.441
you get dizzy with the changes.

28:54.524 --> 28:56.484
It's like figure skaters

28:56.568 --> 29:00.864
and their… their triple Salchow
doggy-style… whatever it is,

29:00.947 --> 29:02.657
you gotta pick a focus point.

29:03.533 --> 29:06.661
Something concrete to lock on to,

29:08.455 --> 29:10.457
no matter what changes around you.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.586
And what if I had one, and I lost her?

29:18.089 --> 29:19.424
Then find another one.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.051
Or you'll fall down.

29:28.224 --> 29:29.225
We're ready.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.527
Okay, how do we start?

29:40.111 --> 29:42.197
Have you ever moved a nest of bees?

29:42.864 --> 29:44.491
No, because that's weird.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.034
You can't just pick it up.

29:46.117 --> 29:49.037
You have to keep the nest calm
while you build a box around it,

29:49.120 --> 29:50.163
and then you trap it.

30:02.091 --> 30:05.178
One of those black holes inside
is vibrating at a different rate.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.138
-I can feel them.
-Good.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.307
Whatever happens,
don't let them speed up or change,

30:09.390 --> 30:10.475
or everything will blow.

30:10.558 --> 30:12.477
Don't shake the bees. Got it.

30:18.900 --> 30:22.487
Lila, when you're ready,
do exactly like Viktor.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.328
Hey, what's she doing?

30:30.411 --> 30:32.622
Using its own gravity to condense it.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.543
That's pretty cool, huh?

30:48.096 --> 30:51.432
You didn't tell me
you were building a prison for God.

30:52.016 --> 30:52.851
Mom?

30:53.726 --> 30:56.145
You have no right to do that.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.565
We're a little busy here, Grace.

30:59.315 --> 31:02.402
The day of vengeance
was in my heart…

31:04.279 --> 31:05.947
What are you talking about?

31:06.030 --> 31:09.492
…and my year of redemption hath come.

31:11.202 --> 31:12.871
-Shit!

31:12.954 --> 31:15.456
The day of vengeance was in my heart,

31:15.540 --> 31:19.168
and my year of redemption hath come.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.147
Get it together.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.944
Get it together, you coward--

32:02.295 --> 32:03.671
Shit!

32:11.220 --> 32:12.847
Hey, Mom, Mom, Mom!

32:13.848 --> 32:15.767
It's Diego. Don't make us hurt you.

32:16.476 --> 32:19.145
-The day of vengeance was in my heart…
-Whoa!

32:19.228 --> 32:21.689
…and my year of redemption
hath come!

32:22.357 --> 32:23.691
Lila, I need you.

32:32.158 --> 32:33.159
Nothing personal.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.456
Okay.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.030
Christopher, now!

33:21.165 --> 33:22.041
Over here!

33:25.461 --> 33:28.006
Quickly. What are you afraid of?

33:28.089 --> 33:29.799
-The face-eating ghosts?
-No.

33:29.882 --> 33:31.843
You're afraid of failure
so you refuse to even try.

33:31.926 --> 33:34.262
Because you'd rather quit than disappoint.

33:34.345 --> 33:36.097
-Disappoint who?
-Me.

33:37.640 --> 33:38.725
In any timeline,

33:38.808 --> 33:41.894
I am simply far too brilliant a teacher
to have left you so untutored.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.938
Conclusion, it was no accident.

33:44.022 --> 33:48.151
I made you children feel small,
confused about your own powers

33:48.234 --> 33:49.318
so that I could control you.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.654
What? Why would you…
Why would you do that?

33:51.738 --> 33:53.740
Never mind that now. Focus!

33:53.823 --> 33:55.283
I witnessed you today.

33:55.366 --> 33:58.369
Inside that overly manicured exterior,

33:58.453 --> 34:00.329
you are a warrior.

34:00.413 --> 34:03.041
It's these spirits that should fear <i>you.</i>

34:03.124 --> 34:05.251
-How do I fight them?
-I don't know.

34:05.334 --> 34:07.420
But I believe with all of my heart

34:07.503 --> 34:08.713
that you do.

34:09.630 --> 34:10.465
Show them.

34:11.424 --> 34:13.926
Be everything
I was afraid to let you become.

34:15.511 --> 34:16.554
Okay.

34:18.598 --> 34:19.682
Okay.

34:24.437 --> 34:26.105
Okay, fine. I'll do it.

35:10.066 --> 35:13.569
Well, aren't you a miracle?

35:58.156 --> 35:59.240
Did it work?

36:00.366 --> 36:03.828
Next Kugelwave in three, two,

36:05.079 --> 36:06.455
one.

37:40.883 --> 37:42.343
Are you avoiding me?

37:43.886 --> 37:45.721
-Busted.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.188
My travel guide?

37:55.273 --> 37:57.316
I, uh, made you a new list.

37:58.109 --> 38:01.821
It's all your favorite Italian monuments
that are still left standing,

38:02.571 --> 38:04.699
color-coded by region, of course.

38:06.325 --> 38:07.326
Nerd.

38:07.952 --> 38:11.330
Well, you just saved the world.
You deserve to finally see it.

38:14.875 --> 38:17.837
And… I'd like to see it with you.

38:25.428 --> 38:26.429
I, um…

38:27.263 --> 38:28.306
I made it myself.

38:28.389 --> 38:31.058
I couldn't exactly find a diamond
on short notice,

38:31.142 --> 38:33.644
but the stone is moon rock.

38:34.812 --> 38:36.689
Um, I brought it back with me,

38:36.772 --> 38:38.899
and I've kind of been keeping it
for a special occasion,

38:38.983 --> 38:40.443
and, well, I--

38:40.526 --> 38:41.944
Luther, it's beautiful.

38:55.791 --> 38:56.709
Sloane,

38:58.586 --> 38:59.712
will you marry me?

39:47.927 --> 39:49.678
Sorry about your robot mum.

39:49.762 --> 39:52.723
-She wasn't my real one.
-Okay.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.435
Sorry I lied to you about Stanley.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.355
I miss him too, you know.

39:59.438 --> 40:01.816
I liked that little shit
and his wonky ears.

40:04.568 --> 40:05.820
He deserved better.

40:05.903 --> 40:07.613
Yeah, he did.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.579
Do you know why I brought him to you?

40:15.663 --> 40:17.289
Because you're a sociopath?

40:17.915 --> 40:18.916
No.

40:21.043 --> 40:22.336
Because I'm a coward.

40:23.629 --> 40:26.340
Dropping a kid in your lap
and seeing if you'd reject us and run

40:26.424 --> 40:28.759
felt safer than telling you the truth.

40:30.219 --> 40:31.053
Which is?

40:34.181 --> 40:35.433
I'm pregnant, Diego.

40:42.231 --> 40:43.232
Diego.

40:44.316 --> 40:45.693
I'm pregnant.

40:48.279 --> 40:52.199
I'll pee on whatever stick you want later,
but for now, please, can you just…

41:04.044 --> 41:06.088
My mum put a bullet in my heart.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.007
Did you know that?

41:08.090 --> 41:11.093
Yeah. Five told me. How did you know?

41:11.177 --> 41:12.261
Infinite Switchboard.

41:14.346 --> 41:17.349
I missed your stupid face,
so I snuck in to get a glimpse of you.

41:17.433 --> 41:18.559
And instead…

41:22.646 --> 41:23.647
Thing is,

41:24.982 --> 41:28.569
I'm not gonna be very good
at this… mother thing.

41:29.361 --> 41:30.613
Apples and trees.

41:31.614 --> 41:34.366
But I saw you with Stan,
and you're a good dad.

41:39.163 --> 41:40.998
What do you want from me, Lila?

41:42.917 --> 41:43.751
Okay.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.503
Truth?

41:50.132 --> 41:52.051
I think you should run from me.

41:54.553 --> 41:55.638
I, um…

41:59.308 --> 42:01.018
I think I'm a bloody mess.

42:01.977 --> 42:06.524
And I think that someone who's…
who never had a family

42:06.607 --> 42:08.692
is in no position to ask for one.

42:10.694 --> 42:12.071
But that's what I want.

42:14.532 --> 42:15.574
With you.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.585
Can I think about it?

42:31.215 --> 42:32.299
Yeah.

42:32.883 --> 42:33.884
Of course.

42:47.481 --> 42:49.441
Hey, want some company?

42:50.568 --> 42:51.610
Sure.

42:52.653 --> 42:53.612
Okay.

42:56.323 --> 42:58.200
Hey, that was really nice of you.

42:59.451 --> 43:01.453
Kill Mom so Diego didn't have to.

43:02.246 --> 43:05.499
My God. We are a weird family, aren't we?

43:06.834 --> 43:09.628
Sorry. Yeah, I heard it as I said it.

43:09.712 --> 43:10.546
It's all right.

43:19.096 --> 43:21.181
What are we gonna do about Allison?

43:22.224 --> 43:24.602
We're all worried about Allison, but

43:25.853 --> 43:27.146
I'm scared for you.

43:27.896 --> 43:28.856
Seriously?

43:30.608 --> 43:32.693
-Yeah.
-She killed someone.

43:32.776 --> 43:35.112
I was trying to do the right thing
and save Harlan's life.

43:35.195 --> 43:37.990
Do you know why I wanted this last jump
to work so badly?

43:38.073 --> 43:39.491
Because you're old and tired?

43:39.575 --> 43:41.744
Because I slaughtered
a boardroom full of people

43:41.827 --> 43:43.412
to buy our way back here.

43:46.165 --> 43:47.166
Shit.

43:50.669 --> 43:53.005
Little advice from someone
who's been there?

43:54.298 --> 43:55.674
Don't do the math.

43:56.842 --> 43:58.844
That equation does not exist.

43:59.595 --> 44:03.932
There's no "save five Harlans
for every two Claires" formula.

44:04.642 --> 44:07.144
People like us, we will never

44:08.270 --> 44:11.523
save enough lives
to make up for the ones that we take.

44:13.442 --> 44:14.735
I don't accept that.

44:14.818 --> 44:16.153
Then you'll drown.

44:16.654 --> 44:20.824
This is the price of being powerful.
Sometimes we step on ants.

44:22.785 --> 44:26.413
And the sooner you face that,
the safer we'll all be.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.290
What is that supposed to mean?

44:29.291 --> 44:32.586
It means you're very dangerous,
Viktor Hargreeves.

44:33.462 --> 44:36.507
The decisions you make
impact the entire world.

44:37.383 --> 44:40.719
So no matter how benevolent they may seem,

44:41.303 --> 44:43.263
you don't get to make them alone.

44:47.851 --> 44:50.813
You know what they call
a superhero who works alone

44:51.480 --> 44:53.107
and doesn't listen to anybody?

44:54.692 --> 44:56.026
A villain.

44:58.612 --> 44:59.905
I am not a villain, Five.

44:59.988 --> 45:02.658
And, Viktor,
I hope to God you never will be.

45:03.992 --> 45:05.703
But that remains to be seen.

45:10.457 --> 45:12.000
No more going rogue.

45:13.001 --> 45:15.754
If you ever need anything,
I'm always here for you.

45:17.381 --> 45:19.258
But lie to us again…

45:21.719 --> 45:23.554
Viktor, I'll kill you myself.

45:30.602 --> 45:33.605
I'm glad we made peace. It all worked out.

45:33.689 --> 45:34.690
Yeah.

45:36.150 --> 45:38.318
But we're definitely killing them
in the morning, right?

45:40.279 --> 45:42.197
And Chris has dibs on knife boy.

45:42.281 --> 45:43.866
No one is killing anyone.

45:44.450 --> 45:45.534
Why not?

45:45.617 --> 45:49.705
We followed your plan,
merged the families, saved the world.

45:49.788 --> 45:51.999
-We don't need them anymore.
-I'm not done yet.

45:52.082 --> 45:53.417
Done what?

45:54.126 --> 45:55.836
That's between me and Dad.

45:58.630 --> 45:59.798
You made a deal with Dad?

46:01.133 --> 46:02.134
Maybe.

46:04.928 --> 46:05.846
Fine. I'm done.

46:05.929 --> 46:07.222
-Sit down.
-No.

46:07.306 --> 46:09.516
We don't recognize your authority anymore.

46:09.600 --> 46:13.395
You're a terrible leader
with no loyalty to anyone but yourself.

46:13.479 --> 46:15.606
<i>You</i> don't speak for Christopher.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.777
-Really, dude?

46:19.860 --> 46:22.488
I'm Number One.
You'll do as I say when I say it.

46:22.571 --> 46:23.530
Not anymore.

46:24.990 --> 46:26.909
Here's to a new life
without this dickhead.

46:39.630 --> 46:41.173
Christopher, what's wrong?

46:46.094 --> 46:47.346
Back away, Fei.

46:47.429 --> 46:50.516
Chris, it's going to be okay.

46:50.599 --> 46:52.810
-Fei!
-I'm going to help you. Just--

47:01.819 --> 47:03.403
Oh my God! Luther!

47:05.197 --> 47:06.949
We gotta go. Now.

47:09.576 --> 47:10.661
We gotta get out!

47:10.744 --> 47:12.037
Wait. Ben!

47:16.375 --> 47:17.209
Run!
