00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:28.771
Oh no!

177
00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:30.981
I always wanna look good
for the paparazzi.

178
00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:33.693
so this is a job for Toss N' Wash.

179
00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:37.238
the no-nonsense. petroleum.
and artificial dye-free detergent...

180
00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:38.948
- Cut!
- What?

181
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.116
Cut.

182
00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:41.450
What is wrong now?

183
00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.661
Uh. nothing's wrong.
We lost the monitors. Stand by!

184
00:11:43.744 --> 00:11:45.413
Wait. I have a hard out at noon.

185
00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:47.373
You're shitting me. Noon?

186
00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:50.292
Don't put this on me. I told Jill.
I have to pick up my daughter.

187
00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:53.421
- I'm taking her to a party.
- You don't have somebody who can do that?

188
00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:57.258
Can somebody get me my phone?

189
00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:00.469
Hey. hey. hey.
Hold your horses. madam. Not yet.

190
00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:02.304
Uncle Klaus...

191
00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.148
Start ignoring
the rules of the road.

192
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:06.100
next. the whole world goes to anarchy.

193
00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.477
Trust me on this. Claire.

194
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.190
And now we go.

195
00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:14.650
Quick. quick. quick! Fast.

196
00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:15.985
You are such a pussy.

197
00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:19.572
Do you have any idea how many pedestrians
are killed annually in this country?

198
00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:20.573
Watch the puddle.

199
00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:23.033
- 6.977.
- ...977.

200
00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:24.243
That's correct.

201
00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:28.330
One minute you're alive.
and then the next. poof. you're dead.

202
00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:31.041
Forever. That's not what we want. right?

203
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:34.920
I wanna get home before climate change
ends the world as we know it.

204
00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:36.255
Well. yeah.

205
00:12:36.338 --> 00:12:37.256
Ew. ew.

206
00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:40.968
Secondhand smoke. three o'clock.
Come over here. Stay on this side.

207
00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:44.555
You're fine. Uncle Klaus.

208
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:49.852
Yeah. I know. I... I'm fine.
You'll be fine. We'll all be fine.

209
00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.188
My name is Gus.

210
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.856
Hi. Gus.

211
00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:56.567
I've been searching for the truth
my whole life.

212
00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.153
Then I found this group.

213
00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:02.239
And it was like a lightbulb went off.

214
00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:06.535
For the first time. I heard people
talking about what I was going through.

215
00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:09.789
- Exactly.
- I realized there's nothing wrong with me.

216
00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:13.250
- It's this timeline. man.
- Yeah.

217
00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:15.336
It's screwed up!

218
00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:18.672
- I know I can come here and say anything.
- Yeah.

219
00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:22.384
I... I could say Sir Reginald Hargreeves
is actually an alien

220
00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:25.721
who is secretly grooming
a cabal of teenage super soldiers.

221
00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:28.891
and all you guys actually know
what I'm talking about.

222
00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:30.684
Keep going.

223
00:13:32.102 --> 00:13:33.102
And now.

224
00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:35.356
I have hope.

225
00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.984
'Cause I know a cleanse is coming.

226
00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:40.486
- Yes.
- Amen.

227
00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:48.077
Thank you. Gus. Thank you.

228
00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:54.166
How about you?
Got anything you wanna share?

229
00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:57.961
Yeah. sure.

230
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.298
Hi. my name's Jerome.

231
00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:03.300
Hi. Jerome.

232
00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:06.512
I'm still new to all this.

233
00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:10.015
but I can tell you folks.
what you're talking about is real.

234
00:14:11.308 --> 00:14:13.310
You're not crazy.

235
00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:15.938
I know because I've been
to other timelines.

236
00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.859
I don't look it. but I'm 63.

237
00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:24.446
I spent 45 years
lost in a future apocalypse.

238
00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:28.200
And I was involved
in the Kennedy assassination.

239
00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:29.743
Speak your truth.

240
00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:31.704
All that's unraveling now.

241
00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.832
I don't know what's real
and what's not anymore.

242
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:38.043
I feel like I can't trust anybody.

243
00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.923
All I know is I'm glad
to have found all of you.

244
00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:46.385
That's it. That's all I got.

245
00:14:46.468 --> 00:14:47.845
It's okay.

246
00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:50.723
Good share.

247
00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:55.895
You wanna hear some real shit. kid?

248
00:14:56.687 --> 00:14:58.355
I'll take you to a real meeting.

249
00:15:06.363 --> 00:15:07.656
You're late.

250
00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.740
I know.

251
00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:10.826
Mustache.

252
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:11.910
Right.

253
00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:16.790
He's waiting in his office.

254
00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.963
The Keepers function
mainly as a support group.

255
00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:25.341
but with strong cult-like tendencies.

256
00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:28.969
Membership is rapidly growing
across all metro areas in the US.

257
00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:30.053
as well as Europe.

258
00:15:30.846 --> 00:15:32.598
It's all there in my report. sir.

259
00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:34.683
What's the organizing principle?

260
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.480
They believe we're all somehow stuck
in the wrong timeline.

261
00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:44.944
Well... just a bunch of loony tunes.
if you ask me.

262
00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:48.364
Drop this Keeper nonsense. Move on.

263
00:15:49.573 --> 00:15:52.117
I think it's time you got back
to your other cases.

264
00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.578
Ladybug. Panama. Chicken Wing.

265
00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.915
- Sir. I am making progress with this.
- Now. you listen to me.

266
00:15:57.998 --> 00:16:00.751
You have the makings of a fantastic spook.

267
00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:03.212
A suspicious mind.

268
00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:05.422
A love of complexity and detail.

269
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.051
A certain maturity
that most of my young agents lack.

270
00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:13.514
Play your cards right.
you'll be running this place someday.

271
00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:16.892
Thank you for saying that. sir.

272
00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:21.230
Hey. buddy!

273
00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:26.860
Ah. it's good to see ya!
How long's it been. huh? About four years?

274
00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:28.779
Minus six months for good behavior.

275
00:16:28.862 --> 00:16:31.782
Well. you better keep that up
now that we're roommates.

276
00:16:31.865 --> 00:16:35.452
The only reason I called you is because
I need a fixed address for my probation.

277
00:16:35.536 --> 00:16:36.954
and the feds seized my apartment.

278
00:16:37.621 --> 00:16:41.083
Well. whatever the reason.
the universe brought us together.

279
00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:42.584
and I think that's fun.

280
00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:43.668
Come on. Let's go.

281
00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:55.848
Claire? Klaus?

282
00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:56.932
Anybody home?

283
00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:58.516
Hello?

284
00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:04.857
<i>Another catastrophic weather event.</i>

285
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.776
You do realize
that we have a TV upstairs. right?

286
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:12.364
Hey. Klaus. are you going
to the thing today?

287
00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:13.490
What thing?

288
00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:16.285
Diego and Lila's thing.
It's little Grace's birthday party.

289
00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:17.911
- Not a chance.
- Please?

290
00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:20.873
I need somebody to take Claire.
She's sleeping over at her cousins'.

291
00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:22.583
- I'm not going.
- Yes. you are.

292
00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:25.419
Allison. attending an all-day event

293
00:17:25.502 --> 00:17:29.715
with problematic family members
and alcoholic beverages?

294
00:17:30.424 --> 00:17:34.386
I mean. that's a one-way ticket
to "Trigger Town. USA." if you ask me.

295
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.388
I'm just gonna stay down here in my room.

296
00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:38.307
Okay. Klaus?

297
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:39.224
Yes.

298
00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:43.187
You have been sober for three years.
Give yourself a little credit. all right?

299
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.354
You can handle this.

300
00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:49.193
Your faith in me is very undeserved.
But. hey. why don't you take Claire Bear?

301
00:17:49.276 --> 00:17:52.196
I can't. I have a big callback tomorrow.
I need to prepare.

302
00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:54.198
Oh. which one again?

303
00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:57.076
The <i>Wichita PD</i> pilot.

304
00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:58.494
<i>Wichita PD.</i>

305
00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:00.162
Sounds gripping.

306
00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:04.458
It's a really big part. Claire.
and it's between me and one other woman.

307
00:18:04.541 --> 00:18:07.461
This is important. I can't keep doing
laundry detergent commercials.

308
00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:11.965
All right. Fine. But you owe me. big-time.

309
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:13.467
Thank you. Lunch. Come on.

310
00:18:14.134 --> 00:18:14.968
Not hungry.

311
00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:16.637
You never eat.

312
00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:19.139
- Like you give a shit.
- Whoa!

313
00:18:19.223 --> 00:18:20.891
Excuse me! Claire!

314
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.600
Claire!

315
00:18:23.685 --> 00:18:25.813
Would it make you feel better
to remind you

316
00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:28.398
that we were exactly like that at her age?

317
00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:30.483
No.

318
00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:44.540
- Where the hell are we?
- Come on. I got a surprise for you.

319
00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:46.917
It's a. uh. little welcome-home gift.

320
00:18:53.882 --> 00:18:55.509
Yeah. don't worry about it.

321
00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:05.018
- No. no. no!
- Oh. come on. Don't be such a sourpuss.

322
00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:08.272
Look. it'll be good for you to reconnect
with the family after all these years.

323
00:19:08.355 --> 00:19:10.607
Hey. this is not my family.
My family's dead.

324
00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:11.859
Remember? The Sparrows?

325
00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:12.942
Fine.

326
00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.236
Either come inside.

327
00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:17.322
or I'm gonna tell your parole officer
you missed your curfew.

328
00:19:18.365 --> 00:19:22.286
You have to at least stay for cake.
No one leaves before cake. Ben.

329
00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:28.333
Hey. sorry. Excuse me.

330
00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:31.420
What are you doing?

331
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.256
- Cake.
- We haven't even done the piñata.

332
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.385
Piñata first. then cake.
What the hell is wrong with you?

333
00:19:40.053 --> 00:19:43.140
What was it?
A Ponzi scheme? White-collar fraud?

334
00:19:43.765 --> 00:19:44.975
Crypto exchange.

335
00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:46.476
Web 3.0. baby.

336
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.729
Feds only went after me
because I'm an outsider.

337
00:19:48.812 --> 00:19:50.439
A fucking maverick like Elon.

338
00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:53.358
Well. that and you bankrupted
100.000 people.

339
00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:54.776
The whole thing was a witch hunt.

340
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.530
Yeah. well. say what you will.
It's still good to have you back. Cheers.

341
00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:02.868
Ha-ha!

342
00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:04.036
Gotcha!

343
00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:08.540
Come on. It's been years
since we've been together like this.

344
00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:10.792
Ever think maybe
there's a good reason for that?

345
00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.085
Where's Viktor?

346
00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:14.046
Oh. uh. he said he was coming.

347
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:18.800
- What about Allison?
- Oh. well. she's usually a no-show. right?

348
00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:21.011
Maybe it's better that way.

349
00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:24.181
Survived another one.
Congratulations. everybody.

350
00:20:24.264 --> 00:20:27.517
All right. Please call me
before you go to bed.

351
00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:28.435
Yes.

352
00:20:28.518 --> 00:20:32.022
Why don't you come on in?
Just for one little slice of cake.

353
00:20:32.522 --> 00:20:34.682
We've already talked about this.
Nobody wants me there.

354
00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:37.236
- That's not true. Not true.
- It is.

355
00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:39.571
- Even if it wasn't. I have lines to learn.
- All right.

356
00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:42.616
Well. I'll tell everybody you said hello.

357
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:55.754
The money's decent.
and I make my own hours. so there's that.

358
00:20:55.837 --> 00:21:00.175
But my team supervisor is a real dickhead.
He's always riding the stick.

359
00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:01.301
Yeah. that seems tough.

360
00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:04.346
Most importantly.
it's just a waste of my God-given talents.

361
00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:06.640
When do you think
I'll be hearing back from the agency?

362
00:21:06.723 --> 00:21:08.934
- Sorry?
- The CIA. bro.

363
00:21:09.017 --> 00:21:10.936
- You gave 'em my résumé. right?
- Right.

364
00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:13.957
- That's heading up the ladder as we speak.
- That's what I'm talking about!

365
00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:15.857
You told 'em I know multiple disciplines?

366
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:19.236
Hand-to-hand. Karate. Aikido.
Hapkido. Krav Maga. Jujitsu.

367
00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:21.029
Muay Thai. Kendo. Sambo...

368
00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.156
Diego. I let 'em know. I told 'em.

369
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.452
...in a panic. you can't get to.
so that's my new thing I'm trying out.

370
00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:29.079
Hey. whoa! Hold your horses.

371
00:21:29.162 --> 00:21:31.665
Just wait for your Uncle Klaus
to get situated

372
00:21:31.748 --> 00:21:35.043
because right now. it feels like
he's about to hyperventilate.

373
00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:38.088
Hey. Did I forget
to pack my little brown bag?

374
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:39.548
- Claire! Come on!
- You're fine.

375
00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:43.093
- It's just a six-year-old's party.
- You're right. You're always right.

376
00:21:43.176 --> 00:21:46.638
It's obnoxious. Put that on the table.
and don't touch anything sharp.

377
00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:49.850
- Soles of the feet.
- Klaus?

378
00:21:49.933 --> 00:21:51.727
- Hey. buddy!
- Hey.

379
00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.770
Good to see ya! Come here!

380
00:21:54.896 --> 00:21:57.691
Sorry. Don't touch. <i>Spasibo.</i>

381
00:21:57.774 --> 00:21:59.026
Right. yeah. of course.

382
00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:01.695
He is a germaphobe now
and extremely sober. Hi. Klaus.

383
00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:03.530
Benjamin!

384
00:22:03.613 --> 00:22:04.781
Klaus.

385
00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:06.867
Wha... When did you get out?

386
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:07.826
About an hour ago.

387
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:11.371
but I'm strongly considering
robbing a bank to get back in.

388
00:22:13.582 --> 00:22:18.295
Yeah. but just give me a second. Okay.
Hey. let go of her! Sorry. excuse me. Hey.

389
00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:20.672
What are you doing? Just string it up.

390
00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:23.133
You said you were
on the west side this morning?

391
00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:26.720
Yeah. I dropped off the kids.
and I picked up the piñata. So what?

392
00:22:26.803 --> 00:22:28.430
So this is an east side piñata.

393
00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:29.514
Excuse me?

394
00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:31.433
This is clearly an east side piñata.

395
00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:33.435
Check out the craftsmanship. the fringe.

396
00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:36.897
Okay. listen. we needed a piñata.
so I got a piñata.

397
00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.942
And right now. we need more soda.
so please. can you hurry up?

398
00:22:42.319 --> 00:22:43.820
Where were you this morning?

399
00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:47.115
Fine. I'll get it myself.

400
00:22:48.408 --> 00:22:50.744
Yeah?
All right. I'll go get her.

401
00:22:53.413 --> 00:22:55.457
Bye. Donnie. Bye. Zack.

402
00:23:21.024 --> 00:23:22.901
Oh. oh. sorry. I was...

403
00:23:22.984 --> 00:23:25.195
As you were. I just need a minute.

404
00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:29.574
Tell me it gets better when they're older.

405
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.953
Tell me it gets easier.

406
00:23:36.373 --> 00:23:38.250
- Once they hit puberty...
- Give me that.

407
00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:53.514
That's better.

408
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.444
You coming in. or you just gonna linger
out here like a total psycho?

409
00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:06.778
I can't. I can't.

410
00:24:06.862 --> 00:24:08.530
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

411
00:24:09.489 --> 00:24:11.616
- You can.
- No. Nobody wants me in there.

412
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.494
Nobody cares anymore.

413
00:24:15.078 --> 00:24:16.078
I don't.

414
00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:18.123
It would be so awkward.

415
00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:21.418
- They're over it. Let's go.
- No. Lila...

416
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:23.503
Give me my... Hey! Give me my keys!

417
00:24:23.587 --> 00:24:24.588
Chop-chop.

418
00:24:26.256 --> 00:24:27.257
Come on!

419
00:24:27.757 --> 00:24:28.800
Li...

420
00:24:31.553 --> 00:24:34.222
Lila! Gimme my keys!
Please don't make me go in there.

421
00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:35.724
Allison. listen to me.

422
00:24:35.807 --> 00:24:38.268
- No... Nobody likes me here.
- You're being dramatic.

423
00:24:38.351 --> 00:24:40.103
I'm telling you. nobody wants me here.

424
00:24:40.187 --> 00:24:42.856
- Please. You don't understand.
- Trust me. you're fine.

425
00:24:46.109 --> 00:24:48.278
Lila. I'm too stoned for this.

426
00:24:49.654 --> 00:24:50.780
This was a mistake.

427
00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:55.535
You're right. This is incredibly awkward.

428
00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:57.287
Uh...

429
00:24:57.996 --> 00:24:59.289
Hey. uh. Allison!

430
00:25:01.541 --> 00:25:04.294
Uh... Uh...

431
00:25:04.377 --> 00:25:05.377
Hey!

432
00:25:05.962 --> 00:25:07.464
So glad you made it.

433
00:25:07.964 --> 00:25:08.964
Just...

434
00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:11.927
thought I'd pop in and say hello.

435
00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:14.012
- Hello.
- Yeah.

436
00:25:14.721 --> 00:25:15.721
Great.

437
00:25:17.432 --> 00:25:19.601
It's. uh. been a minute. huh?

438
00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:21.520
Since we've...

439
00:25:22.479 --> 00:25:23.479
Yeah.

440
00:25:25.148 --> 00:25:27.067
Yeah. Um...

441
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.819
Is Viktor here?

442
00:25:29.903 --> 00:25:34.324
No. no. He's not here yet.
but. uh. he said he was coming. so...

443
00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:36.033
Yeah.

444
00:25:37.244 --> 00:25:38.453
Okay. see you later.

445
00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:47.837
I mean. you do the job.
even though it's killing you.

446
00:25:47.921 --> 00:25:51.633
and the kids. they suck
whatever energy you have left.

447
00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:52.717
Mmm.

448
00:25:53.426 --> 00:25:54.844
And the in-laws. I mean...

449
00:25:56.471 --> 00:25:58.473
I'm glad they're alive in this timeline.

450
00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:01.935
but that don't mean
I want them living in my house.

451
00:26:05.146 --> 00:26:06.481
And then there's Lila.

452
00:26:09.609 --> 00:26:10.609
You know.

453
00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:14.698
she told me she couldn't get pregnant
while breastfeeding.

454
00:26:16.449 --> 00:26:18.785
You can. by the way.

455
00:26:26.543 --> 00:26:28.503
Diego. come on. man.

456
00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:32.632
Some people would kill
to have what you have.

457
00:26:33.133 --> 00:26:35.218
You know? I mean...

458
00:26:38.138 --> 00:26:40.640
I know Sloane and I
would have killed to have this.

459
00:26:43.852 --> 00:26:44.853
Shit.

460
00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:50.650
You're right.

461
00:26:51.484 --> 00:26:52.485
I'm sorry.

462
00:27:18.178 --> 00:27:19.178
Viktor.

463
00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:24.351
- Who are you?
- Uh...

464
00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.854
I need you to get in the van.

465
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:35.028
If my father has something to say to me.
he can come say it himself.

466
00:27:35.612 --> 00:27:37.030
Please.

467
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:38.865
I don't wanna hurt you.

468
00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.410
I'd really like to see you try.

469
00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:46.331
I just... I really need you
to get in that van.

470
00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:57.550
Diego. where's the cake?

471
00:27:57.634 --> 00:28:00.011
You said piñata before cake.

472
00:28:00.095 --> 00:28:02.514
That was like two hours ago!

473
00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:05.225
Can we get this show on the road?
I have book club tonight.

474
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.396
One. two. three...

475
00:28:09.479 --> 00:28:10.522
Yeah. Grace!

476
00:28:10.605 --> 00:28:13.692
...four. five. six.

477
00:28:13.775 --> 00:28:14.775
Now go!

478
00:28:20.156 --> 00:28:21.950
- Harder!
- A little more.

479
00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:23.034
All right.

480
00:28:25.036 --> 00:28:27.038
All right. That's enough. Good job.

481
00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:28.373
- Good effort.
- Good job.

482
00:28:28.456 --> 00:28:29.708
Come here. birthday girl.

483
00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:32.126
Yes.

484
00:28:33.628 --> 00:28:34.629
Oh!

485
00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:39.300
Wow. They really can't
break that thing. huh?

486
00:28:40.343 --> 00:28:43.263
East side piñatas
are notorious for their difficulty.

487
00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:46.558
Screw this. I'm starving.

488
00:28:49.102 --> 00:28:51.855
Out of the way. kid!
I'll hit you. son of a bitch.

489
00:28:53.481 --> 00:28:54.481
Oh!

490
00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.651
Come on!

491
00:29:01.197 --> 00:29:02.699
What the... What...

492
00:29:02.782 --> 00:29:05.243
All right. you asked for it!

493
00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:26.306
- It's okay. sweetie.
- My cake!

494
00:29:27.348 --> 00:29:28.683
What is wrong with you?

495
00:29:30.393 --> 00:29:31.394
I got it open.

496
00:29:34.647 --> 00:29:38.276
All right. just be cool. Jerome.
Anybody asks. you're with me.

497
00:29:41.237 --> 00:29:43.740
It's always so good
to see you. Diane.

498
00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:53.124
These are the real Keepers.

499
00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:54.334
Best of the best.

500
00:29:55.668 --> 00:29:56.668
Oh. hey. Renee.

501
00:29:57.337 --> 00:29:58.630
People are talking.

502
00:29:58.713 --> 00:30:00.840
I'd love to know what you think.

503
00:30:03.218 --> 00:30:04.260
Excuse me. Larry.

504
00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:09.265
You know Hilary.
She used to know every single thing.

505
00:30:09.349 --> 00:30:10.975
So this is book club?

506
00:30:14.103 --> 00:30:16.064
Will you excuse me just a second?

507
00:30:17.398 --> 00:30:19.692
You blow my cover.
I'll rip your balls off.

508
00:30:19.776 --> 00:30:21.152
You're gonna blow <i>my</i> cover.

509
00:30:21.236 --> 00:30:24.697
Nice mustache. by the way. What are you
supposed to be? A Greek serial killer?

510
00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:28.243
I'll have you know
this is top-of-the-line horse hair.

511
00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:32.247
The real question is.
what are you doing here. "Nancy"?

512
00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:36.251
Let's just say the transition
from full-time assassin

513
00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:40.296
to full-time caregiver to 3 small children
and one chunky husband is no picnic.

514
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.632
I needed to get outside the house.

515
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.635
I saw a sign and took a chance.

516
00:30:46.135 --> 00:30:47.554
It's cheaper than therapy.

517
00:30:48.763 --> 00:30:51.641
But you know. these losers
might be onto something.

518
00:30:51.724 --> 00:30:56.062
If everyone can take their seats.
the presentation's about to begin.

519
00:30:57.814 --> 00:30:58.857
Come on.

520
00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:09.242
Who are they?

521
00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:12.548
You never heard of Gene and Jean?
Sure you're part of the right CIA?

522
00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:14.831
- Just spit it out.
- Okay!

523
00:31:15.957 --> 00:31:20.503
Gene and Jean started
the first chapter in Clovis. New Mexico.

524
00:31:20.587 --> 00:31:23.506
Since then. the movement
has been everywhere.

525
00:31:26.175 --> 00:31:27.175
Wow.

526
00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:28.678
Wowie!

527
00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:31.890
I mean. holy shit!

528
00:31:33.516 --> 00:31:38.021
Pardon my French. but look at
all these beautiful shining faces.

529
00:31:38.104 --> 00:31:39.731
It is too much.

530
00:31:39.814 --> 00:31:41.774
Thank you for being here.

531
00:31:42.358 --> 00:31:48.114
We have a big night planned.
because tonight. we will be discussing...

532
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.744
"The Umbrella Effect."

533
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.788
and how I believe

534
00:31:56.623 --> 00:31:59.751
we can return to a restored...

535
00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.339
and correct timeline.

536
00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:13.222
Now. what do we mean
when we talk about the Umbrella Effect?

537
00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:14.306
Well.

538
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:21.147
some people refer to it
as "timeline sickness."

539
00:32:24.734 --> 00:32:27.946
These artifacts from other timelines...

540
00:32:31.199 --> 00:32:36.955
Like the shared memories
so many of us have experienced. huh?

541
00:32:37.038 --> 00:32:38.331
Yup.

542
00:32:38.414 --> 00:32:42.627
Memories the powers that be
would have you believe

543
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:46.798
are just figments of our imaginations.

544
00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:53.096
A dapper dandy holding an umbrella.
standing on the grassy knoll.

545
00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:58.267
An obscure sex cult
called "Destiny's Children."

546
00:32:59.394 --> 00:33:03.564
A litter of child superheroes
in short pants.

547
00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:07.110
from which we derive
the name of this phenomenon.

548
00:33:07.193 --> 00:33:09.362
the Umbrella Effect.

549
00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:12.322
Question is...

550
00:33:14.867 --> 00:33:17.203
who benefits from covering this up?

551
00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:23.167
The elites. of course.

552
00:33:24.585 --> 00:33:29.215
The ruling class has always been
threatened by the truth.

553
00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:33.344
But they cannot stop the truth.
now. can they?

554
00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:37.265
No. I didn't think so.

555
00:33:38.141 --> 00:33:41.602
These artifacts are proof

556
00:33:42.645 --> 00:33:45.064
that we're living in the wrong timelines.

557
00:33:46.065 --> 00:33:47.066
And they're the key

558
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.695
to bringing about

559
00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:53.865
the Cleanse.

560
00:33:56.242 --> 00:33:57.577
What the hell is the Cleanse?

561
00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.704
No idea. but shut your mouth.

562
00:33:59.787 --> 00:34:01.539
Your whisper is very high-pitched.

563
00:34:01.622 --> 00:34:03.249
Don't blow our covers.

564
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:04.751
You're gonna.

565
00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:06.377
Is there a problem back there?

566
00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:07.462
Shit.

567
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:09.797
I'm sorry.

568
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.384
Could you little Chatty Cathys
stand up. please?

569
00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:15.178
- Don't...
- I don't...

570
00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:17.472
Can't really see your pretty little faces.

571
00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:23.352
Oh. Papa. it's Nancy.

572
00:34:24.103 --> 00:34:25.396
Hi. everyone.

573
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.357
And who's your little friend?
I don't believe we've met.

574
00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:31.694
- This is my handsome fella...
- Jerome.

575
00:34:31.778 --> 00:34:32.653
Jerome.

576
00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:34.530
From the Orlando branch.

577
00:34:34.614 --> 00:34:35.740
Mmm.

578
00:34:36.365 --> 00:34:39.035
Jerome from the Orlando branch.

579
00:34:39.118 --> 00:34:42.663
Looks like your suntan
could use a little work there. Jerome.

580
00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:49.545
Maybe there's something
we could help clarify.

581
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:52.423
Jerome from the Orlando branch.

582
00:34:53.007 --> 00:34:54.133
No. so. um. sorry...

583
00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:58.012
We were hoping maybe you could elaborate
on the concept of the Cleanse.

584
00:35:00.556 --> 00:35:02.517
Some believe it's the end.

585
00:35:07.814 --> 00:35:11.818
Others believe
it's but a great restoration.

586
00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:14.070
What do you believe?

587
00:35:15.404 --> 00:35:18.324
Well. you're in luck.

588
00:35:18.407 --> 00:35:24.664
because we are preparing
a very special lecture on just this topic.

589
00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:27.375
Aren't we. darling?

590
00:35:28.209 --> 00:35:29.585
That's right. darling.

591
00:35:30.545 --> 00:35:32.880
If you're interested.
give us your information.

592
00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:34.507
Address. phone number.

593
00:35:36.175 --> 00:35:38.344
We'll make sure to send you an invitation.

594
00:35:39.554 --> 00:35:40.555
Both of you.

595
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:44.350
Thank you both.

596
00:35:45.893 --> 00:35:47.436
So sorry about that.

597
00:35:51.524 --> 00:35:54.777
Look. if these artifacts
are from different timelines.

598
00:35:54.861 --> 00:35:56.112
and now they're showing up...

599
00:35:56.195 --> 00:35:59.073
It's possible
the old man's reset didn't take.

600
00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:00.825
What does that even mean?

601
00:36:00.908 --> 00:36:02.160
I have no idea.

602
00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:06.789
Look. whatever this is.
don't say anything to the family just yet.

603
00:36:06.873 --> 00:36:08.833
All right? Not even Diego.

604
00:36:08.916 --> 00:36:11.544
Absolutely not.
He thinks I'm at book club.

605
00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:15.131
It's just easier that way.

606
00:36:15.882 --> 00:36:18.885
All right. Well. it's a good thing
I never got married.

607
00:36:18.968 --> 00:36:20.636
Too much deception involved.

608
00:36:21.387 --> 00:36:22.387
Wow.

609
00:36:23.723 --> 00:36:26.976
Didn't your dad teach
any of you Hargreeves men how to eat?

610
00:36:28.102 --> 00:36:29.145
Wait. no. come here.

611
00:36:40.823 --> 00:36:43.034
Book club. my ass.

612
00:36:53.127 --> 00:36:54.754
Welcome home. brother.

613
00:36:55.588 --> 00:36:56.588
Welcome home.

614
00:36:58.257 --> 00:36:59.884
What the hell. dude?

615
00:37:00.468 --> 00:37:02.637
You're squatting
in some condemned building.

616
00:37:03.137 --> 00:37:04.722
Condemned? What?

617
00:37:05.932 --> 00:37:08.809
Well. yeah. it's a touch run-down.
I'll give you that.

618
00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:11.604
but come on.
I've put a lot of work into this place.

619
00:37:12.939 --> 00:37:14.482
Not sure I'm seeing it.

620
00:37:16.525 --> 00:37:18.236
Come on. I'll show you around.

621
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.074
I. uh... I read a lot of DIY books.
which is tough at first.

622
00:37:23.157 --> 00:37:25.117
but you kinda get a knack for it.
you know?

623
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.161
Check it out.

624
00:37:30.665 --> 00:37:32.250
Ah. let's get a fire going.

625
00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:36.587
Oh. uh...

626
00:37:37.463 --> 00:37:40.925
You should avoid using the toilets
on the second floor.

627
00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:51.978
Looks like you got mail.

628
00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:52.895
Huh?

629
00:37:52.979 --> 00:37:55.356
Probably the city
condemning this shithole.

630
00:37:55.856 --> 00:37:58.609
No. no. no. no.
They stick those to the front door.

631
00:37:59.819 --> 00:38:00.819
What's this?

632
00:38:10.204 --> 00:38:11.706
We gotta call the others.

633
00:38:12.206 --> 00:38:14.792
Okay. Luther. we're here.
What is it?

634
00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:17.920
It says. "Your brother Viktor
has been kidnapped."

635
00:38:18.004 --> 00:38:21.257
"Follow my exact instructions.
and no harm will come to him."

636
00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:26.554
All right. Any idea
on who might be behind this?

637
00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:29.140
- My money's on you-know-who.
- Dad? Come on.

638
00:38:29.223 --> 00:38:33.060
Dad didn't kidnap Viktor.
He doesn't give a shit about us.

639
00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:35.771
It just really hurts
when family stabs you in the back.

640
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:39.161
Five. can't you just call
your CIA buddies?

641
00:38:39.233 --> 00:38:42.945
Well. the CIA doesn't
investigate kidnappings. That's the FBI.

642
00:38:43.029 --> 00:38:46.282
Wait. Hey. hey. no.
We don't need anyone. We can handle this.

643
00:38:46.365 --> 00:38:47.491
Yeah.

644
00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:49.577
We're not exactly a team anymore. Diego.

645
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.660
Or ever were.

646
00:38:51.078 --> 00:38:53.331
Then there's the whole "no powers" thing.

647
00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:56.876
No. I don't care.
If Viktor's in trouble. I'm in. right?

648
00:38:59.503 --> 00:39:01.543
What are you looking at me for?
I'm not your mother.

649
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:02.965
- I'm in. What?
- Good luck.

650
00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:05.384
You can't even run up stairs
without getting a coronary.

651
00:39:05.468 --> 00:39:06.969
I'm in the best shape of my life.

652
00:39:07.053 --> 00:39:09.347
Jesus. Okay. anyway. now what?

653
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:14.268
It says we're supposed to meet
at Sy's Dry Cleaning on 5th Avenue.

654
00:39:15.227 --> 00:39:16.687
Perfect. Let's roll.

655
00:39:16.771 --> 00:39:17.813
Yeah!

656
00:39:17.897 --> 00:39:18.773
What?

657
00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:34.330
Stay behind Five. He's got the gun.

658
00:39:54.975 --> 00:39:59.230
Guys! Can't you smell that?
This place is a chemical wasteland.

659
00:40:12.118 --> 00:40:14.370
Hey. there he is.

660
00:40:14.453 --> 00:40:15.663
Looking good. buddy.

661
00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.456
Thank God! What's up. Vik?

662
00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:20.709
Couldn't make it to your niece's birthday?

663
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:24.713
Well. I was on the way.
and then I got kidnapped. so...

664
00:40:24.797 --> 00:40:25.881
Yeah. nice excuse.

665
00:40:25.965 --> 00:40:27.216
Diego.

666
00:40:27.299 --> 00:40:28.926
Do you guys wanna untie me. or...

667
00:40:29.009 --> 00:40:30.094
Oh. yeah. sure.

668
00:40:31.554 --> 00:40:33.973
Who grabbed you?
Was it Hargreeves and his goons?

669
00:40:34.056 --> 00:40:35.850
No way. This is amateur hour.

670
00:40:37.143 --> 00:40:40.020
I apologize
if my methods are a little crude.

671
00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:42.690
but this is my first kidnapping.

672
00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:44.442
And hopefully. my last.

673
00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:47.111
But I need your help.

674
00:40:47.194 --> 00:40:49.864
Well. kidnapping our brother
and pointing a gun at us

675
00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.782
isn't gonna buy you much goodwill.

676
00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:56.871
It was the only way I could make sure
that you came here. All of you.

677
00:40:57.371 --> 00:41:00.708
I couldn't leave anything to chance.
Especially when it comes to...

678
00:41:02.877 --> 00:41:04.128
the Umbrella Academy.

679
00:41:04.211 --> 00:41:06.797
No one's called us that
in six years.

680
00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:11.677
Sorry. pal.
The Umbrella Academy doesn't exist.

681
00:41:12.678 --> 00:41:13.679
Um...

682
00:41:13.762 --> 00:41:14.972
Okay. but...

683
00:41:16.223 --> 00:41:18.726
Okay. but... Just...

684
00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:22.688
Can... Can you explain this. then?

685
00:41:27.193 --> 00:41:29.028
Umbrella Academy saves what?

686
00:41:29.528 --> 00:41:32.990
When the hell
did we save the Eiffel Tower?

687
00:41:33.073 --> 00:41:34.408
Where did you get that?

688
00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:37.661
It was in this box of things
in the trunk of my daughter's car.

689
00:41:37.745 --> 00:41:38.746
Her name's Jennifer.

690
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:41.081
- Where did she get that?
- I don't know.

691
00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:42.249
But. okay. listen.

692
00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.876
So. about a year ago.

693
00:41:43.959 --> 00:41:46.253
she met these new friends.

694
00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:49.673
and. uh. they started going
to these strange meetings.

695
00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:53.344
They're very strange people.
They call themselves the Keepers. and. uh...

696
00:41:53.928 --> 00:41:55.513
And then. over time.

697
00:41:55.596 --> 00:41:58.224
she stopped talking to me.

698
00:41:58.307 --> 00:41:59.225
Just stopped.

699
00:41:59.308 --> 00:42:02.853
And that was about three months ago.
and I haven't seen her since.

700
00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:06.565
and I believe that something terrible
has happened.

701
00:42:06.649 --> 00:42:09.568
No offense. Maybe she just
wants nothing to do with you.

702
00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:14.448
No. no. My daughter and I are very close.
She would never do this to me.

703
00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:17.284
Wait. hold on. How did you find us?

704
00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:20.412
I saw you on TV. Toss N' Wash.

705
00:42:20.496 --> 00:42:23.374
Ha! See? No small parts.

706
00:42:23.874 --> 00:42:28.504
I... I've actually been watching you
for quite a while now.

707
00:42:29.547 --> 00:42:30.547
Uh...

708
00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:34.802
And I'm... I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I apologize.

709
00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:39.932
Uh. but. I mean.
she's all that I have left. and. uh...

710
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:42.851
What do you need us for? Call a cop.

711
00:42:42.935 --> 00:42:45.813
I did. They didn't do anything.

712
00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:49.233
We'd like to help. but we're not
the same people in that picture anymore.

713
00:42:49.316 --> 00:42:51.777
Yeah. we don't even have powers now.

714
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.195
Yeah. we're not special.

715
00:42:53.279 --> 00:42:54.947
Speak for yourself. tubby.

716
00:42:56.991 --> 00:42:58.742
Give us 24 hours.

717
00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:00.411
Five. what are you doing?

718
00:43:00.494 --> 00:43:02.955
- 24 hours. We'll find your daughter.
- Yes. Thank you.

719
00:43:03.539 --> 00:43:05.874
- Guys. let's go.
- What are you talking about?

720
00:43:05.958 --> 00:43:10.629
Thank you very much. Umbrella Academy.
I think you're special.

721
00:43:14.049 --> 00:43:14.883
Five.

722
00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:17.094
- Come on.
- What the hell was that. man?

723
00:43:17.636 --> 00:43:19.888
Hey. why are you
considering helping that guy?

724
00:43:19.972 --> 00:43:21.332
- Five.
- What's going on?

725
00:43:22.182 --> 00:43:23.182
Because...

726
00:43:25.769 --> 00:43:26.770
of this.

727
00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:38.574
What I'd like to know is how the daughter
of some random dry cleaner

728
00:43:38.657 --> 00:43:41.368
ends up with a jar of marigold
in the trunk of her car.

729
00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:44.246
How do we know
that's not just a jar of glow stick juice?

730
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:46.832
Why don't you take a sip
and find out. tough guy?

731
00:43:46.915 --> 00:43:49.335
- I will if you will.
- Don't even think about it.

732
00:43:49.835 --> 00:43:53.714
Okay. for the sake of discussion.
let's say this is legit.

733
00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:56.300
Does anyone here want their power back?

734
00:43:56.383 --> 00:43:57.885
- No. siree. Bob.
- Yeah.

735
00:43:58.594 --> 00:44:01.305
For the first time in my life. I'm sober.

736
00:44:02.348 --> 00:44:04.516
And... happy.

737
00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.604
But most importantly.
100% poltergeist-free.

738
00:44:09.104 --> 00:44:11.106
Free?
You rarely leave the house.

739
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:14.068
And when you do.
you're wearing surgical gloves in public.

740
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:16.028
Yeah. well. at least I'm in control.

741
00:44:16.111 --> 00:44:17.111
Showtime.

742
00:44:19.865 --> 00:44:21.367
Look at this chump.

743
00:44:22.576 --> 00:44:23.661
Angle's wrong.

744
00:44:25.245 --> 00:44:26.455
Sloppy form.

745
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.377
- Good job. sir.
- Nice.

746
00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.753
He is so good.

747
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.715
Look. guys. it's a hard no for me too.

748
00:44:36.799 --> 00:44:38.550
I've got a bar to run. friends.

749
00:44:38.634 --> 00:44:39.677
Like. a real life.

750
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.428
You're all nuts. all right?

751
00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:43.806
We should be mainlining
this shit right now.

752
00:44:44.973 --> 00:44:47.810
Look. come on. big guy.
I know you want it.

753
00:44:47.893 --> 00:44:50.062
Wait! I mean. that's a tough one.

754
00:44:50.145 --> 00:44:52.856
Come on. You don't need that. Luther.

755
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.817
Your life is fantastic.

756
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:58.862
I don't know about fantastic.
but you know. I'm... I'm managing.

757
00:44:58.946 --> 00:45:01.031
Is that where the bar is set these days?

758
00:45:01.782 --> 00:45:02.991
Managing?

759
00:45:03.075 --> 00:45:05.577
I'll do whatever the group decides.
How's that?

760
00:45:05.661 --> 00:45:07.246
Yeah. I'm with Luther.

761
00:45:08.247 --> 00:45:09.581
Majority rules.

762
00:45:10.124 --> 00:45:11.417
Yeah. right.

763
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:15.379
You're not
actually considering this. are you?

764
00:45:17.631 --> 00:45:19.049
No.

765
00:45:20.342 --> 00:45:23.011
No. my life is great.
I have everything I need.

766
00:45:23.095 --> 00:45:24.972
Yup. Me too.

767
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:27.307
Same.

768
00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:30.686
All right. then. Motion fails.
We don't drink the mystery juice.

769
00:45:30.769 --> 00:45:32.062
So we don't get our powers back.

770
00:45:32.146 --> 00:45:33.355
Thank God!

771
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.777
I tried. You're all morons.

772
00:45:38.861 --> 00:45:40.195
Hey! Where are you going?

773
00:45:40.279 --> 00:45:42.573
To take a piss! Is that okay. Luther?

774
00:45:42.656 --> 00:45:45.826
Or do you need
to run that by my parole officer too?

775
00:45:45.909 --> 00:45:48.120
Oh shit!
I was supposed to call him at 6:00!

776
00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:54.126
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yeah. it is!

777
00:45:54.835 --> 00:45:57.880
- That's disgusting.
- All right. I gotta hit the road.

778
00:45:57.963 --> 00:45:59.047
No. so soon?

779
00:45:59.131 --> 00:46:00.716
Come on. Vik! Stay a bit longer!

780
00:46:00.799 --> 00:46:02.342
No. wait! Stay. man!

781
00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:04.636
It's just such a long drive. So. yeah.

782
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.889
I should go too.
I've got an audition tomorrow.

783
00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:13.312
Like a big. important audition.
and we have to boot camp the lines!

784
00:46:13.395 --> 00:46:15.647
You've gotta drive the kids
to the dentist at 7:00 a.m.

785
00:46:15.731 --> 00:46:18.901
Why you gotta make it so early again?

786
00:46:18.984 --> 00:46:20.569
Because they have school at 8:00.

787
00:46:20.652 --> 00:46:23.447
Whoa. whoa. whoa!
Hey! Where's everyone going?

788
00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:25.949
We haven't even gotten to the steak yet!

789
00:46:26.033 --> 00:46:27.451
- Party's over.
- No! No!

790
00:46:27.534 --> 00:46:30.579
Okay. One last shot. on me.

791
00:46:30.662 --> 00:46:32.080
For old time's sake.

792
00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:33.623
Please!

793
00:46:34.374 --> 00:46:35.834
- Klaus!
- No!

794
00:46:35.918 --> 00:46:38.212
- Ignore him!
- Come on. He doesn't drink.

795
00:46:38.295 --> 00:46:39.838
Sake doesn't count.

796
00:46:39.922 --> 00:46:41.590
- Exactly.
- It doesn't?

797
00:46:41.673 --> 00:46:43.884
- Hey. Dude's sober.
- Thank you.

798
00:46:47.262 --> 00:46:48.514
Okay. then.

799
00:46:48.597 --> 00:46:52.059

What about curfew?

Relax. Captain Tight-ass.
