Please don't leave me.

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:46.201
{\an8}Yeah.

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.539
{\an8}Hello. secret stash.

50
00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.082
{\an8}Oh. baby. come to Mama.

51
00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:53.501
A little further.

52
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:54.919
Hey. come...

53
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.966
Ow! Ow! Shit!

54
00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.969
Shit. Shit. All right.

55
00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:05.471

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.693

59
00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.795
Well. that was certainly uncalled for.

60
00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:38.880
Was it?

61
00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.592
Trying to save Ben is a fool's errand.

62
00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:47.096
If you look at the variables.
the odds of success are vanishingly small.

63
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.475
That's 'cause the only variables
you consider are black and white.

64
00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:53.353
There's gray in the world.
I live in that space.

65
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.482
You're different than your siblings.

66
00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:00.943
I suspect that the other Hargreeves
was afraid of that.

67
00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:02.987
And you.

68
00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:07.241
Yeah. he was.

69
00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.535
And it screwed me up for a long time.

70
00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:14.457
You say you're not the same as him?

71
00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.335
Now's your chance to prove it.

72
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.921
Hmm.

73
00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:26.969
This is it.

74
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.492
What is all this?

75
00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:53.579
This is the Cleanse. my boy.

76
00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:59.961
My monitoring station recorded
a magnitude 6.3 seismic event.

77
00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:04.549
And the epicenter... is right here.

78
00:07:33.077 --> 00:07:35.037
What the hell?

79
00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:37.999
You still think you can save Ben?

80
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.002
This is only phase one.

81
00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:43.713
His mind has been hijacked.

82
00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:45.590
His body is merely a vessel.

83
00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:50.303
The Cleanse will slowly take full control.

84
00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.879
We should run away somewhere.

85
00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:26.797
Excuse me?

86
00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:27.965
I'm serious.

87
00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:31.886
Keep driving south.
Live on a beach somewhere.

88
00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:33.012
Get married.

89
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:34.597
Just you and me.

90
00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:36.599
Sure.

91
00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:39.185
With the 18 bucks we have between us.

92
00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:43.147
I might just have some money
stashed away in the Caymans.

93
00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.982
You said the government got it all.

94
00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.484
Yeah. about that.

95
00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:49.904
We just need to get to Florida.
I know a pilot in Miami.

96
00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:54.617
I mean. what am I even
supposed to say to that?

97
00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:57.745
Just say yes.

98
00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:05.794
Mmm.

99
00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:07.630
Be right back.

100
00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:09.715
Stay put.

101
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:10.799
I will.

102
00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:16.806
This is Alpha 3-9.
I've got eyes on the package.

103
00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.684
Copy. They've been spotted.

104
00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:20.935
- Not far from here.
- Wait.

105
00:09:21.018 --> 00:09:23.646
- We still have our deal. right?
- Yes.

106
00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:25.314
But you're running out of time.

107
00:09:25.856 --> 00:09:29.151
So. if you're going to make a move.
I suggest you get on with it.

108
00:10:01.892 --> 00:10:02.977
Hello?

109
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.312
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

110
00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:06.856
Viktor? How the hell did you find me?

111
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.900
What you two have been up to
hasn't been subtle.

112
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.362
What can I say?
I've been in prison the last four years.

113
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.114
Not that. you perv.

114
00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:18.784
I'm... I'm talking 6.3 on the Richter scale.

115
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.621
- Is she still with you?
<i>- That's none of your business.</i>

116
00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:23.164
Actually. it <i>is</i> my business

117
00:10:23.247 --> 00:10:26.417
'cause you two are on pace
to end the world in about 48 hours.

118
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.710
Twenty-four. actually.

119
00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:29.045
<i>Shut up!</i>

120
00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.589
Are you serious? You're with Dad now?

121
00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:32.965
Ben. listen to me.

122
00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:34.717
<i>There's something happening to you.</i>

123
00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:36.719
<i>It's called the Cleanse.</i>

124
00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:38.095
It's like a virus.

125
00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.598
It's taking over your whole body. and...

126
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:41.515
<i>Bullshit.</i>

127
00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.684
I feel great. Never felt better.

128
00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.061
That's what I'm saying.

129
00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:48.439
Whatever you're feeling
or seeing. it can't be trusted.

130
00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:50.816
There is something happening
inside of you.

131
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.485
and it's only gonna get worse.

132
00:10:52.568 --> 00:10:53.402
<i>You're right.</i>

133
00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.404
Something <i>is</i> happening inside of me.

134
00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:59.200
I'm happy for the first time in my life.
and you miserable assholes can't stand it.

135
00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:01.410
Ben! I'm just trying to help you!

136
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.997
You need to get away
from Jennifer right now!

137
00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:06.957
You wanna help me? Leave us alone!

138
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:08.041
<i>Ben!</i>

139
00:11:13.297 --> 00:11:15.007
He may be past hope.

140
00:11:27.311 --> 00:11:28.771
Ben. what's wrong?

141
00:11:29.563 --> 00:11:31.065
Nothing I can't handle.

142
00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:48.916
We really get to keep these?

143
00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:53.379
Absolutely.

144
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.298
At least your eyes are open.

145
00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:58.091
Gentlemen.

146
00:11:58.592 --> 00:12:01.053
I wanna introduce you to our elite unit.

147
00:12:04.306 --> 00:12:06.016
Welcome to Sector R.

148
00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:11.731
Hell yes.

149
00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:13.899
I mean. this is what I'm talking about.

150
00:12:14.942 --> 00:12:16.152
These are the guys.

151
00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.781
Agent Parnell here
will show you guys the ropes.

152
00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:23.951
Frank Parnell.
Everyone around here calls me Bud.

153
00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:25.786
Bud. Bud.

154
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.706
I'm gonna hit you straight.
We need a chopper ASAP.

155
00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:32.251
I want a two-mile perimeter
and a lockdown around the hot zone.

156
00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:33.586
I want boots on the ground.

157
00:12:33.669 --> 00:12:36.881
No stone is left unturned. You feel me?

158
00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.265
Yeah. we don't do that here.

159
00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.101
Not even the chopper?

160
00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:52.354
We got a white cube van.
but you need department approval.

161
00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:56.192
Why don't you two boys grab a chair?
Make yourselves comfortable.

162
00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:58.402
Lunch order's about to go in.

163
00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:25.763
Maybe we should go back
to looking for Ben.

164
00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:27.347
We just got here.

165
00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:48.327
- Hey. Diego.
- Hmm?

166
00:13:49.703 --> 00:13:52.164
Are you sure that these are the guys?

167
00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.250
Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure.

168
00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:56.627
What...

169
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.464
This is Covert Ops. bruh.

170
00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:05.469
I'm talking Watergate. Cuba. Bin Laden.

171
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.638
These are the guys.

172
00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:15.437
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
this is where they. you know...

173
00:14:16.438 --> 00:14:18.566
put agents out to pasture.

174
00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:20.693
These guys are the best of the best.

175
00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.445
That's what my manager
at the club called me

176
00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:25.531
when he put me
on the Sunday brunch buffet.

177
00:14:25.614 --> 00:14:27.908
Sounds like you're killing it
on multiple fronts. big guy.

178
00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:31.412
Sunday brunch buffet
is where they put the dead weight.

179
00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:32.496
Legs and eggs.

180
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.080
Look around.

181
00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:36.041
This is legs and eggs.

182
00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:39.295
I'm not gonna let your bad attitude
wreck this for me.

183
00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:41.255
Fine. Knock yourself out.

184
00:14:42.172 --> 00:14:44.925
I'm gonna go see
if Ribbons has anything on the Keepers.

185
00:14:59.106 --> 00:15:01.567
I don't think I can eat
another subway rat.

186
00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:06.947
If you add an orange peel to it.
it kind of tastes like duck à l'orange.

187
00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:11.035
Care to guess how long we've been here?

188
00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:13.662
Long enough I found my first gray hair.

189
00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.123
And it's not on my head.

190
00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:23.524
Well. according to my calendar.

191
00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:24.590
it's been...

192
00:15:24.673 --> 00:15:28.385
six years. five months. two days.

193
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:33.307
Yeah. well. we'll find a way home
soon enough. right?

194
00:15:35.392 --> 00:15:40.356
If we don't get stabbed. shot. or blown up
the next time we go topside.

195
00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:46.946
In some of those timelines.
we would've been lucky to get out alive.

196
00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:51.450
Yeah. well. we're still kicking.
so we must be doing something right.

197
00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:58.207
Do you remember that timeline we found
the other day? At the greenhouse?

198
00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:01.752
And the strawberries. What about it?

199
00:16:02.878 --> 00:16:04.296
Seemed pleasant enough.

200
00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:07.841
There's no feral hogs there.
No secret police.

201
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:13.055
I was thinking we could maybe
set up there for a stretch.

202
00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:14.431
So you're giving up?

203
00:16:16.183 --> 00:16:17.768
No one said give up. but...

204
00:16:19.561 --> 00:16:21.271
it's been almost seven years. Lila.

205
00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:22.773
We deserve a break.

206
00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:26.694
You know. a bed. A shower.

207
00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:31.365
I would strangle a kitten for a hot bath.

208
00:16:37.204 --> 00:16:41.166
Just a few days. okay?
This does not mean that we're giving up.

209
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.250
No.

210
00:16:43.752 --> 00:16:44.752
Okay.

211
00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:01.770
I don't like it. Jean.

212
00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:05.482
I know you don't. Gene.
but I talked to Red Deer.

213
00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:07.359
His story checks out.

214
00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:11.613
That song he keeps whistling. I hate it.

215
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.160
Let's just hear what he has to say.
All right? No harm in that.

216
00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:23.000
Mr. Muntz!

217
00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:25.961
You are a long way from Red Deer.

218
00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:29.965
Well. I wouldn't miss what's coming
for the world.

219
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.468
Oh? And what is that?

220
00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:35.344
The Cleanse.

221
00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:40.392
- But we...
- Lost the girl. I know that.

222
00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:42.061
How the heck do you know that?

223
00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:44.980
I have people looking for her.

224
00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:46.648
So do we.

225
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.360
Tell me how she escaped.

226
00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:52.362
We had her secured in the barn.

227
00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:53.530
Guards posted.

228
00:17:54.114 --> 00:17:56.241
- Gene and I were in the house...
- Dancin'.

229
00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:58.660
...when we heard the screaming.

230
00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:00.329
By the time we got to the barn...

231
00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:03.040
...she had dug her way out.

232
00:18:03.123 --> 00:18:05.751
With that tentacle boy.

233
00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:09.754
Excellent.

234
00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:11.381
Exsqueeze me?

235
00:18:11.465 --> 00:18:14.093
That boy is
the missing piece of this puzzle.

236
00:18:14.676 --> 00:18:17.387
He's the lock. and she's the key.

237
00:18:18.138 --> 00:18:20.474
- You're a cryptic little son of a bitch.
- Gene!

238
00:18:20.557 --> 00:18:22.059
Either tell us what you know.

239
00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:24.311
or I dunk your face in the deep fryer.

240
00:18:24.394 --> 00:18:25.729
That boy has a family.

241
00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:28.524
and if they find him and Jennifer
before we do.

242
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.651
everything is ruined.

243
00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:32.819
So...

244
00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:36.448
why don't you park that macho bullshit.

245
00:18:37.032 --> 00:18:38.075
let us get to work.

246
00:18:38.158 --> 00:18:39.868
find out where the family's going.

247
00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.286
and stop them?

248
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.172
<i>♪ Take one down ♪</i>

249
00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:55.300
<i>♪ Pass it around ♪</i>

250
00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:58.387
<i>♪ And then all you got is ♪</i>

251
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.430
<i>♪ Two bottles of beer on... ♪</i>

252
00:19:02.599 --> 00:19:03.976
Jesus Christ!

253
00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:05.394
What the fuck is that?

254
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.938
Get away. or I'll burn you!

255
00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:10.190
Huh? Get away!

256
00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:19.657
Ew!

257
00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:22.870
Ugh! Ugh. gross.

258
00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:28.167
You must be Thunderbolt.

259
00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:32.421
You're a good dog.

260
00:19:33.046 --> 00:19:34.965
You're a good dead doggy.

261
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.634
Yeah. You like kisses. huh?

262
00:19:37.718 --> 00:19:40.095
Hey. I got a mission for you. Thunderbolt.

263
00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:41.346
You gotta go fetch.

264
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.433
I need you to go fetch a human.

265
00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:45.767
Any living human now.

266
00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.936
Just no motorcycles. no leather.

267
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.689
You got it. boy? You understand. right?

268
00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:51.772
Stop it!

269
00:19:52.941 --> 00:19:55.152
Please. please! Go fetch!

270
00:19:55.235 --> 00:19:56.236
You can do it. boy!

271
00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:07.581
- Is this the place?
- Yeah.

272
00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.291
It's his favorite.

273
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.628
- Have you been here before?
- No. no.

274
00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:15.088
I've never been inside.

275
00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:18.383
- So you have been here before.
- In a cab. Mom.

276
00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:19.718
To get Uncle Klaus.

277
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:22.095
God! For once in your life.
you just need to chill.

278
00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:24.389
We're gonna talk about this later.
Wait here.

279
00:20:33.815 --> 00:20:34.858
What do you want?

280
00:20:34.942 --> 00:20:35.984
Open up!

281
00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:42.491
Piss off!

282
00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:55.587
Now. where are your manners?

283
00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:06.056
Yes. baby.

284
00:21:06.556 --> 00:21:07.556
Next week.

285
00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:10.059
Sorry.

286
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.857
Excuse me.
I'm looking for my brother. Klaus.

287
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:16.941
Have you...

288
00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:20.069
Okay.

289
00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:27.827
Klaus?

290
00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:33.083
Klaus?

291
00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:34.166
Oh!

292
00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:41.174
Seek. and ye shall find.

293
00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:46.346
So Klaus is your brother. huh?

294
00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:49.433
I guess pretty and stupid
runs in the family.

295
00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:05.031
Yeah.

296
00:22:06.533 --> 00:22:07.826
That was cute.

297
00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:10.871
I had to let Klaus go.

298
00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:14.374
But seeing as you're a woman
with such special talents.

299
00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:17.210
perhaps you'd be interested
in filling his vacancy.

300
00:22:22.632 --> 00:22:25.344
But I gotta ask. are you a ballbuster?

301
00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:29.014
'Cause one thing I cannot abide on my crew

302
00:22:29.097 --> 00:22:30.432
is a ballbuster.

303
00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:33.477
Hey. asshole!

304
00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.603
Claire. no!

305
00:22:35.145 --> 00:22:36.271
You brat!

306
00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.565
That was a mistake.

307
00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:51.078
Goddamn bitch!

308
00:22:53.288 --> 00:22:54.748
I think you might be right.

309
00:22:56.666 --> 00:22:58.043
I am a ballbuster.

310
00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.379
What?

311
00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:02.047
No. no. no!

312
00:23:08.428 --> 00:23:10.472
Holy...

313
00:23:10.555 --> 00:23:12.182
Oh shit. Oh shit.

314
00:23:13.016 --> 00:23:15.644
Now. where's my brother?

315
00:23:17.646 --> 00:23:19.773
Or the next time.
it's gonna be your heart.

316
00:23:22.526 --> 00:23:25.195
Pet cemetery on Sycamore.
He's buried there.

317
00:23:26.113 --> 00:23:27.113
Which grave?

318
00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:29.199
What the hell are you?

319
00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:34.454
I'm an actor. you motherfucker.

320
00:23:36.706 --> 00:23:37.916
Well. he was rude.

321
00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:48.468
I got three about the same age.

322
00:23:50.554 --> 00:23:52.222
Picture is ten years old.

323
00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:54.057
Kids are all grown up now.

324
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:56.893
They've got their own lives.
their own kids.

325
00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:00.439
Must be nice.

326
00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:03.191
Not in the slightest. They can't stand me.

327
00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:05.444
First wife left me years ago.

328
00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:06.862
I'm on my third divorce.

329
00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:08.822
Damn. dude!

330
00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:13.117
What happened?

331
00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:14.578
The job.

332
00:24:15.662 --> 00:24:18.062
When they send you on assignment.
the last thing you wanna do

333
00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:20.667
is let anyone know where you are
or what you're doing.

334
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.252
That includes family.

335
00:24:23.003 --> 00:24:24.504
You don't want them worrying.

336
00:24:25.589 --> 00:24:26.840
Yeah. but...

337
00:24:30.844 --> 00:24:32.137
She knew the life.

338
00:24:33.013 --> 00:24:35.432
Right? I mean. working for the CIA.

339
00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:37.058
Yeah. sure she knew.

340
00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:39.978
And when the kids were old enough.
so did they.

341
00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:43.648
For the first few years.
being away all the time worked.

342
00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:45.275
- Until it didn't.
- Hmm.

343
00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:48.653
We just slowly slipped apart. you know?

344
00:24:49.404 --> 00:24:51.948
Became strangers in our own home.

345
00:24:53.116 --> 00:24:54.910
Yeah. but I mean.

346
00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:57.037
the missions.

347
00:24:58.163 --> 00:25:00.040
Traveling all over the world.

348
00:25:00.123 --> 00:25:01.333
I'd trade it all in.

349
00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:03.960
All of it in a second

350
00:25:04.044 --> 00:25:06.880
for a chance to have dinner
with my kids at 6:00.

351
00:25:08.048 --> 00:25:09.633
help them with their homework.

352
00:25:10.217 --> 00:25:13.428
or a chance to lie down next to my wife
at the end of the day.

353
00:25:14.221 --> 00:25:15.847
That's why I'm down here.

354
00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:18.141
File and pile. That's the way to go.

355
00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:21.353
Uh...

356
00:25:22.062 --> 00:25:23.772
What? File and pile?

357
00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:24.855
Yeah.

358
00:25:26.066 --> 00:25:27.984
I thought this was an elite unit.

359
00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:32.197
Son. the only elite thing
about this unit

360
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.740
is our pension status.

361
00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:36.367
But...

362
00:25:38.286 --> 00:25:39.663
But what about that guy?

363
00:25:40.288 --> 00:25:43.208
I mean. he said he worked
the Castro file back in the day.

364
00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:44.626
Castro?

365
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.212
Sure. Larry Castro.

366
00:25:47.295 --> 00:25:50.131
the counterfeit olive oil king
of the Dutch Antilles.

367
00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:53.718
Yeah. That was a real embarrassment
for the agency.

368
00:25:55.929 --> 00:25:57.305
This is legs and eggs.

369
00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:59.391
Sunday brunch. my friend.

370
00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:03.311
I gotta chop a log.

371
00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:34.426
Auntie Ji. hey. It's me.

372
00:26:36.303 --> 00:26:37.679
Put Lila on.

373
00:26:40.807 --> 00:26:41.807
What?

374
00:26:44.728 --> 00:26:45.812
Where is she?

375
00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:51.109
Okay.

376
00:27:35.111 --> 00:27:36.154
If you keep this up.

377
00:27:36.237 --> 00:27:38.990
we're not gonna have strawberries
when the snow comes.

378
00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.701
So we'll eat snow.

379
00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:44.120
- Ah!
- Oh.

380
00:27:59.928 --> 00:28:00.970
Don't.

381
00:28:02.097 --> 00:28:03.097
Don't what?

382
00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:06.017
Be weird.

383
00:28:09.145 --> 00:28:10.188
Was that weird?

384
00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:15.735
No. which is what makes it weird.

385
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.844
Hey. what's the verdict. muchacho?

386
00:28:40.927 --> 00:28:42.721
Your team find Ben and Jennifer?

387
00:28:42.804 --> 00:28:44.514
That's none of your business.

388
00:28:44.597 --> 00:28:46.433
Well. they need our protection.

389
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:48.893
You're the one that needs protecting.

390
00:28:50.061 --> 00:28:52.439
It's time for you to go. muchacho.

391
00:28:52.939 --> 00:28:54.357
Oh. Gene.

392
00:28:55.942 --> 00:28:56.943
Gene. Gene. Gene.

393
00:28:57.527 --> 00:29:00.780
Keep walking right out that back door.
and don't come back.

394
00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:02.824
What seems to be the problem?

395
00:29:02.907 --> 00:29:05.160
I just don't like you. is all.

396
00:29:05.243 --> 00:29:06.327
Is that it?

397
00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:07.871
In a nutshell. yeah.

398
00:29:07.954 --> 00:29:08.955
What about Jean?

399
00:29:09.038 --> 00:29:11.624
Jean's not calling the shots here. I am.

400
00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:13.168
Does she know that?

401
00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:14.753
Here's what you're gonna do.

402
00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:16.087
You're gonna leave...

403
00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:19.966
...or I'm gonna blow out your kneecaps.

404
00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:24.220
Oh no. Wouldn't want that.

405
00:29:30.185 --> 00:29:31.185
You know. Gene...

406
00:29:33.021 --> 00:29:35.190
I'm sorry it didn't work out between us.

407
00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:37.066
Really. I mean that.

408
00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:39.526
Fuck off.

409
00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:14.437
- Are you lost?
- Jeez!

410
00:30:18.233 --> 00:30:19.233
Yeah.

411
00:30:19.859 --> 00:30:22.111
I am. But. uh. you know what?

412
00:30:22.195 --> 00:30:25.615
I think we're all lost to some degree.

413
00:30:25.698 --> 00:30:26.741
Right?

414
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:30.787
We're all just searching for meaning
in an ever-changing world.

415
00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:32.956
Not on the director's floor.

416
00:30:33.623 --> 00:30:34.623
That's right.

417
00:30:37.585 --> 00:30:39.420
Do you know where the bathroom is?

418
00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:41.548
End of the hall. turn right.

419
00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:43.799
Thank you.

420
00:31:22.422 --> 00:31:23.423
Shit.

421
00:31:36.102 --> 00:31:37.862
Can I help you
with anything there?

422
00:31:45.695 --> 00:31:47.196
I. uh...

423
00:31:49.032 --> 00:31:51.284
I saw that. uh. this...

424
00:31:52.201 --> 00:31:53.411
was damaged.

425
00:31:54.621 --> 00:31:56.456
And I'm pretty handy with tools.

426
00:31:56.539 --> 00:31:59.208
so I thought I might
just try and fix it for you.

427
00:31:59.709 --> 00:32:00.710
Hmm.

428
00:32:01.836 --> 00:32:03.338
Well. we have people for that.

429
00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:04.839
Oh.

430
00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:05.923
Fine.

431
00:32:10.845 --> 00:32:12.639
Shall we get you back to your brother now?

432
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:14.890
Sure.

433
00:32:17.393 --> 00:32:18.728
That'll be all. Derek.

434
00:32:51.552 --> 00:32:54.514
Hey. uh. isn't Sector R in the basement?

435
00:32:56.015 --> 00:32:57.015
Yes.

436
00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:58.475
It is.

437
00:32:58.518 --> 00:32:59.560
Oh.

438
00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:01.312
Then. uh. why are we going up?

439
00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:39.976
What the...

440
00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:40.935
Hey!

441
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:42.020
What the...

442
00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:46.023
Diego!

443
00:33:46.774 --> 00:33:48.276
Code Green in Sector R.

444
00:33:51.571 --> 00:33:52.613
Send backup.

445
00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:54.073
Where are your pants?

446
00:33:54.657 --> 00:33:56.075
- We gotta go.
- Why?

447
00:33:56.159 --> 00:33:57.159
It's a long story.

448
00:33:57.201 --> 00:34:00.163
- Were you giving Ribbons a lap dance?
- Kinda.

449
00:34:00.246 --> 00:34:02.040
Got 'em. They're in here.

450
00:34:02.123 --> 00:34:03.166
Shit.

451
00:34:09.213 --> 00:34:10.256

00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:15.942
Hey. someone did well today.

494
00:37:16.025 --> 00:37:17.693
It was the snares you made.

495
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.404
Exceptional.

496
00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:25.076
I fixed it.

497
00:37:28.204 --> 00:37:31.123
Hey. I know that look. Out with it.

498
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.500
Okay.

499
00:37:41.008 --> 00:37:42.009
What's this?

500
00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:43.094
Look inside.

501
00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:48.099
Where'd you get this?

502
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.601
I made it.

503
00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:02.446
You're so full of surprises.

504
00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:09.495
I aim to please.

505
00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.208
Hey. where are you going?

506
00:38:15.668 --> 00:38:17.420
We just ran out of scrap metal.

507
00:38:18.546 --> 00:38:20.381
I'll join you in a minute.

508
00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:21.966
Okay. love.

509
00:38:38.024 --> 00:38:39.191
How much further?

510
00:38:39.275 --> 00:38:40.484
We'll be there soon.

511
00:38:43.612 --> 00:38:44.612
You okay?

512
00:38:45.448 --> 00:38:47.742
Uh. yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

513
00:38:48.951 --> 00:38:50.619
You sure?

514
00:38:51.537 --> 00:38:52.538
Yeah.

515
00:38:53.789 --> 00:38:54.874
Don't worry about it.

516
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:23.611
Okay.

517
00:39:28.741 --> 00:39:29.741
Shit.

518
00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:32.869
All right.

519
00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:39.752
What the hell?

520
00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:52.723
This is my handwriting.

521
00:39:57.853 --> 00:39:59.397
Holy shit.

522
00:40:01.607 --> 00:40:02.608
This is...

523
00:40:11.534 --> 00:40:12.451
This is it.

524
00:40:12.535 --> 00:40:14.829
This is... our way home.

525
00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:27.924
Five?

526
00:40:28.884 --> 00:40:29.969
Yeah. Here!

527
00:40:32.054 --> 00:40:33.514
Did you find anything?

528
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:36.058
Nothing. No.

529
00:40:37.226 --> 00:40:38.226
Careful of that.

530
00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:41.021
Okay. Should we keep looking that way?

531
00:40:41.856 --> 00:40:42.982
Yeah. good idea.

532
00:41:06.172 --> 00:41:07.965
Nobody's coming for you.

533
00:41:09.216 --> 00:41:10.426
You gotta fight

534
00:41:11.427 --> 00:41:12.720
for your right

535
00:41:13.429 --> 00:41:14.597
to live.

536
00:41:16.682 --> 00:41:17.933
You can do this.

537
00:41:18.601 --> 00:41:20.227
Find the warrior.

538
00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:23.272
Find Bruce Lee.

539
00:41:24.607 --> 00:41:25.816
Find...

540
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.862
Uma Thurman.

541
00:41:48.088 --> 00:41:50.216
Uncle Klaus! Where are you?

542
00:41:50.299 --> 00:41:52.384
Klaus!

543
00:41:52.468 --> 00:41:55.221
Oh. goddamn it. Klaus! Where are you?

544
00:41:55.304 --> 00:41:57.973
- Oh God! What if he's...
- No. he's not. okay?

545
00:41:58.057 --> 00:42:01.101
We just need to find his sorry ass.
all right? Come on.

546
00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:02.394
Klaus?

547
00:42:02.478 --> 00:42:03.938
- Uncle Klaus!
- Klaus!

548
00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:06.190
Klaus?

549
00:42:06.273 --> 00:42:07.358
Uncle Klaus!

550
00:42:12.279 --> 00:42:14.031
Ow!

551
00:42:14.114 --> 00:42:16.283
Klaus?

552
00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.035
You hear a dog barking?

553
00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:23.332
Claire. look. Look. Come on.

554
00:42:24.792 --> 00:42:27.044
Klaus! Klaus!

555
00:42:29.338 --> 00:42:30.965
- Thunderbolt.
- Thunderbolt. Okay.

556
00:43:04.331 --> 00:43:05.331
God?

557
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Close enough.

558
00:43:08.627 --> 00:43:09.962
- Allison?
- Yeah.

559
00:43:10.045 --> 00:43:12.047
- Allison. is that you?
- Yeah! Yeah!

560
00:43:12.131 --> 00:43:13.131
Yes!

561
00:43:13.173 --> 00:43:14.883
Claire. Claire Bear.

562
00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:17.636
Hi. Hi. Hi.

563
00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:21.739
You came back for me!

564
00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:24.143
Of course we did! Of course we did!

565
00:43:24.226 --> 00:43:25.769
How did you find me?

566
00:43:26.979 --> 00:43:28.814
We heard this barking.

567
00:43:29.857 --> 00:43:32.026
Thank God!

568
00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:36.529
Let's...

569
00:43:37.865 --> 00:43:39.450
get the hell out of here.

570
00:43:39.533 --> 00:43:41.035
- Yeah.
- Shall we?

571
00:43:44.496 --> 00:43:46.332
Thank you. Thunderbolt.

572
00:43:53.881 --> 00:43:54.882
What's that?

573
00:43:56.216 --> 00:43:58.260
Now. I know that we said no gifts.

574
00:43:59.762 --> 00:44:00.762
but...

575
00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:03.015
Ta-da!

576
00:44:04.725 --> 00:44:06.935
Here's to seven years
in Shitsville with you.

577
00:44:09.271 --> 00:44:12.483
Bloody hell. You're not gonna cry.
are you? It's just instant coffee.

578
00:44:14.652 --> 00:44:16.904
Lila. there's something I should tell you.

579
00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:18.655
Okay.

580
00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:30.918
What's this?

581
00:44:32.878 --> 00:44:33.921
A way home.

582
00:44:37.091 --> 00:44:38.133
It's a cipher.

583
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:45.057
How long have you had this?

584
00:44:46.475 --> 00:44:47.935
I'm not exactly sure.

585
00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:49.018
How long?

586
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:53.691
Five months.

587
00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:55.191
Maybe six.

588
00:44:56.902 --> 00:44:59.446
And you didn't tell me. Why?

589
00:45:02.616 --> 00:45:03.742
You know why.

590
00:45:09.081 --> 00:45:10.332
What are you doing?

591
00:45:10.416 --> 00:45:12.960
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm going home.

592
00:45:14.128 --> 00:45:15.462
We should talk about this.

593
00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:17.965
There's nothing to talk about.
We're going back.

594
00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:20.968
To what? Another apocalypse?

595
00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:23.721
Another broken timeline?
A broken marriage?

596
00:45:23.804 --> 00:45:25.723
That is none of your goddamn business!

597
00:45:26.348 --> 00:45:27.349
Actually. it is.

598
00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:31.603
I've been here with you
the past seven years. watching your back.

599
00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:34.666
Nursing you when you were sick.
Holding you when you were sad.

600
00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:36.942
So it is my goddamn business.

601
00:45:38.819 --> 00:45:41.464
- We're not talking about this.
- We both know how miserable you were.

602
00:45:41.488 --> 00:45:43.866
You do not get to decide
what I do with my life!

603
00:45:44.742 --> 00:45:46.201
He can't give you what you need.

604
00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:47.494
Oh. and you can?

605
00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:48.996
You're happy here.

606
00:45:49.872 --> 00:45:51.081
I know you are.

607
00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:52.791
We both are.

608
00:45:52.875 --> 00:45:55.502
This isn't real. Five!
None of this is real!

609
00:45:56.712 --> 00:45:58.046
What is it. then?

610
00:46:00.841 --> 00:46:01.842
Survival.

611
00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:04.427
Nothing more.

612
00:46:18.567 --> 00:46:20.068
I have children. Five.

613
00:46:22.571 --> 00:46:24.448
Children who need me.

614
00:46:25.866 --> 00:46:26.992
And I need them.

615
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.121
I know.

616
00:46:34.166 --> 00:46:36.543
But we don't know
what we're going back to.

617
00:46:37.211 --> 00:46:38.837
It could all be gone. and...

618
00:46:40.339 --> 00:46:42.341
at least here. we have each other.

619
00:46:49.556 --> 00:46:51.517
Stay if you want. I'm going back.

620
00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:12.329
What's all this. then?

621
00:47:14.248 --> 00:47:15.332
The hell?

622
00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:21.088
Well. this is inconvenient.

623
00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:22.548
Where are the drivers?

624
00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:25.551
Go.

625
00:47:26.927 --> 00:47:27.927
Go. go!

626
00:47:48.031 --> 00:47:49.074
Incoming!

627
00:47:51.618 --> 00:47:52.953
Got 'em pinned!

628
00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:57.749
Take 'em out!

629
00:47:57.833 --> 00:48:00.002
Get in the car! Get in the car!

630
00:48:29.948 --> 00:48:31.199
What's going on?

631
00:48:31.283 --> 00:48:32.659
Stay the fuck down!

632
00:48:42.878 --> 00:48:44.171
Start the car!

633
00:48:49.051 --> 00:48:50.385
Go. go. go. go!

634
00:49:14.493 --> 00:49:15.493
You okay?

635
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:19.414
You tore my suit
when you threw me into the car.

636
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:23.877
Bill me.

637
00:49:27.255 --> 00:49:30.467
I can't speak to how
the other Hargreeves saw you.

638
00:49:31.343 --> 00:49:32.343
but...

639
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:36.014
it was wrong of him
to treat you the way he did.

640
00:49:38.266 --> 00:49:41.520
It is now abundantly clear
to this version of myself

641
00:49:43.188 --> 00:49:45.190
that you deserve to wear the uniform

642
00:49:45.273 --> 00:49:47.859
just as much. if not more.
than the others.

643
00:49:57.661 --> 00:50:01.415
- It shouldn't be much longer to the bank.
- I can't. I'm not gonna make it.

644
00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:04.543
- Can you hang on a little longer?
- Stop. I gotta lie down.

645
00:50:04.626 --> 00:50:07.129
- Okay. let me find somewhere.
- Right now!

646
00:50:19.474 --> 00:50:21.101
Don't worry. I got you.

647
00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:26.273
Come on. Let's get you inside.

648
00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:37.450
I found them.

649
00:50:43.415 --> 00:50:45.375
Hello? We need help!

650
00:50:47.502 --> 00:50:49.629
- I need to lie down. Now!
- All right.

651
00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:52.632
All right. stay here.
I'll go find somebody.

652
00:50:58.805 --> 00:50:59.639
It's ringing.

653
00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:01.641
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

654
00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:02.559
Jennifer?

655
00:51:02.642 --> 00:51:03.642
<i>Hello?</i>

656
00:51:04.144 --> 00:51:05.395
<i>Do you have an emergency?</i>

657
00:51:08.106 --> 00:51:09.107
Jennifer!

658
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:25.790
Jennifer.

659
00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:30.462
I'm scared. Ben.

660
00:52:03.495 --> 00:52:05.705
Someone can't take a hint.

661
00:52:20.929 --> 00:52:23.348
Jean! Jean!

662
00:52:32.357 --> 00:52:33.483
No!

663
00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:44.578
This all could have been so simple.

664
00:53:44.304 --> 00:53:45.764
You changed your shirt?

665
00:53:46.514 --> 00:53:48.934
The other one got stained.

666
00:53:49.476 --> 00:53:50.727
Chikkadoo sauce.

667
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.315
Mint chocolate chip.

668
00:53:56.983 --> 00:54:00.487
What's gotten into you. Gene?
You know that gives you the runs.

669
00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:06.952
Nothing wrong with living on the edge
from time to time. my love.

670
00:54:12.499 --> 00:54:13.625
Leaders.

671
00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:17.712
One of our teams found Ben and Jennifer.

672
00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:23.176
It's time to put out the call.

673
00:54:29.224 --> 00:54:30.224
Are you sure?

674
00:54:31.559 --> 00:54:32.727
Play the song.
