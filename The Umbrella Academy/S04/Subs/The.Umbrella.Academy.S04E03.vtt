00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.400
<i>Good evening. everyone.</i>

2
00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:26.609
<i>I'm Jessica Holmes.</i>

3
00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.611
<i>And I'm Dan Tenenbaum.</i>

4
00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.364
<i>We begin tonight
with a larger-than-life story</i>

5
00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:32.991
<i>down on Kensington Wharf.</i>

6
00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:36.244
<i>Action 9's very own Bailey Stone
is live with the story.</i>

7
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:38.705
{\an8}<i>That's right. Jessica.</i>

8
00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:41.458
{\an8}<i>I'm here with two local crabbers</i>

9
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:42.709
<i>who appear to have caught</i>

10
00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:47.756
<i>what may be the largest squid
ever recorded by man.</i>

11
00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.801
<i>Can you walk our viewers through
exactly what happened?</i>

12
00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:53.302
<i>Sure. Yeah.</i>

13
00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:57.098
<i>We was. uh. out there.
You know. a... a normal day.</i>

14
00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:58.767
<i>We was trying to haul in some claws</i>

15
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.604
<i>when Rolfe here. he said
that he snagged something real big.</i>

16
00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:03.688
<i>Real big. yeah.</i>

17
00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:05.356
<i>Yeah. huge like.</i>

18
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.692
<i>Yeah. I thought it was a fucking whale.</i>

19
00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.944
<i>So I says. "Go on! Reel 'er in!"</i>

20
00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:13.323
<i>Yeah. and I'm reeling 'er in. right.
and I'm reeling and reeling.</i>

21
00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.992
<i>Right. And then.
next thing you know. bang!</i>

22
00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.369
<i>- Yeah.
- Look at that. A big-ass squid.</i>

23
00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:19.621
<i>Real big. Yeah.</i>

24
00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:24.918
<i>What was going through your mind
when you saw that?</i>

25
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.754
<i>Uh. great question.
I was actually... I was hungry.</i>

26
00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:31.007
<i>- On account it was lunchtime.
- Yeah. we was gonna have hot dogs.</i>

27
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.843
<i>Okay. now getting back to the squid here.</i>

28
00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.682
<i>Dan. Jessica. I don't know
what is happening right now.</i>

29
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.811
<i>Something is moving inside the squid.</i>

30
00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:45.105
<i>I don't know if you guys
are getting this in the studio.</i>

31
00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:46.815
<i>but there seems like there's a...</i>

32
00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:48.691
<i>I... I mean. this is incredible.</i>

33
00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.778
<i>but I think I see a... face.</i>

34
00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:53.071
<i>- Here.
- Yes. yes.</i>

35
00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:57.367
<i>Uh. they are cutting inside the squid
to find out what is in there.</i>

36
00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:00.453
<i>Okay.</i>

37
00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.001
<i>What the fuck?</i>

38
00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:10.713
<i>Can you tell us what happened?</i>

39
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.010
<i>The Cleanse.</i>

40
00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:21.599
<i>As you can see. many questions remain.</i>

41
00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:23.643
<i>What is the Cleanse?</i>

42
00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:25.520
<i>Who is this little girl?</i>

43
00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:29.816
<i>Where did she come from.
and where will she go from here?</i>

44
00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.247
<i>Thanks for that report.
Bailey.</i>

45
00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:35.488
<i>Now. let's go to Liza King
in our Channel 9 chopper...</i>

46
00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:55.049
{\an8}Leave it to this clown car of a family
to botch a simple search and rescue.

47
00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:56.551
{\an8}For a second there. we had her.

48
00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:58.928
{\an8}Who were those weirdos
with the fanny packs?

49
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.764
{\an8}Was it me.
or did they smell like wet sheep?

50
00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.266
{\an8}Goats. I thought.

51
00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.226
{\an8}- Mmm.
- Maybe llamas.

52
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.436
{\an8}Who cares?

53
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.022
{\an8}And why did they call you Nancy?

54
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.445
{\an8}Their names are Gene and Jean.

55
00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:19.157
{\an8}They run an underground organization
called the Keepers.

56
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:20.991
{\an8}Sex cult?

57
00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:22.619
{\an8}No. not a sex cult...

58
00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.163
{\an8}Once you get to the top.
it's always a sex cult.

59
00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:26.539
Yeah. The man's got a point.

60
00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:29.876
They're an extremist group
who believe they have memories

61
00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.502
from an alternate timeline.

62
00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:34.088
- Some of their memories are bang on.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:38.384
They're calling this phenomenon
the "Umbrella Effect."

64
00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.888
Ugh. How is this even possible?

65
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:44.182
Well. you know.
we're still working on that.

66
00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:46.935
What do they want with Jennifer?

67
00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:50.939
Great. You don't know that either.

68
00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:52.398
Hey. hey. hey.

69
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.275
Are you okay?

70
00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.986
I'm absolutely fine. thanks to you.

71
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.659
Look. Are you mad at me
because I saved your life?

72
00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.535
I was very clear. was I not?

73
00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.205
No marigold.

74
00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.791
I know. Klaus.
What was I supposed to do? Let you die?

75
00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:13.086
I know. It's just three whole years
down the drain.

76
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.006
Three years clean and sober.
But this is what you wanted. right?

77
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.302
What are you talking about?

78
00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:24.847
I'm talking about this.
Our little parasitic relationship.

79
00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:28.601
The eternal screwup and his <i>holy</i> savior.

80
00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:30.228
As long as I'm around.

81
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:33.398
you don't have to look directly
at your empty pit of a life.

82
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:36.526
Wow! You know what?
Maybe you should take it down a notch.

83
00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.362
No. I think I'll take it up a notch.
shall we?

84
00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:42.907
I mean. dysfunction is. after all.
what we do best in this family.

85
00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.576
We got daddy issues!
Daddy issues!

86
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.995
Chaos junkie.

87
00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:49.706
Mommy issues.

88
00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.124
More daddy issues.

89
00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:53.960
Obnoxious asshole issues.

90
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.587
Then you...

91
00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:02.302
you seem kind of weirdly self-actualized.
as far as I can tell.

92
00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:06.055
Anyway. I'm just so done living.

93
00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.560
cowering in your
little bubble of superiority.

94
00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:13.896
So this is the thanks I get
for taking care of you

95
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.273
for the past five years?

96
00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:18.151
- I think you've got that back-to-front.
- Oh!

97
00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:20.570
Who took care of you since Ray walked out?

98
00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.280
None of these guys gave a shit.

99
00:05:22.363 --> 00:05:23.781
Who took care of little Claire

100
00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:27.327
while you bombed
every shitty audition in town?

101
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.747
So you think that I like
having a grown man living in my basement.

102
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.875
covering my entire house in bubble wrap?

103
00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.670
You think I like picking your sorry ass up
every time you hit rock bottom?

104
00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.340
Bottom? <i>Moi?</i>

105
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.720
There's no bottom here. missy.
No bottom at all.

106
00:05:45.803 --> 00:05:48.222
I'm the goddamn Mariana Trench!

107
00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:51.309
- Wait till you see.
- You know what? Fine.

108
00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:54.395
- Fine. Jump off the deep end.
- I will.

109
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.356
That is so clearly what you wanna do.

110
00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.900
Have fun. and see if I give a shit!

111
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.650
Thank you.

112
00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.487
Truly. thank you.

113
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.114
Finally. a grain of honesty.

114
00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.742
It feels good.
Feels refreshing!

115
00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:11.329
You wanted the old Klaus. You got him.

116
00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.458
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

117
00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:18.544
Look out. Klaus!

118
00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.797
You know what? Actually. while we're here.

119
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.549
does anybody else have some shit
they wanna get off their chest?

120
00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:24.801
Because now's the time.

121
00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.055
No?

122
00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:31.848
No takers?

123
00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.603
Good. I'm done being
the bad guy in this family.

124
00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:42.527
Now that the show's over.
what are we going to do about Jennifer?

125
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.820
We need to find her.

126
00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.908
We're not going anywhere
in this piece of shit.

127
00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:51.285
He said I was the best one. so...

128
00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:52.286
Just saying.

129
00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.086
Careful.

130
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:02.422
Mm-hmm.

131
00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:03.965
- Careful.
- Yeah. sure.

132
00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:10.179
Hey. Ben?

133
00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.722
What? What do you want?

134
00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.475
Uh. it's three o'clock.

135
00:07:15.184 --> 00:07:17.061
Time to check in with your parole officer.

136
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.773
Oh. right. I can't wait to catch him up
on what I've been up to.

137
00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:23.234
Crossing state lines.
shooting up a whole town.

138
00:07:23.317 --> 00:07:24.735
flipping a Volkswagen.

139
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.779
Good idea.

140
00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:27.863
Moron.

141
00:07:30.074 --> 00:07:31.074
All right.

142
00:07:31.742 --> 00:07:34.162
I need a run
on a Chrysler LeBaron Town & Country.

143
00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:36.330
'80. '81.

144
00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:41.127
Brown. simulated woodgrain sides.
New Mexico plates.

145
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.297
Look for matches
with an owner first name Gene.

146
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.508
That is Golf-Echo-November-Echo.

147
00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:51.137
Or Jean.
That's Juliet-Echo-Alpha-November.

148
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.722
Know what's strange?

149
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.309
All those people back in New Grumpson.

150
00:07:57.059 --> 00:08:00.688
They were wearing
Hargreeves-branded military gear.

151
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:04.275
Luther. the entire goddamn place
was a Hargreeves town.

152
00:08:04.358 --> 00:08:07.195
It's like it was designed
to keep Jennifer hostage.

153
00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.030
What's so important about her anyway?

154
00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:11.407
Isn't it obvious?

155
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.742
She's one of us.

156
00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:15.328
- No. No way.
- I mean. that would make sense.

157
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:17.580
Why else would Dad build
a <i>Truman Show</i> around her?

158
00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:19.332
The guy played us. all right?

159
00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:21.542
Nothing Jennifer said
jibed with Sy's story.

160
00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:24.921
They're both gone now.
so that leaves us with two shitty options.

161
00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:28.841
We either go after the Keepers
or. worse. talk to Dad.

162
00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:31.552
Come on. man.

163
00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:34.764
Think we need to split up. Me and Lila
will follow up with the Keepers.

164
00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:36.432
The rest of you go talk to Dad.

165
00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.517
Uh-uh.

166
00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.310
I'm going with you.

167
00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:42.772
And I'm going after Jennifer.

168
00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:44.649
It's better if we stick together.

169
00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:45.775
No. it's not.

170
00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:48.361
And this little field trip proved it.

171
00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:52.365
You're awfully gung ho for a person
that didn't wanna go in the first place.

172
00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:55.201
You're all a bunch of clowns.
I'm going on my own.

173
00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:57.537
Ben.

174
00:08:58.162 --> 00:08:59.830
Don't you walk away from me.

175
00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.000
And then there were six.

176
00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:17.557
Look.

177
00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:20.476
The reason that they call me Nancy is...

178
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.686
I already know.

179
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:22.769
Know what?

180
00:09:24.438 --> 00:09:25.523
I followed you.

181
00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:27.900
The other night.

182
00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:30.695
You what?
What. so you're spying on me now?

183
00:09:31.612 --> 00:09:32.822
I saw you.

184
00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:37.159
You were in the café with... with him.

185
00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.243
With who?

186
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.121
Don't play dumb.

187
00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:44.959
The little Greek guy with the mustache.

188
00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:54.010
Is that funny to you?

189
00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:59.098
Yeah. trust me.
That is absolutely hilarious.

190
00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:02.226
Our kids are gonna grow up
in a broken home. and you're laughing.

191
00:10:03.477 --> 00:10:06.772
Diego. the... the little guy.

192
00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.149
the little Greek guy.

193
00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:09.900
is Five.

194
00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:15.531
Yeah. We've been undercover
investigating the Keepers.

195
00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:17.491
You've been lying?

196
00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:20.077
And you're working undercover
with the CIA?

197
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.581
This is why I didn't tell you.
You'd have some bizarre reaction.

198
00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:25.207
I'm not having a bizarre reaction.

199
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.169
- You're acting like I had an affair.
- It's worse.

200
00:10:28.252 --> 00:10:31.547
Okay. as much as I would love to unpack
whatever this is.

201
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.467
we have much more important things
to think about.

202
00:10:36.218 --> 00:10:38.220
It's because he's in the CIA. huh?

203
00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:40.931
I'm just a dumb delivery driver.

204
00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:42.475
No. Diego.

205
00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:43.893
Then why?

206
00:10:44.685 --> 00:10:46.854
Because I needed something
for myself. okay?

207
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:52.318
Something other than changing diapers
and wine moms and ballet class.

208
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.613
At least you get to get
outside the house every day.

209
00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:01.077
I'm just trapped
in this unending suburban hellscape.

210
00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:06.248
I mean. that's good to know.
That the life we built is so bad.

211
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.627
That's not what I meant.

212
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:14.674
You think I like delivering packages
day in and day out?

213
00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:16.926
Busting my ass?

214
00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:18.094
Oh. trust me.

215
00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:20.221
I'd rather be out there cracking skulls.

216
00:11:20.304 --> 00:11:24.016
but. I mean. somebody's gotta show up
for this marriage. because...

217
00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:26.977
it sure as hell ain't you.

How about some fresh clothes
hot from the dryer?

226

Who... Who are you?

227
00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:07.787
I'm Dr. Jean. with a J.

228
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.206
And I'm Dr. Gene. with a G.

229
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.627
We'll let you decide
which is the dominant Jean...

230

And which is recessive.

What the hell is going on?

232
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.473
Am I a prisoner?

233
00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:31.060
- No!
- No. of course not. You're our guest.

234
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.440
We have been looking for you
for a very long time.

235
00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:39.652
We have so many questions
about the Cleanse.

236
00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:43.072
What are you talking about?

237
00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:44.573
The Cle... Uh...

238
00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:46.075
Oh.

239
00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:48.828
I get it. I get it. It's okay.

240
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:53.916
You have just been through
a very traumatic experience.

241
00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:58.087
That gang of miscreants.
they were trying to kidnap you.

242
00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.672
No. no.

243
00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:01.715
They... They were... Uh...

244
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.550
They were...

245
00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.928
They were what. hon?

246
00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:11.350
Well. thank goodness
we got you when we did.

247
00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:13.269
Who knows what might've happened to you.

248
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.897
Is there anyone
we can call for you?

249
00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:18.858
Mom? Dad?

250
00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:20.441
Maybe a friend?

251
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:28.033
They're all gone.

252
00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:30.327
My whole life.

253
00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:31.954
It was all a lie.

254
00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:34.999
Am I just part of someone's sick joke?

255
00:14:35.082 --> 00:14:36.542
It's okay. hon.

256
00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:38.711
You're safe now.

257
00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:40.713
No. uh. I gotta go.

258
00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:47.970
Hush now. darling.

259
00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:52.224
You just let Jean and Gene
take care of you. hmm?

260
00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:53.309
That's right.

261
00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:55.769
Here.
This will make you feel better.

262
00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:00.064
Go on.

263
00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:12.202
Not bad. right?

264
00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:18.167
You know. not everybody likes
alpaca milk right away.

265
00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:21.295
Notoriously hard to milk.

266
00:15:21.378 --> 00:15:22.755
Small teats.

267
00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:25.132
Just like...

268
00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:35.726
So this is book club. huh? Nancy?

269
00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:37.311
Oh. shut up. Diego.

270
00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:41.065
Oh Jesus!

271
00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:47.529
You drive.

272
00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:48.781
You sure? Wanda?

273
00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:50.866
Yeah. I don't give a shit anymore.

274
00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:59.166
She's pulling to the right a little bit.

275
00:15:59.249 --> 00:16:01.919
And don't go over 40.
or the muffler's gonna fall off.

276
00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:04.545
Got it.

277
00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:09.718
Welcome to the Keepers HQ.
courtesy of Jean and Gene.

278
00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:20.020
Jean and Gene
didn't give us much to go on.

279
00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:22.064
Stay focused for once. darling.

280
00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.489
All the files are gone.

281
00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:33.117
Yeah. it certainly looks that way.

282
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.870
While you two stand around
twiddling your dinks. I got recon to do.

283
00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:38.580
There's nothing here. Diego.

284
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:41.500
- Our targets left in a hurry. correct?
- Yeah.

285
00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:42.583
So?

286
00:16:42.626 --> 00:16:46.296
So... haste makes waste. <i>mami.</i>

287
00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:51.552
Out with it. Why can't you blink?

288
00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:53.303
I can blink.

289
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.180
You know. I just...

290
00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:57.181
Won't.

291
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.728
You gotta get back
on that horse. <i>kemosabe.</i>

292
00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:01.811
Don't!

293
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.230
Don't!

294
00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:06.608
Whoa! Where are we?

295
00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:09.319
A subway station.

296
00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:12.406
I can see that. numbnuts.
but why did you blink us here?

297
00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:15.409
Believe me. Lila. it was not on purpose.

298
00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:19.371
Ever since Ben spiked us
with that janky marigold.

299
00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:21.415
when I blink. this is where I end up.

300
00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:24.501
- Neat.
- Not really.

301
00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:26.377
What's down here?

302
00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:28.297
Oh!

303
00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:32.634
Okay. not the MTA. Not the Tube.

304
00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:35.262
Trust me. this is
unlike any subway you've been to.

305
00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:37.097
Well. where do the trains go?

306
00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.307
That's the weird part.

307
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.226
I took a westbound train.
I went one station over.

308
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.229
When I came up. it was
the exact same day. exact same time.

309
00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:46.148
but a completely different timeline.

310
00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:49.068
Now that's interesting.

311
00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:51.028
Yeah.

312
00:17:52.112 --> 00:17:53.112
A map.

313
00:17:53.697 --> 00:17:55.032
That's helpful. innit?

314
00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:57.117
If I could understand it.

315
00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.495
I once navigated the Tokyo subway

316
00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:02.039
with a bullet wound in my thigh
and on my period.

317
00:18:02.122 --> 00:18:03.957
so how hard can it be?

318
00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.294
Okay. so...

319
00:18:08.003 --> 00:18:11.298
North to south. This connects around here.

320
00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:14.176
Fuck me. this is confusing.

321
00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:18.263
Eastbound. Shall we?

322
00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:19.848
We should get back to Diego.

323
00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:22.893
Boring. Come on. Let's take a ride.

324
00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:25.687
I don't wanna be hopping on trains
until we understand this.

325

Uh. what are you doing?

343
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.875
You know. this TV has...

344
00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:30.502
been on the fritz for a while.

345
00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:31.795
Haven't you noticed?

346
00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:35.424
I just thought I'd take her down
to the old geek lab

347
00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:37.634
and let them work their magic.

Hey. careful! Careful of your feet!

349
00:19:40.053 --> 00:19:42.973
Your feet on the glass.
Watch your feet on the glass.

350
00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:46.727
That was an accident.

351
00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:52.274
And I'll pay you back.

352
00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:55.068
Uncle Klaus.

353
00:19:56.236 --> 00:19:59.948
whatever happened. why don't we just
sit down and talk about it?

354
00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:02.242
I appreciate your input. Claire Bear.

355
00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:05.078
and I'd be happy
to discuss it at a later date. but...

356
00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:10.834
However. your Uncle Klaus has had
a truly... horrible day.

357
00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:12.586
and he just can't...

358
00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:19.384
he just can't have this conversation
right now. I'm sorry.

359
00:20:21.261 --> 00:20:22.554
Come on. Uncle Klaus.

360
00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:25.182
Are things so bad
a drink won't make it worse?

361
00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:35.317
No. it's too late.

362
00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:38.987
- No.
- It's too late.

363
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.864
No. it isn't.

364
00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:42.783
Yeah. it is. I'm going.

365
00:20:42.866 --> 00:20:44.952
Please. just talk to me for a minute?

366
00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:46.161
Will you move. please?

367
00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:49.873
- We could just get through this together...
- Will you please just fucking move?

368
00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:51.166
Now!

369
00:21:02.844 --> 00:21:07.474
I already told you that it's too... late.

370
00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:27.953
Damn. it smells like ass.

371
00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:33.041
Jesus!

372
00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:51.852
Dr. Jean Thibedeau.

373
00:22:11.371 --> 00:22:12.581
The Cleanse?

374
00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:16.668
Come to <i>papi.</i>

375
00:22:22.966 --> 00:22:23.967
Come on.

376
00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:28.054
Yucko.

377
00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:32.266
Gross.

378
00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:42.027
Dear diary.

379
00:22:42.819 --> 00:22:44.988
why do I always wear suits?

380
00:22:46.406 --> 00:22:47.407
Hmm.

381
00:22:48.658 --> 00:22:50.035
What are you doing?

382
00:22:50.118 --> 00:22:53.038
Leaving bread crumbs.
It's a broken vending machine.

383
00:22:53.121 --> 00:22:55.123
Stain on the floor
in the shape of Australia.

384
00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:57.626
- Three burnt-out light bulbs.
- Mmm. Poetic.

385
00:23:01.588 --> 00:23:02.506
Yep.

386
00:23:02.589 --> 00:23:04.299
Where do you reckon we end up?

387
00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:06.843
My guess is
back in Gene and Jean's apartment.

388
00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:10.847
- Same day. same time. different timeline.
- Different timeline. I knew it.

389
00:23:17.187 --> 00:23:18.397
Shows what you know.

390
00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:21.983
You must have jumped forward.
ahead of time. to the end of the world.

391
00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:24.611
No. no. no. We haven't jumped anywhere.

392
00:23:24.694 --> 00:23:27.531
We're not moving forwards
or backwards through time.

393
00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:30.409
We're just going
to alternate versions of now.

394
00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:32.285
This is Gene and Jean's apartment.

395
00:23:35.956 --> 00:23:37.290
I've been here before.

396
00:23:37.374 --> 00:23:38.834
This is my apocalypse.

397
00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:40.001
Your apocalypse?

398
00:23:40.627 --> 00:23:42.337
Yeah. the original timeline.

399
00:23:42.838 --> 00:23:44.631
I was stuck here for 40 years.

400
00:23:44.714 --> 00:23:48.093
This is the timeline where Viktor
blew up the moon and we didn't stop it.

401
00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:51.304
Well. this is a very shitty timeline.

402
00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:54.558
Hold on a second.

403
00:23:55.642 --> 00:23:56.642
Binoculars?

404
00:23:58.437 --> 00:23:59.438
What?

405
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:04.985
Did you just fart?

406
00:24:05.068 --> 00:24:06.069
Get down!

407
00:24:10.657 --> 00:24:12.909
- Who the hell is shooting at us?
- I am.

408
00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:22.043
Okay. We need to get out of here. Go!

409
00:24:22.836 --> 00:24:23.962
Wait for me!

410
00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:32.262
I must improve my cardio.

411
00:24:42.022 --> 00:24:42.856
Shit.

412
00:24:44.232 --> 00:24:45.232
The hell are you doing?

413
00:24:46.401 --> 00:24:47.903
Did you find something. love?

414
00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:49.404
Oh. I found something.

415
00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:52.449
Something that's gonna
blow this case wide open.

416
00:24:54.951 --> 00:24:55.994
Okay.

417
00:24:57.621 --> 00:24:58.997
Let's see.

418
00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:03.835
Umbrella Academy.

419
00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:07.047
That's impossible.
There was no Umbrella Academy in 2006.

420
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.507
Not in this timeline.

421
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.259
It must be one of
Gene and Jean's artifacts.

422
00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:12.594
Keep reading.

423
00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:15.347
October 14th. 2006.

424
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.975
Wait. what's so special
about October 14th. 2006?

425
00:25:19.559 --> 00:25:20.685
The day Ben died.

426
00:25:21.728 --> 00:25:22.562
Our Ben.

427
00:25:22.646 --> 00:25:24.189
That's a coincidence.

428
00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:26.149
Let me break it down for you.

429
00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:29.444
A random dry cleaner shows up
out of the blue

430
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:34.449
and hires us to go to New Grumpson. Maine.
to rescue a girl named Jennifer.

431
00:25:34.533 --> 00:25:36.326
The whole town goes to shit.

432
00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:37.410
we get T-boned.

433
00:25:37.494 --> 00:25:40.872
and the girl gets kidnapped
by two vigilantes in a station wagon.

434
00:25:40.956 --> 00:25:43.250
Now. in their trash.

435
00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:47.087
we find a foreign document
that has something to do with Ben's death.

436
00:25:48.088 --> 00:25:49.256
Hence...

437
00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:54.970
whatever is going on with Jennifer.

438
00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:56.805
it's got something to do with Ben.

439
00:25:57.305 --> 00:25:59.391
Ipso facto. mofos.

440
00:25:59.975 --> 00:26:02.310
Bet you regret
not sending in that resume. huh?

441
00:26:04.354 --> 00:26:06.856
The hell's the "Jennifer incident"?

442
00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:09.776
That was a tragic accident.

443
00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:27.335
Hello. Benjamin.

444
00:26:29.337 --> 00:26:31.965
Sy. where the hell have you been?

445
00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:34.718
Where's my daughter? Did you find her?

446
00:26:34.801 --> 00:26:36.428
Oh. we found her all right.

447
00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:40.640
We got lit up by a bunch of
friendly townsfolk strapped with Uzis.

448
00:26:40.724 --> 00:26:42.434
I said it was a dangerous job.

449
00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:45.854
You also said she was your daughter.
which is total horseshit.

450
00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:47.689
She has no idea who you are.

451
00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:49.232
Why are you even here?

452
00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:52.944
- So you talked to her?
- Yeah.

453
00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:55.238
We totally hung out.

454
00:26:55.905 --> 00:26:57.073
Nice girl. really.

455
00:26:58.074 --> 00:26:59.618
So now you understand.

456
00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:02.161
Understand what?

457
00:27:02.621 --> 00:27:04.331
How special she is.

458
00:27:05.248 --> 00:27:07.042
I mean. yeah. she seemed cool.

459
00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:12.088
To be honest.
I can't stop thinking about her.

460
00:27:16.676 --> 00:27:17.802
Where is she now?

461
00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:22.766
Taken by two weirdos with... fanny packs.

462
00:27:24.434 --> 00:27:27.812
Gene and... Jean something.

463
00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:30.815
Okay. listen to me very carefully.

464
00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:35.654
This is an extremely
volatile situation. okay?

465
00:27:35.737 --> 00:27:38.615
You can either believe me or not.
It doesn't matter.

466
00:27:38.698 --> 00:27:42.994
Either way. she's in grave danger.
We need to get her back immediately.

467
00:27:43.078 --> 00:27:46.206
- What do you think I'm doing here?
- Where are your siblings?

468
00:27:46.289 --> 00:27:48.708
Forget about those losers.
I'm running point now.

469
00:27:48.792 --> 00:27:50.502
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

470
00:27:50.585 --> 00:27:53.004
Hey. hey. hey. hey.

471
00:27:53.088 --> 00:27:54.589
What is...

472
00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:56.466
What is happening to me?

473
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:59.219
It's her. She's calling out to you.

474
00:27:59.302 --> 00:28:01.805
What? What are you talking about?

475
00:28:01.888 --> 00:28:03.014
I told you.

476
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.058
She's special.

477
00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:08.353
And you're special. too. Ben.

478
00:28:09.771 --> 00:28:12.148
Just listen to your body.

479
00:28:12.232 --> 00:28:15.026
She needs you. Ben.
She can't be out there on her own.

480
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.903
You've got to see this through.

481
00:28:16.986 --> 00:28:21.116
You have everything you need
to find her... within you.

482
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.328
Okay? Just close your eyes.

483
00:28:26.287 --> 00:28:27.789
Close your eyes.

484
00:28:28.832 --> 00:28:30.667
Listen to your body.

485
00:28:32.627 --> 00:28:35.338
Use your instincts.

486
00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:51.312
Everything all right. dear?

487
00:28:52.814 --> 00:28:54.357
Yeah. it's nothing.

488
00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:56.650
Come.

489
00:28:57.068 --> 00:28:59.320
- We wanna show you something.
- Yeah.

490
00:29:20.842 --> 00:29:22.260
Whoo!

491
00:29:22.343 --> 00:29:23.887
What is all this stuff?

492
00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:25.596
Proof.

493
00:29:26.806 --> 00:29:27.806
Proof of what?

494
00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:32.395
Proof that the world we live in
is one big. phony-baloney lie.

495
00:29:33.188 --> 00:29:34.731
At first. it was...

496
00:29:34.814 --> 00:29:35.982
it was like a dream.

497
00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:40.820
One of those dreams where you don't know
whether you're dreaming or not.

498
00:29:40.904 --> 00:29:42.405
But then.

499
00:29:43.364 --> 00:29:46.785
along came the artifacts.

500
00:29:46.868 --> 00:29:47.911
Whoo!

501
00:29:48.703 --> 00:29:53.750
Little tokens of proof.
slipping through time and space.

502
00:29:54.667 --> 00:29:58.546
Proof of the many-worlds theory
of quantum mechanics and such.

503
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:03.134
Better believe they called us every name
under the sun. Didn't they. Jean?

504
00:30:03.218 --> 00:30:06.221
Frauds. tricksters. charlatans.

505
00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:10.183
Accused us of intellectual dishonesty.

506
00:30:10.892 --> 00:30:11.892
Who's "they"?

507
00:30:12.352 --> 00:30:13.645
"Who's they"?

508
00:30:13.728 --> 00:30:17.106
The faculty at Golden Mesa
Community College. for starters.

509
00:30:17.857 --> 00:30:20.652
Our reputations were
dragged through the mud.

510
00:30:20.735 --> 00:30:22.445
Tenure. revoked.

511
00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:24.572
And all because

512
00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:27.700
we dared to speak the truth

513
00:30:27.784 --> 00:30:30.245
about these memories.

514
00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:34.082
Memories of another timeline.

515
00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:38.962
A timeline that felt so much more...

516
00:30:40.713 --> 00:30:41.713
More true.

517
00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:46.803
Where... I was teaching at Harvard.

518
00:30:46.886 --> 00:30:50.223
and Gene was a MacArthur fellow.

519
00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:53.184
Okay.

520
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:57.480
But. uh. what does all of this
have to do with me?

521
00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:00.399
Jennifer.

522
00:31:01.985 --> 00:31:03.111
You're the key.

523
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.616
The way to destroy all the false timelines
and restore the real one.

524
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.660
We're ready. sugar.

525
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.872
What do we need to do. huh?

526
00:31:13.955 --> 00:31:17.792
How can we help you
bring about the Cleanse?

527
00:31:22.755 --> 00:31:24.424
You people are...

528
00:31:24.924 --> 00:31:26.718
You people are fucking crazy.

529
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:27.635
Mmm!

530
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.220
Language. darling.

531
00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:32.223
Hey. help me! Somebody help me!

532
00:31:36.436 --> 00:31:38.271
We were so nice to you.

533
00:31:38.354 --> 00:31:40.356
Brought you into our home.

534
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.358
Gave you alpaca milk.

535
00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:47.739
Maybe seeing an old friend
will help jog your memory.

536
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.038
I believe you two are already acquainted.

537
00:32:05.465 --> 00:32:06.466
No.

538
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:12.555
Think about it. kiddo.

539
00:32:15.516 --> 00:32:16.935
Close 'er up. Rudy.

540
00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:22.065
No. no. no! No!

541
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:24.692
Wait! Wait!

542
00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:27.654
Don't leave me in here with it!

543
00:32:27.737 --> 00:32:31.574
Let me out! Please! No! Let me out!

544
00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:33.076
Let me out!

545
00:32:39.499 --> 00:32:40.859
Are we really doing this?

546
00:32:42.168 --> 00:32:43.168
Yeah.

547
00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:44.796
Yeah. we are.

548
00:32:46.214 --> 00:32:47.214
Hold on.

549
00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:52.053
You skipped the family reunions.
You barely call.

550
00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:54.764
You never submit anything
to the family newsletter.

551
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:59.060
And yet. here you are.
first in line to see Dad?

552
00:33:00.687 --> 00:33:01.688
What's with that?

553
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.858
I'm stuck. okay?

554
00:33:07.527 --> 00:33:11.322
I'm... I'm stuck in an endless argument
with him in my head.

555
00:33:11.406 --> 00:33:13.074
And I feel like...

556
00:33:14.283 --> 00:33:16.327
like the only way I can move forward is

557
00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:18.579
if I finally say my piece to him.

558
00:33:20.289 --> 00:33:22.917
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

559
00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:26.212
Just a... friendly reminder to the group

560
00:33:26.295 --> 00:33:28.756
that the last time
you spoke your piece with Dad.

561
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.841
he murdered you.

562
00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:33.094
I'm sure that won't happen again.

563
00:33:33.177 --> 00:33:34.554
Right?

564
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:38.266
We probably won't even
make it past the front door.

565
00:33:39.475 --> 00:33:40.893
If civility doesn't work.

566
00:33:40.977 --> 00:33:43.104
I'll just rumor their brains
all over the wall.

567
00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:45.023
Let's go.

568
00:33:51.946 --> 00:33:53.666
<i>Three people approaching.</i>

569
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.742
<i>Copy. We gotta help.</i>

570
00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:01.080
May I help you?

571
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:04.834
Yeah. you can run inside
and tell Reggie that we're coming in

572
00:34:04.917 --> 00:34:06.044
whether he likes it or not.

573
00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:12.133
Of course. Ms. Hargreeves. Welcome.

574
00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:13.509
We've been expecting you.

575
00:34:14.177 --> 00:34:15.845
Luther. Viktor.

576
00:34:15.928 --> 00:34:18.431
I'll escort you inside the house.
This way. please.

577
00:34:20.558 --> 00:34:22.393
What the hell is going on here?

578
00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:25.563
This better not be
another daddy-daughter ambush.

579
00:34:25.646 --> 00:34:26.981
Did you tell him we were coming?

580
00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:28.066
No.

581
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:30.526
I haven't talked to the man in five years.

582
00:35:10.316 --> 00:35:14.153
What a pleasure
to finally put faces to names.

583
00:35:21.911 --> 00:35:23.162
You must be Allison.

584
00:35:24.997 --> 00:35:27.166
I've heard so much about you.

585
00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:29.126
You have?

586
00:35:29.168 --> 00:35:30.169
Yes.

587
00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:35.424
And Luther... my little space boy.

588
00:35:37.176 --> 00:35:39.595
I finally get a chance
to properly thank you

589
00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:41.389
for watching over me on the moon.

590
00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:42.473
Oh!

591
00:35:43.474 --> 00:35:44.474
It was nothing.

592
00:35:50.189 --> 00:35:51.315
Dear Viktor.

593
00:35:54.527 --> 00:35:56.863
I understand we share a passion
for the violin.

594
00:35:57.697 --> 00:36:00.867
It's more of
a love-hate thing for me. but...

595
00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.120
Come.

596
00:36:05.872 --> 00:36:06.873
Come sit.

597
00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:14.297
Okay.

598
00:36:26.267 --> 00:36:28.352
Is. uh. Reggie home?

599
00:36:28.978 --> 00:36:31.272
I'm sure he's puttering around somewhere.

600
00:36:31.355 --> 00:36:33.900
Let us get to know each other a bit first.

601
00:36:36.485 --> 00:36:39.864
Go ahead. Don't be shy.
The chef will be cross if you don't.

602
00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:44.367
Tea?

603
00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:54.212
<i>♪ We can make each other happy ♪</i>

604
00:36:55.087 --> 00:36:58.174
<i>♪ Oh. we can make each other happy ♪</i>

605
00:36:58.841 --> 00:37:01.510
<i>♪ We can make each other happy ♪</i>

606
00:37:01.594 --> 00:37:04.722
<i>♪ We can make each other happy ♪</i>

607
00:37:08.517 --> 00:37:11.854
<i>♪ You can climb a mountain ♪</i>

608
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:17.902
Well. I'll be damned.

609
00:37:25.952 --> 00:37:26.952
Yo.

610
00:37:27.995 --> 00:37:29.789
- Quinn.
- Klaus.

611
00:37:29.872 --> 00:37:32.291
What a delightful surprise.

612
00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:36.754
I thought you were dead.
but it turns out you can float.

613
00:37:36.837 --> 00:37:40.675
You know. the whole death. rebirth.
death. rebirth. death...

614
00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:43.010
It's a vicious cycle. You look well.

615
00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:44.136
The beard.

616
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.598
It's very... robust.

617
00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:48.516
Thank you.

618
00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:51.644
You look like the same degenerate.
smackhead piece of shit

619
00:37:51.727 --> 00:37:52.979
that owes me money.

620
00:37:53.062 --> 00:37:54.438
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

621
00:37:55.314 --> 00:37:57.441
What was that? Like. five grand?

622
00:37:58.401 --> 00:38:01.737
I don't really...
I don't have much cash on me.

623
00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:05.866
- Try 40.
- Forty?

624
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.661
No. <i>mon frère.</i>
You've got me confused with someone else.

625
00:38:08.744 --> 00:38:11.706
The vig's been running five years. Klaus.

626
00:38:13.582 --> 00:38:15.793
Hands... Oh!

627
00:38:15.876 --> 00:38:17.295
The math is good.

628
00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:21.257
Look. Quinn. you know.

629
00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.969
we could stand here
and debate dollars and cents all day long.

630
00:38:25.052 --> 00:38:27.054
but I think you and I both know

631
00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:29.515
I don't have your money.

632
00:38:29.598 --> 00:38:32.393
And even if you gave me the time.

633
00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:33.978
I wouldn't get it.

634
00:38:34.061 --> 00:38:39.650
So if you could find it
in that dark. black pagan heart of yours

635
00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:40.860
to forgive the debt...

636
00:38:40.943 --> 00:38:43.988
How about I rip one of those pretty eyes
out of that head of yours

637
00:38:44.071 --> 00:38:45.323
and wear it around my neck.

638
00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:46.866
You could do that. I suppose.

639
00:38:46.949 --> 00:38:49.910
Or you could save us both
the stress and the energy

640
00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:53.414
and the headache and the time
and kill me right now.

641
00:38:56.042 --> 00:38:58.085
Where's that gun at?
Where are you keeping it?

642
00:38:58.169 --> 00:38:59.837
Keep your hands to yourself. you weirdo.

643
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.922
- The back of the waist?
- Stop it!

644
00:39:13.517 --> 00:39:15.728
You always were a sick puppy.

645
00:39:15.811 --> 00:39:16.811
Ruff!

646
00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:18.272
Not in the face. please.

647
00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:26.530
Junkie piece of shit.

648
00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:30.033
Jesus.

649
00:39:50.763 --> 00:39:52.890
Son of a bitch.

650
00:39:58.854 --> 00:40:00.940
Must be quite cold in Canada.

651
00:40:02.358 --> 00:40:03.984
I mean. yeah.

652
00:40:04.068 --> 00:40:05.653
I mean. it can be.

653
00:40:06.654 --> 00:40:08.531
The summers are quite pleasant.

654
00:40:10.616 --> 00:40:14.578
And Luther. what about you?
What do you do?

655
00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:15.871
Oh! Um...

656
00:40:16.455 --> 00:40:18.040
I'm a professional dancer.

657
00:40:19.542 --> 00:40:21.127
- A dancer?
- Yeah.

658
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:22.378
How wonderful!

659
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:28.634
You've all done so well for yourselves.
No thanks to your father. I might add.

660
00:40:28.717 --> 00:40:30.010
I heard that.

661
00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:33.431
My chief of security informs me

662
00:40:33.514 --> 00:40:36.016
that the tiny hamlet
of New Grumpson. Maine.

663
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:40.271
is still smoldering
in the wake of your colossal ineptitude.

664
00:40:40.354 --> 00:40:42.064
Reggie. darling. please.

665
00:40:42.148 --> 00:40:45.526
Tell me everything I want to know now
or suffer the consequences.

666
00:40:45.609 --> 00:40:47.194
You first.

667
00:40:47.903 --> 00:40:49.864
- Hey. hey.
- Whoa!

668
00:40:50.614 --> 00:40:51.614
Ah!

669
00:40:52.074 --> 00:40:53.242
So it's true.

670
00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:58.080
I suspected you couldn't have done
all that damage au naturel.

671
00:40:58.164 --> 00:40:59.039
But how?

672
00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:00.791
Reggie. enough.

673
00:41:00.875 --> 00:41:03.210
Is this really how you treat your guests?

674
00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:05.379
Threats and interrogations?

675
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.256
Now. sit down.

676
00:41:07.339 --> 00:41:10.176
and we'll have a conversation
like a civilized species.

677
00:41:11.343 --> 00:41:14.221
Guess we know who wears the monocle
in this relationship.

678
00:41:15.973 --> 00:41:17.308
Tea. darling?

679
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.935
No. thank you. darling.

680
00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:24.690
If I may be so bold as to ask.

681
00:41:24.773 --> 00:41:27.776
how did you regain your powers?

682
00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:31.113
Why did you destroy
the town of New Grumpson?

683
00:41:31.197 --> 00:41:32.197
And...

684
00:41:33.115 --> 00:41:35.367
what have you done with the girl?

685
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.747
Well. it's kind of a long story.

686
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.082
but it all started

687
00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:45.878
when we were approached by Sy Grossman.

688
00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:48.506
I'm unfamiliar with the name.

689
00:41:49.089 --> 00:41:50.883
- Oh.
- You know what. Reg?

690
00:41:50.966 --> 00:41:52.426
I think the real question is

691
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:55.262
why you'd build an entire town
to hold a girl prisoner?

692
00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:57.389
Her name is Jennifer.

693
00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:00.351
And I wasn't holding her prisoner.

694
00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:02.520
I was protecting her.

695
00:42:03.103 --> 00:42:04.605
Protecting her from what?

696
00:42:05.231 --> 00:42:07.316
From you. naturally.

697
00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:09.944
So she is one of us.

698
00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:11.403
I'm afraid not.

699
00:42:12.071 --> 00:42:14.031
She's nothing like you.

700
00:42:14.114 --> 00:42:18.494
In fact. she's your complete opposite
in every way imaginable.

701
00:42:19.411 --> 00:42:23.207
And she has more power
than all of you put together.

702
00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.625
Hey!

703
00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:28.837
We need to talk about Ben.

704
00:42:47.648 --> 00:42:49.692
That is quite the gift you have.

705
00:42:49.775 --> 00:42:51.026
Well.

706
00:42:52.236 --> 00:42:54.738
gift and a curse. really.

707
00:43:00.452 --> 00:43:03.664
I think I've got an idea
how you're gonna pay off that debt.

708
00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:08.085
Oh. come on. Don't keep me in suspense.

709
00:43:11.964 --> 00:43:13.924
Asshole.

710
00:43:14.008 --> 00:43:15.926
In Moldovan.

711
00:43:16.635 --> 00:43:17.886
From Moldova.

712
00:43:18.554 --> 00:43:20.264
And it's mostly redacted.

713
00:43:20.347 --> 00:43:22.224
Great. So we can't read it or see it.

714
00:43:22.308 --> 00:43:25.603
From what I can tell. this document
is from our original timeline.

715
00:43:25.686 --> 00:43:27.313
It explains how Ben died.

716
00:43:27.396 --> 00:43:29.523
It refers to it
as the "Jennifer incident."

717
00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:31.483
We already know how Ben died.

718
00:43:31.567 --> 00:43:33.444
Okay. then. Tell us.

719
00:43:35.237 --> 00:43:38.073
Well. it was a tragic accident.

720
00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:42.453
Ben. our Ben. died
because we failed as a team.

721
00:43:43.704 --> 00:43:46.040
Nobody was responsible. and...

722
00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:49.542
And what?

723
00:43:53.255 --> 00:43:54.673
Allison. how did Ben die?

724
00:43:56.425 --> 00:43:57.843
It was a tragic accident.

725
00:43:58.344 --> 00:44:00.888
- Ben died because we failed as a team.
- Failed as a team.

726
00:44:01.513 --> 00:44:04.933
Nobody was responsible.
yet we were all responsible.

727
00:44:05.726 --> 00:44:08.687
Ben Hargreeves represented the best of us.

728
00:44:09.605 --> 00:44:11.857
Ben was the Umbrella Academy.

729
00:44:14.276 --> 00:44:16.111
What kind of sick party trick is this?

730
00:44:16.195 --> 00:44:19.907
Okay. can any one of you remember
how Ben actually died?

731
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.660
Anything?

732
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.039
I... I wasn't there.

733
00:44:27.122 --> 00:44:29.625
Well. neither was I.
but the rest of you were.

734
00:44:29.708 --> 00:44:33.253
You think you'd remember something
about the death of your beloved brother.

735
00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:34.630
but you don't.

736
00:44:34.713 --> 00:44:37.925
- What the hell is going on here?
- Isn't it obvious?

737
00:44:38.008 --> 00:44:40.678
Someone's been playing putty
with your hippocampus.

738
00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:42.221
Messing with our memories.

739
00:44:44.223 --> 00:44:46.809
As fascinating as this may be.

740
00:44:46.892 --> 00:44:50.062
I assure you I haven't the foggiest notion
of what this is about.

741
00:44:51.105 --> 00:44:52.564
You know something. old man.

742
00:44:52.648 --> 00:44:56.694
You are speculating about the actions of
a completely different version of myself

743
00:44:56.777 --> 00:44:58.821
from a completely different timeline.

744
00:44:58.904 --> 00:45:00.030
That said.

745
00:45:01.115 --> 00:45:02.950
it does sound like something I might do.

746
00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:04.868
Oh. here we go.

747
00:45:04.952 --> 00:45:07.871
There may or may not have been

748
00:45:07.955 --> 00:45:10.332
a certain clandestine project

749
00:45:10.833 --> 00:45:14.253
with a certain clandestine
intelligence agency.

750
00:45:14.336 --> 00:45:16.672
Human experiments on the mind.

751
00:45:16.755 --> 00:45:18.006
I should have known.

752
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:21.343
Psychological warfare was all the rage
in the '60s.

753
00:45:21.427 --> 00:45:23.178
but it was only a brief contract.

754
00:45:23.262 --> 00:45:24.471
Immensely lucrative.

755
00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:26.765
So you can erase memories?

756
00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:29.810
With the human mind.
anything is possible. young man.

757
00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:31.979
If you can erase them.
you can restore them?

758
00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:34.314
- With the proper technology.
- Which you have?

759
00:45:35.441 --> 00:45:36.441
Naturally.

760
00:45:36.817 --> 00:45:38.694
It's in this building somewhere.

761
00:45:38.777 --> 00:45:41.363
All right. old man.
you're gonna put 'em back.

762
00:45:41.447 --> 00:45:44.032
each and every memory
to do with Ben's death.

763
00:45:44.116 --> 00:45:47.536
Because if you erased
the Jennifer incident.

764
00:45:47.619 --> 00:45:49.705
that means there was something
important enough

765
00:45:49.788 --> 00:45:51.707
that you'd take the time to get rid of it.

766
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:53.208
I will do no such thing!

767
00:45:53.292 --> 00:45:55.753
We need to track down the girl
before it's too late.

768
00:45:55.836 --> 00:45:57.463
Reggie. please.

769
00:45:57.546 --> 00:46:00.382
Darling. this is messy work.
It could take hours. days.

770
00:46:00.466 --> 00:46:02.926
Whatever chain of events
has been set in motion

771
00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:05.763
is ultimately your handiwork.

772
00:46:05.846 --> 00:46:10.434
Whatever timeline it happened in.
help them.

773
00:46:10.517 --> 00:46:11.769

Shame.

811
00:49:01.229 --> 00:49:03.273
They were real good workers too.

812
00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:06.443
Yeah. but shooting them
would have ruined everything.

813
00:49:06.944 --> 00:49:08.654
We did what we had to do.

Just lean back and relax. Luther.

818
00:49:29.758 --> 00:49:30.926
Yeah. right.

819
00:49:33.845 --> 00:49:36.974
Do we all have to do this?
Can't you just do it to one of us?

820
00:49:37.057 --> 00:49:40.769
Fragments of your original memories
are still locked away in your minds.

821
00:49:41.436 --> 00:49:43.939
They are all integral pieces
of a bigger puzzle.

822
00:49:47.442 --> 00:49:49.069
I wanna be connected too.

823
00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:51.238
But you weren't on the mission.

824
00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:54.408
I wasn't on the team then. but I am now.

825
00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:57.119
and I wanna know the truth
as much as you do.

826
00:49:58.286 --> 00:50:00.247
Excellent. Please take a seat.

827
00:50:03.542 --> 00:50:06.670
- How about you?
- Yeah. I think I'm going to spectate.

828
00:50:07.254 --> 00:50:10.716
Ditto. No offense. but I'm not
letting you near my gray matter.

829
00:50:10.799 --> 00:50:13.260
Very well. Perhaps you could help.

830
00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:24.813
Any last words
before Dad liquifies my brain?

831
00:50:28.608 --> 00:50:30.569
I'm sorry I lied about book club.

832
00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:34.363
Good.

833
00:50:35.323 --> 00:50:38.410
You know. a husband and wife
shouldn't have any secrets. Lila.

834
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:39.911
That's a rule.

835
00:50:40.579 --> 00:50:41.663
You're right.

836
00:50:42.748 --> 00:50:43.874
No more secrets.

837
00:50:47.419 --> 00:50:49.671
I think that we need
a break from each other.

838
00:50:49.755 --> 00:50:52.257
- Time to reassess our marriage.
- What?

839
00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:17.074
Wait! Is this gonna hurt?

840
00:51:17.157 --> 00:51:18.617
Indubitably.

841
00:51:25.707 --> 00:51:27.459
<i>It was a tragic accident.</i>

842
00:51:27.542 --> 00:51:30.670
<i>Ben died because we failed as a team.</i>

843
00:51:31.296 --> 00:51:35.092
<i>Nobody was responsible.
yet we were all responsible.</i>

844
00:51:35.842 --> 00:51:38.428
<i>Ben Hargreeves represented the best of us.</i>

845
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.848
<i>Ben was the Umbrella Academy.</i>
