Luther. What's the matter with you?

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.706
Sorry. I'm... I'm going.

6
00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:43.001
I told you. no drugs
unless you're buying from me.

7
00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:46.087
No. no. I just had...
had a family reunion last night.

8
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.381
- Shut up and get on stage.
- Okay.

{\an8}Well. Viktor. that's what
we're all trying to figure out.

38

{\an8}Oh God. don't look at me.

{\an8}Oh. sorry about that.

- Be careful.
- How do you do that?

56
00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:14.796
A gun to my head. I couldn't tell you.

57
00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.050
Oh. come on! It took me months
to find these original sconces!

58
00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:21.469
I don't give a shit about your sconces.

59
00:04:21.552 --> 00:04:22.845
I want answers now.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.682

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:32.146
Relax. Kodiak Jack.

64
00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:45.158
It was me.

65
00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.043
<i>I know you're all too terminally emo
to do what had to be done.</i>

66
00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:58.798
<i>so I made an executive decision
and spiked your sake with the marigold.</i>

67
00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:04.178
Why am I not surprised?

68
00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.097
You had no right to do that. asshole!

69
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.182
Oh. trust me. you'll thank me later.

70
00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.059
Yeah. or I'll kick your ass right now.

71
00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:13.104
Oh yeah. Now. that I would love to see.

72
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.859
Ugh!

73
00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.694
What is with the tails?

74
00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:21.946
I don't know. They won't go back in!

75
00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:26.200
Oh! God. Why is it cold?

76
00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:28.494
The real question is.
why would you touch it?

77
00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.663
Forget about my tails. all right?

78
00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:34.000
I haven't felt this good in years.
Maybe you guys need to take some more.

79
00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:36.461
Okay. you know what? Give me that.

80
00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:38.004
Wait a minute. Hold on.

81
00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:40.423
Klaus. why aren't you sick?

82
00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:45.053
Here's to the non-existent
Umbrella Academy.

83
00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.137
<i>Kanpai!</i>

84
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:47.722
<i>Kanpai!</i>

85
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.773
<i>Well.
because one sake bomb is too many.</i>

86
00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:59.192
and a thousand is just never enough.

87
00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.106
You didn't drink.

88
00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.822
- No.
- Do you realize what you've done?

89
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.868
- Hey. All right!
- Hey. get off!

90
00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:13.790
Dude! I live here!

91
00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:17.585
The fact is you're all too busy living
in loser mindset

92
00:06:17.668 --> 00:06:20.171
to realize we're much better off this way.

93
00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:21.672
That wasn't your decision to make.

94
00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.884
Give me one good reason
why we shouldn't have our powers back.

95
00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:28.596
I don't know. Maybe because
we ended the world three times.

96
00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:30.306
We also saved it three times.

97
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.433
Well. that part's highly debatable. Diego.

98
00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:34.352
Forget about saving the world.

99
00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:37.438
I just spent five years
building a life for myself.

100
00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:38.731
A real life.

101
00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:43.569
Away from all this.
away from Dad. away from our past.

102
00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:47.198
And you had to go and fuck it all up
with one sake bomb!

103
00:06:55.706 --> 00:06:58.376
Look. I was trying to help.

104
00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:01.712
No. no. no. Viktor's right.
None of us asked for this.

105
00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:03.506
I could have lost my job.

106
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:04.966
- Did you?
- Wha...

107
00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:07.677
Well. actually. no.

108
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.805
My boss bumped me up
from brunch buffet to prime time.

109
00:07:10.888 --> 00:07:14.058
And I have been booked in Atlantic City
next weekend. But still!

110
00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:16.894
Come on. Allison.

111
00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:19.647
You can't tell me
you're not a little bit glad

112
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.692
to have your powers back
after all these years?

113
00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:27.155
Why would I be. Benjamin?
Why would I want my powers back?

114
00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:31.409
Maybe you can rumor your way out of
those corny-ass laundry commercials you do

115
00:07:31.492 --> 00:07:32.910
and finally get off the B-list.

116
00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:33.828
The...

117
00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:41.002
The B-list? Excuse me.

118
00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:44.297
I... I am the face of a national campaign.

119
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.466
something that I made happen
out of nothing

120
00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:49.844
while you were too busy
playing backgammon with Bernie Madoff.

121
00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:51.304
Tell him. sister.

122
00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:52.472
Wow.

123
00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:55.099
All right. all right. Klaus.
Come on. Klaus.

124
00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:58.561
My brother. it's not too late
for you to get in on this action.

125
00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:01.189
- I told you. It's not gonna happen.
- Why not?

126
00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:02.398
Maybe with your powers back.

127
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.942
you won't have to keep living life
like a human sippy cup.

128
00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:06.027
Huh?

129
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.280
It's a slippery slope. All right?

130
00:08:09.363 --> 00:08:10.490
Into what?

131
00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:13.326
Powers. ghosts. drugs. sex. oblivion.

132
00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:19.040
It's one big spicy gumbo of bad.
and I'm not going back to that old Klaus.

133
00:08:19.123 --> 00:08:22.168
I like this Klaus.
"Hey. he collects coupons."

134
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:25.004
"He's frugal. respectable. reliable."

135
00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:28.591
"And most importantly.
he's a Klaus that Claire likes."

136
00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:34.180
And trusts and looks up to.

137
00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:36.265
Guys. Ben doesn't look so hot.

138
00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.019
Come on.

139
00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:42.772
It's okay. I just need to lie down.

140
00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:45.566
Get him on this. Lay him down.

141
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.319
Whoa! What do we do? Call 911?

142
00:08:48.402 --> 00:08:49.570
No. no. no. no!

143
00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.614
No cops!

144
00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:54.116
All right. We need to go back
to the dry cleaners

145
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.535
and get more information.

146
00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:57.370
Agreed. I'll drive.

147
00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:58.371
Let's roll. mofos.

148
00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:00.248
Let's get him out of here. quick.

149
00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:02.875
Watch the tentacles.

150
00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.211
The state of the place.

151
00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:09.089
Hey.

152
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.050
You okay?

153
00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:14.595
No. not really.

154
00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.681
Yeah. I know.

155
00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:20.226
Come on.
Let's go figure this out together.

156
00:09:21.185 --> 00:09:22.979
You wanna get changed first?

157
00:09:24.188 --> 00:09:25.188
Right.

158
00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:55.970
Just... Just let me do...

159
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.231
Well.
looks like Sy flew the coop.

160
00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:10.192
Or somebody got to him.

161
00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.986
He did say he was in danger.

162
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.655
Look at this. New Grumpson. Maine.

163
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.535
- The hell's in New Grumpson?
- Maybe Sy's daughter. Jennifer.

164
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.955
Or maybe that's where
our dry cleaner scampered off to.

165
00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.915
Or maybe this is all one big setup.

166
00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:28.377
Well. there's only one way to find out.

167
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:29.462
Hell yeah.

168
00:10:30.212 --> 00:10:31.212
Road trip.

169
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.051
Really? Are we really doing this?

170
00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:36.552
Hell yeah. we're doing this.

171
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.680
You do realize
we have three small children. yeah?

172
00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:40.764
Lila.

173
00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.601
Look. hey. Today's Wednesday. okay?

174
00:10:43.684 --> 00:10:46.937
The twins have garden club.
and Grace has gymnastics. okay?

175
00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:48.939
Uncle Lenny can pick 'em up. okay?

176
00:10:49.023 --> 00:10:51.776
Yes. But wait. that's not the point.

177
00:10:51.859 --> 00:10:52.777
That <i>is</i> the point.

178
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.030
Look. I spend all day every day
with your family. all right?

179
00:10:56.113 --> 00:10:58.616
And I never ever complain. all right?

180
00:10:58.699 --> 00:11:00.242
You complain all the time.

181
00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:03.579
Okay. okay.
Well. look. this is... my family.

182
00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.543
I only have
one spare pair of underwear.

183
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:07.517
- You'll be fine.
- It might not be enough.

184
00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:10.044
All right? And I want you to come with me.

185
00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:14.465
Uncle Lenny. huh?

186
00:11:14.548 --> 00:11:17.718
Just you and me.
Like the old days. No kids.

187
00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:21.097
No kids.

188
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.768
Okay.

189
00:11:26.268 --> 00:11:28.145

She goes places. and she lies about it.

272

You know. she's got that book club.

273
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:25.734
Yeah. what is it?
A book club of two. Five?

274

- What are you talking about?
- Last night. I followed her.

275
00:16:29.446 --> 00:16:32.074
She was in some café with some guy.

276
00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:35.452
Some Greek-looking son of a bitch
with a creepy mustache.

277

- The mustache was creepy?
- Oh yeah.

278

on a little secret. okay?

346
00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:32.856
This is not the kind of place
where the customer is always right.

347
00:20:33.523 --> 00:20:36.610
It's the kind of place where
the customer is frequently wrong.

348
00:20:37.152 --> 00:20:38.152
and when he's rude.

349
00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:40.906
he gets boiling liquids
poured down the front of his chinos.

350
00:20:40.989 --> 00:20:43.242
You know what? Your attitude sucks.

351
00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:44.534
Where's your manager?

352
00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:45.911
Oh boy. Bad move.

353
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:51.124
Not only am I the manager.
but I'm also the owner.

354
00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:53.961
So. if you're worried about
somebody threatening your person.

355
00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:56.046
I would love to call the police.

356
00:20:56.129 --> 00:20:58.674
- Have them sort it out.
- No. No cops.

357
00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:00.217
That won't be necessary.

358
00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:03.512
Well. then may I suggest
being nicer to Gary.

359
00:21:04.471 --> 00:21:05.722
He's the town sheriff.

360
00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:13.729
Of course.

378
00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:11.038
Like. I'm happy.

379
00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:14.207
But we're not friends.

380
00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:21.006

Years. really.

408
00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.915
But that's no reason
to take it out on you.

409
00:25:01.082 --> 00:25:04.169
Well. everybody's had
a rough couple years.

00:25:07.297 --> 00:25:08.715

412
00:25:08.798 --> 00:25:13.428

Oh my God.

00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:18.517
You're the SparrowBit guy.

415
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.769
- I saw you on the news...
- Keep your voice down.

416
00:25:22.062 --> 00:25:23.230
You're a piece of shit.

417
00:25:23.813 --> 00:25:26.775
Mmm. God. How'd you get people
to buy into your scam?

418
00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:28.401
It wasn't a scam.

419
00:25:28.485 --> 00:25:29.528
Mmm.

420
00:25:29.611 --> 00:25:31.530
There's some inherent risk in crypto.

421
00:25:31.613 --> 00:25:35.283
but how can you really put a price
on true economic freedom?

422
00:25:37.118 --> 00:25:40.330
Wow. You really buy your own bullshit.

423
00:25:40.413 --> 00:25:41.915

427
00:25:51.508 --> 00:25:52.508
But...

428
00:25:55.845 --> 00:25:57.097
that ship has sailed.

429
00:25:57.973 --> 00:26:00.058
I bought this place. Rent is cheap.

430
00:26:00.767 --> 00:26:03.103
Uncle Gary's weird. but he's family.

431
00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:05.522
"Family"?

432
00:26:05.605 --> 00:26:06.856
He's my step-uncle.

433
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.650
Raised me since I was six.

434
00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:11.486

435
00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:19.744
Oops. Got serious on you.

436
00:26:21.705 --> 00:26:22.706
No.

437
00:26:24.666 --> 00:26:25.667
I get it.

438
00:26:27.085 --> 00:26:29.129
I didn't have a normal family either.

439
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.345
What time does that bus get here again?

440
00:26:38.388 --> 00:26:40.265
Not that I'm in a hurry or anything.

441
00:26:41.057 --> 00:26:43.310
That bus hasn't stopped here in years.

442
00:26:44.394 --> 00:26:45.394
What?

443
00:26:46.646 --> 00:26:48.565
I keep the sign up for tourists.

444
00:26:48.648 --> 00:26:52.402
You know. they sit. they wait.
they get hungry. They come in.

445
00:26:54.195 --> 00:26:55.196

446
00:26:56.656 --> 00:26:59.075

at SparrowBit.

450
00:27:13.298 --> 00:27:16.551
Yeah. sure. Just give me a second.
This place is a gold mine.

451
00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:17.636

452
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:22.390

453
00:27:24.267 --> 00:27:26.186

we have to be about this Cleanse thing?

- We've got to get you to safety now.

506

00:32:18.561 --> 00:32:21.564
I will explain everything later.
Now. just get away from him.

518
00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:29.280
What are you?

519
00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:31.616
It's okay.

520
00:32:32.325 --> 00:32:33.534
You can trust me.

521
00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:35.119
Don't listen to him.

522
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.080
Come with us.

523
00:32:42.919 --> 00:32:44.128
Don't do it.

524
00:32:44.212 --> 00:32:45.213
Don't do it.

525
00:32:48.716 --> 00:32:50.009
No!

526
00:32:50.093 --> 00:32:52.303
Remember. we can't hurt the girl.

527
00:32:55.056 --> 00:32:57.350
They're heading eastbound on Main Street.

528
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.961
The hell?

529
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:35.972
What...

530
00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:48.151
Where is everyone?

531
00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:51.571
Same day.

532
00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:55.199
Same time.

533
00:34:02.623 --> 00:34:04.375
A different timeline.

534
00:34:19.974 --> 00:34:21.559
Hey! Don't worry.

535
00:34:21.642 --> 00:34:23.895
I'm gonna go out. okay? You wait there.

536
00:34:23.978 --> 00:34:25.772
No. you stay. I'm gonna go.

537
00:34:25.855 --> 00:34:28.066
No. you stay. I go.

538
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:29.525
Don't tell me what to do!

539
00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:32.653
Just let me make
my own choices for now. okay?

540
00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:35.073
I have laser eyes!
I'm more powerful than you!

541
00:34:35.156 --> 00:34:38.034
- They're not even working!
- They're gonna work! I feel it!

542
00:34:40.453 --> 00:34:42.955
Why can't I just do something
for myself right now?

543
00:34:43.039 --> 00:34:45.124
You'd never do anything
if I didn't tell you to!

544
00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:46.208
I take out the trash!

545
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.168
This isn't about you!

546
00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:48.753
- Stay! Stay!
- No!

547
00:34:48.836 --> 00:34:51.172
Listen to me for once
in your goddamn life!

548
00:35:16.989 --> 00:35:18.282
Did you see that?

549
00:35:28.042 --> 00:35:29.042
Yes!

550
00:35:30.753 --> 00:35:33.506
Really? You gotta one-up me like that?

551
00:35:36.717 --> 00:35:38.344
It stings a bit.

552
00:35:38.427 --> 00:35:39.762
- It does.
- Come on.

553
00:35:41.055 --> 00:35:42.056
Oh my God.

554
00:35:45.184 --> 00:35:48.437
<i>I'm a wonderful person.</i>

555
00:35:48.521 --> 00:35:52.859
<i>I am good enough
to live this wonderful life.</i>

556
00:35:52.942 --> 00:35:57.655
<i>No. I will not look outward
but rather inward to the lives.</i>

557
00:35:57.738 --> 00:36:02.827
- Help! Help!
<i>- This life</i> is <i>worth living right now.</i>

558
00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:06.497
Help me! Help me. please!

559
00:36:06.581 --> 00:36:08.082
I know.

560
00:36:09.458 --> 00:36:10.458
Help!

561
00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:12.795
Jennifer?

562
00:36:12.879 --> 00:36:15.006
Yes! Yes! Yes!

563
00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:19.468
They're trying to kill me.
Help get me out of here.

564
00:36:19.552 --> 00:36:23.181
Jennifer! Oh my God!
We've been looking everywhere for you!

565
00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:25.099
Man. am I good.

566
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:27.810
We have to go now!

567
00:36:27.894 --> 00:36:30.021
I know. but we have to wait for my family

568
00:36:30.104 --> 00:36:32.940
because I have a terrible track record
of abandoning my post.

569
00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:35.484
You don't understand.
They're going to kill me.

570
00:36:35.568 --> 00:36:37.445
- I know. We just gotta wait.
- Klaus!

571
00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:39.864
Klaus. you idiot! Start the van!

572
00:36:39.947 --> 00:36:42.867
Hey. hey. I did it! I found Jennifer!

573
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.036
Klaus! Klaus!

574
00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:46.913
Start the van!

575
00:36:47.914 --> 00:36:50.291
Jennifer? Her name's not Jennifer.
I'm Jennifer.

576
00:36:50.374 --> 00:36:51.626
I thought you were Rosie.

577
00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:54.837
That's just the name I put on my name tag
so guys don't stalk me.

578
00:36:54.921 --> 00:36:57.256
Oh. so wait.

579
00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.175
My mistake. You are...

580
00:37:01.844 --> 00:37:03.304
You shouldn't have come here.

581
00:37:07.433 --> 00:37:08.433
Klaus!

582
00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:12.313
- Let me go!
- You can't trust these people.

583
00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:14.232
Come with me. I will keep you safe.

584
00:37:22.657 --> 00:37:23.658
Shit.

585
00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:24.951
He's bleeding out!

586
00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:27.245
Come on. You're not safe here. Let's go.

587
00:37:27.328 --> 00:37:28.871
Come on. Let's get you in the van.

588
00:37:28.955 --> 00:37:30.206
Ow!

589
00:37:30.289 --> 00:37:31.999
- Come on!
- All right. Help me up.

590
00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:34.210
- All right.
- Get him in the van!

591
00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:35.752
Let's go!

592
00:37:36.128 --> 00:37:37.129
Get in. get in.

593
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.924
Put pressure on the wound.
Watch your hands.

594
00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:44.095
The hell is this place?

595
00:37:44.178 --> 00:37:45.738
Who the hell are these people?

596
00:37:46.305 --> 00:37:47.890
Oh!

597
00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:54.272
Dad?

598
00:37:56.232 --> 00:37:57.233
No.

599
00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:02.946
What?

600
00:38:13.666 --> 00:38:15.835
Oh shit! Get down!

601
00:38:42.528 --> 00:38:43.848
What the hell?

602
00:38:49.076 --> 00:38:50.411
Well. my new power's dope.

603
00:39:12.892 --> 00:39:13.976
Five. get in here!

604
00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:23.903
I can't hold things much longer!

- On it. Yeah.
- No! He doesn't want that.

You can't just let him die.
He stopped breathing.

617
00:40:10.282 --> 00:40:11.283
Do it.

618
00:40:12.118 --> 00:40:13.911

Hey. Klaus.

623

You okay?

627
00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:52.950
Thank God.

628
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.874
- He's good.
- What did you do?

629
00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:01.834
You're okay. You're okay.

630
00:41:01.917 --> 00:41:04.879
- You're good.
- What did you do?

631
00:41:05.713 --> 00:41:07.006
I saved your life.

632
00:41:10.551 --> 00:41:12.720
Well. that was a weird fuckin' town.

633
00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:15.306
You know it was all Hargreeves goons?

634
00:41:15.389 --> 00:41:18.642
You know. I should have known.
Those sconces were too perfect.

635
00:41:18.726 --> 00:41:20.686
At least we got who we came for.

636
00:41:20.769 --> 00:41:22.980
Oh yeah. Good job. buddy. You found her.

637
00:41:27.193 --> 00:41:30.529
Hey. we're gonna get you back to your dad
safe and sound.

638
00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:32.572
My dad?

639
00:41:34.408 --> 00:41:35.826
Yeah. Sy Grossman.

640
00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:37.912
