{\an8}Keepers.

12
00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:43.204
{\an8}We are nearing the moment of return

13
00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:46.124
{\an8}to our rightful lives.

14
00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:47.333
{\an8}Yeah!

15
00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:51.004
{\an8}No longer will we need
to live in the memories

16
00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:54.632
{\an8}of another place or another time.

17
00:02:57.468 --> 00:03:01.764
{\an8}The nonbelievers will try
to break through our lines

18
00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.766
{\an8}and stop the Cleanse.

19
00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:10.815
{\an8}We cannot let that happen!

20
00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:15.528
So now is the time for vigilance!

21
00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:20.074
Now is the time for sacrifice!

22
00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:26.456
Because. goddamn it. we're the only effers
brave enough to see this through!

23
00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:27.916
Are you with us?

24
00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.168
Yeah!

25
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.631
- Are you with us?
- Yeah!

26
00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:49.729
Go. go. go!

27
00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:06.496
If we find the target.
what are your instructions?

28
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.959
No one takes a shot unless I order.
Is that clear?

29
00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:12.877
Yes. sir.

30
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.879
Against my better judgment.

31
00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:16.923
we'll try it your way.

32
00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:18.758
How do you want to proceed?

33
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:20.677
We should talk to Jean and Gene.

34
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.513
Those lunatics?
Waste of time if you ask me.

35
00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.473
There might be a way
to negotiate with them.

36
00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:27.892
and at the very least.
it could buy us some time

37
00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:31.562
to get Ben and Jennifer out of there
before they become the Cleanse.

38
00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:35.983
Very well.

39
00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.129
We gave 'em hell back there. didn't we?

40
00:04:58.047 --> 00:05:00.466
Yeah. just like the good old days. huh?

41
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.010
Better than the old days.

42
00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.512
Man. we took on the CIA
and we won. my friend.

43
00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:05.595
Yeah.

44
00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.766
I'm so ashamed
I even wanted to work there.

45
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.478
It's like I've been sleepwalking
through my own life.

46
00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.691
Meanwhile. I'm married
to the hottest. smartest.

47
00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.278
most psychotic chick on the planet.

48
00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.406
Yeah.

49
00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:27.201
And I'm an aging stripper
living alone in a condemned building.

50
00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:28.328
No. whoa. Hey.

51
00:05:29.203 --> 00:05:31.923
When I was playing secret agent.
who sniffed out a global conspiracy?

52
00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:32.999
Ah...

53
00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.043
- I got lucky.
- Lucky?

54
00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:39.005
Five couldn't do that.
and he's been working there for years.

55
00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:42.342
You got a big fat win.

56
00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:45.136
and no one can take that away from you.

57
00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:50.475
Huh.

58
00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:54.519
<i>Papi's</i> home!

59
00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:56.773
Come here! Get in here!

60
00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:57.856
Hi!

61
00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.485
Hon. Hello.

62
00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:03.613
You guys been good. huh?
I missed you guys so much.

63
00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:05.740
Look what I got you. Shoes off.

64
00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:07.533
- Huh? Oh.
- Shoes off.

65
00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:10.078
Look at... Oh! It's got blood. Don't worry.

66
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.538
Yeah. peep that. huh?

67
00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:14.582
Hey. where's Lila?

68
00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:17.293
Who knows?
Like you. she doesn't tell us anything.

69
00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.087
- She hasn't come back?
- No.

70
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.756
What are you standing there for?
Come. You must be hungry.

71
00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:23.508
Yes. We are starving. aren't we?

72
00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:28.012
Oh. uh. could I please...
borrow some clothes?

73
00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:30.139
Of course!

74
00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:32.975
You can take from Cousin Ronnie's closet.

75
00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:33.935
Oh!

76
00:06:34.018 --> 00:06:35.269
My closet?

77
00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:38.523
I don't want
these stinky monkey legs in my pants!

78
00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:40.942
I'm going to kick your ass! Get lost!

79
00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.363
You come. Come with me.

80
00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.217
What do you want?

81
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.678
The boy... and his girlfriend.

82
00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:09.762
No problem.

83
00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:11.431
Go ahead and get 'em.

84
00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:14.892
but first. you need permission
from every man and woman here.

85
00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.896
Now. it doesn't
have to be unanimous. Gene.

86
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.067
We could agree to a simple majority.
just to keep things sporting.

87
00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:25.153
This was a waste of time.

88
00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:27.989
- We should shoot every last one of them.
- You're not helping.

89
00:07:28.072 --> 00:07:29.782
- Typical.
- Excuse me?

90
00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:34.036
Every word out of your mouth
is a perfect little pearl. right?

91
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.747
Not to be questioned
because you think you know best.

92
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.417
Such a man's perspective.

93
00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:42.795
I am a man.

94
00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:44.338
As are you.

95
00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.299
Uh...

96
00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:51.262
Why don't you two toddle on off
to wherever you came from?

97
00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:54.307
Forget even entertaining
somebody else's opinion

98
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.808
or respecting their wishes.

99
00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:59.187
- What are you prattling on about?
- Can we please get back to my brother?

100
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.731
We're not giving him up.

101
00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:03.065
And you never listen!

102
00:08:04.692 --> 00:08:06.986
But I've got your attention now.

103
00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:09.947
You're doing things my way
from here on out.

104
00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.255
That was weird.

105
00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.550
For once. my boy.
we are in complete agreement.

106
00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:34.263
So. do you have a plan B?

107
00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:39.018
What the hell was that?

108
00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:42.063
That was an unsuccessful attempt
to thwart our plans.

109
00:08:42.146 --> 00:08:45.983
No. That was you
acting like a fucking lunatic!

110
00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:47.693
You are overreacting.

111
00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.487
Am I?

112
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.073
You clearly know that man. Gene.

113
00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:54.700
- How?
- It doesn't matter.

114
00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.577
Like hell it doesn't!

115
00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:57.912
Keep your voice down.

116
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:06.045
And what is this god-awful song
you keep whistling. Gene?

117
00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.131
You don't even like that song.

118
00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.803
Something's changed.

119
00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:16.639
Oh.

120
00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.101
They got to you. didn't they?

121
00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:22.812
The nonbelievers.

122
00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.522
Stop talking. Jean.

123
00:09:24.605 --> 00:09:29.068
Don't you talk to me like that.
Gene Thibedeau.

124
00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:31.153
I brought you into this work.

125
00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.281
You're upsetting our followers.

126
00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:35.074
I taught you the truth...

127
00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:36.033
Yeah!

128
00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:37.827
- ...about the Cleanse.
- Right!

129
00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:43.165
Without me. he'd just be
some sniveling little mama's boy...

130
00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:48.087
trying to finish his dissertation.

131
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.797
Ah!

132
00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:56.804
Who are you?

133
00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:09.734
You killed her.

134
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.903
Cunning observation. Bea.

135
00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.156
Why'd you do that?

136
00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:20.453
Jean has betrayed us!

137
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.122
But she's your wife.

138
00:10:23.205 --> 00:10:25.416
Alas. no more.

139
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.795
The Cleanse is bigger than love.
my compatriots.

140
00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.714
It's bigger than all of us!

141
00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.925
She started the movement.

142
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:41.682
There's a difference
between starting something

143
00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:44.393
and having the spine
to see it through. Bea...

144
00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:48.481
no matter the cost.

145
00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:52.193
Jean got cold feet!

146
00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:57.573
Anybody else's feet feeling chilly?

147
00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:01.368
Good.

148
00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:03.954
Get back to your posts.

149
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.129
Might wanna give that a light sharpening.

150
00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:19.762
Everything looks normal.

151
00:11:20.262 --> 00:11:22.723
It's possible they solved the Cleanse
without us.

152
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.520
Hey. you good?

153
00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:33.734
It's been seven years
since I've seen my kids. Five. I'm scared.

154
00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:36.153
What are you scared of?

155
00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:40.199
That they won't love me
like they did before.

156
00:11:41.992 --> 00:11:44.704
Hey. It's only been a few hours for them.

157
00:11:45.287 --> 00:11:46.831
Nothing's changed.

158
00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:48.332
You promise?

159
00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:50.459
Yeah. Promise.

160
00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:55.797
You're back!

161
00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:57.507
We are.

162
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.011
Good. Yeah. I was starting to get worried.

163
00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.564
What?

164
00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:14.150
Oh. I don't know. I...

165
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.944
I missed you.

166
00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:18.988
You did?

167
00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:21.741
Yeah! I mean. why wouldn't I?

168
00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:26.245
It's just. I... I can't remember
the last time you said that.

169
00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:27.746
Yeah.

170
00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:29.373
Sorry about that.

171
00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.126
That's gonna change.

172
00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:35.045
Lot of things are gonna change now.

173
00:12:37.214 --> 00:12:38.549
Mommy's home!

174
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.972
Oh my god.

175
00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:51.479
You can let go of me now. Mommy.

176
00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:53.856
Just a little longer.

177
00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:58.527
But you're squishing my face.

178
00:13:00.404 --> 00:13:01.614
Why are you crying?

179
00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:07.161
I'm just so happy to see you.

180
00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.204
You okay?

181
00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.039
Yeah.

182
00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:12.625
Come here!

183
00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:18.339
Oh!

184
00:13:18.422 --> 00:13:21.133
It smells so nice in here.
Hey! How's it going?

185
00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:22.968
Oh! Yo. yo. yo! Shoes.

186
00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:25.012
Oh. sorry.

187
00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.225
- Wait. what's with the dirt?
- Oh. yeah.

188
00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:31.018
Allison and Claire Bear

189
00:13:31.101 --> 00:13:34.313
had to dig me out of the grave
of a dead greyhound.

190
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:35.856
Is anyone hungry?

191
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.818
My God. I could eat a horse.

192
00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:40.694
- Hey. family.
- Long story.

193
00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:44.365
Hello. Oh. hi. Uh...

194
00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:49.578
I'm famished.
If I can get a little sandwich...

195
00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:51.997
It's so good to see you.

196
00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:53.123
You too.

197
00:13:53.707 --> 00:13:54.708
Oh my God.

198
00:13:56.293 --> 00:13:57.545
- Oh my God.
- Shoes.

199
00:13:57.628 --> 00:13:58.963
Hi!

200
00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:01.089
Okay.

201
00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.263
Cinco. you coming?

202
00:14:08.472 --> 00:14:10.975
- Yeah. I'm right behind you.
- All right. Take your shoes off.

203
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.909
My team is in position.
ready to fire on your command.

204
00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.412
Hold your horses there. Rambo.
I'm gonna go in.

205
00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:32.621
Don't be ridiculous.

206
00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.039
Even with your powers.

207
00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:37.209
you'd be overwhelmed
by the sheer number of those extremists.

208
00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:39.253
There's one less of them
to worry about now.

209
00:14:39.336 --> 00:14:40.629
- Who?
- Jean.

210
00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:41.589
With a G?

211
00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:42.756
With a J.

212
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.175
- Husband gutted her like a trout.
- What?

213
00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:48.095
Some people
just aren't cut out for marriage.

214
00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:49.680
You see?

215
00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:53.559
I gave you an opportunity
to resolve this issue. You failed.

216
00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:55.102
Now we do it my way.

217
00:14:55.185 --> 00:14:56.437
Gene was right.

218
00:14:56.937 --> 00:14:59.106
You do always think you know what's best.

219
00:14:59.189 --> 00:15:01.817
- If you get a sight on Ben. take the shot.
- What? No!

220
00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:02.902
Excuse me.

221
00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:06.572
I saved your life back there on the road.
You owe me the chance to talk to Ben.

222
00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:11.744
You have 15 minutes. but I fail to see
how you intend to breach that mob.

223
00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:20.669
I need to borrow a tire iron
and a Sharpie.

224
00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:24.714
Heads up!

225
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:31.931
Hey. hey. Whoa. whoa. whoa!

226
00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:35.351
- Hey. who the fuck are you. dude?
- Whoa! Hold on a second!

227
00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:42.023
You're late.

228
00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:45.444
My truck broke down.
so I had to hoof it the last couple miles.

229
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.448
That's not much of a weapon.

230
00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:52.076
It was the best I could do
on short notice.

231
00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:53.494
Can I join you guys?

232
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:57.748
Yeah.

233
00:15:57.831 --> 00:16:00.417
You can post up with us
at the back of the building.

234
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:01.961
Make sure no one gets in.

235
00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:03.462
Grab a spot.

236
00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:07.341
I just... I gotta take a piss first.
Any chance I can use the can inside?

237
00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:09.510
"Can inside."

238
00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:13.847
No. Jean and Gene said nobody goes inside.

239
00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:15.265
Find a shit bucket.

240
00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:17.267
Yeah. of course. No problem.

241
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:20.187
I'll just use the alley.

242
00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:58.767
Like I said. nobody goes inside. asshole!

243
00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.702
Ben! Ben!

244
00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:20.581
Ben. are you in here?

245
00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:24.001
Ben.

246
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:26.837
Viktor?

247
00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:28.881
What are you doing here?

248
00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:36.764
You need to come with me.

249
00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:39.183
I'm not leaving Jennifer.

250
00:17:41.977 --> 00:17:45.814
I'm gonna help you. okay?
Both of you. I need you to listen to me.

251
00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.524
We don't need your help!

252
00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.618
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell.

253
00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:01.121
What's happening to me?

254
00:18:32.402 --> 00:18:34.321
Hey. has anyone heard from Viktor?

255
00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:36.740
Maybe he found Ben and Jennifer.

256
00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:40.744
Surely he would've called. left a message.

257
00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:42.704
So we all struck out?

258
00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.623
God. what a bunch of losers.

259
00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:48.836
Well. not entirely.

260
00:18:50.587 --> 00:18:51.587
Yeah.

261
00:18:52.005 --> 00:18:54.341
Deputy Director Ribbons is a Keeper.

262
00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:57.094
along with other agents at the CIA.

263
00:18:57.177 --> 00:18:59.471
It's your boss. Five.

264
00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:00.764
Yeah.

265
00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:04.768
It turns out Gene and Jean also have
a bigger movement than we thought.

266
00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:07.896
So we have to get to Ben and Jennifer
before they do and stop the Cleanse.

267
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.440
Right. but we have to find them first.

268
00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:12.442
Yeah. They might be anywhere.

269
00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:13.902
We gotta find 'em.

270
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.531
What's with you?

271
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.201
You've barely said a word. Five.
When does that ever happen?

272
00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:25.539
It's called thinking. Luther.
You should try it sometime.

273
00:19:25.622 --> 00:19:27.332
- Hey!
- Whoa! Uncalled for!

274
00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:30.085
- Shut up.
- I do think. I think you're an asshole!

275
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:31.529
Grandpa's not had his nap.

276
00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.147
Can we not do this right now?

277
00:19:33.213 --> 00:19:35.215
No. you know what? Let's do it right now.

278
00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:37.509
We all struck out.
There's nothing better to do.

279
00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:38.969
Five. it's gonna be okay.

280
00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:40.470
It's not gonna be okay.

281
00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:43.098
Oh. don't talk to my wife like that. man.

282
00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.100
Not around here. Not during Christmas.

283
00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.102
You gonna do something about it. fuckface?

284
00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.937
- Hey!
- Whoa. language!

285
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:52.900
Yeah. I'm gonna k-i-c-k
your a-s-s. my boy.

286
00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:55.652
Mmm. Looks like somebody
passed the first grade.

287
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.697
Hey. both of you need to stop. okay?

288
00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:00.698
What's that?

289
00:20:01.116 --> 00:20:02.242
What's what?

290
00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:05.412
That thing on your wrist?
You hate bracelets.

291
00:20:05.495 --> 00:20:06.330
No. I don't.

292
00:20:06.413 --> 00:20:08.665
Yeah. you do.
I gave you one for Valentine's Day.

293
00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:11.210
You traded it for a Dyson vacuum. What...

294
00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:18.967
Did you give her this?

295
00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:24.681
Answer the question. Five.

296
00:20:25.682 --> 00:20:26.725
I made it.

297
00:20:27.517 --> 00:20:28.517
For her?

298
00:20:29.603 --> 00:20:31.855
Well. I sure as hell
didn't make it for you.

299
00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:42.324
Is something going on between you two?

300
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.539
- Diego...
- Holy shit!

301
00:20:50.123 --> 00:20:50.958
Oh wow!

302
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:52.417
- Holy shit!
- What?

303
00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:54.002
I didn't see that one coming.

304
00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:56.255
Holy shit! I was right!

305
00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:58.507
The book club. All this time.

306
00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.467
I knew you were cheating on me with...

307
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.388
I wasn't cheating.

308
00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:09.393
At least... not when you thought that I was.

309
00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:12.354
- Should we go? We should go.
- We're not going anywhere.

310
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.904
Did you s-k-r-e-w my wife?

311
00:21:22.322 --> 00:21:25.951
"Screw" is spelled s-c-r-e-w.

312
00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:30.330
Okay. you need to listen to me. all right?

313
00:21:30.414 --> 00:21:33.250
No matter how strange this sounds.
just listen.

314
00:21:34.167 --> 00:21:35.335
Five and I.

315
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.338
we've been lost in a subway.

316
00:21:40.882 --> 00:21:42.217
It's not a regular subway.

317
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:43.302
It's a waypoint

318
00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:46.388
between alternate timelines
of the same moment in time.

319
00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:50.434
Yeah. Think I'm gonna buy that bullshit?

320
00:21:50.517 --> 00:21:52.728
She's telling the truth. all right?

321
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:55.397
We got lost.
We couldn't find our way back.

322
00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:06.950
We were searching
for seven years. Diego.

323
00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:31.475
We were moving from timeline to timeline.

324
00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:33.560
We had no idea what we would find.

325
00:22:34.436 --> 00:22:35.520
We were

326
00:22:36.938 --> 00:22:39.441
chased. attacked. shot at.

327
00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:45.197
I never stopped trying to find a way home.

328
00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:52.913
But I got tired.

329
00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:55.540
and I had to stop running.

330
00:23:00.337 --> 00:23:02.964
Um. that's when it happened.

331
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.134
Do you love him?

332
00:23:13.016 --> 00:23:14.017
Diego. now's not the...

333
00:23:14.101 --> 00:23:15.811
Do you love him?

334
00:23:24.694 --> 00:23:26.863
Hey. stupid grown-ups. check out the TV.

335
00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:29.574
<i>- One of the occupants...</i>
- Isn't that Uncle Ben?

336
00:23:29.658 --> 00:23:32.160
<i>...is a former convict named Ben Hargreeves.</i>

337
00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:34.162
Look. look. look. look. look!

338
00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:36.498
<i>...convicted in 2019
for a crypto Ponzi scheme</i>

339
00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:40.252
<i>and served four years in
Avalon Federal Correctional Institution.</i>

340
00:23:40.335 --> 00:23:42.462
Oh. we gotta go.

341
00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:43.547
Yeah.

342
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:47.426
<i>...how this armed group of protesters
is connected with Hargreeves.</i>

343
00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:50.303
<i>Local police have yet to be able
to get close enough to the building</i>

344
00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:51.430
<i>to make contact.</i>

345
00:23:51.513 --> 00:23:55.308
and we have no information
if Hargreeves is holding any hostages.

346
00:23:56.518 --> 00:23:57.518
The Cleanse.

347
00:23:57.978 --> 00:23:59.646
It's changing both of you.

348
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.481
Into what?

349
00:24:02.315 --> 00:24:03.650
Well. I'm not sure.

350
00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:07.612
but I do know
that if you stay here with her.

351
00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:09.030
it's only gonna get worse.

352
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.660
I'm not leaving her. Viktor.

353
00:24:19.207 --> 00:24:20.542
That's Dad checking on us.

354
00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:22.294
Don't touch it!

355
00:24:22.377 --> 00:24:23.377
Please!

356
00:24:24.838 --> 00:24:28.175
Please let me answer it.
It could buy us more time.

357
00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:31.887
More time. More time for what?

358
00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:35.182
God.

359
00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:39.144
He wants to kill you.

360
00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:44.232
Father of the year. that guy.

361
00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:46.902
Ben. listen.

362
00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.616
If you don't come out with me...

363
00:24:55.285 --> 00:24:56.912
I guarantee you

364
00:24:57.996 --> 00:25:01.500
that Dad and his tactical team
will come in.

365
00:25:02.626 --> 00:25:04.211
and they will kill you

366
00:25:05.754 --> 00:25:06.838
and Jennifer.

367
00:25:11.051 --> 00:25:12.385
And I don't want that.

368
00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:25.357
I'm scared. Viktor.

369
00:25:31.655 --> 00:25:32.656
Me too.

370
00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:39.538
I wanna go home.

371
00:25:44.417 --> 00:25:46.127
No!

372
00:26:02.018 --> 00:26:03.144
Damn it!

373
00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:04.396
Pick up. boy!

374
00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:35.802
That doesn't look good.

375
00:26:36.636 --> 00:26:39.180
Quick. back down that alley
so we're out of sight.

376
00:26:41.391 --> 00:26:43.226
- Diego!
- Back up. you idiot!

377
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.769
- I'm trying.
- What?

378
00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:45.853
What?

379
00:26:46.479 --> 00:26:47.647

382

Come on. man! You're gonna get us killed!

386
00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:03.246

Maybe you shouldn't have
cheaped out on the brakes.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.826
To be fair. new ceramic pads
on a vehicle this old

398
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.161
is not a good investment.

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:46.873
Stop yapping and start doing!

I can't. all right?

405
00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:57.801
I'll mimic your power.
We'll do it together.

406
00:27:57.884 --> 00:27:59.284
You're not doing anything with him.

407
00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:01.638
You know we're gonna end up in the subway.

408
00:28:01.721 --> 00:28:03.640
Do not think about the past.

409
00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:09.104
If you're gonna do something.
now would be the time.

410
00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:11.231
- Yeah!
- Your family needs you.

411
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.483
I need you.

412
00:28:13.983 --> 00:28:15.068

413
00:28:22.325 --> 00:28:23.535
What the...

414
00:28:25.662 --> 00:28:27.330
- What is that?
- What?

415
00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:29.124
God. I think it's Ben!

416
00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:31.668
- Stay where you are!
- Viktor. you're hurt. Come here.

417
00:28:31.751 --> 00:28:34.170
No. I'm fine! Just don't touch Ben!

418
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.135
Is that Jennifer?

419
00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:44.973
Get away from him!

420
00:28:45.932 --> 00:28:47.600

- What's he doing?
- He's pulling out the durango.

428
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.472
Viktor. let him go!

429
00:29:26.055 --> 00:29:27.432

431
00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:55.960
Take the shot.

432
00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:46.094
Tango down.

433
00:31:20.753 --> 00:31:21.880
It's happening.

434
00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:25.049
It's happening!

435
00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:29.762
- What the hell was that?
- The Cleanse. It's here.

436
00:31:29.846 --> 00:31:31.180
Don't be afraid!

437
00:31:32.849 --> 00:31:33.850
Oh God.

438
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.021
Oh my God!

440
00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.889
Ah shit!
We gotta get that thing away from Viktor.

441
00:31:46.946 --> 00:31:48.424
- What if we hurt it?
- Doesn't matter.

442
00:31:48.448 --> 00:31:50.533
- They might still be alive.
- What?

443
00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:57.832
We should get to cover.

444
00:31:59.876 --> 00:32:01.377
- Oh shit!
- Allison. wait!

445
00:32:01.461 --> 00:32:02.712
Oh God.

That's right! Come on!
Come get these legs and eggs. baby!

449
00:32:14.015 --> 00:32:16.517
What are you doing. big guy?
What are you doing?

450
00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:20.438
I'm trying to start a fight.
Hey. come on. assface. Come on! Hey!

452
00:32:28.905 --> 00:32:31.032
- Hey!
- I can fly now.

453
00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:32.283
Oh. it hurts.

454
00:32:32.367 --> 00:32:34.535
- Hey. Hey. pal. how you doing?
- I'm okay.

455
00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:36.287
- Okay. I gotcha.
- I'm okay.

456
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:37.455
Holy fuck!

457
00:32:47.924 --> 00:32:49.217
Okay. that didn't work.

458
00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.677
- Eye lasers?
- Yeah. yeah.

459
00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:52.804
Aim for the tanks.

460
00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:11.197
Is it supposed to get bigger?

461
00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:14.867
I'm here. I'm here!

462
00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:18.788
Get away from me. kid.

463
00:33:18.871 --> 00:33:20.206
We almost got killed!

464
00:33:20.289 --> 00:33:22.417
Stay away from my wife!

465
00:33:28.089 --> 00:33:30.091

- What are you waiting for?
- It's Ben.

473
00:34:02.665 --> 00:34:03.958
Not anymore.

474

00:34:48.002 --> 00:34:49.670
My hand is stuck in his ass.

483
00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:51.214
- Let's do this?
- Okay.

484
00:35:06.646 --> 00:35:08.064
It's not working!

485
00:35:32.588 --> 00:35:35.049
Will this thing ever stop growing?

486
00:35:36.592 --> 00:35:39.053
Stop fighting each other
when we're about to be killed!

487
00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:41.430
- I wanna kill him.
- It's over. Five.

488
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.150
Shit.

489
00:36:05.204 --> 00:36:06.204

490
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:08.624

491
00:36:08.708 --> 00:36:09.709
You good?

492
00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:19.844
Is she still breathing?

493
00:36:19.927 --> 00:36:21.679
- Barely.
- There she is.

494
00:36:21.762 --> 00:36:23.431
Is she alive? Allison?

495
00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:30.313
Oh wow.

496
00:36:30.396 --> 00:36:31.647
What now?

497
00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:35.109
We gotta get the hell out of here
and figure out how to kill that thing.

498
00:36:35.693 --> 00:36:38.613
- Let's go.
- Let's go. All right. come on.

499
00:36:39.155 --> 00:36:40.615
All right. On your feet.

500
00:37:10.603 --> 00:37:12.355
Let's move out. Sergeant.

501
00:37:13.648 --> 00:37:15.024
It's time to evacuate. sir.

502
00:37:15.107 --> 00:37:18.444
On the contrary.
it's time to face the inevitable.

503
00:37:18.945 --> 00:37:21.864
Goodbye. Gary. Thank you for your service.

504
00:37:24.867 --> 00:37:26.118
Let's roll out!

505
00:37:44.136 --> 00:37:47.098
Why did I wait to take the shot?

506
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:57.316
Because maybe
you are a good man. after all.

507
00:37:58.192 --> 00:38:02.822
You pathetic. self-deluded zealot.

508
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.617
Do you have any idea what you've done?

509
00:38:09.745 --> 00:38:10.745
Yeah.

510
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.292
I ended the world.

511
00:38:16.836 --> 00:38:17.836
Shoot it!

512
00:38:29.015 --> 00:38:31.267
And that's a good thing. my love.

513
00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:33.728
Who are you?

514
00:38:43.362 --> 00:38:44.572
Abigail.

515
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.325
You did this?

516
00:38:47.408 --> 00:38:49.243
You left me no choice.

517
00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:50.494
But why?

518
00:38:52.872 --> 00:38:56.500
Dying was my penance
for creating something so deadly.

519
00:38:57.877 --> 00:38:58.877
This...

520
00:39:00.129 --> 00:39:01.255
Cleanse.

521
00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:07.720
Wasn't it enough
to see our world destroyed?

522
00:39:08.971 --> 00:39:11.057
Why would you loose it on this one?

523
00:39:15.561 --> 00:39:18.230
<i>Because I was
so lonely without you.</i>

524
00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:26.197
I didn't ask to be brought back to life.

525
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.823
That was an act of love.

526
00:39:27.907 --> 00:39:30.034
No. Reginald.

527
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:32.536
It was hubris.

528
00:39:33.913 --> 00:39:38.209
Your actions had consequences far greater
than anything you could imagine.

529
00:39:40.503 --> 00:39:42.671
And it was my duty to set it right.

530
00:39:44.298 --> 00:39:45.341
So.

531
00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:49.220
it was you who thwarted all my plans

532
00:39:49.303 --> 00:39:51.639
to keep Ben and Jennifer apart.

533
00:39:57.686 --> 00:39:58.938
I was wrong.

534
00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:02.733
And you made it right.

535
00:40:05.152 --> 00:40:06.946
Well done. my love.

536
00:40:10.699 --> 00:40:11.826
Well done.

553

Our specials...

554
00:42:50.025 --> 00:42:51.986
Hey. you. Over here.

555
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:58.576
Can someone get Drunk Five out of here?

556
00:42:59.785 --> 00:43:00.995
What is this place?

557
00:43:02.705 --> 00:43:05.499
It's a gas station.
The hell does it look like? It's a deli.

558
00:43:07.501 --> 00:43:08.586
Coffee.

559
00:43:12.339 --> 00:43:15.301
And... two pastrami.

560
00:43:17.469 --> 00:43:18.679
Bon appétit.

561
00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:21.348
It's a little light on the sauerkraut. no?

562
00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:25.019
Yeah. it says it on the menu.
I keep telling him. but he never listens.

563
00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:26.145
Sorry.

564
00:43:26.228 --> 00:43:27.438
It's not your fault.

565
00:43:27.521 --> 00:43:28.606
Theoretically. it is.

566
00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:30.608
Oh. you're not gonna like that.

567
00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:35.362
So I take it you figured out
the subway system by now.

568
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.198
Alternate versions
of the same moment in time?

569
00:43:38.699 --> 00:43:39.533
That is correct.

570
00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:42.786
You'd be surprised how long it took
some of the Fives to figure that out.

571
00:43:43.662 --> 00:43:46.081
We're all you from alternate timelines.

572
00:43:46.165 --> 00:43:49.001
Most of us here have given up
trying to fix the problem.

573
00:43:50.544 --> 00:43:51.544
What problem?

574
00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:55.841
The broken timeline. man.
There's only supposed to be one.

575
00:43:58.677 --> 00:43:59.887
I don't get it. I...

576
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.600
Look around. Five.
Does this seem right to you?

577
00:44:06.268 --> 00:44:07.144
No. but...

578
00:44:07.227 --> 00:44:10.397
You think Einstein was thinking of this
when he was figuring out relativity?

579
00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:12.566
Not a chance.
This shit woulda made his head explode.

580
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.611
Okay. So what shattered
the original timeline?

581
00:44:15.694 --> 00:44:17.154
Not "what." "Who."

582
00:44:17.237 --> 00:44:19.907
And I will give you three guesses
to figure it out.

583
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.075
We did!

584
00:44:22.409 --> 00:44:24.703
Why you always gotta wreck shit.
Brisket Five?

585
00:44:25.704 --> 00:44:26.538
Why?

586
00:44:26.622 --> 00:44:30.125
By "we." he means the family. My siblings?

587
00:44:30.751 --> 00:44:31.919
The morons. yeah.

588
00:44:32.628 --> 00:44:34.421
I'm familiar with them. Yeah.

589
00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:38.258
One perfect timeline. and the moment
we come into existence... boom!

590
00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:41.387
Shattered to an infinite number
of alternate timelines

591
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:44.848
in an infinite loop of time
as we try and save the world...

592
00:44:44.932 --> 00:44:46.850
How many times was it again?

593
00:44:47.893 --> 00:44:50.854
145.412.

594
00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:53.065
That's a lot.

595
00:44:53.148 --> 00:44:55.484
He's like Rain Man. that one.
He loves numbers.

596
00:44:55.567 --> 00:44:57.611
Oh. by the way. check out the artwork.

597
00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:02.783
It's all the different ways
we've made our universe go kaboom.

598
00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:07.496
Gold star for consistency. am I right?

599
00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:10.040
We need to fix this.

600
00:45:10.124 --> 00:45:11.458
Oh. trust me. We've tried.

601
00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:13.544
That's why one of us created
the Commission.

602
00:45:13.627 --> 00:45:15.629
He wanted to undo
all the broken timelines.

603
00:45:15.713 --> 00:45:17.464
Get back to the one and only.

604
00:45:17.965 --> 00:45:19.967
But that always fails because...

605
00:45:21.009 --> 00:45:22.928
The family is the problem.

606
00:45:23.011 --> 00:45:26.807
We're doomed to save or destroy the world
over and over again. ad infinitum.

607
00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:27.808
Bingo.

608
00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:28.891
Bingo.

609
00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:33.439
Sorry. I need to get back to my family.
Stop this from ever happening.

610
00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:35.774
Well. good luck with that.

611
00:45:35.858 --> 00:45:38.235
Guess you don't want your brisket to go?

612
00:45:50.497 --> 00:45:52.458
Thank God. Hello.

613
00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:53.709
Mom!

614
00:45:53.792 --> 00:45:55.627
I'm okay. Go with your cousins.

615
00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:57.629
- No. I'm not leaving you.
- Claire. please.

616
00:45:57.713 --> 00:45:58.714
Come on. Let's go.

617
00:45:58.797 --> 00:46:00.424
Claire? We'll take care of her.

618
00:46:00.507 --> 00:46:03.677
Just can you and the others
just stay here. okay?

619
00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:06.138
Just one second. One second.

620
00:46:08.515 --> 00:46:09.975
All right. on the couch.

621
00:46:10.058 --> 00:46:13.771
How do we beat a thing
that everything we throw at it. it gets...

622
00:46:13.854 --> 00:46:16.273
it gets bigger and it gets stronger?

623
00:46:16.356 --> 00:46:17.274
Well. we can't.

624
00:46:17.357 --> 00:46:19.693
It's only a matter of time
before it envelops everything.

625
00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.779
So the world's ending again. huh?

626
00:46:21.862 --> 00:46:24.782
Hey! Great timing. Great timing.

627
00:46:24.865 --> 00:46:25.866
Hey.

628
00:46:26.575 --> 00:46:28.118
- Five.
- Five!

629
00:46:28.744 --> 00:46:31.580
Why'd you come back. buddy?
Things are pretty bleak here.

630
00:46:31.663 --> 00:46:33.624
Trust me. I wasn't planning on it.

631
00:46:34.708 --> 00:46:39.588
Fortunately. I had a. uh. long
and eye-opening conversation with myself.

632
00:46:40.714 --> 00:46:41.548
What?

633
00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:44.468
We are the reason that this is happening.

634
00:46:46.428 --> 00:46:47.805
You care to elaborate?

635
00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:52.851
The marigold that infected our mothers.
bringing forth our births...

636
00:46:54.937 --> 00:46:57.064
<i>...had an unexpected side effect.</i>

637
00:46:58.148 --> 00:46:59.817
It shattered the timeline.

638
00:47:00.692 --> 00:47:04.738
<i>and it broke it into an infinite number
of alternate timelines.</i>

639
00:47:05.405 --> 00:47:07.699
The timelines are bleeding
into each other.

640
00:47:07.783 --> 00:47:10.369
That's how the Keepers were able
to find those artifacts.

641
00:47:10.452 --> 00:47:12.913
Holy shit. Gene and Jean were right.

642
00:47:12.996 --> 00:47:15.499
Their dreams of other timelines were real.

643
00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:18.836
So we need to go back
to the original timeline

644
00:47:18.919 --> 00:47:20.838
before the other ones were created.

645
00:47:20.921 --> 00:47:24.299
Am I the only one
who's very. very. very confused?

646
00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:25.259
Nope.

647
00:47:25.342 --> 00:47:27.261
That's what Ben was trying to show me.

648
00:47:28.762 --> 00:47:30.556
What does Ben have to do with this?

649
00:47:30.639 --> 00:47:31.974
Back at the department store.

650
00:47:32.057 --> 00:47:35.727
when I was trying to pull the durango
from his body. I had a vision.

651
00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:43.735
<i>I think he was trying to show me
the original timeline.</i>

652
00:47:44.403 --> 00:47:45.821
He tried to kill you.

653
00:47:45.904 --> 00:47:48.490
But he didn't.
He pushed me away to save me.

654
00:47:50.242 --> 00:47:52.369
I think he was trying
to tell me something.

655
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:54.371
That the Cleanse isn't a bad thing.

656
00:47:54.454 --> 00:47:56.915
You're saying that thing

657
00:47:56.999 --> 00:48:00.043
that destroys everything
it comes into contact with is good?

658
00:48:00.127 --> 00:48:01.420
I think so? I...

659
00:48:01.503 --> 00:48:05.340
We need to let the marigold in our bodies
merge with the durango inside the Cleanse.

660
00:48:07.009 --> 00:48:08.927
They should cancel each other out.

661
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:11.805
Okay. Then what happens to us?

662
00:48:13.265 --> 00:48:14.683
We cease to exist.

663
00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:22.566
Old Klaus might have been down
for some recreational hara-kiri.

664
00:48:22.649 --> 00:48:26.528
but it turns out
that I'm really not into killing myself.

665
00:48:26.612 --> 00:48:28.614
so. uh. count me out.

666
00:48:28.697 --> 00:48:32.117
Actually. it's not killing ourselves.
It's worse than that.

667
00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:34.202
We'll be erased from history.

668
00:48:37.623 --> 00:48:39.583
Okay. what about the other timelines?

669
00:48:40.542 --> 00:48:43.712
They will never have existed.
None of us will.

670
00:48:44.463 --> 00:48:47.591
No one will have
any memory of this... or us.

671
00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:58.977
Does anyone else not like this plan?

672
00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.942
If we cease to exist.
what happens to our families?

673
00:49:06.234 --> 00:49:07.402
I'm not sure.

674
00:49:07.486 --> 00:49:10.447
Wait. No. I... I don't like
where this is going. Five.

675
00:49:11.323 --> 00:49:13.533
Come on. Five.
There has to be another way.

676
00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:14.910
There isn't.

677
00:49:16.161 --> 00:49:17.913
Take it easy. all right?

678
00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:22.626
Lila. why don't you take the family
to that crazy subway of yours.

679
00:49:22.709 --> 00:49:25.629
You save them... save yourself.

680
00:49:25.712 --> 00:49:28.548
- No. she can't do that.
- I'm not talking to you. Five.

681
00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:31.093
All the marigold
needs to be destroyed. Diego.

682
00:49:31.176 --> 00:49:34.388
If Lila isn't here when the Cleanse comes.
it just restarts.

683
00:49:39.226 --> 00:49:41.520
Yeah. well. good thing
it's her decision. isn't it?

684
00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:43.813
Yeah.

685
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:50.487
I'm staying with my mom.

686
00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:52.656
Claire Bear.

687
00:49:52.739 --> 00:49:53.949
- No.
- Mom. I'm staying.

688
00:49:54.032 --> 00:49:56.118
No. You have to go with Lila. okay?

689
00:49:56.201 --> 00:49:59.287
No. I'd rather die here with you
than not remember you.

690
00:49:59.371 --> 00:50:00.371
No.

691
00:50:01.289 --> 00:50:02.289
Claire.

692
00:50:03.959 --> 00:50:06.837
I need you to live... okay?

693
00:50:07.587 --> 00:50:10.007
I need you to live and experience

694
00:50:10.507 --> 00:50:13.885
all of the amazing things
that this world has to offer you. okay?

695
00:50:14.886 --> 00:50:16.513
- I'll forget you. Mom.
- No.

696
00:50:16.596 --> 00:50:18.015
We don't know that.

697
00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:20.851
Okay? We don't know that.

698
00:50:20.934 --> 00:50:23.061
What I do know is
you have to go with Lila.

699
00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:24.604
No. I can't.

700
00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:29.526
Hey. listen to Mom. Claire Bear.
Every time I do. things turn out okay.

701
00:50:29.609 --> 00:50:30.986
Hey. look at me.

702
00:50:31.778 --> 00:50:32.778
Look at me.

703
00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:39.745
I will always be a part of you.

704
00:50:40.996 --> 00:50:42.039
Always.

705
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:44.207
Even if you don't remember me.

706
00:50:45.584 --> 00:50:51.673
You'll always be my beautiful. smart girl.

707
00:50:54.926 --> 00:50:55.926
Okay?

708
00:51:05.645 --> 00:51:07.731
Come here. I love you.

709
00:51:07.814 --> 00:51:08.940
Love you too.

710
00:51:13.278 --> 00:51:15.363
- Okay.
- You have to go.

711
00:51:15.447 --> 00:51:18.241
- No. No.
- Baby. you have to go.

712
00:51:18.325 --> 00:51:20.285
Let's go. Get the family together. okay?

713
00:51:20.368 --> 00:51:21.411
Lila. Lila. wait.

714
00:51:22.245 --> 00:51:24.414
Look. I don't wanna sound like
an asshole here.

715
00:51:25.874 --> 00:51:28.335
but if Five is right.
you leaving is not a good thing.

716
00:51:28.418 --> 00:51:30.045
He's right. You can't go.

717
00:51:40.514 --> 00:51:42.724
- Watch me.
- Lila!

718
00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:44.976
Okay. Come on. everyone.

719
00:51:45.977 --> 00:51:48.230
Stand around me. okay?

720
00:51:52.651 --> 00:51:53.944
Lila. don't do this.

721
00:51:54.736 --> 00:51:55.779
Hold onto me.

722
00:52:02.369 --> 00:52:03.870
<i>All right. come on!</i>

723
00:52:06.039 --> 00:52:09.084
Hey. you can wait here! Yeah!

724
00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:10.627
All right!

725
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:12.337
Sweetheart. Okay?

726
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.922
Where are we going?

727
00:52:14.005 --> 00:52:16.609
I'll tell you when we get there.

728
00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:17.759
Where are we going?

729
00:52:19.094 --> 00:52:20.804
Somewhere safe. angel. okay?

730
00:52:20.887 --> 00:52:23.014
Lila.

731
00:52:25.851 --> 00:52:27.411
What's he doing here?

732
00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:29.855
Can you just keep everyone together?

733
00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:34.651
- Don't try to stop me.
- Lila. please.

734
00:52:34.734 --> 00:52:37.070
I can't leave them.
What if they don't make it?

735
00:52:37.154 --> 00:52:38.363
Then they don't make it.

736
00:52:43.243 --> 00:52:46.329
If you go with them.
then this whole thing starts over.

737
00:52:46.413 --> 00:52:49.166
It doesn't end until
all the marigold inside us is gone.

738
00:52:50.625 --> 00:52:52.169
You don't know that.

739
00:52:53.545 --> 00:52:54.629
Yeah. I do.

740
00:52:55.922 --> 00:52:57.048
You do too.

741
00:52:59.801 --> 00:53:01.344
You have to let them go.

742
00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:07.851
Lila. the train is here!
What should we do?

743
00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:14.566
I'm sorry.

744
00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:20.614
Okay. come on. Come on. everyone.
What are you waiting for?

745
00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:23.200
Come on. come on. come on!

746
00:53:39.007 --> 00:53:40.007
Mom!

747
00:53:40.342 --> 00:53:41.593
No. Lila!

748
00:53:43.011 --> 00:53:44.888
- Lila!
- Mommy!

749
00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:48.642
It's okay. love.

750
00:53:51.645 --> 00:53:53.188
I'll see you soon. okay?

751
00:53:54.856 --> 00:53:56.566
Lila!

752
00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:58.985
Make sure you read
to Gracie every night. okay?

753
00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:00.070
Mommy!

754
00:54:00.153 --> 00:54:02.364
And don't let the twins fight!

755
00:54:09.371 --> 00:54:11.998
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

756
00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:18.380
It's gonna be okay.

757
00:54:29.307 --> 00:54:30.684
I hate you for this.

758
00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:31.810
I know.

759
00:54:31.893 --> 00:54:34.771
I hate you. I hate you for this.

760
00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:48.410
So. uh... now what?

761
00:54:49.661 --> 00:54:51.204
Guess we just wait.

762
00:54:53.832 --> 00:54:54.666
I'm sorry. guys.

763
00:54:54.749 --> 00:54:57.711
If I'd have known we were gonna die here.
I would have cleaned up.

764
00:54:57.794 --> 00:55:00.088
Well. at least your laundry's clean.
I mean...

765
00:55:00.171 --> 00:55:01.172
Actually. it's not.

766
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:18.690
It looks angry.

767
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:20.942
What gives you that impression?

768
00:55:30.452 --> 00:55:31.452
The kids?

769
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:33.496
Yeah. they're safe.

770
00:55:38.918 --> 00:55:39.918
And Claire.

771
00:55:41.963 --> 00:55:43.590
Think they're gonna be okay?

772
00:55:45.216 --> 00:55:46.216
Yeah.

773
00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:48.511
My family will take care of them.

774
00:55:51.598 --> 00:55:52.974
She'll never be alone.

775
00:55:59.981 --> 00:56:00.981
So...

776
00:56:07.447 --> 00:56:08.823
we gonna do this thing?

777
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:32.305
All right. Moving!

778
00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:33.389
Come on. Let's go.

779
00:56:35.475 --> 00:56:36.475
Quickly.

780
00:56:44.818 --> 00:56:47.070
Oh God. I loved those windows.

781
00:56:49.614 --> 00:56:51.741
- All right.
- Doesn't matter anymore.

782
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:55.328
Well. maybe we should go around the circle

783
00:56:55.412 --> 00:56:56.663
and. you know.

784
00:56:57.831 --> 00:57:00.250
share our favorite moments together.

785
00:57:03.461 --> 00:57:04.546
What?

786
00:57:04.629 --> 00:57:05.463
Barf.

787
00:57:05.547 --> 00:57:07.147
- Let's not do that.
- That's a bad idea.

788
00:57:07.173 --> 00:57:09.026
- Yeah. it's terrible.
- That's a terrible idea.

789
00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:10.385
Yeah. bad call.

790
00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:14.973
Okay. so... what do we do?

791
00:57:16.516 --> 00:57:18.476
Just power up. I guess.

792
00:57:23.064 --> 00:57:24.566
You feel strong enough for this?

793
00:57:25.525 --> 00:57:26.525
Yeah.

794
00:57:27.068 --> 00:57:28.111
I think so.

795
00:57:39.873 --> 00:57:41.583
Ugh. I'm feeling...

796
00:57:53.094 --> 00:57:54.179
Okay.

797
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:56.598
Now what?

798
00:57:57.182 --> 00:57:58.266
Now we wait.

799
00:58:26.544 --> 00:58:28.379
I'm sorry you left Canada for this.

800
00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:30.590
I'm not.

801
00:58:32.383 --> 00:58:34.344
This is where I'm supposed to be...

802
00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.223
with my family.

803
00:58:44.145 --> 00:58:45.230
You were right.

804
00:58:48.983 --> 00:58:49.983
Don't.

805
00:58:51.402 --> 00:58:52.403
I see you.

806
00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:55.573
I finally see you.

807
00:58:58.284 --> 00:58:59.911
I didn't mean to hurt you.

808
00:59:02.622 --> 00:59:03.665
I know.

809
00:59:44.831 --> 00:59:46.165
Uh...

810
00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:47.417
...Five?

811
00:59:48.334 --> 00:59:52.380
Don't fight it.
Let it take you. Just let it go.

812
00:59:53.673 --> 00:59:55.091
Whoo! It stings.

813
00:59:55.174 --> 00:59:56.174
Yeah.

814
00:59:57.844 --> 00:59:59.345
I know. Right. buddy?

815
01:00:00.888 --> 01:00:02.015
Hold on. okay?

816
01:00:03.182 --> 01:00:04.392
It's almost over.

817
01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:25.955
Ah!

818
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:37.550
Thank you for letting me be
in your weird family.

819
01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:43.097
Oh God. I'm gonna miss you guys.

820
01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.684
I'm just glad
we're all together in the end.

821
01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:49.729
No more legs and eggs. eh?

822
01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:53.566
Maybe we'll see each other again.

823
01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:55.985
That would be nice.
