ï»¿1
00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:23.773
Step lively. children.
We have a mission to do.

2
00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.817
Number One. round up the children.

3
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.445
Let's go. Get your asses in gear.
My man. Diego.

4
00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:29.946
My ass is always in gear.

5
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.656
Come on. guys. Come on.

6
00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:37.996
Are you kidding me. Klaus?
You just got back from rehab!

7
00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.915
I'm California sober. Allison.

8
00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.709
Come on. guys. Just hurry up.

9
00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:43.792
Dad's waiting!

10
00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:56.138
Ben!

11
00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:58.975
- Why aren't you dressed?
- I'm not going.

12
00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.810
But we'll be one man down.

13
00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.605
Relax. Vanya can take my place.

14
00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.607
I wanna help you guys.

15
00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.736
- Dad?
- Narc.

16
00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.491
Number Six. Why aren't you dressed?

17
00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:15.950
He says he's not going.

18
00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.709
And what do you think you're doing?

19
00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:27.754
I just... I thought I could help
on this mission.

20
00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:32.217
Take that off immediately.

21
00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.302
You look ridiculous.

22
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:45.021
A Moldovan arms dealer
has acquired a deadly new weapon.

23
00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:49.275
It's being held in a shipping container.
awaiting a buyer.

24
00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.320
Your mission is
to locate and destroy the weapon

25
00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:54.405
before the deal can be made.

26
00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.909
- Number One will take point.
- What about me? What should I do?

27
00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.536
Stop asking questions.

28
00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.122
Now. children. whatever you do.

29
00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:05.333
it is imperative that you
keep the weapon contained.

30
00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:09.337
Do not. under any circumstances.

31
00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.131
open the container.

32
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.258
Is that understood?

33
00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:17.219
Very well.

34
00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:19.681
It's time. children.

35
00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.323
Buckle up. children.

36
00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:38.908
Prepare for departure.

37
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.571
Tangos. three o'clock.

38
00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:21.910
Go.

39
00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.052
Yeah. this is the one. Let's go.

40
00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:52.314
Guys!

41
00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:54.359
Go. I got this!

42
00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:56.903
- Are you sure?
- I got this!

43
00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:01.407
Okay. Diego. Allison. Klaus.
you're on me. Let's go.

44
00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.514
Is someone in there?

45
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:48.997
It's okay.

46
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.165
I'm here to help. What's your name?

47
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.543
Jennifer.

48
00:04:57.338 --> 00:04:58.339
My name is Ben.

49
00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:02.260
I'm gonna get you out of here. okay?
Can you trust me?

50
00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.264
Take my hand.

51
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.435
Ben! What the hell are you doing?

52
00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:12.645
There's someone in here.
We have to get her out.

53
00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.063
That wasn't part of the plan.

54
00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.482
So what? You're gonna blow up
an innocent girl?

55
00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.919
- But Dad said...
- I don't give a fuck what Dad said!

56
00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:20.153
We need to help her.

57
00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:21.988
Ben. wait!

58
00:05:22.071 --> 00:05:23.573
Shit!

59
00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.742
Dad. we got a bit of a problem.

60
00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.118
Dad?

61
00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:48.056
Okay. let's go. Ben.

62
00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:56.272
I told you not to open the container.

63
00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:00.526
Dad?

64
00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:23.591
Oh my God.

65
00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:30.932
You murdered our brother!

66
00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:32.141
And Jennifer.

67
00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:34.685
- Son of a bitch.
- Children!

68
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:38.481
{\an8}Whatever anger you may feel
towards me is misdirected.

69
00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.316
{\an8}May I remind you

70
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.819
{\an8}that it was
the other Sir Reginald Hargreeves

71
00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.529
{\an8}who committed this horrible act?

72
00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:45.905
{\an8}What are you going on about?

73
00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:49.742
{\an8}When we were kids. the "other" Hargreeves
killed Ben and Jennifer.

74
00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:52.245
{\an8}And he had a perfectly valid reason
for doing so.

75
00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:53.830
{\an8}They were two innocent kids!

76
00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:57.417
{\an8}Who would have set off
a cataclysmic chain of events.

77
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.252
{\an8}leading to the extinction of all humanity.

78
00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:01.921
{\an8}You are no different
than the other Hargreeves.

79
00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:03.589
{\an8}You're both fucking psychopaths!

80
00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.133
{\an8}It's not his fault.

81
00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:09.470
{\an8}Reg is not responsible for what happened
to your brother and that poor girl.

82
00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:11.597
I am.

83
00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:17.728
Years ago. I synthesized a new element.

84
00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.897
The very essence of the universe.

85
00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.482
The particle we know as marigold.

86
00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:24.944
And at the same moment. unbeknownst to me.

87
00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.738
a second particle was created.

88
00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:28.990
Durango.

89
00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:31.409
When marigold and durango interact.

90
00:07:31.492 --> 00:07:34.245
they cause... a reaction.

91
00:07:34.328 --> 00:07:36.038
a physical reaction.

92
00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:39.083
Unstoppable. irrevocable.

93
00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.295
The extinction of everything we know.

94
00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:43.504
The Cleanse.

95
00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.216
By the time I realized what was happening.

96
00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:49.969
it was too late for our world.

97
00:07:50.052 --> 00:07:51.888
You couldn't have known. darling.

98
00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.892
I... don't mean to be a dick and all.

99
00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.561
but what the fuck does any of this
have to do with us?

100
00:07:58.644 --> 00:07:59.844
The other particle.

101
00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:02.607
it is inside of Jennifer.

102
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.234
That's why it's imperative
that none of you

103
00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.028
can come into contact with her.

104
00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:08.863
What happens if we do?

105
00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:10.740
We end the world.

106
00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:12.658
Saw that coming.

107
00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:14.494
Uh...

108
00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:15.578
Guys?

109
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.333
We... may have a problem.

110
00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.008
- Slow down.
- We've gotta keep moving.

111
00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.344
No.

112
00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:35.765
End of the line.
I'm not going any further with you.

113
00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:37.642
Where are you gonna go?

114
00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.227
I'll figure it out.

115
00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:44.315
Why did I even bother
saving your ungrateful ass?

116
00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:45.233
A good question.

117
00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:47.944
We met. what. 36 hours ago?

118
00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:50.947
In that time. you've killed.
like. two dozen people.

119
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.365
Yeah. to protect you.

120
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:53.949
From what?

121
00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:58.329
Do you even know?

122
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.084
I didn't ask for any of this.
I... I don't even know what this is.

123
00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:08.839
But you and me. we're...

124
00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:11.133
we're connected somehow.

125
00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:15.054
Let's just...

126
00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:19.016
Let's get some rest.
and we can figure this out together.

127
00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:20.892
Please?

128
00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:29.151
Come on. We gotta move.

129
00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:37.827
I don't understand.
What? You just let him go?

130
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.122
Well. how was I supposed to know
Ben was infected with this...

131
00:09:41.205 --> 00:09:42.957
whatever this thing is?

132
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.792
Great work. Luther. Really great.

133
00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:47.420
The rash on his arm.
What did it look like?

134
00:09:47.503 --> 00:09:49.171
I dunno. It was just kind of...

135
00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:53.384
You know. it kind of looked like
that thing that Klaus caught

136
00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:54.927
when he came home from Ibiza.

137
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.611
Are you a doctor?

138
00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.639
Or do you just play one
at bachelorette parties?

139
00:09:58.723 --> 00:09:59.723
Hey!

140
00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:01.767
I am a professional dancer.

141
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:04.812
Luther. was there anything unusual
about this rash?

142
00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:07.106
No. It was just. you know. red.

143
00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:09.733
And glowing.

144
00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:12.944
And pulsating.

145
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.698
You didn't think maybe
that was worth bringing up?

146
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:18.409
I just thought it had to do
with our powers coming back.

147
00:10:18.492 --> 00:10:21.203
I mean. we've all been having issues.
I know I have.

148
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:23.830
I've heard enough.

149
00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.461
Whoa! What are you doing?

150
00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:31.088
- It's time to hunt.
- He's gonna kill Ben all over again.

151
00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:35.134
One of the hosts must be eliminated
before the reaction is complete.

152
00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:36.217
Reaction?

153
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.306
You do realize that you're talking about
human beings and not lab rats. correct?

154
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:43.476
Reggie. please listen to your children.
You can't just murder him.

155
00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:45.478
She's right. There has to be another way.

156
00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:48.105
I understand.
You've grown attached to your brother.

157
00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:51.359
But you don't seem to appreciate
what's at stake here.

158
00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:53.569
We must act before it's too late.

159
00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.240
How about you shut your mouth?

160
00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:00.201
How dare you!

161
00:11:00.284 --> 00:11:01.869
I think it's high time you realize

162
00:11:01.952 --> 00:11:04.705
you're not running the show
here anymore. old man.

163
00:11:06.874 --> 00:11:08.584
Don't even think about it!

164
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.216
Do you think these childish theatrics
will stop me?

165
00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:19.178
Okay. well.
I can step it up a notch if you like.

166
00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:22.556
Viktor. please don't hurt him!

167
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.519
Why not? Why shouldn't I?
All he does is hurt everybody else.

168
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.814
Ben. Jennifer. me.

169
00:11:29.897 --> 00:11:30.940
All of us.

170
00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:33.192
Spare me the waterworks.

171
00:11:33.275 --> 00:11:36.320
One life isn't more important
than the entire planet.

172
00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:38.989
Oh. but your wife's is.

173
00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:44.453
You stuck your nose in
where it didn't belong.

174
00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.288
and you allowed Jennifer to escape.

175
00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:48.082
This is your fault!

176
00:11:48.165 --> 00:11:50.751
Oh no. no. no! This is <i>your</i> fault!

177
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:57.633
My whole life.
all I wanted was for you to see me.

178
00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.510
to make me a part of the team.

179
00:12:00.636 --> 00:12:03.848
Instead. you treated me like I was broken.

180
00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:05.725
And I believed you.

181
00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:09.562
I thought you knew me
better than I knew myself.

182
00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:11.731
but I know now you don't know shit!

183
00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.109
<i>You're</i> the failure!

184
00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:17.528
<i>You're</i> the reason this happened!

185
00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:23.159
And I am not gonna let you kill Ben!
Not now. not ever!

186
00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:25.161
Am I clear?

187
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.671
Viktor.

188
00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:37.297
That's enough.

189
00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:39.425
That's enough.

190
00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:47.516
You and your father.

191
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:50.102
Both so headstrong.

192
00:12:57.735 --> 00:12:59.653
You took your sweet time.

193
00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:02.406
What is it?

194
00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:04.909
Oh.

195
00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:07.452
What?

196
00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:14.835
It seems we may have found your brother.

197
00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:20.591
You are in luck. my dear.

198
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.011
Our most gifted medium is in today.

199
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.354
Looking good. champ.

200
00:13:34.563 --> 00:13:35.940
I'll be back in 30.

201
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:38.901
Enjoy.

202
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:48.994
Please.

203
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.623
Don't be shy. Come on in.

204
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.252
Have a seat.

205
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.047
Name of the deceased?

206
00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:02.132
Uh. Richard.

207
00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:04.593
- Oh.
- But he preferred Dick.

208
00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:06.095
Ha! Don't we all?

209
00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:08.889
And how old was Dick?

210
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.599
Sixty-two.

211
00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:13.310
Died a month ago today.

212
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:17.857
Swerved to miss a deer
and drove headfirst over a cliff.

213
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.651
Oh God! That's tragic.

214
00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:25.406
Ever since. I just...

215
00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:30.619
I feel like he's been... haunting me.

216
00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:32.997
Hauntings are rare. honey.

217
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.082
He's just stuck. is all.

218
00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.751
It's when we can't let go.

219
00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:40.504
neither can they.

220
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.380
Hmm.

221
00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:55.769
Yes.

222
00:14:59.815 --> 00:15:02.067
Beloved Dick.

223
00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.529
we are reaching out to you.

224
00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:09.658
Commune with us.

225
00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:11.535
Commune with us!

226
00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:14.038
Move among us!

227
00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:16.874
Eyes. please.

228
00:15:17.791 --> 00:15:20.419
Yes. Closed. Closed.
Keep 'em closed. That's it.

229
00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:29.678
He's... he's passing over the great divide

230
00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:32.222
between our world and his.

231
00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:33.641
Don't you feel him?

232
00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:36.393
I do! I do!

233
00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:46.070
Is he... here?

234
00:15:47.237 --> 00:15:49.740
Oh. I'm here. baby.

235
00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:54.161
Well. uh...

236
00:15:54.244 --> 00:15:57.706
Tell me something
that only... only I would know.

237
00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:02.753
Tell her...

238
00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:07.758
she has an ass like a Georgia peach.

239
00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:13.346
Well.

240
00:16:14.431 --> 00:16:15.432
he says

241
00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:21.021
you have a derriere
as beautiful as a Georgia...

242
00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:24.692
Georgia peach!

243
00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:25.901
Yes.

244
00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:28.737
Oh! He's here.

245
00:16:35.077 --> 00:16:36.370
He's with us.

246
00:16:37.621 --> 00:16:38.747
Can I

247
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.333
touch him?

248
00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:43.085
Oh baby. Come to Daddy.

249
00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:46.672
Well. that part
is a little trickier. cowboy.

250
00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:50.050
Well. the man outside said

251
00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:52.720
that you would be able to provide certain...

252
00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:56.515
services of a...

253
00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.393
fleshly nature.

254
00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:05.065
It's 500 for the full service.
There's an ATM in the lobby.

255
00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:07.401
Come on. You're gonna charge her?

256
00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:10.362
I brought cash.

257
00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:12.740
Wonderful!

258
00:17:14.324 --> 00:17:15.492
All right.

259
00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:18.704
Hop on board. Dick.

260
00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:41.310
Dick?

261
00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:44.730
You bet your sweet peachy ass!

262
00:17:44.813 --> 00:17:47.691
Mmm! It really is you.

263
00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:51.904
Yeah. baby! Oh baby! I missed you!

264
00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:53.530
Give it to Daddy!

265
00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:07.753
Okay. Ben is an asshole.
I'll give you that. But a mass murderer?

266
00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:10.339
Turned everyone into haggis.

267
00:18:13.675 --> 00:18:15.636
And they have terrible taste in tattoos.

268
00:18:15.719 --> 00:18:17.554
Some next-level psycho shit.

269
00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:19.598
This could have been a rescue mission.

270
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:22.017
More likely a massacre by two individuals

271
00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:24.394
who are growing increasingly violent
by the minute.

272
00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:25.938
You don't know that.

273
00:18:26.021 --> 00:18:29.525
All right. so my guys tell me
that this whole farm actually belongs

274
00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:32.319
to those two lunatics
who ambushed us at New Grumpson.

275
00:18:32.402 --> 00:18:33.612
Gene and Jean Thibedeau.

276
00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:35.823
Well. maybe Ben killed them too.

277
00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:38.617
Forensics found fresh tracks
leading out of the barn.

278
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.246
- My guess is they escaped.
- They couldn't have gotten far.

279
00:18:42.329 --> 00:18:44.289
Based on the signs of rigor.

280
00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:47.167
I'd say time of death was
six. maybe seven hours ago.

281
00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:49.545
How do you know that?

282
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:54.800
<i>Wichita. PD.</i>
Thursday nights at 9/8 Central.

283
00:18:56.301 --> 00:18:57.301
Ready the car.

284
00:18:58.637 --> 00:18:59.888
I gotta make a call.

285
00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:11.066
You thinking what I'm thinking?

286
00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:12.901
Rarely.

287
00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.945
There might be a way to stop all this.

288
00:19:15.028 --> 00:19:16.071
The answer is no.

289
00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:17.990
Hey. you didn't even
let me ask the question.

290
00:19:18.073 --> 00:19:20.492
I know I'm gonna hate it.
Why waste the oxygen?

291
00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:22.296
Why don't we use
that little time choo-choo.

292
00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:24.454
go back in time.
and stop the coming Armageddon?

293
00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.207
How would that work?

294
00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:31.545
Well. we travel back
to the original Jennifer incident.

295
00:19:31.628 --> 00:19:34.047
Stop your Ben from ever touching that Jen.

296
00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:38.510
Lila. if you recall.
we almost got our heads blown off.

297
00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:39.803
- Mmm.
- All right?

298
00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:42.139
Plus. it would never work
without a briefcase.

299
00:19:42.222 --> 00:19:44.766
Stop being such a baby. It's worth a shot.

300
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.812
Clearly the rules are different this time.
Maybe we don't even need a briefcase.

301
00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:52.482
You must have those powers
for a reason. right?

302
00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:54.442
Let's use it.

303
00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:57.821
All right. fine.

304
00:19:57.905 --> 00:20:00.032
First sign of trouble. we're coming back.

305
00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:01.992
You do have one problem though.

306
00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:06.163
I don't suppose
we can explain any of this to him.

307
00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:08.332
He's like a sponge
that can take no more water.

308
00:20:08.415 --> 00:20:09.415
It's a shame.

309
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.585
Can I talk to you for a second?

310
00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:15.296
Do you mind?

311
00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:18.132
Yeah.

312
00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:22.179
That thing you said earlier
about needing a break.

313
00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:25.015
You don't love me anymore?

314
00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:28.685
Of course I still love you.
but you make this so hard. Diego.

315
00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:30.646
What? How? What...

316
00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:33.523
Every day. me and the kids
have to watch you moping around the house.

317
00:20:33.607 --> 00:20:37.527
complaining about your life.
your job. your in-laws. your fat belly.

318
00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:39.029
You're just as bored as I am.

319
00:20:39.112 --> 00:20:42.241
Remember. you're the one
that snuck out to those Keeper meetings.

320
00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:50.624
I took my big bag of shit out of the house
so no one else has to deal with it.

321
00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:53.919
This is our life. my love.

322
00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:58.382
If you're not in it.
then what's the point?

323
00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:07.516
He must be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

324
00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.643
Be prepared to eliminate on sight.

325
00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:11.478
I can save him.

326
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:14.189
Look around. He's beyond saving.

327
00:21:16.316 --> 00:21:18.026
Don't make me put you down again.

328
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.073
Very well. then. What's your big idea?

329
00:21:23.156 --> 00:21:25.575
Just give me a moment. and I can explain.

330
00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:27.786
- Sir?
- Mr. Five.

331
00:21:27.869 --> 00:21:30.622
I thought you said
you had this situation under control.

332
00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:33.625
The situation is proving
more kinetic than anticipated.

333
00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:36.628
No shit. We have
the Texas Tentacle Massacre out here.

334
00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:40.132
Okay. I need to know
who's responsible for this bloodbath.

335
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:45.387
Well. sir. I do have a few leads.
but I need a favor before I can follow up.

336
00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:47.889
I'm listening.

337
00:21:50.058 --> 00:21:53.562
Okay. you see these two idiots over there?
Those are my brothers.

338
00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:56.523
Now. they're kind of stepping
all over the crime scene.

339
00:21:56.606 --> 00:21:58.900
asking dumb questions. getting in my way.

340
00:22:01.528 --> 00:22:03.322
Do you mind taking 'em back to HQ?

341
00:22:04.197 --> 00:22:07.075
You know. show 'em around.
Maybe let them hold some guns.

342
00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:10.203
You're asking me to babysit.

343
00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:14.374
You want this case solved. don't you?

344
00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:17.878
You owe me. Five.

345
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.674
Diego! Luther!

346
00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:25.469
Come over here.
I wanna introduce you to my boss.

347
00:22:25.969 --> 00:22:27.971
Deputy Director Lance Ribbons.

348
00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:31.600
It's an honor to meet you. sir.

349
00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:32.683
Hello. Lance.

350
00:22:33.268 --> 00:22:37.022
I understand you gentlemen have
a keen interest in the CIA.

351
00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:43.445
I'd love to give you an insider's look.
if you're interested.

352
00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:45.906
- No. not really...
- Are you kidding?

353
00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:48.115
We're in.

354
00:22:48.492 --> 00:22:49.492
Good.

355
00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:52.204
Meet me at the office.

356
00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:01.045
What?

357
00:23:01.088 --> 00:23:02.464
Why do I have to go?

358
00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:04.174
'Cause he wants both of us.

359
00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:06.593
Come on. Luther.

360
00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:11.431
I really need this right now. man.
Life sucks.

361
00:23:13.934 --> 00:23:15.102
All right. fine.

362
00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:16.185
Yes!

363
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.523
- We're gonna need suits.
- Suits?

364
00:23:19.606 --> 00:23:20.606
Yeah. man.

365
00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:22.943
Gotta look the part. playboy.

366
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.695
Did you steal those from a dead guy?

367
00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:34.579
Come on. Come on. come on. Klaus.

368
00:23:36.623 --> 00:23:38.959
Claire? Sweetheart. what happened?

369
00:23:44.464 --> 00:23:45.465
I'm on my way.

370
00:24:11.199 --> 00:24:12.479
<i>Welcome to King Reg.</i>

371
00:24:12.534 --> 00:24:15.287
<i>Would you like to try
our two-for-one King Chikkadoo sandwich?</i>

372
00:24:16.705 --> 00:24:21.501
Once upon a time.
I had bad oysters in Cairo.

373
00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:27.674
<i>Pull forward to the window. please.</i>

374
00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:43.148
Do you know why my dog is called Rolex?

375
00:24:44.524 --> 00:24:46.234
Because he's a watchdog.

376
00:24:52.699 --> 00:24:54.117
Shut her down. hon.

377
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.244
Yes!

378
00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:02.512
Come again. Lovely to see you.

379
00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:05.504
So nice to see you.
Okay. thank you very much. Thank you.

380
00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:07.672
Okay. Bye-bye. Goodbye.

381
00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:08.924
Thank you. sir.

382
00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:13.844
Claire?

383
00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:16.848
- Honey. are you okay?
- I tried to stop him.

384
00:25:16.932 --> 00:25:20.435
It's okay. It's okay.
It's all right. It's not your fault. okay?

385
00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:24.147
You need to understand.
your uncle has a disease.

386
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:26.024
He's really. really sick.

387
00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:27.858
What about you?

388
00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:32.155
What happened to your face. Mom?
Where were you?

389
00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:35.033
Maybe it's time
to look at your side of the street.

390
00:25:36.326 --> 00:25:37.160
Excuse me?

391
00:25:37.244 --> 00:25:40.372
If you know this. why do you keep
letting him into your life?

392
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.543
You need to address
your inability to set healthy boundaries.

393
00:25:45.126 --> 00:25:46.670
Okay. little miss.

394
00:25:46.753 --> 00:25:50.507
You're a little young to understand
my relationship with my brother.

395
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.008
Jesus.

396
00:25:52.092 --> 00:25:54.344
Ever since we were kids.
this is what he does.

397
00:25:54.427 --> 00:25:57.764
He messes up. He gets in some shit.
And who does he call? Me.

398
00:26:00.308 --> 00:26:01.393
But he needs me.

399
00:26:01.977 --> 00:26:03.687
He needs us.

400
00:26:06.064 --> 00:26:08.733
Uncle Klaus is immortal. right?

401
00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:10.819
Yeah. So?

402
00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:15.365
So why do you keep trying to save someone
who can literally save himself?

403
00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:19.744
When did you get so smart?

404
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.997
Guess I got it from my mom.

405
00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:27.544
What a mess.

406
00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:33.091
So are we gonna go look for him or...

407
00:26:33.174 --> 00:26:34.801
Maybe just this once.

408
00:26:34.884 --> 00:26:36.261
Yeah. I'll go change.

409
00:26:44.894 --> 00:26:47.606
Five hundred bucks in 30 minutes?

410
00:26:50.358 --> 00:26:52.777
You know. at this rate.

411
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:55.405
I'm gonna have that debt paid off
in no time.

412
00:26:55.488 --> 00:26:57.782
No time at all.

413
00:26:57.866 --> 00:26:59.200
That's what you think.

414
00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:00.744
Hey. what are you doing?

415
00:27:00.827 --> 00:27:03.038
- Hey. that's not fair!
- Hey!

416
00:27:05.749 --> 00:27:07.417
- That's for food.
- What?

417
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.794
For rent. For supplies.

418
00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:11.046
Are you kidding me?

419
00:27:11.755 --> 00:27:13.757
What do you think? Sage grows on trees?

420
00:27:15.008 --> 00:27:16.008
Fuck.

421
00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:20.388
Dom's cut. Pirate's cut. My cut.

422
00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:26.895
And that is for the party favors
we went through last night.

423
00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:35.737
What's it gonna be. my little star?

424
00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.495
That's what I thought.

425
00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:46.873
Pace yourself.
Got a busy night ahead of you.

426
00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:51.836
Yeah. baby!

427
00:27:58.301 --> 00:27:59.969
Go! Go! Go!

428
00:28:00.637 --> 00:28:02.222
See that board over here?

429
00:28:04.224 --> 00:28:05.058
Let's go.

430
00:28:22.826 --> 00:28:24.828
Any updates on our missing person?

431
00:28:24.911 --> 00:28:27.497
No. ma'am. but we are still waiting
for some teams to report in.

432
00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.165
Top marks. Bea.

433
00:28:32.627 --> 00:28:34.129
Was there something else?

434
00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:37.132
Um. there's somebody asking to see you.

435
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.510
- Name?
- He wouldn't say.

436
00:28:40.593 --> 00:28:41.720
And you let him in?

437
00:28:43.138 --> 00:28:45.515
He... He knew the code phrase.

438
00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:52.980
Bring him over.

439
00:28:57.026 --> 00:28:58.319
She's doing her best.

440
00:29:00.196 --> 00:29:01.614
Don't you defend her.

441
00:29:10.498 --> 00:29:11.916
Can we help you?

442
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.626
I very much hope so.

443
00:29:14.294 --> 00:29:16.045
Denny Muntz. Red Deer chapter.

444
00:29:16.713 --> 00:29:17.797
Never heard of it.

445
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:21.342
Well. we're small. but I assure you.
we're all true believers.

446
00:29:22.385 --> 00:29:25.680
You've helped so many people
find the truth. Jean.

447
00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:27.307
May... May I call you Jean?

448
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:28.850
No. you may not.

449
00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:30.143
Gene!

450
00:29:30.226 --> 00:29:31.686
Don't be rude.

451
00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:34.439
Of course you can. Mr. Muntz.

452
00:29:34.522 --> 00:29:36.858
- Please have a seat.
- Oh. thank you.

453
00:29:37.984 --> 00:29:38.984
Tight squeeze.

454
00:29:47.535 --> 00:29:49.287
State your business here.

455
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:51.873
I want to...

456
00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:54.834
discuss the missing girl.

457
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.468
Are you hungry. Mr. Muntz?

458
00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:06.554
Because they have
a hell of a chicken sandwich here.

459
00:30:08.431 --> 00:30:09.933
- I could eat. Jean.
- Yeah.

460
00:30:10.016 --> 00:30:12.101
Thank you.

461
00:30:12.185 --> 00:30:13.311
Chikkadoo.

462
00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:27.826
<i>Dave. it's at the theater!</i>

463
00:30:56.771 --> 00:30:57.771
Hey.

464
00:30:59.107 --> 00:31:00.107
Hey.

465
00:31:01.651 --> 00:31:02.986
Thought you were sleeping.

466
00:31:06.072 --> 00:31:07.115
I feel like

467
00:31:08.783 --> 00:31:10.243
I'm going insane.

468
00:31:13.079 --> 00:31:15.874
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you since we met.

469
00:31:18.793 --> 00:31:19.793
Same.

470
00:31:22.797 --> 00:31:25.091
I've never felt this way
about anyone before.

471
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:33.433
I feel like
breaking down this wall right now.

472
00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:43.609
Look.

473
00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:49.532
I appreciate you saving me
from those lunatics.

474
00:31:50.116 --> 00:31:51.784
but once we get some rest.

475
00:31:51.868 --> 00:31:54.120
I think it's best
if we go our separate ways.

476
00:31:54.621 --> 00:31:57.874
How am I supposed to do that?
Where am I supposed to go?

477
00:31:57.957 --> 00:31:59.000
Back to your family.

478
00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:01.002
Those people aren't my family.

479
00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:03.171
My family died a long time ago.

480
00:32:05.298 --> 00:32:06.549
Mine too.

481
00:32:18.144 --> 00:32:19.144
Well.

482
00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.648
if they ever even existed.

483
00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:24.484
What do you mean?

484
00:32:26.653 --> 00:32:27.946
When I was six.

485
00:32:28.696 --> 00:32:31.407
I was pulled out of the stomach
of a giant squid.

486
00:32:32.742 --> 00:32:34.494
It was on the news and everything.

487
00:32:37.038 --> 00:32:38.957
I was never identified.

488
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.044
Nobody ever came to claim me.

489
00:32:45.088 --> 00:32:46.881
Must have tossed me overboard.

490
00:32:49.342 --> 00:32:51.177
It's a miracle I even survived.

491
00:33:02.563 --> 00:33:04.524
Ben? You still there?

492
00:33:06.067 --> 00:33:07.067
Look.

493
00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.613
Obviously. we're meant to be together.

494
00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:13.449
Me with my tentacles.

495
00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:15.368
You. the miracle squid girl.

496
00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:22.709
That has to be fate. right?

497
00:33:29.632 --> 00:33:30.967
What channel are you on?

498
00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:36.097
Six.

499
00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:38.975
It's <i>The Blob.</i>

500
00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:41.144
I love this movie.

501
00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:45.023
Me too.

502
00:33:45.732 --> 00:33:47.608
<i>No. Danny! Wait!</i>

503
00:33:49.569 --> 00:33:50.778
<i>What goes?</i>

504
00:33:53.489 --> 00:33:54.489
Okay.

505
00:33:54.991 --> 00:33:56.659
Do exactly what we did last time.

506
00:33:56.743 --> 00:33:58.286
Just ride one stop eastbound.

507
00:33:58.369 --> 00:34:00.705
Go up to the apocalypse timeline.

508
00:34:00.788 --> 00:34:04.959
Avoid getting killed.
and warp back to 2006.

509
00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:08.504
Stop Ben from ever going
on the Moldovan mission. Got that?

510
00:34:08.588 --> 00:34:10.673
Relax. It's a rookie time travel mission.

511
00:34:10.757 --> 00:34:13.134
We've done this a thousand times.

512
00:34:13.217 --> 00:34:17.013
But time travel-wise.
I don't get the whole subway thing. right?

513
00:34:17.096 --> 00:34:19.766
I'm much more of
a DeLorean kind of person. yeah?

514
00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:28.524
Just in case...

515
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:35.531
After you.

516
00:34:51.964 --> 00:34:52.964
Shit!

517
00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:56.052
Oh. goddamn it!

518
00:35:02.308 --> 00:35:04.310
The lady is back for more.

519
00:35:04.393 --> 00:35:06.729
Oh. hello.

520
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.231
Look at you.

521
00:35:08.314 --> 00:35:11.067
Stacking up repeat customers already.

522
00:35:16.656 --> 00:35:17.865
So.

523
00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:20.117
more Dick?

524
00:35:21.661 --> 00:35:22.787
Yes. please.

525
00:35:26.165 --> 00:35:29.252
Our beloved Ricardo.

526
00:35:30.336 --> 00:35:32.964
Come back for round two.

527
00:35:33.047 --> 00:35:34.465
Commune

528
00:35:35.424 --> 00:35:36.759
with us

529
00:35:37.677 --> 00:35:39.345
once more.

530
00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:56.195
Oh. I knew
you couldn't stay away. baby.

531
00:36:03.327 --> 00:36:05.746
- What's gotten into you?
- Shut your mouth.

532
00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:08.541
Where's the money. Richard?

533
00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:10.877
What? What money?

534
00:36:12.086 --> 00:36:13.504
Don't play dumb with me.

535
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:16.757
I checked the safe deposit box.

536
00:36:17.258 --> 00:36:18.258
It's gone.

537
00:36:19.343 --> 00:36:21.888
I don't know what you're talking about!

538
00:36:22.889 --> 00:36:24.390
Uh-huh.

539
00:36:25.641 --> 00:36:30.396
You know. for 20 years. I stood by.
and I watched you squander our money

540
00:36:30.479 --> 00:36:32.106
to dice and hussies.

541
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:36.235
And I will be damned
if I let you take it to the grave.

542
00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:39.906
Where is it?

543
00:36:43.242 --> 00:36:47.371
I'll never tell you. you heartless whore.

544
00:37:00.426 --> 00:37:01.426
Dick?

545
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.722
Dick? Dick?

546
00:37:07.183 --> 00:37:08.267
He's gone.

547
00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:15.191
Oh. can you please
unhand my... my treasures. please?

548
00:37:15.274 --> 00:37:17.276
Ow!

549
00:37:20.696 --> 00:37:23.324
Well. that was a waste.
I'm not paying for that.

550
00:37:25.284 --> 00:37:26.284
I know.

551
00:37:27.245 --> 00:37:29.080
I know where he hid the money.

552
00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:33.709
And I'll tell you.

553
00:37:33.793 --> 00:37:37.046
But first. you gotta help me
get the hell out of here.

554
00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:40.007
Start talking.

555
00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:42.759
The brooch.

556
00:37:44.637 --> 00:37:47.306
Give me the brooch.
then I'll tell you the location.

557
00:37:49.809 --> 00:37:51.269
What's going on in there?

558
00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:54.981
All right.
It's the First National Bank of Zurich.

559
00:37:56.899 --> 00:37:58.901
- Passcode?
- Brooch first.

560
00:38:00.236 --> 00:38:02.321
The password is "Thunderbolt."

561
00:38:05.324 --> 00:38:08.202
Oh. he always loved that damn dog
more than me.

562
00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:16.585
That was pretty fast.

563
00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:18.796
It was quite good.

564
00:38:20.673 --> 00:38:22.883
- See you next time.
- Toodle-oo.

565
00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:27.179
Cha-ching.

566
00:38:49.076 --> 00:38:50.661
Not bad. not bad.

567
00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:55.541
Oh. just be careful with that tie.
Tends to end up in your G-string.

568
00:38:56.417 --> 00:38:58.336
Wait. you're wearing a G-string?

569
00:38:59.462 --> 00:39:00.462
You're not?

570
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:03.132
- Never mind. Come on.
- Wait.

571
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.093
What are we doing here anyway?

572
00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:09.847
We should be out there finding Ben.
not holed up in some office.

573
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:11.849
- Some office?
- Yeah.

574
00:39:12.558 --> 00:39:13.726
Luther.

575
00:39:13.809 --> 00:39:19.565
you're standing in the heart of
the most powerful intelligence apparatus

576
00:39:19.648 --> 00:39:21.859
in the history of the world!

577
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:24.069
I mean.

578
00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:26.822
intelligence. bro.

579
00:39:28.157 --> 00:39:29.742
This is how we find Ben.

580
00:39:41.087 --> 00:39:42.213
He's just excited.

581
00:39:46.634 --> 00:39:50.137
Okay. Broken vending machine. Australia.

582
00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:52.932
Three burnt-out light bulbs.

583
00:39:53.015 --> 00:39:55.267
See? Your poetry book came in handy.

584
00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:57.436
All right.

585
00:39:58.229 --> 00:40:01.065
Knowing me. I probably set a trap.
so be careful.

586
00:40:15.454 --> 00:40:17.456
All right. There's no sign of him.

587
00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:21.210
Okay. Well. let's get going
before you start farting.

588
00:40:22.002 --> 00:40:22.920
Yeah.

589
00:40:23.003 --> 00:40:25.256
Ready? 2006. here we come.

590
00:40:32.513 --> 00:40:33.514
Did it work?

591
00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.724
Are we here?

592
00:40:36.559 --> 00:40:37.560
I don't know.

593
00:40:38.144 --> 00:40:40.729
October 14. 2006.

594
00:40:41.355 --> 00:40:42.982
Great. Okay.

595
00:40:43.065 --> 00:40:45.067
So we go in. we snuff Ben out.

596
00:40:45.151 --> 00:40:47.778
we get back on the tube.
we're back before bath time.

597
00:40:47.862 --> 00:40:49.363
We're not here to kill him. Lila.

598
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:52.867
We're just diverting him. Making sure
he doesn't go on the Moldova mission.

599
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.995
- Mmm.
- I haven't seen him in. like. five years.

600
00:40:56.078 --> 00:40:58.956
So he might be a little jumpy.
Just play it cool.

601
00:40:59.039 --> 00:41:00.791
Like polar bear nipples.

602
00:41:00.875 --> 00:41:02.835
Oh shit!

603
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.091
Step lively. children.
We have a mission to do.

604
00:41:09.675 --> 00:41:11.677
Number One. round up the children!

605
00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:15.181
Let's go. Get your asses in gear.
My man. Diego.

606
00:41:15.264 --> 00:41:16.849
My ass is always in gear.

607
00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:19.226
Come on. guys.

608
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:20.978
Are you kidding me?

609
00:41:21.061 --> 00:41:22.813
You just got out of rehab.

610
00:41:22.897 --> 00:41:25.524
I'm California sober. Alphonso.

611
00:41:27.067 --> 00:41:28.152
Alphonso?

612
00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:33.782
Umbrellas.

613
00:41:36.076 --> 00:41:37.244
Sparrows.

614
00:41:38.078 --> 00:41:40.164
- Who's that?
- We're in the wrong timeline.

615
00:41:40.247 --> 00:41:41.624
- We need to go.
- Hey!

616
00:41:42.583 --> 00:41:44.668
- Who the hell are you?
- Rude.

617
00:41:45.586 --> 00:41:47.546
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

618
00:41:48.422 --> 00:41:50.591
We're the Phoenix Academy.

619
00:41:50.674 --> 00:41:52.218
And we're about to fuck you up.

620
00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:57.097
Okay. slight hiccup.

621
00:41:57.723 --> 00:41:58.724
You think?

622
00:41:59.725 --> 00:42:02.102
Okay. Well. look.
We're in the wrong timeline.

623
00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:03.979
but clearly. we're in the neighborhood.

624
00:42:04.063 --> 00:42:05.523
Neighborhood of what?

625
00:42:05.606 --> 00:42:07.608
Christ. I never should have
listened to you.

626
00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:09.902
Chill out. Five!

627
00:42:09.985 --> 00:42:12.404
We'll figure it out. okay? You know why?

628
00:42:12.488 --> 00:42:14.406
Because someone brought a map.

629
00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:15.866
Hmm.

630
00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:17.367
All right.

631
00:42:19.828 --> 00:42:20.913
Look. we're here.

632
00:42:21.497 --> 00:42:24.500
Take this train three stops
to this squiggly line.

633
00:42:25.209 --> 00:42:27.753
Transfer at the division symbol.

634
00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:30.713
Oh fuck!

635
00:42:31.298 --> 00:42:32.424
Oh no. wait!

636
00:42:33.008 --> 00:42:34.301
We're here.

637
00:42:35.135 --> 00:42:37.012
Two stops on the ampersand.

638
00:42:37.596 --> 00:42:39.807
- No more winging it.
- Is that an umlaut or an ablaut?

639
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.809
Let's get back to where we came from.

640
00:42:44.478 --> 00:42:45.479
Now!

641
00:42:46.605 --> 00:42:48.607
- Hey!
- What? Do you wanna miss the train?

642
00:42:48.691 --> 00:42:52.236
Well. who made you in charge?
Jesus! You were gonna leave without me.

643
00:42:58.576 --> 00:42:59.702
All right.

644
00:42:59.785 --> 00:43:00.995
Come to Mama.

645
00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.705
Come on. baby.

646
00:43:12.506 --> 00:43:14.300
Oh. oh. oh!

647
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.010
Wait.

648
00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:18.887
Yes!

649
00:43:18.971 --> 00:43:22.182
Sweet delicious Jesus. you bitch!

650
00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:23.267
Come to Mama!

651
00:43:33.986 --> 00:43:35.070
Oh freedom.

652
00:43:36.196 --> 00:43:37.196
Freedom.

653
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:39.825
All right. baby. freedom.

654
00:43:57.176 --> 00:43:59.053
Goddamn you. Thunderbolt.

655
00:44:06.268 --> 00:44:07.268
Bingo.

656
00:44:11.565 --> 00:44:12.900
What do we got here?

657
00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:15.319
This isn't a dog corpse.

658
00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:29.500
Oh my God!

659
00:44:31.794 --> 00:44:34.421
Thank you. thank you. Thunderbolt.

660
00:44:35.631 --> 00:44:36.631
Surprise.

661
00:44:37.633 --> 00:44:38.676
How did you...

662
00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:41.720
Oh. Richard never trusted banks. sweetie.

663
00:44:41.804 --> 00:44:43.597
And I knew that you were fibbing.

664
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:47.518
So I waited till you got yourself free.
and I followed you here.

665
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.980
Well. you are right on time.

666
00:44:52.481 --> 00:44:54.525
Very. very punctual.

667
00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.570
How about we call it a 50/50 split?

668
00:44:58.654 --> 00:45:00.447
I mean. that seems fair to me.

669
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:05.619
I'm more than happy
to just take my finder's fee

670
00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:09.373
slash digging-for-several-hours fee

671
00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:11.542
and be on my merry way. all right?

672
00:45:11.625 --> 00:45:14.002
How about I shoot you

673
00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:16.004
in the face?

674
00:45:16.088 --> 00:45:17.756
Just...

675
00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:19.590
All right.

676
00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.138
I could probably get down to. uh...

677
00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:26.348
0%.

678
00:45:26.432 --> 00:45:29.017
- I could probably live with that.
- Yeah.

679
00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:30.686
Just take it.

680
00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:33.147
Right there. I see 'em.

681
00:45:33.647 --> 00:45:36.233
Always good to keep a rat around.

682
00:45:36.859 --> 00:45:38.527
'cause they sniff out the cheese.

683
00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:40.821
Okay. back up. This is my estate.

684
00:45:41.321 --> 00:45:44.324
- That's what you think.
- Run out of people to pimp?

685
00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:46.488
- What are you doing?
- Funny. lady.

686
00:45:46.535 --> 00:45:48.746
You find that gun in a Cracker Jack box?

687
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:50.664
Had to bring
your big boys with you?

688
00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:51.665
That's right.

689
00:45:51.749 --> 00:45:53.751
How about I put a hole in that jacket?

690
00:45:53.834 --> 00:45:54.835
Try it.

691
00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.695
Oh my God!

692
00:46:24.865 --> 00:46:27.451
I was so not expecting that.

693
00:46:29.912 --> 00:46:31.747
Oh. well. All right.

694
00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:34.166
Oh. Quinn!

695
00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:38.796
Thank God you're alive!

696
00:46:40.047 --> 00:46:43.050
Guess you found a way
to finally pay that debt off.

697
00:46:45.052 --> 00:46:47.304
So we're even now. right?

698
00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:48.805
Yeah.

699
00:46:49.389 --> 00:46:50.974
Can you give me a hand. please?

700
00:46:51.058 --> 00:46:53.143
- You want a hand? Yeah?
- Yeah.

701
00:46:53.227 --> 00:46:54.812
Here's your fucking hand.

702
00:47:00.067 --> 00:47:01.193
Fucking tweaker.

703
00:47:02.903 --> 00:47:05.239
Ow! Ow. that hurt.

704
00:47:07.741 --> 00:47:10.077
Ha ha! Very funny.

705
00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:14.498
Quinn. could you open this goddamn lid?

706
00:47:17.292 --> 00:47:18.292
Quinn!

707
00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:27.385
Quinn.

708
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.765
Quinn! Stop playing around! Open...

709
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:34.017
Quinn! Open up!

710
00:47:34.101 --> 00:47:35.561
Open up! Open up!

711
00:47:35.644 --> 00:47:37.771
A year or two should do the trick.

712
00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:40.732
Please help! Help me!

713
00:47:40.816 --> 00:47:42.442
Help me!

714
00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:43.819
Help!

715
00:47:43.902 --> 00:47:45.821
Help me. please! Someone!

716
00:47:47.072 --> 00:47:48.240
Help!

717
00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:52.619
Let's hear it. then. Your brilliant plan.

718
00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:55.706
- I can remove Ben's marigold.
- That's not possible.

719
00:47:55.789 --> 00:47:57.124
I've done it before.

720
00:47:58.792 --> 00:48:00.419
I assume it wasn't without risk.

721
00:48:01.753 --> 00:48:04.923
- It had its challenges.
- Then why would you want to do it again?

722
00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:07.426
'Cause he's my brother.

723
00:48:07.926 --> 00:48:09.094
A meaningless connection.

724
00:48:10.262 --> 00:48:11.262
You're wrong.

725
00:48:11.305 --> 00:48:12.347
Really?

726
00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:18.937
You never did understand
what it means to be a part of a family.

727
00:48:19.438 --> 00:48:21.273
And thank goodness for that.

728
00:48:21.899 --> 00:48:24.067
You children bicker constantly.

729
00:48:24.151 --> 00:48:25.151
Yeah!

730
00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:28.113
Yeah. And we drive each other crazy.

731
00:48:28.196 --> 00:48:31.325
That's why I moved
as far away from them as possible.

732
00:48:31.825 --> 00:48:35.412
But when things go to hell.
which inevitably they do.

733
00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:37.873
they're there for me.

734
00:48:39.207 --> 00:48:42.794
More evidence
humans are an inferior species.

735
00:48:44.379 --> 00:48:46.882
If that's what you think.
I feel sorry for you.

736
00:48:47.382 --> 00:48:49.092
Spare me your pity. boy.

737
00:48:49.176 --> 00:48:53.847
Even with your powers.
I am your superior in every way.

738
00:48:57.351 --> 00:48:58.352
Maybe.

739
00:49:00.145 --> 00:49:03.273
But in every timeline.
you're also a complete asshole.

740
00:49:24.711 --> 00:49:25.712
That was our stop.

741
00:49:32.552 --> 00:49:33.971
<i>...the express.</i>

742
00:49:34.554 --> 00:49:35.555
- Bollocks.
- Shit.
