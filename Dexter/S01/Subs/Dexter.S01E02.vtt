WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:04.342
Previously on Dexter. . .

00:04.968 --> 00:06.135
Tonight's the night.

00:06.261 --> 00:09.347
And it's going to happen again and again. . .

00:09.890 --> 00:11.599
Has to happen.

00:11.725 --> 00:13.226
There he is.

00:13.894 --> 00:15.436
He's the one.

00:18.065 --> 00:20.566
You're mine now, so do exactly as l say.

00:22.027 --> 00:23.945
- You better be a cop.
- No. Forensics.

00:24.071 --> 00:27.699
There is no blood near the body.
lt's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

00:27.825 --> 00:31.953
l've never seen such clean.
dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

00:32.079 --> 00:33.996
How does the killer get rid of the blood?

00:34.123 --> 00:35.873
One of these days, you're gonna tell me.

00:35.999 --> 00:38.626
l told you blood spatter
doesn't take up all my time.

00:38.752 --> 00:41.587
- How was your date with Rita last night?
- Great.

00:41.714 --> 00:43.464
She's perfect because Rita is,

00:43.590 --> 00:45.883
in her own way, as damaged as me.

00:46.051 --> 00:48.928
Open your eyes and look at what you did!

00:49.054 --> 00:53.224
- Please. you have to understand.
- Trust me. l definitely understand.

00:57.187 --> 00:59.230
- Hello?
- What are you doing now?

00:59.356 --> 01:02.108
Just finishing up a project,
but l'll come by later.

01:02.234 --> 01:03.985
- They found another hooker.
- Another?

01:04.111 --> 01:05.778
The third one in five months.

01:05.904 --> 01:08.781
- Third? You mean there's a. . .
- A serial killer, right.

01:08.907 --> 01:12.201
There are people out there
who do really bad things.

01:12.327 --> 01:14.620
Learn how to spot them. l can teach Dexter.

01:14.747 --> 01:19.417
The killer flayed the skin, the flesh, completely
off. Now, why would he do that?

01:19.543 --> 01:21.961
He's experimenting to find the right way.

01:22.087 --> 01:26.966
He's certainly raising the bar.
Damn, this guy is good.

01:27.092 --> 01:28.342
The killer is an artist.

01:28.469 --> 01:30.553
You give me the fucking creeps,
you know that?

01:30.679 --> 01:32.346
Yeah, l know. Sorry about that.

01:32.473 --> 01:36.058
But now we have a fourth body,
and the cuts were different.

01:36.185 --> 01:38.686
That's telling us a story.
The ritual is changing.

01:38.812 --> 01:41.522
l'd like to check and see
if any refrigerated trucks

01:41.648 --> 01:43.941
have been stolen in the last week or so.

01:46.945 --> 01:48.321
lt just seems odd.

01:48.447 --> 01:52.742
Your sister has this ice-truck theory,
and then here you are to back it up.

01:52.868 --> 01:55.536
she's good. Lieutenant.
You should give her a chance.

01:56.789 --> 01:58.623
l think this is a friendly message.

01:58.749 --> 02:00.708
"Hey, wanna play?"

02:00.834 --> 02:05.004
And, yes, l wanna play. l really, really do.

04:12.925 --> 04:14.592
l dream.

04:17.763 --> 04:22.224
l dream l'm floating
on the surface of my own life,

04:22.351 --> 04:25.353
watching it unfold, observing it.

04:26.772 --> 04:28.773
l'm the outsider, looking in.

04:40.452 --> 04:42.244
Yeah!

04:42.371 --> 04:45.331
Oh, you want to play, man? Come on!

04:45.457 --> 04:46.999
ln the water!

04:49.378 --> 04:52.254
Look at them.
They can laugh and play.

04:52.381 --> 04:54.465
lt comes so easily for them.

04:56.718 --> 04:59.220
Even though l'm not one of them,

04:59.346 --> 05:02.807
even though sometimes
l can really be a monster. . .

05:03.600 --> 05:05.601
today, l'm just. . .

05:06.645 --> 05:08.312
a sea monster.

05:25.455 --> 05:29.417
Soon enough, l'll have to go back
to doing what l do. . .

05:29.543 --> 05:34.088
so l make a point of enjoying days like this
when l have them.

05:48.812 --> 05:50.354
Just a second.

05:51.356 --> 05:55.401
The ice-truck killer left me
a gruesome souvenir.

05:55.527 --> 05:58.404
Explaining it could be kind of. . .

05:58.530 --> 06:00.448
awkward.

06:01.199 --> 06:04.118
- Hey.
- Bagels, brother. Let me in.

06:10.792 --> 06:13.169
Could it be more depressing in here?

06:14.212 --> 06:16.839
Got anything to drink?
lt's hot as hell out there.

06:16.965 --> 06:18.340
OJ?

06:18.467 --> 06:19.925
With ice.

06:24.723 --> 06:26.265
So, how you doing?

06:26.391 --> 06:27.600
l'm fine.

06:27.726 --> 06:29.185
Yeah, things are fine.

06:29.311 --> 06:33.939
Breakfast, which l already had, was fine,
but you know me. l'm always hungry.

06:40.989 --> 06:42.656
So, what's up, hotshot?

06:42.783 --> 06:44.450
All right, get this.

06:44.576 --> 06:46.577
Lieutenant's looking
for that refrigerated truck

06:46.703 --> 06:50.039
in every swamp, glade, and chop shop
from here to the Keys.

06:50.165 --> 06:51.749
But the way l see it. . .

06:52.417 --> 06:56.670
that whackjob truck driver
threw a severed head at your car.

06:56.797 --> 06:58.047
lt's not as if he's shy.

06:58.173 --> 07:01.425
You think he hid the truck in plain sight,
wanting it to be found?

07:01.551 --> 07:04.970
l could answer that if LaGuerta
didn't have me back with my hookers.

07:05.097 --> 07:08.265
- That truck is your ticket into Homicide.
- Tell me about it.

07:08.391 --> 07:11.477
Just because LaGuerta has you
looking for hookers on her time

07:11.603 --> 07:14.730
- doesn't mean you can't look for the truck. . .
- On my time.

07:16.191 --> 07:18.943
- What's with these?
- l've got court.

07:21.279 --> 07:24.782
Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?

07:25.325 --> 07:27.827
Our dad was a cop. You're a cop.
l work for the cops.

07:27.953 --> 07:30.412
For us, this is brother-sister stuff.

07:32.165 --> 07:34.875
Brings out your eyes.

07:39.422 --> 07:41.674
First he throws a severed head at me,

07:41.800 --> 07:43.884
then he leaves me these doll parts,

07:44.010 --> 07:46.220
like pieces of a puzzle.

07:46.346 --> 07:47.888
l like puzzles.

07:55.647 --> 07:58.899
But there's nothing more frustrating
than putting a puzzle together

07:59.025 --> 08:02.486
and finding that it still doesn't make sense.

08:07.826 --> 08:10.035
Please state your name and occupation.

08:10.162 --> 08:13.122
My name is Dexter Morgan,
and l'm a forensics specialist

08:13.248 --> 08:16.709
in blood-spatter analysis
for the Miami Metro Police Department.

08:16.835 --> 08:19.712
And how long have you been
doing blood-spatter analysis?

08:19.838 --> 08:21.088
Almost 1 2 years.

08:21.214 --> 08:23.382
You've been involved in quite a few cases.

08:23.508 --> 08:25.551
2, 1 03.

08:25.677 --> 08:27.595
Give or take.

08:27.721 --> 08:30.097
No, 2, 1 03.

08:31.016 --> 08:33.726
Then it's safe to say blood is your life.

08:35.979 --> 08:37.479
Safe to say.

08:37.606 --> 08:39.690
Unlike the other guys
down at the station,

08:39.816 --> 08:44.820
l love coming to court to rub shoulders with the
good people of the Sunshine State. . .

08:44.946 --> 08:47.072
and Sasquatch.

08:47.199 --> 08:50.868
ln a courthouse.
everyone's on their best behavior. . .

08:53.663 --> 08:55.456
like they're being watched.

09:00.128 --> 09:01.879
And they are.

09:02.005 --> 09:05.799
Some people would look at this family
and see only tragedy and heartbreak.

09:05.926 --> 09:08.427
But l see so much more than that.

09:09.179 --> 09:11.722
l'll do this, OK?

09:14.184 --> 09:16.060
l see opportunity.

09:18.855 --> 09:23.984
Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed
his mom, went out for a jog.

09:24.110 --> 09:29.240
He told her he'd be back in time to take out the
trash cans. Just another night. until...

09:30.450 --> 09:34.119
until the defendant not only struck him
with his car, but fled the scene,

09:34.246 --> 09:37.289
leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying
for hours

09:37.415 --> 09:40.084
before his body was found the next morning.

09:40.627 --> 09:43.420
From heinous to unspeakable.

09:44.422 --> 09:46.674
The people will prove that not only
did Mr. Chambers

09:46.800 --> 09:48.842
strike and kill Alexander Pryce,

09:48.969 --> 09:52.805
but did so while once again
under the influence of alcohol.

09:53.974 --> 09:55.683
Happy birthday, Alex!

09:55.809 --> 09:57.643
- Thank Dexter.
- Rip right into it.

09:57.769 --> 09:58.727
What?

09:58.853 --> 10:01.146
Yeah. Hope it's money.

10:01.273 --> 10:02.773
Yeah, you wish.

10:03.984 --> 10:06.277
Thanks, guys. lt's like 80 degrees out.

10:07.320 --> 10:11.282
But next year at this time.
we're coming to visit you at Harvard.

10:12.575 --> 10:15.995
- lt's everything l've ever wanted for Dexter.
- Thanks, Dad.

10:16.746 --> 10:19.665
All right, enough corniness.

10:19.791 --> 10:21.458
l see their pain.

10:22.419 --> 10:25.379
On some level.
l even understand their pain.

10:26.423 --> 10:28.549
l just can't feel their pain.

10:33.972 --> 10:39.476
lt's a matter of time before we see how far Matt
Chambers' crocodile tears get him.

10:41.229 --> 10:42.479
But until then. . .

10:44.482 --> 10:47.693
a little of my favorite tropical fruit.

10:48.987 --> 10:52.364
The perfect driving food
next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

10:52.490 --> 10:54.992
Also, l can keep my energy up
for the day job.

11:25.774 --> 11:28.150
Detective!

11:28.276 --> 11:29.318
Did we get an lD?

11:29.444 --> 11:32.071
First on scene pulled the wallet.
We're still waiting.

11:32.197 --> 11:34.323
Hello, Dex.

11:34.449 --> 11:36.575
Our boss - Lieutenant LaGuerta.

11:36.701 --> 11:41.747
ln keeping with her total sense of entitlement,
she has this attraction to me.

11:41.873 --> 11:43.457
And l thought l was creepy.

11:45.210 --> 11:49.922
Given the skin rupture and the secondary
spatter, distance had to be a 50, 60ft drop.

11:50.048 --> 11:52.424
The eastbound's only 40ft.

11:52.550 --> 11:54.927
lt's not high enough
for this kind of damage.

11:55.053 --> 11:58.889
Best guess, originating point
is the westbound causeway.

11:59.974 --> 12:02.810
Hey! Get me a team
on the westbound causeway!

12:02.936 --> 12:04.436
She's good.

12:04.562 --> 12:06.313
Angel, look at this.

12:08.441 --> 12:11.402
l think there's something in his mouth.

12:13.196 --> 12:14.196
Medic!

12:21.079 --> 12:24.081
Ah, it's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.

12:24.207 --> 12:28.710
You better check out my friend. too.
No telling what this guy might have had.

12:32.215 --> 12:33.882
This is what he had.

12:35.301 --> 12:38.262
Call me crazy, Angel,
but l think this is human flesh.

13:06.541 --> 13:08.500
Hooked up with Sean last night.

13:09.544 --> 13:10.919
The cable guy Sean?

13:11.045 --> 13:12.463
Oh, God, no.

13:12.589 --> 13:14.631
He smelled like cheese.

13:14.757 --> 13:17.759
- So the mechanic Sean?
- Yep.

13:18.386 --> 13:19.761
He came over.

13:19.888 --> 13:22.222
We opened a bottle of pinot grig'.

13:22.348 --> 13:24.266
We finished a bottle of pinot grig'.

13:24.392 --> 13:26.018
Before l knew it, we were. . .

13:26.144 --> 13:28.145
Stop that.

13:28.271 --> 13:30.856
- You don't want to hear this, do you?
- No.

13:30.982 --> 13:34.234
But if you two are getting serious,
l'd love to meet him.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.861
Why don't you and Sean the mechanic

13:35.987 --> 13:38.864
join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner
tomorrow night?

13:38.990 --> 13:42.534
Why? so you can tell me later
he's not good enough for your little sister?

13:42.660 --> 13:46.455
Don't. You're the one who was going on about
brother-and-sister stuff.

13:46.581 --> 13:50.334
That becomes brother-and-sister
double-dating? What goes on in your head?

13:50.460 --> 13:51.877
Come on. lt'll be fun.

13:52.003 --> 13:55.172
All right, we'll go, but l'm not promising
we'll have fun.

13:55.882 --> 13:57.007
Not now.

13:57.133 --> 13:58.842
What crawled up his ass?

13:58.968 --> 14:00.761
He hates lab rats.

14:00.887 --> 14:06.058
Well, here's a headline. . . lt's lab rats
that make us cops look good.

14:07.519 --> 14:09.520
OK, listen up.

14:09.646 --> 14:12.731
We just got an lD on the body
from under the causeway.

14:12.857 --> 14:15.234
His name is Ricky Simmons.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.402
He was a cop.

14:33.378 --> 14:36.463
- Let me ask you something.
- Yeah.

14:36.589 --> 14:39.216
When we were partners,
you used every excuse in the book

14:39.342 --> 14:41.677
to get out of making
a next-of-kin notification.

14:41.803 --> 14:45.764
l knew Ricky from the department softball
team. He was a good guy. a good cop.

14:45.890 --> 14:47.558
lt's the least l could do.

14:55.942 --> 14:56.942
Motherfucker!

15:01.614 --> 15:03.282
Call it in!

15:05.326 --> 15:10.247
3H-77 to dispatch. We need EMT
and police backup now.

15:10.373 --> 15:12.124
l'll check the house.

15:12.250 --> 15:14.459
Kara, it's me. lt's James.

15:14.586 --> 15:16.503
You're OK.

15:19.007 --> 15:22.134
Hey, it's me.

15:22.927 --> 15:24.928
lt's OK.

15:25.930 --> 15:27.806
This is so fucked-up, man.

15:30.852 --> 15:32.728
Going after a cop's family. . .

15:33.771 --> 15:36.773
- Who would do such a thing?
- That's why we're here.

15:37.817 --> 15:39.610
But it's still fucked-up.

15:40.153 --> 15:43.947
They say Ricky Simmons was under deep
cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

15:44.073 --> 15:45.240
All right. Thanks.

15:45.366 --> 15:48.285
He'd been working the gig for ten months and
everything was good.

15:48.953 --> 15:51.622
But this, going after his wife. . .

15:52.665 --> 15:54.833
Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

15:55.710 --> 15:59.713
Now he's gone and pissed off
the entire Miami Police Department.

16:00.632 --> 16:03.550
- ls there any word on the wife?
- She should be in surgery by now.

16:06.929 --> 16:09.765
There's an inconsistency somewhere.

16:09.891 --> 16:11.183
- And that would be?
- l'm not sure.

16:11.309 --> 16:14.728
but it's the answer to
a question we haven't thought of yet.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.321
Look.

16:30.703 --> 16:32.537
- Whose is it?
- Probably hers.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.916
Ricky Simmons, her husband,
last number dialed.

16:41.339 --> 16:42.798
l got it.

16:42.924 --> 16:44.174
Good work, Angel.

16:44.300 --> 16:47.219
- Well, actually, it was Dexter.
- Sergeant?

16:49.263 --> 16:53.058
98, 99, 1 00!

16:53.184 --> 16:56.603
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a new world record!

16:57.814 --> 16:58.855
Stop it!

16:58.981 --> 17:00.482
Can't stop. Must tickle.

17:00.608 --> 17:02.192
Got to hear the magic word!

17:02.318 --> 17:05.028
l have your magic word right here -
chocolate chip.

17:05.530 --> 17:08.073
- Cookies!
- Homemade.

17:08.199 --> 17:11.827
OK. you guys.
take your cookies into the bedroom.

17:11.953 --> 17:15.288
- Two each.
- But you never let us eat in our bedroom.

17:15.998 --> 17:18.375
Well, l want some alone time with Dexter.

17:20.545 --> 17:23.588
- Are you gonna kiss him?
- Actually. yes.

17:23.715 --> 17:24.756
Cool.

17:24.882 --> 17:25.966
Gross!

17:30.722 --> 17:32.097
Cookie?

17:32.974 --> 17:35.142
l wuv cookies.

17:36.394 --> 17:38.729
You're snarfing them down
like the cookie monster.

17:38.855 --> 17:42.899
No. this isn't snarfing.
This is eating with enthusiasm.

17:44.235 --> 17:46.194
Tell me about your day.

17:46.904 --> 17:49.823
l had court, you know, the blood thing.

17:49.949 --> 17:54.161
And then a crime scene and more blood.

17:54.829 --> 17:57.581
- l don't know how you do it.
- Well. blood is...

17:57.707 --> 17:58.623
My life.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.000
. .my job.

18:00.126 --> 18:02.711
Lately, the thing that surprises me most about
Rita

18:02.837 --> 18:04.379
is how much l like being with her.

18:05.173 --> 18:06.798
But whenever that happens
with a woman.

18:06.924 --> 18:10.427
when l feel comfortable with her,
it all goes wrong.

18:10.553 --> 18:14.139
That's why l think it's best
to take it one step at a time.

18:14.265 --> 18:19.853
Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for
us to get together with her new boyfriend.

18:19.979 --> 18:22.647
You think you can get a baby-sitter
some night?

18:22.774 --> 18:25.275
You mean an actual grown-up meal?

18:25.401 --> 18:27.986
l'd love that. Pick a date.

18:28.821 --> 18:30.614
l pick Dexter.

18:32.158 --> 18:34.785
And l pick my sister to chaperone.

19:04.148 --> 19:05.732
Sister.

19:05.858 --> 19:07.651
So, Miami's the haystack,

19:07.777 --> 19:10.028
and the ice truck's the needle, right?

19:10.154 --> 19:11.279
OK.

19:11.405 --> 19:15.826
Then brother,
l just found the fucking needle.

19:22.792 --> 19:23.708
How did you find it?

19:23.835 --> 19:26.545
l put the word out with patrol,
the hide-in-plain-sight thing.

19:26.671 --> 19:29.756
Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.

19:29.882 --> 19:32.175
This is a busy street.
Anyone see the driver?

19:32.301 --> 19:36.721
The restaurant manager said it was here when
he opened. ls this the one you saw?

19:36.848 --> 19:41.059
l feel like a kid at his own surprise party.
This is the same truck.

19:41.185 --> 19:44.104
lt's hard to say. lt all happened so fast.

19:44.230 --> 19:51.111
Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and
say that it is. Why is it still running?

19:51.237 --> 19:54.197
lt keeps the back compartment refrigerated.

20:03.875 --> 20:06.793
Holy shit, they're fucking fingertips.

20:10.673 --> 20:13.049
Clean slices, no blood.

20:16.053 --> 20:19.890
My guess is he drained the body entirely
before these cuts were made.

20:20.016 --> 20:21.766
How did he do that? Some kind of pump?

20:21.893 --> 20:23.393
No.

20:23.519 --> 20:26.479
l had Forensics do a work-up
on our last victim.

20:26.606 --> 20:28.440
Our guy's old school.

20:28.566 --> 20:31.026
He hoists the body up, severs the jugular.

20:31.152 --> 20:32.736
The heart does all the work.

20:32.862 --> 20:35.906
lt's the most effective method, really.

20:36.032 --> 20:37.866
Fucking butcher.

20:39.869 --> 20:42.746
There are 206 bones
in the human body.

20:42.872 --> 20:45.957
He could have left any one of them.

20:46.083 --> 20:49.794
But he gave us exactly what we need
to identify the victim,

20:49.921 --> 20:53.506
like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.

20:56.928 --> 20:58.637
Who made the find?

20:58.763 --> 21:00.472
Officer Morgan.

21:00.598 --> 21:02.474
Harry's daughter?

21:02.600 --> 21:05.143
Must be in the genes,
her and her brother.

21:06.020 --> 21:08.730
This truck's a good get.
lt's their first solid lead.

21:08.856 --> 21:12.400
l encourage all my officers
to think outside the box.

21:12.526 --> 21:14.527
Well, nice work, Lieutenant.

21:14.654 --> 21:16.446
l got the Deputy Mayor.

21:16.948 --> 21:18.949
Congratulate Morgan for me.

21:29.877 --> 21:31.670
Another beautiful Miami day,

21:31.796 --> 21:34.881
mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon
showers.

21:35.007 --> 21:37.634
Chalk one up for Miami Metro, eh, ma'am?

21:37.760 --> 21:40.679
Last time l checked, Morgan,
l'm the lieutenant.

21:40.805 --> 21:45.558
which means my officers keep me apprised at
all times on all things.

21:45.685 --> 21:49.688
You pull a stunt like that again.
it won't matter who your father was.

21:49.814 --> 21:50.814
OK?

22:19.093 --> 22:20.719
Dude, is this blood?

22:20.845 --> 22:23.013
lt's chocolate. lt's on your shirt, too.

22:26.684 --> 22:28.601
lt's a new shirt.

22:29.854 --> 22:32.939
- What is taking so long?
- lt's a big truck.

22:33.065 --> 22:35.900
They won't find anything,
not even a tic tac.

22:36.027 --> 22:38.236
He's thought all this through.

22:38.362 --> 22:40.405
l know l would.

22:40.531 --> 22:43.575
- Your famous hunches telling you anything?
- lce-cold.

22:43.701 --> 22:46.828
You're a goddamn riot.
This fucking guy's toying with us.

22:47.538 --> 22:51.791
Deb's right.
This truck's not another piece of the puzzle.

22:51.917 --> 22:53.293
They are.

22:58.716 --> 23:00.842
Watching ice melt. This is fun.

23:00.968 --> 23:03.261
Stand closer, Morgan,
and l'll melt your heart.

23:03.387 --> 23:05.388
l think he's got a crush on you, Dex.

23:06.682 --> 23:10.602
Yo, l was talking to Morgan the sister.
Vince Masuka only swings one way.

23:10.728 --> 23:11.978
Yeah, from vine to vine.

23:12.104 --> 23:13.271
Enough.

23:13.397 --> 23:17.692
l'm glad to see the sexual harassment seminar
really paid off.

23:32.958 --> 23:35.418
This is seriously fucked-up, my friends.

23:37.213 --> 23:38.922
Why go to all this trouble?

23:39.924 --> 23:42.801
What's this sick son of a bitch
trying to tell us?

23:42.927 --> 23:45.303
Not "us". Me.

23:45.429 --> 23:48.932
My freezer,
the painted doll's fingernails. . .

23:51.310 --> 23:54.020
l think he's trying to impress me.

23:54.146 --> 23:56.147
And it's working.

23:56.273 --> 23:59.526
What, a man can't call his wife
three times in one day?

24:03.531 --> 24:06.741
Kiss my baby and tell her,
"Daddy be home para la cena. "

24:06.867 --> 24:08.785
l'm getting another call.

24:08.911 --> 24:10.203
Yeah, te amo.

24:11.122 --> 24:12.956
Batista.

24:13.916 --> 24:16.167
l'll be there in two minutes.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.337
She's still in surgery.

24:19.463 --> 24:20.964
The doctors are hopeful.

24:21.507 --> 24:24.676
lce-truck killer returns,
dead undercover cop.

24:24.802 --> 24:26.719
lt's a typical day in the neighborhood.

24:26.846 --> 24:28.847
You got to hear this.

24:31.684 --> 24:34.102
Ricky, where the fuck are you?

24:34.478 --> 24:36.521
l'm gonna try for the back door.

24:36.647 --> 24:38.106
Oh, fuck, he saw me!

24:38.232 --> 24:40.358
Oh, please don't hurt me!

24:42.611 --> 24:46.322
Lieutenant. National database
kicked back the DNA match.

24:48.242 --> 24:49.492
Norberto Cervantes.

24:51.871 --> 24:54.038
Let me see that.

25:29.116 --> 25:31.868
- Get down!
- Police! Put your hands up! Police!

25:32.536 --> 25:33.828
- Get them down!
- Down!

25:33.954 --> 25:36.497
Put your fucking hands up!
Put your hands up!

25:41.212 --> 25:44.547
- ls that necessary?
- lt's a dangerous world, Guerrero.

25:47.259 --> 25:49.886
Yes, and one can't be too careful, Detective.

25:55.309 --> 25:57.018
Yes, l-l've had alc. . .

25:57.519 --> 26:01.481
Problems with alcohol in the past.
l never tried to hide that.

26:02.024 --> 26:02.982
But. . .

26:03.108 --> 26:05.109
you heard from my AA sponsor.

26:05.236 --> 26:07.862
l've been sober for over a year now, so. . .

26:09.406 --> 26:13.284
Look, l. . .
l'm not disputing that it was my car. . .

26:14.620 --> 26:16.955
that hit Mr. Pryce.

26:17.581 --> 26:19.791
But. . .

26:19.917 --> 26:23.586
l reported it stolen
hours before the accident.

26:28.425 --> 26:32.553
Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on
the invisible mask of sympathy.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.013
even empathy,

26:34.139 --> 26:38.226
and otherwise right-thinking people
don't stand a chance.

26:43.774 --> 26:45.483
l knew it.

26:45.609 --> 26:47.485
"Not guilty."

26:48.070 --> 26:51.614
Matt Chambers may have found
a way to beat the system...

26:52.658 --> 26:54.409
but so have l.

26:55.744 --> 26:57.954
Ricky, where the fuck are you?

26:58.539 --> 27:00.581
Oh, fuck, he saw me!

27:00.708 --> 27:02.750
Oh, please don't hurt me!

27:07.464 --> 27:10.425
The way we see it,
you're in on the kill of Ricky Simmons,

27:10.551 --> 27:13.511
but that's not enough for you
or for Guerrero.

27:13.637 --> 27:15.638
Ricky is dead?

27:16.807 --> 27:19.809
- That saddens me.
- Shut the fuck up!

27:25.399 --> 27:28.818
Wait, you're not implying that
Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?

27:29.737 --> 27:31.362
l'm truly disappointed.

27:31.488 --> 27:33.948
Not only do l have a dead cop,

27:34.074 --> 27:37.577
someone broke in his house
and shot his wife.

27:37.703 --> 27:40.997
Word out in the world, Sergeant. . .

27:42.124 --> 27:43.958
Simmons's wife was fucking around.

27:45.169 --> 27:47.712
Maybe he tried to kill the bitch himself,

27:47.838 --> 27:50.673
and felt so bad about it,
he committed suicide.

27:51.550 --> 27:52.967
A cop murder-suicide.

27:54.094 --> 27:56.387
lt's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?

27:58.140 --> 28:01.059
You think it's a fucking coincidence
your ass is in here?

28:01.185 --> 28:04.312
We got you on the causeway
the morning Ricky Simmons died!

28:04.438 --> 28:07.231
- Bullshit.
- We don't deal in bullshit.

28:08.150 --> 28:10.068
We deal in good police work.

28:10.194 --> 28:12.904
And good science.

28:18.160 --> 28:21.287
You must have been a motherfucker
at cat's cradle.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.374
l never played it.

28:25.209 --> 28:29.128
OK, Kara Simmons was shot while she was
running. Her phone call tells us that.

28:29.254 --> 28:32.632
She was running towards the back door.
There. She turns.

28:32.758 --> 28:35.635
The shooter sees her.
She's shot high on the chest.

28:35.761 --> 28:39.722
lt spins her around, spraying blood
on the walls there and there.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.349
She loses her cellphone.

28:41.475 --> 28:46.396
She struggles to the coffee table, the couch,
and then she finally falls back there.

28:52.778 --> 28:53.945
She never got this far.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.658
lt's not her blood.

29:09.420 --> 29:11.254
Angel, meet our shooter.

29:13.424 --> 29:16.259
DNA of Cervantes' flesh
in Ricky Simmons' mouth.

29:16.385 --> 29:19.429
DNA from a rogue drop of blood
we found at the Simmons' house.

29:26.311 --> 29:27.979
Tell me you're sure about this.

29:28.105 --> 29:29.605
1 00 per cent.

29:30.107 --> 29:31.858
That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.

29:31.984 --> 29:34.735
- Let's nail his coffin and ship it.
- Hang on. sergeant.

29:34.862 --> 29:38.239
We get him to roll over on Guerrero,
and we own them both.

29:38.365 --> 29:41.367
You're talking about throwing him a deal? Then
what, he walks?

29:41.493 --> 29:45.746
lf he does, we pick him up on other charges.
lf he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.

29:45.873 --> 29:50.209
Gets us Guerrero? We can't catch the guy,
he's un-fucking-touchable!

29:50.335 --> 29:53.004
Come on. Lieutenant.
We already got a win.

29:53.130 --> 29:54.755
lt's not about your win.

29:54.882 --> 29:57.133
lt's about the big picture.

30:07.811 --> 30:09.562
l've seen this before.

30:10.397 --> 30:11.647
Whenever a cop is killed,

30:11.773 --> 30:15.693
it's like everyone's life has been stopped
in mid-sentence.

30:15.819 --> 30:19.197
Davey Sanchez was a fearless
and dedicated cop.

30:20.240 --> 30:24.076
Davey Sanchez was a son,
a husband and a father.

30:25.871 --> 30:28.039
Davey Sanchez was my partner.

30:29.082 --> 30:31.083
Davey Sanchez was my hero.

30:34.463 --> 30:36.005
That was great.

30:40.844 --> 30:43.262
What, Dad?

30:43.388 --> 30:47.350
Ever since Davey was killed.
my world feels out of control.

30:49.353 --> 30:50.520
How do you fix it?

30:53.148 --> 30:54.815
Two ways, l guess. . .

30:57.903 --> 30:59.946
Honor Davey's memory. . .

31:02.616 --> 31:04.617
and catch the bastard who did this to him.

31:06.787 --> 31:08.538
lt's not about vengeance.

31:10.249 --> 31:12.333
lt's not about retaliation. . .

31:13.835 --> 31:16.170
or balancing the books.

31:16.922 --> 31:19.674
lt's about something deep inside.

31:23.053 --> 31:25.972
My father had more than his share of pain,

31:26.098 --> 31:28.933
but he didn't deal with it
the way most people do.

31:29.059 --> 31:32.061
Happy hour. Now, there's a misnomer.

31:32.980 --> 31:35.606
l'll have what he's having.

31:35.732 --> 31:36.899
Wise choice.

31:39.653 --> 31:40.903
You celebrating?

31:41.488 --> 31:43.155
Something like that.

31:45.325 --> 31:46.993
Hey, have we met?

31:48.120 --> 31:50.454
l doubt it. l just moved down here.

31:51.540 --> 31:53.082
l needed a new start.

31:54.042 --> 31:56.794
- Girlfriend or boyfriend?
- Ex-wife.

31:56.920 --> 31:59.005
She said l drank too much.

32:00.090 --> 32:02.008
Hence the "ex" part.

32:02.134 --> 32:04.427
- Fuck her.
- Man, she was all over me to change,

32:04.553 --> 32:07.471
like she never done anything
wrong in her life...

32:07.598 --> 32:10.683
- besides marrying me.
- We all make mistakes.

32:10.809 --> 32:13.352
Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.

32:13.478 --> 32:16.188
God! Damn it!

32:16.315 --> 32:19.191
l thought l was the only one
who hated the Hurricanes.

32:19.318 --> 32:23.321
- l take it you didn't grow up in Miami.
- No, l've had to move around some.

32:23.447 --> 32:25.156
Say no more.

32:25.282 --> 32:27.617
But home is where my ass is.

32:28.619 --> 32:30.202
l'm getting mine out of town.

32:30.329 --> 32:31.996
Enjoy Miami.

32:33.248 --> 32:36.834
Remember, there's nothing
a new city can't cure.

32:37.794 --> 32:40.546
- You got that right.
- Hey, thanks, buddy.

32:40.672 --> 32:42.340
Next one's on me.

32:45.135 --> 32:48.220
- You sure you're good to drive?
- Been a lot worse.

33:08.408 --> 33:11.202
l sure hope he doesn't go out there
and kill himself.

33:11.328 --> 33:13.412
That would be. . .tragic.

33:25.050 --> 33:28.719
Matt Chambers is accused
of committing a crime in Florida.

33:28.845 --> 33:32.682
He was arrested in Florida
and he's being tried in Florida.

33:34.309 --> 33:38.604
So the good people of Florida only went as far
as validating their own assumptions

33:38.730 --> 33:41.524
that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy.

34:02.838 --> 34:05.005
"Nothing a new city can't cure."

34:11.680 --> 34:16.225
My father taught me one thing
above all others - to be sure.

34:16.351 --> 34:17.601
And l am.

34:17.728 --> 34:20.396
Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.

34:22.399 --> 34:25.943
lf God is in the details.
and if l believed in God,

34:26.069 --> 34:28.404
then he's in this room with me.

34:30.282 --> 34:33.451
l just wish he'd brought an extension cord.

34:39.750 --> 34:41.083
lt's James.

34:42.461 --> 34:45.755
We're gonna get the bastard
who did this to Dexter.

35:08.487 --> 35:12.281
This guy is just toying with us
and LaGuerta's too fucking dumb to see it.

35:12.407 --> 35:16.076
Deb was saying that this psycho guy
cut off that chick's fingertips.

35:16.203 --> 35:19.622
Man, that's got to suck, right?

35:21.792 --> 35:25.419
Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive.

35:26.254 --> 35:27.838
That's not his style.

35:27.964 --> 35:31.175
He usually leaves the killing
to someone else.

35:32.803 --> 35:35.513
So, how long have you two been going out?

35:35.639 --> 35:37.389
A couple weeks, l guess.

35:37.516 --> 35:39.809
Deb never mentioned how you met.

35:39.935 --> 35:42.686
Well, she brought her car
into my shop. and...

35:43.188 --> 35:47.316
- You have your own place?
- No, but l wish l did.

35:54.908 --> 35:56.242
Someday, huh?

35:56.368 --> 35:58.285
Dex, enough with the inquisition.

35:58.411 --> 35:59.703
No, it's all right.

35:59.830 --> 36:04.375
lf l had a sister with legs like yours. l'd be
checking out the dude she was seeing, too.

36:04.501 --> 36:07.419
ls this guy a keeper or what?

36:09.840 --> 36:11.757
Come on. l'll get you another drink.

36:11.883 --> 36:13.926
Are you guys good?

36:14.052 --> 36:15.427
Yep.

36:21.184 --> 36:23.310
Seems like a nice guy.

36:23.436 --> 36:26.730
They could barely keep
their hands off each other.

36:26.857 --> 36:29.733
l can kill a man, dismember his body,

36:29.860 --> 36:32.528
and be home in time for Letterman.

36:32.654 --> 36:36.365
But knowing what to say
when my girlfriend's feeling insecure. . .

36:37.367 --> 36:39.076
l'm totally lost.

36:42.914 --> 36:45.416
Off your ass. Cervantes.
Hands behind your back.

36:45.542 --> 36:48.294
Walk backwards and assume the position.

36:57.387 --> 36:58.721
Step away.

37:05.854 --> 37:07.271
Exit the cell.

37:09.524 --> 37:10.983
Where are we going?

37:11.109 --> 37:15.195
The call came down. They want you moved to
a more secure block.

37:19.451 --> 37:23.203
You think the call to take care of me
came down from the warden?

37:23.330 --> 37:26.582
Who the fuck do you think
the warden listens to?

37:28.251 --> 37:29.627
Get used to it.

37:34.007 --> 37:35.966
This is from Mr. Guerrero.

38:13.338 --> 38:19.051
New claims for US unemployment benefits
fell unexpectedly 273,000 last week,

38:19.177 --> 38:23.347
pushing the four-week average claim
to the lowest level in nearly six years.

38:23.473 --> 38:28.727
lnitial claims for state jobless aid
fell 1 1 ,000 in the week just ended.

38:34.567 --> 38:38.112
Every time a woman
tries to do this to me, it. . .

38:38.238 --> 38:39.738
tickles.

38:41.825 --> 38:43.993
Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

38:44.119 --> 38:45.160
What?

38:45.286 --> 38:47.246
The kids.

38:47.372 --> 38:50.207
Oh, they sleep through thunderstorms.

39:22.615 --> 39:24.033
l'm sorry.

39:29.372 --> 39:31.248
Tell me.

39:33.585 --> 39:35.085
l can't do this.

39:37.338 --> 39:42.009
That's OK.

39:43.053 --> 39:44.261
l'm OK.

39:49.267 --> 39:52.227
We have an elephant in the room,
and its name is "sex."

39:53.521 --> 39:55.314
Tell me about it.

39:57.067 --> 39:59.943
Hey, as far as l'm concerned,
it can just stay in the corner

40:00.070 --> 40:01.779
and mind its own damn business.

40:03.114 --> 40:05.407
lt's easier said than done.

40:07.368 --> 40:09.036
Yeah.

40:10.580 --> 40:12.081
But it needs to be right. . .

40:14.042 --> 40:15.709
for both of us.

40:18.004 --> 40:21.381
Or it won't be right for either of us.

40:24.010 --> 40:25.928
l don't want that. Do you?

40:28.515 --> 40:30.099
No.

40:31.017 --> 40:32.684
You know. . .

40:35.688 --> 40:40.609
l can't believe l found the one good,
truly decent man left on the planet.

40:43.279 --> 40:46.448
. .was found dead in a basement hallway
of the Miami Metro jail.

40:46.866 --> 40:51.370
Norberto Cervantes was a known associate
of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.

40:51.496 --> 40:53.497
Speculation is that another inmate

40:53.623 --> 40:56.166
is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.

41:22.277 --> 41:24.820
Notice how the skin is gloving
around the joints?

41:25.655 --> 41:29.324
- And that is important because?
- A sure sign of postmortem severance,

41:29.450 --> 41:34.246
meaning the victim was already dead
when she was relieved of her fingertips.

41:34.372 --> 41:37.291
Why the different nail polishes?
What is this guy thinking?

41:37.417 --> 41:40.002
He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it."

41:40.128 --> 41:42.421
l don't know. Do you have an lD?

41:42.547 --> 41:45.883
- Sherry Taylor, another hooker.
- At least he's consistent.

41:46.009 --> 41:47.050
Yeah.

41:47.177 --> 41:51.555
Killing young women that have
to sell their bodies just to survive. . .

41:51.681 --> 41:53.015
or feed their kids.

41:54.017 --> 41:58.020
My sister puts up a front so the world
won't see how vulnerable she is.

42:01.107 --> 42:05.194
Me, l put up a front so the world won't see
how vulnerable l'm not.

42:06.863 --> 42:09.865
l don't care who these fingertips belong to,

42:09.991 --> 42:13.202
only what my new friend
out there is trying to say.

42:14.204 --> 42:15.871
Morgan. The captain wants Dexter.

42:18.291 --> 42:19.708
Her.

42:38.519 --> 42:39.728
You wanted to see me, sir?

42:39.854 --> 42:43.106
Lieutenant LaGuerta has something
she wants to tell Dexter.

42:43.233 --> 42:47.945
Officer Morgan. you've shown
tremendous initiative these last few days.

42:48.404 --> 42:51.323
Because of you, we were able to
track down that ice truck.

42:51.449 --> 42:54.493
and we now have an lD on the latest victim.

42:55.536 --> 42:59.289
The captain believes you should be reassigned
from Vice to Homicide.

42:59.415 --> 43:02.042
And l concur. Congratulations.

43:02.168 --> 43:04.753
You're a good cop, like your old man.

43:06.130 --> 43:07.130
Thank you, sir!

43:11.719 --> 43:15.639
- Thank you so much.
- l see a detective shield in your future.

43:16.516 --> 43:18.600
l won't let you down, sir.

43:25.024 --> 43:26.775
l hope you know what you're doing.

43:28.069 --> 43:29.444
l promoted you, didn't l?

43:31.155 --> 43:33.949
Now find me this ice-truck son of a bitch.

43:37.954 --> 43:39.496
- OK?
- OK.

44:06.232 --> 44:07.524
OK.

44:07.650 --> 44:09.276
Burning the oil?

44:09.402 --> 44:11.069
l clocked out.

44:13.281 --> 44:15.782
Why are you going at this so hard?

44:15.908 --> 44:19.244
Someone comes after one of us,
he comes after all of us.

44:24.500 --> 44:27.711
l know that look, Maria.
You got something to say, just say it.

44:27.837 --> 44:30.672
l just got off the phone with the hospital.

44:32.258 --> 44:35.302
Kara simmons suffered
massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.

44:35.428 --> 44:36.970
l got to be there.

44:38.514 --> 44:40.182
James, she died.

44:54.280 --> 44:56.031
Was Cervantes right?

44:58.034 --> 45:01.328
Was Kara sleeping with someone
other than Ricky?

45:04.207 --> 45:05.916
Was it you?

45:10.088 --> 45:13.423
- What the fuck were you thinking?
- What the fuck business is it of yours?

45:13.549 --> 45:17.094
My cops, my precinct, my business!

45:17.220 --> 45:21.181
Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce
as soon as he came off undercover.

45:21.307 --> 45:22.849
She didn't want to. . .

45:22.975 --> 45:26.103
She didn't want to hurt him
when he was on the case.

45:29.565 --> 45:32.401
lf l go by the book.
l take you off the case.

45:32.527 --> 45:33.652
Fuck the book.

45:33.778 --> 45:37.114
- There's nobody more motivated to get. . .
- Revenge?

45:37.949 --> 45:39.533
Justice.

45:48.584 --> 45:50.419
Take point on Guerrero.

45:55.007 --> 45:56.466
Thanks.

45:59.262 --> 46:03.348
ln slaughterhouses, they stun the animals
before butchering them.

46:03.474 --> 46:05.642
lt's the humane thing to do.

46:05.768 --> 46:07.894
Those animals. . .

46:08.020 --> 46:09.688
they're the lucky ones.

46:25.288 --> 46:27.330
"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack.

46:27.457 --> 46:30.417
"Totally important.
Do not let me down. Deb."

46:31.461 --> 46:33.420
Gone to rest his weary head.

46:33.546 --> 46:35.213
The good news is he'll still be here

46:35.339 --> 46:38.300
when l come back for
our own personal happy hour.

46:41.637 --> 46:43.221
God, these are so good.

46:43.347 --> 46:45.307
Not as good as your good news.

46:46.309 --> 46:49.895
My little sister's all growed-up
and transferred to Homicide.

46:53.441 --> 46:54.941
And the best part. . .

46:55.067 --> 46:57.569
LaGuerta had to say the actual words.

46:57.695 --> 47:00.739
- l thought her head would explode.
- l'm really proud of Dexter.

47:00.865 --> 47:04.201
You had my back the whole way,
and l appreciate it.

47:04.327 --> 47:06.620
l mean that. You're the best.

47:06.746 --> 47:09.623
And that's why l wanted
to share this moment with Dexter.

47:09.749 --> 47:11.333
So, Sean was busy?

47:13.669 --> 47:15.587
lt turns out there's another woman.

47:16.506 --> 47:17.506
Who?

47:18.674 --> 47:19.674
Me.

47:19.800 --> 47:21.843
Sean the mechanic is married?

47:21.969 --> 47:25.096
lmagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?

47:25.223 --> 47:26.389
And you and he are. . .

47:26.516 --> 47:27.557
So over.

47:27.683 --> 47:29.559
l dumped his married ass.

47:29.685 --> 47:33.480
l just wish l could get into
a healthy relationship like you and Rita,

47:33.606 --> 47:36.983
without the drama and the tension
and the uncertainty.

47:38.027 --> 47:39.653
Yeah, l'm a lucky guy.

47:56.671 --> 47:59.631
Jesus, Dad, it's called being on time!
Did you ever hear of it?

47:59.757 --> 48:01.758
l was having a bad day.

48:01.884 --> 48:06.263
- The captain and l had a discussion.
- Well. maybe you sh...

48:06.389 --> 48:08.014
Wait. What kind of bad day?

48:10.726 --> 48:13.019
lt's about the guy who killed Davey, isn't it?

48:13.145 --> 48:16.356
The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and
let him walk.

48:17.525 --> 48:19.609
Bad guy kills a cop and nothing happens?

48:21.571 --> 48:22.654
That's not fair.

48:22.780 --> 48:24.406
Life's not fair, Dexter.

48:25.992 --> 48:27.367
Can't anyone do anything?

48:27.493 --> 48:29.286
Can't you do something?

48:29.412 --> 48:31.871
No, not now.

48:35.167 --> 48:36.668
So what, then?

48:36.794 --> 48:39.921
The world just keeps
spinning out of control?

48:41.591 --> 48:43.508
No.

48:43.634 --> 48:46.970
The world can always be set right again.

48:47.972 --> 48:50.932
Bad guy kills a cop.
and nothing happens?

48:51.058 --> 48:53.268
Not anymore.

48:53.394 --> 48:54.644
Be back in a sec.

48:55.646 --> 49:00.358
- l'm running the gamut here emotion-wise.
- Nature calls.

49:00.484 --> 49:04.029
All the planning, the making sure. . .

49:04.655 --> 49:06.448
does it go away because l have a chance

49:06.574 --> 49:11.036
to rid the world of a cop-killer
and balance the books?

49:11.162 --> 49:15.040
Do l just ignore everything my father
taught me about how to do this right,

49:15.166 --> 49:18.710
about how to stay safe so l can do it again?

49:27.386 --> 49:28.553
Yep.

49:30.097 --> 49:33.058
l don't give a shit
about your goddamn problems.

49:33.184 --> 49:35.810
l gave you a job.
You take care of it.

49:39.815 --> 49:42.067
What the fuck you looking at?

49:53.496 --> 49:55.497
Happy birthday, Alex!

50:08.511 --> 50:10.178
But next year at this time. . .

50:10.888 --> 50:12.681
lt's Dexter.

50:13.391 --> 50:14.641
And Dexter.

50:16.227 --> 50:17.686
Thanks, Dad.

50:20.773 --> 50:22.190
All right, enough corniness.

50:22.316 --> 50:24.275
We meet again. . .

50:32.118 --> 50:33.535
. .for the last time.

50:36.372 --> 50:38.665
l didn't do anyth. . .anything.

50:38.791 --> 50:40.792
Some people believe that.

50:43.254 --> 50:45.004
The problem is, l don't.

50:45.798 --> 50:48.383
But it's true. l was. . . l was set up.

50:51.512 --> 50:52.595
By whom?

50:53.889 --> 50:56.057
That. . .that family.

50:57.810 --> 51:01.146
They needed someone to blame. lt's a natural
thing to do when you're grieving.

51:01.272 --> 51:03.022
So then none of this is your fault?

51:03.149 --> 51:04.649
l swear.

51:05.693 --> 51:07.861
OK! OK! OK! No!

51:07.987 --> 51:09.821
OK. OK. Stop.

51:09.947 --> 51:11.614
All right.

51:11.741 --> 51:12.657
OK, OK.

51:12.783 --> 51:13.950
lt. . .

51:14.076 --> 51:15.869
lt was me, only it wasn't me.

51:15.995 --> 51:18.204
lt was the booze.

51:18.330 --> 51:20.039
lt takes me over.

51:20.166 --> 51:23.585
That's a point of view to which
l'm not entirely unsympathetic.

51:24.587 --> 51:30.425
Neither you nor l is in complete control
of our destinies.

51:31.886 --> 51:34.596
Although. at the moment.
it would seem l have the upper hand.

51:36.432 --> 51:38.558
Really, l'm so sorry.

51:38.684 --> 51:41.644
You've done this
too many times to be sorry.

51:54.784 --> 51:57.994
Carlos Guerrero has chosen
to live in a dangerous world.

51:58.120 --> 52:00.163
That's his truth.

52:00.289 --> 52:04.793
My truth is that world doesn't need me
to balance its books.

52:38.327 --> 52:42.330
Matt Chambers, welcome
to your last change of address.

52:42.456 --> 52:44.123
You'll like it here.

52:44.250 --> 52:47.335
You and your neighbors
have so much in common.

53:14.613 --> 53:17.198
The worst thing about
finally putting together a puzzle

53:17.324 --> 53:20.410
