WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:04.008
Previously on Dexter. . .

00:04.134 --> 00:07.387
No blood. What a beautiful idea.

00:07.513 --> 00:11.391
Brother, l just found the fucking ice truck.

00:16.605 --> 00:17.814
lt is my new friend.

00:19.024 --> 00:22.527
When he broke into my apartment.
he took some time to get to know me -

00:22.653 --> 00:26.239
my life, my secrets.

00:26.365 --> 00:28.241
Paul doesn't live here anymore.

00:28.367 --> 00:30.868
No shit.
He's in jail.

00:30.994 --> 00:34.414
But, see, he still owes me
for two ounces of blow.

00:34.540 --> 00:35.915
which means you owe me.

00:36.041 --> 00:38.251
The coyote wanted more money,
l didn't have it.

00:38.377 --> 00:42.255
Poor bastards - spend their life savings,
get stuffed into a fishhold.

00:42.381 --> 00:45.133
- lf they can't pay. . .
- They disappear.

00:45.259 --> 00:46.759
Jorge Castillo -

00:46.885 --> 00:49.262
the only suspect even
remotely close to the park

00:49.388 --> 00:51.681
where Yelina was supposed
to drop the money.

00:51.807 --> 00:53.891
Excuse me.
Private yard.

00:55.227 --> 00:57.437
Sorry, l just assumed you were Cuban.

00:58.731 --> 01:01.065
American, pal, just like Dexter.

01:05.070 --> 01:06.320
Just like me.

01:06.447 --> 01:08.781
Cono.

01:08.907 --> 01:11.617
Get back in there, you Cuban piece of shit.

01:11.744 --> 01:14.245
They're even better-matched than l thought.

01:15.247 --> 01:16.581
Fucking animals.

01:17.916 --> 01:19.500
God bless America.

01:19.626 --> 01:21.085
No.

01:25.466 --> 01:29.260
Taking the extra time to kill Valerie
may have been ill-advised.

01:29.386 --> 01:33.473
My life has always been a sequence
of carefully planned moments.

01:33.599 --> 01:37.059
But sometimes
you just have to take a risk.

03:39.433 --> 03:43.394
Life is so fleeting, so fragile,

03:43.520 --> 03:46.522
every breath the potential to be our last.

03:49.443 --> 03:50.985
You ready?

04:00.913 --> 04:02.788
Can l have my cereal now?

04:02.915 --> 04:04.790
We all grieve in our own way.

04:04.917 --> 04:05.917
Sure.

04:06.919 --> 04:10.129
l prefer the six-year-old approach.

04:10.255 --> 04:13.299
Yet another l've sent to a watery grave.

04:14.176 --> 04:16.093
Well, not quite.

04:23.602 --> 04:25.311
Hey, what about this one?

04:25.437 --> 04:27.104
l want angel cake.

04:27.230 --> 04:30.149
lt's angel food. stupid.
and you don't get a vote.

04:30.275 --> 04:31.317
lt's my birthday.

04:31.443 --> 04:32.443
Guys.

04:35.948 --> 04:38.366
So, how'd it go?

04:38.492 --> 04:41.869
Bob the goldfish, may he rest in peace.

04:41.995 --> 04:44.997
Thanks for coming over
and taking care of this for me.

04:45.123 --> 04:48.042
- Dead stuff.
- l know.

04:48.168 --> 04:50.544
Well, go have a seat.

04:50.671 --> 04:53.339
Your treat for coming over early
is on its way.

04:56.885 --> 05:00.638
l don't get birthdays - the party, the song.

05:01.139 --> 05:05.393
Celebrating another year
just being alive feels forced.

05:07.354 --> 05:09.271
That one.
That's the one l want.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.567
- Coconut it is.
- l hate coconut.

05:13.694 --> 05:15.653
You've never had coconut.

05:18.198 --> 05:21.742
lt's dispatch.
l might have to settle for toast to go.

05:25.956 --> 05:27.915
Sure, what's the location?

05:32.004 --> 05:33.713
l'll be right there.

05:43.598 --> 05:45.307
The crime scene.

05:46.518 --> 05:47.893
My crime scene.

06:09.124 --> 06:13.127
l shouldn't have killed them both.
l didn't have enough time.

06:13.253 --> 06:17.423
A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood.

06:17.549 --> 06:19.717
What did l leave behind?

06:37.652 --> 06:40.237
lmpossible.

06:41.656 --> 06:44.992
Nice place setting. huh?
We're running her prints now.

06:45.118 --> 06:48.037
lt had to be him.
He's watching me.

06:50.999 --> 06:52.792
Good.

06:52.918 --> 06:54.794
lD the victim.

07:00.467 --> 07:03.928
- You find anything else?
- That ain't enough?

07:04.054 --> 07:05.262
Any eyewitnesses?

07:05.388 --> 07:07.306
Just do your job.
Worry about the blood.

07:10.185 --> 07:11.852
You gonna answer that?

07:15.774 --> 07:17.233
This tin can smells like ass.

07:17.359 --> 07:21.570
The sooner you get busy.
the sooner we can finger who did this.

07:21.696 --> 07:23.948
You heard the man.

07:36.294 --> 07:39.922
He dove 1 00 feet to bring up the body.

07:41.216 --> 07:44.552
He's getting back at me
for not killing that security guard.

07:46.054 --> 07:49.849
Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck killer.
l've got the press sniffing outside.

07:49.975 --> 07:50.891
No, it's not his M.O.

07:51.017 --> 07:55.062
We got an lD. Valerie Castillo.
Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

07:55.188 --> 07:57.106
Well, then, try and track him down.

07:57.232 --> 07:59.150
Sir, we found something.

08:05.657 --> 08:07.032
You got anything?

08:07.159 --> 08:10.911
No bruising.
Nothing under her nails.

08:11.037 --> 08:13.539
She didn't put up a fight.

08:13.665 --> 08:17.751
lf she was killed here, which l doubt, whoever
did it was a real pro.

08:17.878 --> 08:21.088
Under normal circumstances,
l'd take that as a compliment.

08:21.214 --> 08:23.841
- Prints?
- She's clean.

08:24.467 --> 08:27.011
This trailer - that's another matter.

08:27.137 --> 08:30.973
l don't even want to know
what some of those stains are.

08:32.767 --> 08:36.979
Yo, Dex, l think l found something.
Zoom in on this, will you?

08:37.105 --> 08:38.772
l'm kind of low on batteries here.

08:38.899 --> 08:41.192
Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

08:43.236 --> 08:45.905
Yo, what's up with you today?
You're throwing off my chi.

08:46.031 --> 08:47.573
You're not Chinese.

08:47.699 --> 08:48.574
l'm not?

08:48.700 --> 08:50.492
Look, right here.

08:52.204 --> 08:55.289
Does that look like a needle mark to you?

08:56.875 --> 09:00.336
lt's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

09:02.631 --> 09:06.050
Yeah, l guess.

09:08.178 --> 09:10.930
l'm gonna let the coroner bag her.

09:11.056 --> 09:12.765
l'm hungry.

09:25.445 --> 09:27.529
This ain't no auto garage.

09:29.407 --> 09:31.951
Oh. God.
Oh, l didn't need to see that.

09:32.077 --> 09:34.453
You never seen
a latrine before, Morgan?

09:34.579 --> 09:37.122
Yeah, just not indoors.

09:37.249 --> 09:41.335
- Well, the army taught me a lot of things.
- l feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

09:41.461 --> 09:45.214
Digging holes for people to take a dump?
That was most important.

09:45.340 --> 09:46.632
l'm not really getting that.

09:46.758 --> 09:49.385
lt doesn't matter how many bars
you got on your collar.

09:49.511 --> 09:52.596
Everybody's shit stinks.
We were partners a long time.

09:52.722 --> 09:56.392
From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's
better half was knee-deep.

09:56.518 --> 10:00.145
- You like the husband for this?
- lt's always the husband.

10:03.233 --> 10:04.525
What have you got?

10:04.651 --> 10:07.569
lt looks like a phone number
and a name - Mariel.

10:07.696 --> 10:09.905
Call it in to Batista.
He can run it down for us.

10:10.031 --> 10:11.699
Sergeant Doakes.

10:11.825 --> 10:14.618
We heard movement in the trunk.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.620
l got it. l got it.

10:26.423 --> 10:28.841
You all right, kid? Come on, man.

10:28.967 --> 10:33.929
- No.
- Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

10:59.581 --> 11:01.999
The noose is tightening.

11:04.753 --> 11:07.504
This is how it ends -
in the hands of a seven-year-old?

11:07.630 --> 11:08.964
Hey, Deb.

11:09.090 --> 11:10.841
l usually like kids.

11:10.967 --> 11:12.343
Who's the boy?

11:12.469 --> 11:15.971
All we got so far is that he's Cuban
and he seems to like LaGuerta.

11:16.097 --> 11:18.682
Spend enough time in a trunk,
she'd look good to anybody.

11:20.894 --> 11:23.812
Did he, you know, see anything?

11:23.938 --> 11:28.525
l'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.
Social services is on the way.

11:29.819 --> 11:32.696
You OK? You got a whole
brow thing going on.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.032
Morgan, bring some water!

11:35.158 --> 11:37.785
l love her.

11:37.911 --> 11:41.413
Maybe l should spend some time
in a hot trunk, too.

11:41.539 --> 11:45.209
My neat little world of lies
is crumbling all around me,

11:45.335 --> 11:49.880
and l can't tell a soul,
especially not Deb.

11:51.216 --> 11:55.010
- Deb, we've been through this.
- But l have my books.

11:55.136 --> 11:59.098
l could just stay in the car
or l can walk with you guys.

11:59.224 --> 12:01.809
l promise l'll be quiet.
You won't even know l'm there.

12:01.935 --> 12:03.435
The pheasants will know you're there.

12:03.561 --> 12:06.230
- But Dexter was my age when. . .
- Deb. that's enough.

12:06.356 --> 12:09.066
The Logans are waiting.
Did you pack your swimsuit?

12:11.111 --> 12:12.820
- Yes.
- Good girl.

12:12.946 --> 12:15.364
l want to see that backflip
when we come home.

12:15.490 --> 12:19.243
All right. Go on out to the car.
We'll be there in a sec.

12:22.705 --> 12:24.623
She does kind of have a point, Dad.

12:24.749 --> 12:27.751
What we do your sister
can never know about.

12:29.129 --> 12:33.799
Keeping the truth from the people
closest to you is how you'll survive. . .

12:33.925 --> 12:36.635
and how you'll protect them
if anything goes wrong.

12:46.938 --> 12:47.980
Guys, hurry up.

12:48.106 --> 12:50.607
You're gonna be late for school.

12:50.733 --> 12:53.527
l'm headed to the store.
ls there anything else you want?

12:53.653 --> 12:56.655
- Balloons aren't much of a list.
- lt's OK.

12:56.781 --> 13:00.159
l don't need that other stuff.
lt's too expensive.

13:00.285 --> 13:03.203
How about you let me worry
about that stuff. OK?

13:03.329 --> 13:05.914
lt's your party.
You can have whatever you want.

13:12.255 --> 13:15.466
- Hello?
- Hey, babe, it's me.

13:16.634 --> 13:18.510
Go wait in the car.

13:20.013 --> 13:21.847
What's wrong with Mom?

13:21.973 --> 13:25.642
She only gets that way
when she's talking to Dad.

13:29.939 --> 13:33.984
l was able to track down that name, Mariel,
with the number that you called in.

13:34.110 --> 13:36.445
She's a Cuban refugee.
She's staying with cousins.

13:36.571 --> 13:39.490
- l had a car bring her in.
- Why scratch the number in the floor?

13:39.616 --> 13:42.659
Next of kin, in case something
happened to her.

13:42.785 --> 13:46.038
Guys like Castillo are ruthless.
They prey on families.

13:46.164 --> 13:49.208
He was holding Mariel and
six others captive at a salvage yard.

13:49.334 --> 13:50.584
That explains the garage.

13:50.710 --> 13:54.922
lf the relatives don't pay the release fee.
the coyote would dump their ass overboard.

13:55.048 --> 13:57.549
Cocksuckers make me sick.
Come on.

14:10.021 --> 14:12.648
Mariel, when was the last time
you saw Jorge Castillo?

14:20.073 --> 14:22.241
When he locked her
and the other refugees up

14:22.367 --> 14:24.326
after pulling them from the boat.

14:30.750 --> 14:33.252
They went without food and water.

14:33.378 --> 14:36.463
Some guy tried to escape,
but he was beaten by Jorge.

14:36.589 --> 14:37.923
How'd she get free?

14:43.721 --> 14:46.515
Somebody opened the door to the garage.

14:59.529 --> 15:05.117
she said. "When we find them.
to make them suffer for what they did,

15:05.243 --> 15:07.744
"especially that concha
that treated her like a dog."

15:09.080 --> 15:10.289
Ah, got Dexter.

15:10.415 --> 15:11.999
Fuck me.
The wife was in on it.

15:12.125 --> 15:14.918
Ask if she knows the little boy
social services picked up.

15:22.427 --> 15:24.428
She never saw a boy.

15:28.474 --> 15:31.977
No hair. no fibers.
C.O. D. exsanguination.

15:32.103 --> 15:33.270
So far, so good.

15:33.396 --> 15:37.190
- You're hovering.
- Keep reading. Wait for it.

15:37.317 --> 15:38.984
This is a prelim. l don't have time. . .

15:39.110 --> 15:40.902
M-fucking-99.

15:42.780 --> 15:44.239
Etorphine hydrochloride?

15:44.365 --> 15:47.659
An animal tranquilizer
more powerful than morphine.

15:47.785 --> 15:50.537
lt causes total paralysis.

15:50.663 --> 15:54.666
That mark on her neck kept bugging me,
so l ordered up a tox screen.

15:54.792 --> 15:57.836
That's it.
No more doughnuts for Masuka.

15:57.962 --> 16:00.547
Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

16:00.673 --> 16:04.259
The only way to get it
is with a D. E.A. license.

16:05.678 --> 16:07.387
l put a request in for the list.

16:07.513 --> 16:11.642
- l should have it for Doakes in the morning.
- Nice.

16:12.810 --> 16:14.394
Yeah, baby.

16:14.520 --> 16:19.900
l'm on that list, and eventually the alias
l used will lead them back to me.

16:20.026 --> 16:21.818
Tick-tock.

16:27.909 --> 16:29.034
Hey, Dexter.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.494
Thank God you're there.

16:30.620 --> 16:35.040
- l really need to talk with someone.
- Everything OK?

16:35.166 --> 16:37.292
Paul called after you left.

16:37.418 --> 16:40.337
- Paul? Who's Paul?
- My soon-to-be ex.

16:40.463 --> 16:43.590
He's already out of jail, overcrowding.
Can you believe it?

16:43.716 --> 16:47.386
Every time something goes a little bit right,
something like this happens.

16:47.512 --> 16:50.347
- He wants to come to Astor's party.
- What did you tell him?

16:51.140 --> 16:55.394
l'd have to think about it.
But even if l say no, he won't listen.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.812
He never does.

16:58.690 --> 17:00.899
Can you come over tonight?

17:01.025 --> 17:03.402
l'm kind of under the gun here, big case.

17:03.528 --> 17:06.446
l shouldn't be dumping all this on Dexter.
l'm sorry.

17:06.572 --> 17:08.240
No, don't be.

17:08.366 --> 17:11.243
Tell you what, l'll stop by if l can.
l promise.

17:11.369 --> 17:14.913
OK. l'll keep a plate warm just in case.

17:15.039 --> 17:16.832
Thanks. Bye.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.420
Check the marinas.
Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

17:21.546 --> 17:23.547
We'll search the house.

17:25.258 --> 17:28.552
- Where's LaGuerta?
- Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

17:30.054 --> 17:31.596
- sketch?
- He told social services

17:31.723 --> 17:34.725
that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

17:35.560 --> 17:36.643
Valerie Castillo?

17:36.769 --> 17:39.855
Sounds like she got exactly
what she had coming to her.

17:39.981 --> 17:42.274
Personally, l'd shake this guy's hand.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.192
Yeah, you say that now.

17:55.580 --> 17:58.415
Found his passport.

17:58.541 --> 18:01.835
God, l feel like l need a shower
just looking at this douche bag.

18:01.961 --> 18:05.589
Well, keep searching. Phone records,
bank accounts, credit cards.

18:06.340 --> 18:08.383
Maybe the wife got greedy, and he killed her.

18:09.302 --> 18:10.427
Maybe.

18:15.141 --> 18:17.684
This morning,
what was that thing by the car?

18:17.810 --> 18:18.977
What thing?

18:19.103 --> 18:22.147
Before you opened the trunk,
you tried to cockblock me.

18:22.273 --> 18:24.149
l was just looking out for my team.

18:24.275 --> 18:26.276
l didn't see you looking out for LaGuerta.

18:26.402 --> 18:28.320
- l would if she'd asked.
- l didn't ask.

18:28.446 --> 18:31.948
Fine.
Next time, just get your ass shot.

18:34.994 --> 18:38.830
- lt's possible our guy left town.
- lf he even did it.

18:40.082 --> 18:43.543
- What if we have a copycat killer?
- That's a bit of a stretch.

18:43.669 --> 18:46.797
What if the person
who killed Valerie Castillo

18:46.923 --> 18:49.674
tried to bleed her out like
the ice-truck killer but didn't know how?

18:49.801 --> 18:52.385
- she wasn't a hooker.
- She was killed someplace else

18:52.512 --> 18:55.013
and laid out in a ritualistic manner,
just like all the others.

18:55.139 --> 18:57.724
- she wasn't in pieces.
- She had cuts on her neck.

18:57.850 --> 19:02.604
l'm just saying, with all the media coverage
on the ice-truck killer,

19:02.730 --> 19:04.231
it's possible.

19:04.357 --> 19:06.233
What do you suggest, Morgan?

19:06.359 --> 19:09.319
Let me work up a profile
in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

19:10.905 --> 19:12.322
Fine. Whatever.

19:17.119 --> 19:19.120
That's the second time
you've made that face.

19:19.247 --> 19:21.248
Who are you avoiding?

19:22.834 --> 19:25.126
We got one more stop to make.

19:33.886 --> 19:35.846
Nothing lasts forever.

19:35.972 --> 19:38.306
Just ask a Ford Pinto.

19:39.642 --> 19:42.936
Eventually, most serial killers get caught.

19:43.062 --> 19:46.857
There's really not much
of a retirement plan.

19:46.983 --> 19:52.529
But it can't end like this. lt's too soon.
l'm not ready.

20:03.916 --> 20:05.542
He saw me.

20:24.437 --> 20:25.812
What's this?

20:25.938 --> 20:30.025
You've been asking who's been calling.
My mom lives here.

20:30.151 --> 20:34.029
- Did you forget your laundry?
- She's been on me to stop by for dinner.

20:34.155 --> 20:36.656
Now, here's the plan.
We go in. We eat.

20:36.782 --> 20:38.950
We out before the cheesecake.
You got it?

20:39.076 --> 20:42.287
- l'm. what. your exit strategy?
- You can stay out here if you want.

20:42.413 --> 20:44.623
That gives me a better excuse
to leave earlier.

20:44.749 --> 20:46.791


20:46.918 --> 20:48.084
lt's your call.

20:49.462 --> 20:51.630
Shit.

20:51.756 --> 20:53.048
My sisters are here, too.

20:57.970 --> 21:00.972
Fucking family reunion.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.936
This john comes out of nowhere.
He's got me by the throat.

21:06.062 --> 21:09.814
l can't reach around and get my gun,
and l see he has a nipple ring.

21:09.941 --> 21:12.651
l rip that fucker out
like it's a grenade pin.

21:12.777 --> 21:13.693
Morgan.

21:13.819 --> 21:15.153
Oh, l'm sorry. Cop mouth.

21:15.279 --> 21:16.488
We're used to it.

21:16.614 --> 21:20.283
When James graces his family
with his presence.

21:20.409 --> 21:21.868
Some of us don't work at a bank.

21:21.994 --> 21:25.038
First words out of my
baby brother's mouth were,

21:25.164 --> 21:26.665
"Got milk, motherfucker?"

21:26.791 --> 21:29.542
Oh, OK, now, that's enough, all of Dexter.

21:29.669 --> 21:31.503
That security guard is gonna be all right?

21:31.629 --> 21:34.339
lf someone did a hatchet job on me,
l'd cash it all in.

21:34.465 --> 21:35.674
Yeah, Tony's doing OK.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.843
The hospital's setting him up
with some prosthetics.

21:38.970 --> 21:41.721
He's just got this spirit about him.

21:41.847 --> 21:44.933
The guy's missing body parts
because of this ice-truck killer,

21:45.059 --> 21:46.768
and he's still hitting on me.

21:46.894 --> 21:50.230
That's because men only think
with one body part,

21:50.356 --> 21:52.357
and that one was not cut off.

21:53.859 --> 21:55.068
Well, it's the damn truth.

21:55.194 --> 21:57.612
Morgan. come on.
We got a case to solve.

21:57.738 --> 22:01.032
Oh. are you sure. honey?
l got some cheesecake in the fridge.

22:01.158 --> 22:03.535
Yeah. We're sure.

22:03.661 --> 22:07.497
You know...
l would love some cheesecake.

22:07.623 --> 22:09.666
You can wait in the car.
That's your call.

22:10.710 --> 22:13.211
He'll wait.

22:13.337 --> 22:15.839
l'll help Dexter.
l'm sorry.

22:18.843 --> 22:21.886
l wonder. in time.
if they'll even remember me,

22:22.013 --> 22:25.807
other than the man
who broke their mother's heart.

22:26.392 --> 22:29.561
l'll be breaking their hearts, too.

22:29.687 --> 22:34.482
He is their father. They have a right to know
he's been released. right?

22:36.610 --> 22:37.777
Yeah, sure.

22:37.903 --> 22:42.407
Even if l tell Paul not to come,
he'll show up here eventually.

22:42.533 --> 22:43.783
l know him.

22:43.909 --> 22:46.703
Everything's been going so good at work. . .

22:47.747 --> 22:49.164
With Dexter.

22:50.124 --> 22:51.416
l don't know what to do.

22:51.542 --> 22:54.627
He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

22:56.881 --> 23:01.593
Paul always had a temper,
but when he was using...

23:01.719 --> 23:05.388
He said if l left, he would find us
and hurt the kids.

23:06.474 --> 23:09.893
Somehow, l thought that by staying,
l was protecting them.

23:12.021 --> 23:16.066
Cody doesn't remember the worst of it,
but Astor. . .

23:18.402 --> 23:21.404
She was the one who called
the police the last time.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.573
She was protecting me.

23:25.493 --> 23:28.995
You're not that woman anymore.
You're stronger than that now.

23:30.081 --> 23:32.624
lf their dad shows up.
we'll deal with it together.

23:34.210 --> 23:36.461
Dad's coming home?

23:42.635 --> 23:45.261
Can he sleep in my room, Mom?
Can he. Mom?

23:45.387 --> 23:47.680
l shouldn't even be here.

23:47.807 --> 23:50.141
Rita will be devastated if l'm arrested.

23:50.267 --> 23:53.186
Her husband was a crackhead.
and her boyfriend's a serial killer.

23:53.312 --> 23:56.272
lt's kind of hard
not to take that personally.

24:00.945 --> 24:04.030
Better get inside, son.
storm's on its way.

24:44.155 --> 24:46.739
Why didn't you tell me
what you are, Dex?

25:14.351 --> 25:16.394
Any last words?

25:18.105 --> 25:20.481
Figures.

25:35.206 --> 25:37.749
l don't have bad dreams.

25:37.875 --> 25:40.043
When l sleep, all of me sleeps.

25:40.169 --> 25:43.129
Nothing ever goes bump
in Dexter's night.

25:49.678 --> 25:54.891
l've never felt a moment
of remorse, doubt, regret.

25:58.979 --> 26:00.939
What's happening to me?

26:05.069 --> 26:06.611
lf my back wasn't against the wall,

26:06.737 --> 26:10.615
l'd almost feel guilty for
hacking into Masuka's email.

26:10.741 --> 26:13.576
Once l got past all the porn, it was easy.

26:15.746 --> 26:18.331
And there l am.

26:18.457 --> 26:20.625
Dr. Patrick Bateman -

26:20.751 --> 26:24.087
so wholesome, so inconspicuous.

26:24.213 --> 26:26.256
Harry would frown upon
destroying evidence,

26:26.382 --> 26:28.299
but he never wanted me
to get caught. either.

26:28.425 --> 26:30.426
What are you doing in here?

26:30.552 --> 26:34.472
My computer went down.
l was just checking some email.

26:36.850 --> 26:38.935
Can you take a look at this for me?

26:40.771 --> 26:43.856
- Copycat killer?
- l worked all night on that profile.

26:43.983 --> 26:45.316
l'd like to give it to LaGuerta,

26:45.442 --> 26:49.821
- but l want to make sure it's good enough.
- l'm honored.

26:51.407 --> 26:54.075
"The similar manner in which
the body was displayed

26:54.201 --> 26:58.746
"suggests this killer feels a connection
to the ice-truck killer.

26:59.999 --> 27:01.541
"Excited by what he's doing.

27:06.338 --> 27:09.257
"The cut on the victim's cheek,
while not fatal,

27:09.383 --> 27:11.509
"appears to be a signature of sorts.

27:11.635 --> 27:15.596
"Because of the lack of evidence
collected from the crime scene.

27:15.723 --> 27:20.685
"the suspect may be familiar with
law enforcement or forensics procedure."

27:23.480 --> 27:26.190
Why'd you quit?
You're getting to the good stuff.

27:26.317 --> 27:29.068
Let me guess -
single white male, mid-30s, lives alone,

27:29.194 --> 27:31.571
disconnected from his emotions.

27:33.782 --> 27:37.994
- lt's a little textbook, don't you think?
- But it totally fits this case.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.787
You're trying to make it fit.

27:43.083 --> 27:46.544
My advice?
Keep this to yourself.

27:48.672 --> 27:51.049
- Really?
- Deb, you're new to Homicide.

27:51.175 --> 27:54.427
This blows up in your face,
you've given LaGuerta the excuse

27:54.553 --> 27:55.928
to send you back to Vice.

28:03.562 --> 28:07.565
No. l'm onto something here. l feel it.

28:07.691 --> 28:09.609
Like one of your hunches.

28:13.113 --> 28:15.114
Way to have my back.

28:22.456 --> 28:23.873
Where's your sister?

28:27.419 --> 28:30.296
Debra, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

28:34.676 --> 28:36.094
How did you get into my cabinet?

28:36.220 --> 28:40.431
You hide the key in the pantry
on the top shelf.

28:40.557 --> 28:44.811
You and your brother know
never to touch my guns

28:44.937 --> 28:46.938
unless it's under my direct supervision.

28:47.064 --> 28:48.439
But l was being really careful.

28:48.565 --> 28:51.067
l mean, l was only shooting
at the cans and the bottles.

28:51.193 --> 28:52.944
And l'm really good, like Dexter,

28:53.070 --> 28:56.114
and now we can all go hunting together.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.907
l'm disappointed in you, Debra.

28:59.243 --> 29:00.827
Grab your things.

29:07.584 --> 29:09.419
Thanks a lot.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.966
Starting this morning,
we have cadets from the Academy

29:15.092 --> 29:17.802
going over every inch of the salvage yard.

29:17.928 --> 29:18.970
Those days l don't miss.

29:19.096 --> 29:22.807
The kid we found yesterday
saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo.

29:22.933 --> 29:25.726
Because he didn't recognize
a photo of Jorge Castillo,

29:25.853 --> 29:29.272
Lieutenant LaGuerta is bringing him in
to attempt a sketch.

29:32.943 --> 29:34.152
Come on, sweetheart.

29:34.278 --> 29:36.612
Let's take the seatbelt off.

29:36.738 --> 29:38.823
There you go. Come on.

29:38.949 --> 29:40.199
Come on, sweetheart.

29:40.325 --> 29:42.368
You want to go inside
to see the nice lady?

29:42.494 --> 29:44.787
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

29:46.290 --> 29:47.748
Thanks for bringing him by.

30:00.137 --> 30:02.597
Normally, l wouldn't approve
of something like this,

30:02.723 --> 30:05.141
but you've made quite an impression.

30:07.352 --> 30:10.646
- You have kids?
- No.

30:12.149 --> 30:15.860
l was like him once.
A stranger in a strange place,

30:15.986 --> 30:20.281
left to grow up with strangers,
all for a better life.

30:21.992 --> 30:25.161
Well, police lieutenant,
l'd say you've done OK.

30:26.330 --> 30:30.166
- Any luck with the family?
- No. He talks about an uncle Roberto.

30:30.292 --> 30:33.878
- He just uses the first name.
- Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

30:34.004 --> 30:35.213
l hope so.

30:35.339 --> 30:38.257
l hate to send another one into foster care.

30:40.511 --> 30:41.511
Thank Dexter.

30:42.429 --> 30:43.721
Bye, sweetheart.

30:45.682 --> 30:49.477
Meanwhile, we'll follow up
on the D. E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

30:49.603 --> 30:55.066
That would include vets, doctors,
animal control. even circuses.

30:55.192 --> 30:57.735
Be thorough. Check everyone.

30:57.861 --> 31:00.863
Masuka, what do we have
on the home and the boat?

31:00.989 --> 31:02.949
Still processing, sir.

31:03.075 --> 31:07.245
lf the husband is a dead end.
then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

31:07.371 --> 31:10.748
Morgan, any ideas?

31:10.874 --> 31:12.208
Don't do it, Deb.

31:12.334 --> 31:17.088
The last thing l need right now
is to be profiled for all of Miami Metro.

31:17.214 --> 31:20.675
We could be looking at someone
who's inspired by the ice-truck killer.

31:20.801 --> 31:24.136
lf so, the suspect is probably familiar
with forensic procedures.

31:24.263 --> 31:26.472
l have a profile.
l'd be happy to show it to Dexter.

31:26.598 --> 31:28.224
l'll be in my lab.

31:30.352 --> 31:31.727
Hello, Dex.

32:03.927 --> 32:05.261
l'll be right back.

32:05.387 --> 32:06.387
No.

32:30.287 --> 32:33.706
l forgot how much l loved
pastelitos growing up.

32:33.832 --> 32:36.167
He just needed
a little reminder of home.

32:36.293 --> 32:39.337
l was barely his age
when l came over with my family.

32:39.463 --> 32:41.464
l threw up the whole damn way.

32:50.265 --> 32:52.433
Go get the artist.
l think somebody's ready.

32:52.559 --> 32:54.185
Save me some.

33:27.636 --> 33:30.429
Did you thank Mrs. Carroll
for picking you up from school for me?

33:30.555 --> 33:32.014
Yes.

33:40.023 --> 33:41.941
So, what do you think?

33:44.778 --> 33:46.487
Everything OK?

33:47.239 --> 33:48.572
You want to talk about it?

33:48.699 --> 33:51.909
Holly, Blake, and Ashley said
they can't come to my party.

33:52.035 --> 33:55.413
Honey, that's not true.
l spoke with their moms last week.

33:55.539 --> 33:56.580
lt's all Cody's fault.

33:56.707 --> 33:59.625
He couldn't keep his mouth shut
about dad getting out of jail.

33:59.751 --> 34:03.504
- Did not!
- You told everyone!

34:13.223 --> 34:14.807
l have to know.

34:20.689 --> 34:23.399
Dexter. . .

34:23.525 --> 34:26.736
Thank God. My arm's asleep.

34:27.904 --> 34:31.615
- How long have you two been like this?
- Half an hour.

34:31.742 --> 34:34.410
l was afraid l'd wake him if l moved.

34:36.079 --> 34:39.790
At that age.
when they're out, they're out.

34:39.916 --> 34:42.960
You could brush his teeth,
and he wouldn't wake up.

34:44.129 --> 34:47.882
Here. Lift up his head.
l'll slide this underneath.

35:03.607 --> 35:06.317
Oh, thanks.

35:08.487 --> 35:10.821
What are you doing here?

35:10.947 --> 35:13.949
l'm waiting on some lab work.
l had some time to kill.

35:15.869 --> 35:18.871
Go ahead.
We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

35:18.997 --> 35:21.791
We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

35:21.917 --> 35:28.088
lt's only a matter of time before we know
what this little guy saw.

35:47.984 --> 35:51.487
Come on.

36:01.957 --> 36:05.543
lf Dexter. . . Here.

36:05.669 --> 36:07.503
You want help or not?

36:09.506 --> 36:12.883
l have a hair or something
stuck on my lens.

36:13.009 --> 36:14.093
You're in good hands.

36:14.219 --> 36:16.887
l traded my glasses in
for contacts in high school.

36:17.013 --> 36:17.888
Boys?

36:18.014 --> 36:20.057
Yeah. What l really needed was tits.

36:20.183 --> 36:22.351
l had Winnie the Poohs
on my bras until l was 1 6.

36:22.477 --> 36:25.521
As you can see, not a whole
lot's changed since then.

36:25.647 --> 36:27.231
Try not to blink, OK?

36:29.192 --> 36:31.235
OK, OK. l'll do it.

36:31.361 --> 36:33.404
l'll do it.

36:33.530 --> 36:38.409
Let me ask you something.
Your brother's adopted, right?

36:38.535 --> 36:40.661
Yeah, my dad found him
at a crime scene.

36:40.787 --> 36:44.415
How did the department feel about Harry
getting personally involved in a case?

36:44.541 --> 36:47.126
lt didn't seem to be a problem.
My parents never talked about it.

36:47.252 --> 36:50.713
Oh, but still, raising a boy,
it's a lot of work, no?

36:51.923 --> 36:52.882
God, no.

36:53.008 --> 36:55.676
l got in more trouble than he did.
He was the perfect one.

36:55.802 --> 36:57.720
Here, l think l see it.

36:59.431 --> 37:00.764
Yeah.

37:00.891 --> 37:03.392
There's the bastard.

37:05.896 --> 37:06.896
Thanks.

37:13.236 --> 37:14.904
Let me ask you a question.

37:16.239 --> 37:17.907
Why do you have it in for me?

37:20.076 --> 37:23.120
You're loud, impulsive,
and constantly question authority.

37:25.624 --> 37:27.082
Fair enough.

37:28.919 --> 37:31.086
l hear you have an interesting theory on. . .

37:37.469 --> 37:40.721
The report on scandal-plagued
AFL's transactions in Florida

37:40.847 --> 37:43.140
showed Transportation Department employees

37:43.266 --> 37:47.686
received more than $460 in gifts.
ranging from golf balls and free dinners. . .

37:47.812 --> 37:48.938
Honey, what is it?

37:50.231 --> 37:52.733
. .in return for buying supplies
worth $7,000. . .

37:57.948 --> 37:59.615
Sweetie.

37:59.741 --> 38:02.034
l'm sorry. lt was an accident.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.828
lt's all right. These things happen.

38:04.955 --> 38:07.790
Go get changed, and l'll fix the bed.

38:15.465 --> 38:17.675
Mommy?

38:17.801 --> 38:21.470
ls it OK if l didn't have my party?

38:54.504 --> 38:57.798
lt's only a matter of time
before that boy tells the police

38:57.924 --> 39:01.218
who he saw that night
at the salvage yard - me.

39:02.053 --> 39:06.432
Once the sketch is finished,
there will be no place left to hide.

39:06.558 --> 39:09.852
lf l want any chance of survival,
l have to get rid of it all.

39:11.021 --> 39:12.980
l have to let go.

39:50.393 --> 39:52.644
Alex Timmons - sniper.

39:53.521 --> 39:57.941
Yes, l did it.
ls that what you want to hear?

40:00.528 --> 40:02.946
Gene Marshall - arsonist.

40:03.073 --> 40:06.533
Have you ever watched someone
burned alive?

40:07.952 --> 40:11.121
Cindy Landon - black widow.

40:11.247 --> 40:13.624
l'll fuck you if you let me go.

40:13.750 --> 40:16.460
Such fond memories of them all.

40:16.586 --> 40:19.630
They all accepted their fate
in their own way.

40:19.756 --> 40:22.132
Now it's time for me to do the same.

40:22.258 --> 40:25.594
Valerie Castillo - my last victim.

40:34.437 --> 40:38.899
He's not angry.
That's not what this is about.

40:39.025 --> 40:41.151
He's testing me.

40:43.154 --> 40:45.405
l was wrong the whole time.

40:45.532 --> 40:48.325
My playmate saw an opportunity
to paint me into a corner

40:48.451 --> 40:52.788
to see if l'd find my way out,
if l'd fight to survive.

41:19.607 --> 41:21.233
lf you have a well-preserved sample,

41:21.359 --> 41:25.195
transferring a dry drop
of blood is relatively easy,

41:25.321 --> 41:26.530
Almost as easy as it was

41:26.656 --> 41:31.493
lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from
his boat and putting them on this knife.

42:03.526 --> 42:05.235
Just got off the phone with the FBl.

42:05.361 --> 42:06.486
Now for the hard part.

42:06.613 --> 42:08.989
l wanted to see what their computers
would spit out.

42:09.115 --> 42:11.992
l cross-referenced my profile
with the ice-truck killer list.

42:12.118 --> 42:13.535
1 1 new hits.

42:13.661 --> 42:18.248
How about we hold off till we get a sketch,
take it from there.

42:18.374 --> 42:19.333
l know, l know.

42:19.459 --> 42:21.084
l want to get a head start on this.

42:21.211 --> 42:23.712
We could look these over at lunch. My treat.

42:24.839 --> 42:27.674
You never give up, do you?

42:27.800 --> 42:30.052
Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

42:30.178 --> 42:34.014
Can't remember the last time l met
a guy's family and they actually liked me.

42:34.140 --> 42:35.265
You held your own.

42:35.391 --> 42:37.309
Most people don't get
a dirty word in edgewise

42:37.435 --> 42:38.936
with my sisters around the table.

42:39.062 --> 42:43.482
ln our house, every Thursday night was
pancake night - Morgan tradition.

42:44.734 --> 42:46.735
l miss that kind of stuff, you know?

42:46.861 --> 42:48.278
l found something.

42:49.864 --> 42:51.281
The wife's blood?
You're sure?

42:51.407 --> 42:54.117
This was found in
the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

42:54.244 --> 42:56.078
We check all the clothing items
that come in.

42:56.204 --> 42:58.163
Because of sheer volume,
that takes time.

42:58.289 --> 43:00.707
- lt doesn't prove anything.
- Not by itself.

43:00.833 --> 43:04.795
l've been re-examining the video footage
l took from that morning.

43:04.921 --> 43:08.090
Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.
They're long and deep.

43:08.216 --> 43:09.800
Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

43:09.926 --> 43:10.801
No shit.

43:10.927 --> 43:14.388
The person who did this
wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck killer.

43:14.514 --> 43:16.390
He was in a hurry.

43:16.516 --> 43:19.685
- He was probably afraid of getting caught.
- Most killers are.

43:19.811 --> 43:22.604
Except if this was a copycat,
he wouldn't be in a rush.

43:23.648 --> 43:25.148
He would savor his first kill.

43:25.275 --> 43:28.193
He would control the precise moment
Valerie Castillo died

43:28.319 --> 43:30.654
instead of just letting her bleed out.

43:30.780 --> 43:32.155
This is all too. . .

43:34.284 --> 43:37.452


43:37.578 --> 43:39.830
Have you completely ruled out the husband?

43:39.956 --> 43:41.832
Why are you doing this?

43:41.958 --> 43:45.168
The boy said he didn't recognize
Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

43:45.295 --> 43:47.296
He was a dehydrated
and traumatized seven-year-old

43:47.422 --> 43:49.589
left to fend for himself
for days in a salvage yard.

43:49.716 --> 43:51.383
You really think it's the husband?

43:51.509 --> 43:54.469
He's a deep-sea fisherman.
Most know how to use a knife.

43:54.595 --> 43:56.096
Plus, he's still missing.

43:59.600 --> 44:01.852
Have you finished your search
of the salvage yard?

44:03.313 --> 44:05.147
l'll have them send the cadets out again.

44:08.151 --> 44:09.735
Hey, l'm sorry.

44:12.113 --> 44:14.031
l know how hard you worked on that profile.

44:14.157 --> 44:16.491
No, Dex, l really don't think you do.

44:28.588 --> 44:30.297
How long are you grounded for?

44:31.716 --> 44:33.717
Two months.

44:35.970 --> 44:40.223
- Deb, l had to tell him.
- No, Dex, you didn't.

44:40.350 --> 44:42.893
You could have kept
your fucking mouth shut.

44:43.019 --> 44:44.936
Dad was worried about you, and so was l.

44:45.063 --> 44:47.856
Well, now you can spend
more time together.

44:47.982 --> 44:50.609
l'm not stupid. Dexter.
That's always what you wanted.

44:50.735 --> 44:51.818
No, it's not.

44:53.863 --> 44:57.949
- Deb, you're my sister.
- No. l am not.

44:58.076 --> 45:00.535
And he is my father.

45:00.661 --> 45:02.412
There are so many times, l swear,

45:02.538 --> 45:05.540
that l wish he would have
never brought you home.

45:08.878 --> 45:11.755
Dexter, l am so sorry.

45:11.881 --> 45:15.258
l really, really didn't mean it like that.

45:20.890 --> 45:22.432
Here.

45:24.268 --> 45:26.311
l thought you might want that.

45:27.522 --> 45:29.689
You're a better shot than me anyway.

46:04.767 --> 46:06.309
Hello?

46:06.436 --> 46:08.311
Paul, hey, it's me.

46:08.438 --> 46:11.731
- Look, we need to talk.
- sure thing.

46:11.858 --> 46:14.109
l know you want to see Astor,

46:14.235 --> 46:18.697
but. l mean.
the kids are doing so well now.

46:18.823 --> 46:24.703
Maybe it would be a good idea
if you don't come to the party.

46:24.829 --> 46:28.665
She is my daughter, too, Rita.
l have every right to be there.

46:28.791 --> 46:29.916
You know what? l'm sorry.

46:30.042 --> 46:32.461
l'm sorry, but l have full custody now,

46:32.587 --> 46:35.255
and you can't just drop in
on us like this anymore.

46:35.381 --> 46:36.423
Now, l checked.

46:36.549 --> 46:38.341
The restraining order is still in effect.

46:38.468 --> 46:42.345
lf you step one foot on this property.
the first call l'm gonna make is to the police.

46:42.472 --> 46:44.473
The second is to your parole officer.

47:07.788 --> 47:09.956
l need a sergeant.

47:24.597 --> 47:26.348
l'll be right there.

47:38.194 --> 47:40.111
The uncle called our office this morning.

47:40.238 --> 47:42.030
He lives in Tampa.

47:43.699 --> 47:47.244
That's great. He should be with family.

47:47.370 --> 47:48.828
Can l take him home?

47:50.206 --> 47:51.540
We're good.

47:53.584 --> 47:55.752
Thank Dexter.

47:55.878 --> 47:59.381
Thank you for finding him, huh?
He's a very special boy.

47:59.507 --> 48:01.883
l know.

48:25.241 --> 48:27.242
Lieutenant, you need to see this.

48:38.045 --> 48:38.962
You OK?

48:39.088 --> 48:40.589
These contacts.

48:51.642 --> 48:54.227
Wrecks like this
are usually sold for scrap.

48:54.353 --> 48:56.062
The husband stashes a knife inside

48:56.188 --> 48:59.774
and lets a demo crew shred
the truck before we find it.

48:59.900 --> 49:01.693
No more murder weapon.

49:01.819 --> 49:04.696
- There's blood.
- Want to bet it's the wife's?

49:04.822 --> 49:07.240
lt's always the husband.
You were right all along.

49:07.366 --> 49:09.326
shake it off. Morgan.
Homicide takes time.

49:09.452 --> 49:11.786
Deb will forgive me eventually.

49:11.912 --> 49:13.038
That's who she is -

49:13.164 --> 49:16.249
bighearted, kind, nothing like me.

49:16.375 --> 49:19.336
LaGuerta thought
you should see this.

49:19.462 --> 49:22.964
That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

49:27.803 --> 49:30.013
Son of a bitch.

49:30.139 --> 49:31.222
Dex.

49:31.349 --> 49:33.350
OK, l gave them Jorge's sock,

49:33.476 --> 49:36.728
a knife with his prints,
and a drop of his wife's blood.

49:36.854 --> 49:40.690
Forensics trifecta like that
should trump a child's drawing. . .

49:40.816 --> 49:42.317
l hope.

49:51.202 --> 49:53.036
Too fucking weird.

49:53.162 --> 49:54.746
Jesus Christ saved this kid.

49:54.872 --> 49:59.000
On his own for as long as Oscar was,
who's to say he didn't?

50:07.593 --> 50:11.054
When did lighting candles
become more fun than blowing them out?

50:11.180 --> 50:14.140
Nice turnout.

50:14.266 --> 50:16.601
l called all the moms to assure them

50:16.727 --> 50:19.312
that Paul would not
be making an appearance.

50:20.731 --> 50:24.025
Do Astor and Cody know
that you told their dad not to come?

50:28.364 --> 50:29.823
After presents.

50:33.703 --> 50:35.036
Ready?

50:37.707 --> 50:39.249
Make a wish, baby.

50:39.375 --> 50:41.584
Just don't tell anybody,
or it won't come true.

50:41.711 --> 50:44.421
lt already came true.
Dad's not here.

50:51.178 --> 50:52.762
l want the middle piece.

50:52.888 --> 50:53.930
OK.

50:54.056 --> 50:57.100
l was wrong about birthdays.

50:57.226 --> 51:00.145
Maybe the reason to celebrate
them is what they offer -

51:00.271 --> 51:02.981
the hope of living to see another one.

51:04.900 --> 51:07.318
The thing about Deb forgiving me,

51:07.445 --> 51:09.404
l better give her a few more days.

51:15.661 --> 51:18.288
l barely escaped getting caught this time.

51:18.998 --> 51:21.082
l realize now my days are numbered.

51:23.002 --> 51:24.919
So l better make the most of them.

51:35.431 --> 51:39.893
All along, l thought this was a game
my alter ego and l were playing.

51:40.936 --> 51:42.771
But relationships change,

51:43.481 --> 51:45.273
evolve,

51:45.399 --> 51:46.775
and this one's getting deep.

51:55.117 --> 51:57.660
Like Harry said in my dream. . .

51:58.788 --> 52:01.164
. .the storm's on its way.
