WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:03.883
Previously on Dexter. . .

00:04.009 --> 00:06.844
So if you or that skinny bitch
try to screw with what's mine,

00:06.970 --> 00:09.013
l swear to God.
l don't care who l have to hurt.

00:10.307 --> 00:12.934
Let's face it. Paul.
You've been a problem.

00:13.060 --> 00:14.644
lt's time for you to go away.

00:15.062 --> 00:16.604
lt's Paul.

00:16.730 --> 00:18.940
He violated Florida's three-strikes law.

00:19.066 --> 00:21.859
The cops picked him up
totally strung out on heroin.

00:21.985 --> 00:24.654
He's back in jail.

00:26.573 --> 00:28.616
Holy shit! They're fucking fingertips.

00:29.034 --> 00:31.994
He started getting all rough
with me until he saw this.

00:32.121 --> 00:33.037
Then what?

00:33.163 --> 00:35.331
Then he changed his tune,
got all turned on.

00:35.457 --> 00:37.500
Told me to take my fake hand off.

00:37.626 --> 00:38.918
He takes all my nail polish

00:39.044 --> 00:41.087
and paints each nail a different color.

00:41.213 --> 00:43.172
- Menthol?
- Like cough drops.

00:43.298 --> 00:47.009
l could hear them clicking
against his teeth when he. . .

00:47.136 --> 00:49.303
Son of a bitch loved those lozenges.

00:49.430 --> 00:51.431
l was confused because l love Dexter.

00:52.558 --> 00:53.391
What did you say?

00:54.017 --> 00:55.143
l love Dexter.

00:56.019 --> 00:57.729
l love you, too.

01:01.734 --> 01:03.109
What happened to your lip?

01:08.240 --> 01:11.075
l had an incident with a tool at the workshop.

01:18.333 --> 01:22.003
Just take it easy. l need an ambulance
at 1 228 Caldon Street.

01:22.129 --> 01:23.671
A guy's been stabbed.

03:25.544 --> 03:27.920
l've never had much use
for the concept of hell.

03:28.046 --> 03:30.965
but if hell exists, l'm in it.

03:37.890 --> 03:41.475
The same images running
through my head over and over.

03:52.487 --> 03:53.738
l was there.

03:55.824 --> 03:57.491
l saw my mother's death.

03:59.953 --> 04:02.330
A buried memory.
forgotten all these years.

04:02.456 --> 04:05.833
lt climbed inside me that day.

04:05.959 --> 04:07.668
And it's been with me ever since -

04:08.795 --> 04:11.130
my dark passenger.

04:19.222 --> 04:21.974
You should be focusing on me, socio.

04:26.980 --> 04:30.149
Seriously want to get
the motherfucker that did it to Batista.

04:34.947 --> 04:36.781
Hey. You all right?

04:37.366 --> 04:38.699
Yeah. l'm OK.

04:38.825 --> 04:41.410
l'm just, you know, distraught about Angel.

04:42.621 --> 04:45.831
- How's he doing? Do we know?
- still in surgery.

04:45.958 --> 04:48.668
LaGuerta's there.

04:48.794 --> 04:50.628
God, l hate feeling so helpless.

04:52.339 --> 04:56.509
What, no jokes about providing
gross sexual comfort at a time of crisis?

04:56.635 --> 04:58.594
Our friend was stabbed. . .

04:58.720 --> 05:00.513
and he might die.

05:00.639 --> 05:02.098
Officer Morgan.

05:07.896 --> 05:08.980
What do you think, Dex?

05:09.106 --> 05:11.315
He put up a fight. There was a struggle.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.317
Attaboy, Angel.

05:13.443 --> 05:16.821
Here, this trail - steady stream of drops.

05:16.947 --> 05:19.323
He had a few seconds.
Tried to move away until. . .

05:21.159 --> 05:22.827
Till he fell.

05:25.455 --> 05:26.998
So much blood.

05:33.296 --> 05:35.548
What's happening to me?

06:02.034 --> 06:03.576
No way.

06:03.702 --> 06:05.953
You're the one l'm supposed to meet.

06:06.079 --> 06:07.371
ln the flesh.

06:07.497 --> 06:10.207
You know, l was just talking
to someone about Dexter.

06:19.384 --> 06:21.844
That tickles.

06:21.970 --> 06:24.263
Don't stop.

06:24.389 --> 06:27.391
l wouldn't dream of stopping.

06:27.517 --> 06:29.935
You're so different this time.

06:30.062 --> 06:31.645
Gentle.

06:32.230 --> 06:35.483
l thought you were gonna try
and get all pervy with my stump again.

06:35.609 --> 06:39.820
Actually, your. . .imperfection
is what saved you the first time.

06:39.946 --> 06:41.906
Saved me from what?

06:42.657 --> 06:44.575
True artistry.

06:47.329 --> 06:51.457
The message of my work
is not in the product itself,

06:51.583 --> 06:53.793
but rather the presentation.

06:55.378 --> 06:58.964
That wrinkled flesh on your radial carpal
joint is far from perfect.

06:59.091 --> 07:00.716
lt's quite unsightly, actually.

07:00.842 --> 07:03.135
Hey, you don't have
to be an asshole about it.

07:03.261 --> 07:04.345
Hey, hey, no, no, no.

07:06.640 --> 07:10.267
l'm sorry. l didn't mean to offend.

07:12.687 --> 07:13.938
Truthfully. . .

07:14.981 --> 07:18.192
l'm thankful for Dexter.

07:18.318 --> 07:20.861
You're my escape plan.

07:20.987 --> 07:23.280
Escape from what?

07:23.406 --> 07:25.491
The police.

07:25.617 --> 07:29.370
Because of Dexter.
l've had to speed up my project.

07:29.496 --> 07:31.831
l need something to distract them by.

07:31.957 --> 07:34.166
And l always found
a freshly chopped-up body

07:34.292 --> 07:35.501
always does the trick.

07:35.627 --> 07:37.711
Wait, wait! No!

07:37.838 --> 07:40.172
Don't struggle. That never helps.

07:41.049 --> 07:43.425
l'm compressing your carotid artery,

07:43.552 --> 07:46.095
and that is cutting off oxygen to your brain.

07:46.221 --> 07:50.141
ln about ten seconds, you'll be unconscious.

08:16.918 --> 08:18.919
Hey, it's Rudy. Leave a message.

08:19.045 --> 08:21.547
OK, l guess you went to bed.

08:21.673 --> 08:24.508
Or you fell asleep on the couch
watching Xena reruns,

08:24.634 --> 08:27.011
which l still think makes you a dork.

08:29.931 --> 08:32.183
Either way, call me when you get this, OK?

08:32.309 --> 08:33.309
Miss Dexter.

08:35.478 --> 08:39.023
He's still in surgery,
but l don't know when we'll hear anything.

08:39.149 --> 08:41.525
So l guess you won't be coming over tonight.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.236
No. l mean, l can't.

08:44.362 --> 08:47.364
l understand.
You need to be there for your friend.

08:48.241 --> 08:49.867
l haven't told the kids yet.

08:49.993 --> 08:51.285
Told them about Angel?

08:52.454 --> 08:55.122
No, about Paul. . .being back in prison?

08:55.248 --> 08:58.500
l hate breaking their hearts.
They think so much of their dad now.

08:58.627 --> 09:00.377
Right.

09:04.633 --> 09:05.758
You know what?

09:05.884 --> 09:08.344
Focus on Angel. We can talk about this later.

09:08.470 --> 09:09.386
Thanks.

09:09.512 --> 09:12.640
They're actually coming out
right now. l got to go.

09:25.278 --> 09:28.280
Angel sustained severe internal injuries.

09:28.406 --> 09:31.075
He lost a lot of blood.

09:31.201 --> 09:33.744
But. . .the surgery was successful.

09:35.205 --> 09:37.248
lt looks like our boy's out of the woods.

09:42.420 --> 09:46.632
l know l should stay.
be a part of the group hug.

09:47.592 --> 09:49.301
But l can't focus.

09:49.427 --> 09:51.762
l'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.

09:51.888 --> 09:53.973
l need to know what it means.

10:05.026 --> 10:06.610
What the fuck is wrong with you?

10:08.280 --> 10:10.364
l have someplace l have to be.

10:12.242 --> 10:15.452
We all got someplace to be.
But you just found out that somebody

10:15.578 --> 10:19.498
who was supposed to be your friend is gonna
live. Does it make you feel anything?

10:19.624 --> 10:20.916
Anything at all?

10:23.461 --> 10:25.879
Take your fucking hand off me.

10:30.593 --> 10:32.177
Just what l always thought.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.139
Right.

11:05.003 --> 11:07.254
Shit. Just what l need.

11:23.021 --> 11:24.021
Hey.

11:24.564 --> 11:25.939
l know it's late.

11:26.066 --> 11:28.442
l guess you didn't get my message.

11:28.568 --> 11:30.110
l drove by and saw your car.

11:32.072 --> 11:33.530
l can go.

11:33.656 --> 11:35.240
Get your ass in here.

11:35.367 --> 11:39.078
lt's about time you see where l live anyway.

11:39.204 --> 11:41.872
Oh, you have no idea
how much l needed this.

11:41.998 --> 11:44.208
You feel good.

11:44.334 --> 11:46.335
And cold. You're freezing.

11:46.461 --> 11:49.380
Well, then stay and keep me warm.

12:03.311 --> 12:06.063
This Batista thing
has gotten to you, hasn't it?

12:09.359 --> 12:10.901
Angel's daughter was there.

12:13.071 --> 12:15.531
That's got to be rough.

12:15.657 --> 12:19.243
Daughter of a cop, just like Dexter.

12:22.747 --> 12:24.206
l remember what that's like -

12:24.332 --> 12:26.750
kissing your father goodbye,

12:27.043 --> 12:29.086
always afraid it's for the last time.

12:29.212 --> 12:30.337
Hey.

12:31.256 --> 12:33.424
Let's get out of town for the weekend.

12:33.550 --> 12:35.092
Just the two of us.

12:36.219 --> 12:37.803
We need to talk.

12:42.809 --> 12:44.476
l'm sitting right here.

12:44.602 --> 12:45.602
Nope.

12:47.063 --> 12:48.981
The time has got to be right.

12:51.943 --> 12:53.444
OK.

12:54.863 --> 12:56.989
lt will have to wait. . .

12:57.115 --> 13:00.492
At least till we catch the asshole
who did this to Batista.

13:00.618 --> 13:03.620
Let me warn you - l can be very persistent.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.330
l need to get out of town,

13:05.457 --> 13:09.293
and l need you to come with me.

13:12.964 --> 13:14.298
What l need is sleep,

13:15.592 --> 13:18.844
which is not gonna be easy.
l'm totally wired from all this shit.

13:18.970 --> 13:22.473
Well, lucky for you, l have the perfect cure.

13:24.184 --> 13:25.434
My loving arms.

13:28.313 --> 13:31.440
And. . . l got a little thing to help you sleep.

13:32.692 --> 13:34.902
That ain't no little thing.

13:35.028 --> 13:36.612
l meant Valium.

13:36.738 --> 13:39.031
lt's one of the perks working at the hospital.

13:39.157 --> 13:40.574
Wine and Valium?

13:42.827 --> 13:45.370
- l'll be totally helpless.
- You read my mind.

14:13.608 --> 14:16.777
- Well, as l live and breathe!
- You miss me?

14:16.903 --> 14:19.947
You and the bear claws
you're hiding behind your back.

14:22.575 --> 14:24.326
This must be important.

14:24.452 --> 14:26.203
Haven't seen much of you lately.

14:26.329 --> 14:27.663
No rest for the wicked.

14:29.541 --> 14:32.376
- How's Gene?
- Good days and bad.

14:33.044 --> 14:35.295
He just finished his first round of radiation.

14:35.421 --> 14:36.922
Well, he's a good guy.

14:38.258 --> 14:40.592
Not much of a bridge player, though.

14:40.718 --> 14:42.803
Harry and Gene used to get so mad

14:42.929 --> 14:45.222
every time Doris and l'd take them
to the cleaners.

14:48.977 --> 14:51.436
l was hoping you could dig up
an old case file for me.

14:51.563 --> 14:54.064
Well, sure thing. Got a date?

14:54.566 --> 14:55.941
Uh, not exactly.

14:56.067 --> 14:58.610
lt's the crime scene where Harry found me.

15:02.323 --> 15:05.784
Uh. . . l wish l could help, but. . .

15:05.910 --> 15:09.705
Everything from that long ago is boxed up
in the basement at City Hall.

15:09.831 --> 15:11.832
And, as you can see,

15:11.958 --> 15:15.586
l'm up to my you-know-what
in year-end reports, so. . .

15:21.342 --> 15:23.010
lt's my lieutenant.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.806
Camilla, is there anything you remember?

15:29.142 --> 15:32.185
What l remember, Dexter Morgan,
is your father caring enough

15:32.312 --> 15:35.939
to bring you into his home
and give you a loving family.

15:37.775 --> 15:40.068
l wouldn't keep your lieutenant waiting.

15:44.032 --> 15:45.490
Who found the body parts?

15:45.617 --> 15:48.118
l did. They were left under the tree.

15:48.244 --> 15:51.163
l thought it was the crew from last night
messing around...

15:51.289 --> 15:52.914
till l found the head.

15:53.041 --> 15:56.293
l told him not to touch anything,
but he never listens.

15:56.419 --> 15:57.961
God, Patty, you're such a bitch.

15:58.087 --> 16:01.548
Did you guys see anything out of
the ordinary before you found the body?

16:01.674 --> 16:05.344
There were some broken
ornaments by the tree.

16:05.470 --> 16:09.348
Who'd do something like this
so close to Christmas?

16:09.474 --> 16:11.224
The Grinch.

16:11.351 --> 16:13.393
Oh, you're a fucking riot, Max!

16:13.519 --> 16:16.229
Like anyone's gonna go shopping
down here after this.

16:16.356 --> 16:19.149
- There go our jobs.
- Thank you for your cooperation.

16:21.694 --> 16:23.904
Oh, sucks to be an elf.

16:26.157 --> 16:29.701
- Sir, can you answer a question?
- . .any place with security cameras.

16:29.827 --> 16:32.871
- Get some visual surveillance.
- l got here as fast as l could.

16:32.997 --> 16:35.999
- What are we looking at?
- Female victim cut up into pieces.

16:36.834 --> 16:38.293
The ice-truck killer? So soon?

16:38.419 --> 16:40.629
Yep, and after the bloodbath at the hotel,

16:40.755 --> 16:44.216
can't wait to see how the captain'll handle
the press on this one. James!

16:44.342 --> 16:45.967
l need you to walk Dexter to the crime scene.

16:46.094 --> 16:48.553
Will somebody turn off
this damn snow machine?

16:48.680 --> 16:50.347
Your sister can help you out.

16:51.557 --> 16:54.768
That a whole sexual-tension thing,
or am l missing something?

16:57.397 --> 16:58.605
1 03.

16:58.731 --> 17:01.608
lt's the same numbers
he left at Marina View Hotel.

17:01.734 --> 17:04.986
- Any leads as to what they mean?
- We've talked to numerologists,

17:05.113 --> 17:07.698
code breakers - nothing.
They need more to go on.

17:11.369 --> 17:15.038
First he turns my whole world inside out
with a carnival of blood.

17:19.085 --> 17:21.086
Now he leaves me this.

17:21.212 --> 17:24.423
A calming oasis in the desert
of my confusion.

17:24.549 --> 17:26.299
lt doesn't make sense.

17:33.891 --> 17:35.726
Crime scene's wiped clean.

17:35.852 --> 17:36.685
Another hooker?

17:36.811 --> 17:38.812
Ho, ho, ho - another dead ho.

17:38.938 --> 17:40.230
Somebody's been naughty.

17:40.356 --> 17:42.858
Hey. Morgan. want to sit
on my lap when we're done

17:42.984 --> 17:46.278
- and tell me what you want for Christmas?
- And he's back.

17:46.404 --> 17:50.407
No, thanks. Last thing on my wish list
is a burning sensation when l pee.

17:51.743 --> 17:54.244
This doesn't seem right.

17:54.370 --> 17:57.122
Body parts scattered among the presents.

17:57.248 --> 18:00.542
Broken ornaments.
lt's not his usual meticulous style.

18:02.462 --> 18:04.045
lt seems rushed. . .

18:04.922 --> 18:06.631
- haphazard.
- That would explain

18:06.758 --> 18:08.425
why we can't find one of the hands.

18:14.807 --> 18:16.057
What's wrong?

18:16.768 --> 18:18.643
Something underneath the torso.

18:24.942 --> 18:26.902
Merry Christmas, Miami.

18:27.487 --> 18:28.487
After all this time,

18:28.613 --> 18:30.655
why do you think the ice-truck killer
has struck again?

18:30.782 --> 18:33.909
Any answer at this time would be
pure speculation on my part.

18:34.035 --> 18:35.494
Do you think it has connection

18:35.620 --> 18:38.330
with your department's handling
of the Neil Perry fiasco?

18:38.456 --> 18:39.956
Sir?

18:49.300 --> 18:50.759
You've arrested the wrong man.

18:50.885 --> 18:53.762
Made the world think l'm a rank amateur,

18:53.888 --> 18:56.097
and l'm very, very angry.

18:56.224 --> 18:58.308
To answer for your mistakes. . .

19:00.645 --> 19:03.188
- Stop the tape.
- What are you doing?

19:03.314 --> 19:04.981
Look at her tears rolling up.

19:06.484 --> 19:07.651
Oh, my God.

19:08.569 --> 19:10.362
Bastard's got her upside down.

19:11.239 --> 19:14.282
That's how he bleeds them out.
He strings them up like meat.

19:23.793 --> 19:26.586
No, please, no!

19:28.840 --> 19:32.425
- All right, turn it off.
- l'll have the tape sent to the station. . .

19:32.552 --> 19:35.470
- ..for analysis.
- Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.

19:35.596 --> 19:38.390
With all due respect,
Lieutenant LaGuerta's in charge. . .

19:38.516 --> 19:40.642
- of this investigation.
- Not anymore.

19:40.768 --> 19:44.104
We didn't catch this guy.
and now he's rubbing our noses in it.

19:44.230 --> 19:46.690
We've got to come up
with some fresh ideas.

19:48.901 --> 19:53.697
- This is some bullshit, l'll go talk to him.
- No. no. no. Do as he says.

19:53.823 --> 19:56.533
The commissioner has his ass in a sling.

19:56.659 --> 19:59.911
He's up for review.
Word is he's getting the boot.

20:00.037 --> 20:01.997
You're just gonna sit back and take this?

20:02.123 --> 20:06.585
lf it means being seen as
his worthy successor. . . l'll be at the hospital.

20:06.711 --> 20:08.461
All right, PB and J lnside,

20:08.588 --> 20:10.797
cut diagonally, not straight across.

20:10.923 --> 20:12.173
Tastes better that way.

20:12.717 --> 20:15.844
Has Dad said if he's coming over
Christmas Eve

20:15.970 --> 20:18.013
or Christmas morning?

20:18.139 --> 20:19.639
l miss him.

20:19.765 --> 20:23.393
l'm afraid your dad's not gonna
make it this year for the holidays.

20:24.437 --> 20:25.770
Where is he?

20:25.897 --> 20:27.689
Well, uh. . . He's. . .

20:27.815 --> 20:29.399
He's back in jail, isn't he?

20:31.903 --> 20:35.614
Look, l know he wanted to say goodbye,
but there wasn't any time.

20:35.740 --> 20:37.032
He loves you guys so much.

20:38.951 --> 20:40.577
l forgot my math book.

20:42.914 --> 20:46.291
l'm sure he'd love to hear from Dexter.
We could write him a letter.

20:46.417 --> 20:48.293
lt's all your fault.

20:50.963 --> 20:53.798
You could at least pretend
you want to be here.

20:54.759 --> 20:59.387
- You had the urgent need for tacos.
- Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.

20:59.513 --> 21:00.805
He's been acting weird lately.

21:00.932 --> 21:04.059
Last night he said we need to talk.

21:04.185 --> 21:06.144
Well, that's never good.

21:06.270 --> 21:08.355
Well, thanks. l feel a lot better.

21:08.481 --> 21:11.107
l've only been obsessing about this all day.

21:12.693 --> 21:15.612
Think you could talk to him for me?

21:17.531 --> 21:20.283
- Oh, look, it's Rudy.
- l sort of called him.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.911
Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.

21:23.037 --> 21:25.038
Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.

21:25.164 --> 21:27.082
Oh, shit.

21:27.208 --> 21:29.834
That's work. l have to go.

21:30.211 --> 21:32.462
Here, take mine. Sorry.

21:39.011 --> 21:40.011
What's with your lip?

21:40.137 --> 21:42.347
Deb catch you with a right hook?

21:42.473 --> 21:44.432
She can be protective with the remote.

21:44.558 --> 21:48.186
l had a little workshop accident
this morning.

21:48.312 --> 21:51.064
Doesn't look like it happened this morning.
The cut's already closing up.

21:51.190 --> 21:53.024
Did l say. . . l meant yesterday morning.

21:53.150 --> 21:54.985
l think l'm working too hard.

21:55.987 --> 21:59.698
Anyway, l don't think my lip is
why Deb arranged this little chitchat.

22:00.825 --> 22:04.327
My sister is afraid
there may be trouble in paradise.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.705
Your sister's wrong.

22:06.831 --> 22:08.707
So this whole "need to talk" thing?

22:09.500 --> 22:13.044
l'm starting to look at the big picture.

22:13.170 --> 22:16.715
She's someone l could see spending
the rest of my life with. you know?

22:16.841 --> 22:19.968
No, l don't know.

22:20.094 --> 22:23.555
But l do know that Deb's falling for Dexter. . .hard.

22:23.681 --> 22:25.890
- You hurt her. . .
- And you'll hurt me.

22:26.017 --> 22:27.517
Something like that.

22:43.325 --> 22:46.202
l'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.

22:47.663 --> 22:49.831
Hey, Dexter.

22:51.167 --> 22:52.751
You had us so worried.

22:52.877 --> 22:53.752
lf l'd have known

22:53.878 --> 22:56.421
that this would get you back
in the same room with me,

22:56.547 --> 22:58.381
l would have gotten stabbed sooner.

23:00.092 --> 23:02.052
l'm gonna get the doctor.

23:08.059 --> 23:10.643
No, no, no. What are you doing?

23:12.396 --> 23:14.773
The doctor said you're lucky to be alive
and have a liver.

23:14.899 --> 23:17.400
Well, that's why l got two, right?

23:18.986 --> 23:21.071
lt's a good thing
you decided to be a cop.

23:24.742 --> 23:29.162
Tell me that you caught the cocksucker
that ruined one of my best shirts.

23:29.288 --> 23:30.789
We don't have any leads.

23:30.915 --> 23:32.624
Did you see anything?

23:33.250 --> 23:34.250
No.

23:36.587 --> 23:37.921
He was behind me.

23:39.423 --> 23:41.758
l just felt the blade go in.

23:42.927 --> 23:45.053
lt happened so fast.

23:50.184 --> 23:51.601
How long has Nina been here?

23:52.520 --> 23:54.479
She was the first one at the hospital.

23:54.605 --> 23:56.648
She's been with you the whole time.

24:10.621 --> 24:15.166
My mother was murdered before my eyes.

24:15.292 --> 24:19.546
Makes sense l'd choose a life
where l search for meaning in blood.

24:19.672 --> 24:23.842
The sole memory l have of her
is being covered in it.

24:23.968 --> 24:26.302
l need to know more details.

24:30.141 --> 24:33.226
l hope that look means you found something
on Batista's shirt.

24:33.352 --> 24:34.978
You should see this.

24:38.107 --> 24:40.984
That's what l drove
all the way back from the hospital for?

24:41.110 --> 24:44.362
This drop of blood doesn't match the wound
pattern or the spatter

24:44.488 --> 24:45.697
from the rest of the shirt,

24:45.823 --> 24:47.949
and it is on the inside of the back collar.

24:48.075 --> 24:49.450
He was stabbed from behind.

24:49.577 --> 24:52.412
- Could it be the attacker's blood?
- Batista fought back.

24:52.538 --> 24:56.583
Well, run the DNA. lf this guy's got priors,
we'll get a hit on the database.

24:56.709 --> 24:57.959
l sent a sample to the lab.

24:58.085 --> 25:01.379
Let's get this together. Come on. Let's go.

25:01.505 --> 25:05.049
Bring the monitor over here.

25:05.176 --> 25:09.012
Sorry to hear, you know,
about Matthews taking you off the case.

25:09.138 --> 25:11.639
Last gasp of a desperate man.

25:12.474 --> 25:15.810
Things are gonna change around here.

25:15.936 --> 25:17.478
And l won't forget your help.

25:23.569 --> 25:26.070
And l'm very, very angry.

25:26.197 --> 25:29.407
Oh, God, no! No, please!

25:29.533 --> 25:30.742
l can't watch this again.

25:30.868 --> 25:33.369
l know it's tough,
but keep your eyes on the monitor.

25:34.580 --> 25:35.955
Wait, what was that?

25:36.081 --> 25:41.044
The camera tilts up
right before he hits the off switch. Watch.

25:42.213 --> 25:45.298
That, my friends,
is a monster refrigeration unit.

25:45.424 --> 25:49.260
- He needs it cold to preserve the bodies.
- But check this out.

25:49.386 --> 25:52.180
Look at the space there is
between her feet and the ceiling.

25:52.306 --> 25:56.267
This room is bigger than a commercial freezer.
Likely it was a custom build.

25:56.393 --> 25:58.686
We should focus our search
on commercial districts.

25:58.812 --> 26:00.772
No. Residential.

26:00.898 --> 26:02.690
You think he built it in his own place?

26:02.816 --> 26:04.984
He picks up hookers, right? l worked Vice.

26:05.110 --> 26:07.570
Smart girls know not to go
near a factory or a warehouse

26:07.696 --> 26:09.113
unless you never want to be seen again.

26:09.240 --> 26:11.532
How do we know
he didn't knock out his victims

26:11.659 --> 26:13.993
or drug them, then take them
to a warehouse?

26:14.119 --> 26:17.121
No other victim showed
signs of head injury or narcotics.

26:17.248 --> 26:21.125
Besides, what better way to trap a victim
than to get her into your own home?

26:21.252 --> 26:23.670
The escort service said
she was meeting a client

26:23.796 --> 26:25.922
between Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.

26:26.048 --> 26:29.133
And her body was found
at Santa's Cottage, on Biscayne Mall.

26:29.260 --> 26:30.301
We'll map out grids.

26:30.427 --> 26:31.928
Focus on private residences

26:32.054 --> 26:34.472
drawing large amounts of power
near those areas.

26:34.598 --> 26:35.765
Catch a break. . .

26:36.934 --> 26:38.810
we'll catch this son of a bitch.

26:40.938 --> 26:44.023
- Where the hell are you going?
- To do some research on a case.

26:44.149 --> 26:46.150
You had to call me after the lunch with Rudy.

26:46.277 --> 26:48.361
l've been freaking out. He sent me this.

26:48.487 --> 26:50.405
"Cum sail away with me?"

26:50.531 --> 26:52.323
He misspelled "come."

26:52.449 --> 26:54.325
Dexter, this is no time to joke.

26:54.451 --> 26:56.911
This is good, right? A romantic weekend?

26:57.037 --> 26:58.621
What did he say to you?

26:58.747 --> 27:00.665
Oh, wait, no. Don't. Don't tell me.

27:00.791 --> 27:02.709
Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.

27:02.835 --> 27:04.669
Unless l should know. Should l know?

27:04.795 --> 27:06.838
OK, tell me.

27:06.964 --> 27:08.548
You know, no. Don't.

27:08.674 --> 27:11.676
"We need to talk"? Who says it
unless you're getting dumped?

27:11.802 --> 27:14.012
- l don't think it's about that.
- Maybe wants me on the water

27:14.138 --> 27:15.305
in case l make a scene.

27:16.348 --> 27:18.266
l always do this. l put myself out there.

27:18.392 --> 27:21.185
- l set myself up to get hurt.
- He wants to be part of the family.

27:21.312 --> 27:23.438
What?

27:24.273 --> 27:25.398
Wait.

27:25.524 --> 27:27.692
Like. . .propose?

27:27.818 --> 27:32.530
l have to get to the library before it closes,
but we'll talk about this later, OK?

27:32.656 --> 27:35.533
Oh, my God.

27:35.659 --> 27:37.827
Oh, my God!

27:46.628 --> 27:49.255
l was never one to dwell on my past,

27:49.381 --> 27:51.632
always content to leave it a mystery.

27:51.759 --> 27:52.717
No details.

27:52.843 --> 27:55.762
Just a blur of images rushing by.

27:55.888 --> 27:59.307
But my friend out there wants
to bring those memories into focus.

28:04.688 --> 28:06.022
So do l.

28:06.148 --> 28:10.360
This is it for the Metro News
for 1 972 through 1 973.

28:10.486 --> 28:12.528
The Tribune's archives. . .

28:27.294 --> 28:29.337
1 0/3?

28:33.092 --> 28:38.137
1 -0-3. Same as the hotel,
same as Santa's Cottage.

28:38.263 --> 28:41.140
This is what he wanted me to find all along.

28:47.064 --> 28:48.523
Close your eyes.

28:51.527 --> 28:52.693
Don't look.

28:53.821 --> 28:56.614
Laura Moser. . .

28:56.740 --> 28:58.408
my mother.

28:59.118 --> 29:02.412
No wonder l felt so
disconnected my entire life.

29:02.538 --> 29:04.747
lf l did have emotions, l'd have to feel. . .

29:05.874 --> 29:07.083
. .this.

29:14.425 --> 29:16.259
October third, 1 973.

29:17.177 --> 29:20.555
Laura Moser and three others
found chopped up with a chainsaw.

29:20.681 --> 29:24.392
A drug dealer didn't appreciate
Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

29:24.518 --> 29:26.644
First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.

29:27.229 --> 29:28.980
- You've been busy.
- A crime that big

29:29.106 --> 29:33.151
and yet there's no record of the case file
at City Hall. That seems a bit odd.

29:33.277 --> 29:34.485
lt's a long time ago.

29:34.611 --> 29:37.613
What is in that report
that Harry didn't want me to see?!

29:39.366 --> 29:43.911
Why was there no mention in newspapers
about a three-year-old boy at the crime scene?

29:46.665 --> 29:48.916
Damn it, l need to know. l need that file.

29:49.042 --> 29:52.378
l can't give you the file
'cause it no longer exists.

29:52.504 --> 29:54.839
l destroyed it the day your adoption
went through.

29:54.965 --> 29:56.716
You did what?

29:56.842 --> 29:59.302
Made a promise to your father.

30:00.345 --> 30:01.637
Why, to protect him?

30:03.974 --> 30:05.349
To protect Dexter.

30:13.817 --> 30:16.861
Harry had a code.
He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.

30:16.987 --> 30:19.572
Your father was a decent man
and an honest cop,

30:19.698 --> 30:22.783
but what he saw
in that cargo container changed him.

30:23.494 --> 30:28.414
You were left there for days, starving,
in blood two inches thick.

30:38.592 --> 30:41.427
- Dex, Cody's run away!
- Are you sure?

30:41.553 --> 30:43.262
Yeah, l've looked everywhere.

30:43.680 --> 30:46.516
- Call the police. l'll be right there.
- OK.

30:51.897 --> 30:53.272
l need to know the truth.

30:53.398 --> 30:54.774
Kid. . .

30:57.611 --> 30:59.028
. .leave this one alone.

31:00.489 --> 31:03.324
l can't sit here,
l should be out there doing something.

31:03.450 --> 31:05.576
Rita, the police said
you need to stay here

31:05.702 --> 31:09.288
in case Cody comes home.
The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.

31:09.414 --> 31:12.166
Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?

31:12.292 --> 31:15.711
What if some crazy person
picked him up off the street?

31:18.590 --> 31:21.759
lt's all my fault.

31:21.885 --> 31:26.556
- Honey, what are you talking about?
- l should have heard Cody get out of bed.

31:26.682 --> 31:29.267
l'm his big sister.

31:29.393 --> 31:32.228
Hey. Hey, look at me.

31:32.354 --> 31:35.481
lt's not your fault, OK?

31:38.402 --> 31:40.236
Could you go get Dexter some water?

31:44.908 --> 31:45.908
Oh, God.

31:47.411 --> 31:49.495
l should have seen this coming.

31:49.621 --> 31:54.709
Cody was so upset with me when l told him
that Paul was back in jail.

31:55.002 --> 31:56.586
Paul.

31:57.170 --> 31:59.547
- Today's Thursday, right?
- Yeah.

31:59.673 --> 32:02.758
l think l know where Cody might be.

32:12.936 --> 32:14.979
Hey.

32:15.105 --> 32:16.772
Need a push?

32:21.028 --> 32:23.487
Today's the day you meet Daddy
in the park. huh?

32:23.614 --> 32:24.947
He'll be here.

32:25.073 --> 32:28.451
Oh, baby, l'm so sorry,
but he's not coming back.

32:28.577 --> 32:30.119
Not for a long time.

32:32.956 --> 32:35.625
Look, we'll talk about this
when we get home, OK?

32:36.585 --> 32:39.003
After all the lies
Harry left for me to uncover,

32:39.129 --> 32:41.172
l'd love to run away, too.

32:42.966 --> 32:44.675
He won't even look at me.

32:44.801 --> 32:49.013
l'm not the one in jail,
and yet l'm still the bad guy.

32:49.139 --> 32:51.349
Well, you didn't tell them the truth. . .

32:51.475 --> 32:53.476
about their father.

32:53.602 --> 32:56.604
l told them Paul was back in jail.

32:56.730 --> 32:59.565
Well, right, you told them where he is,
but not who he is.

32:59.691 --> 33:04.403
He's still the same drug-using,
wife-beating redneck he always was.

33:04.529 --> 33:07.281
They should hear that.

33:07.407 --> 33:11.410
You're not a parent. You don't understand.
You do anything to protect your kids.

33:11.536 --> 33:14.497
Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them,
you're protecting Paul.

33:16.625 --> 33:18.501
Well, l. . . l got to get them home.

33:33.934 --> 33:35.559
Somebody's in a good mood.

33:35.686 --> 33:39.730
The commissioner and the review board
did not look happy this morning.

33:39.856 --> 33:41.982
They've been in Matthews' office
for two hours.

33:42.109 --> 33:44.276
You thinking his ass is
three shades of red now?

33:44.403 --> 33:48.406
l don't care what color it is
as long as it's on its way out the door.

33:58.959 --> 34:02.920
- Tell me that did not just happen.
- lt's who you know and who you blow.

34:03.046 --> 34:07.216
- Probably picking their fucking tee time.
- Maria. watch your back.

34:07.342 --> 34:10.052
He's gonna be gunning for you
now more than ever.

34:11.012 --> 34:12.805
Let him try.

34:17.728 --> 34:19.478
My man Juan, hook it up.

34:19.604 --> 34:21.731
They didn't have Road & Track so. . .

34:25.235 --> 34:28.070
- That better be a bag of applesauce.
- OK. at this point.

34:28.196 --> 34:30.030
you should go save yourself. Go.

34:31.825 --> 34:34.702
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

34:34.828 --> 34:35.870
Two double-meats?

34:35.996 --> 34:37.580
A man's got to eat.

34:40.250 --> 34:42.126
You're so cute when you're annoyed.

34:42.252 --> 34:45.129
- Your mouth makes those little O's.
- God damn it. Angel.

34:45.255 --> 34:47.131
do l look like l'm being cute with you?

34:47.257 --> 34:50.801
- Well. not now you don't. no.
- Why do you always do this. . .

34:50.927 --> 34:56.515
- make light of things that matter?
- OK, l'm sorry. OK?

34:56.641 --> 34:59.143
When l come home,
l'll eat anything you want.

34:59.269 --> 35:02.772
No jokes, no complaining. l promise.

35:02.898 --> 35:04.607
When you come home?

35:06.359 --> 35:08.986
l thought the way things are going with us. . .

35:10.655 --> 35:12.114
l thought you'd forgiven me.

35:14.826 --> 35:18.245
Well, of course l forgive Dexter.

35:18.371 --> 35:22.792
- l forgave you a long time ago.
- OK, so let's fix this.

35:23.794 --> 35:25.711
This could be a second chance for us.

35:27.631 --> 35:28.798
What?

35:32.803 --> 35:34.637
Look, you did what you did.

35:36.556 --> 35:37.640
lt was hard.

35:39.851 --> 35:41.977
But it got us to face the truth.

35:44.314 --> 35:45.940
We were miserable. . .

35:46.066 --> 35:48.192
for years.

35:48.318 --> 35:52.863
Do you really want to survive this
and go right back to being unhappy?

35:52.989 --> 35:53.989
Maybe.

35:55.659 --> 35:56.951
What if l do?

36:00.831 --> 36:03.249
Look, you will always be Auri's father.

36:03.375 --> 36:06.877
l will always care about Dexter.

36:09.339 --> 36:11.966
l'll always be here for Dexter.

36:14.719 --> 36:17.179
But our marriage is over.

36:30.151 --> 36:32.903
Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.

36:33.029 --> 36:36.615
Maria. . .let's you and me have a talk.

36:36.741 --> 36:41.036
Congratulations on the review.
l hear it went well. You must be thrilled.

36:41.162 --> 36:43.873
- But, if you don't mind. . .
- Let me get to the point.

36:44.332 --> 36:46.500
All our mishaps these last few months -

36:46.626 --> 36:49.128
failure to bring in the ice-truck killer,

36:49.254 --> 36:51.338
mishandling of Tony Tucci. . .

36:51.923 --> 36:54.383
- even Neil Perry.
- That was your fuck-up. . .

36:55.427 --> 36:56.343
not mine.

36:56.469 --> 37:00.139
They're all the result of
a bad command structure,

37:00.265 --> 37:01.473
and that's my failure.

37:03.602 --> 37:05.060
Well. . .

37:05.979 --> 37:07.855
l'm glad to hear you say that.

37:09.232 --> 37:11.859
Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.

37:13.653 --> 37:16.405
so this morning.
the commissioner gave me the go-ahead

37:16.531 --> 37:18.866
to restructure the division.

37:19.868 --> 37:23.245
Effective immediately,
you'll no longer serve as my lieutenant.

37:25.290 --> 37:27.875
l'm sorry. l know this must be difficult for Dexter.

37:29.085 --> 37:31.337
Please, it's ridiculous.

37:34.257 --> 37:37.468
- You really don't want to do this.
- Because of your status...

37:37.594 --> 37:40.971
- in the Cuban community.
- l'm a fucking hero to this community.

37:41.097 --> 37:44.308
- You think they'll accept it?
- Your replacement's been selected.

37:44.434 --> 37:45.935
Her name is Esme Pascal,

37:46.061 --> 37:48.896
a transfer from Fort Lauderdale.
A real up-and-comer.

37:50.273 --> 37:52.441
Pascal, the Haitian-American?

37:53.485 --> 37:58.697
- Who got shot last year in the line of duty.
- Turns out she's an actual hero.

37:58.823 --> 38:01.659
lf you think l'm gonna stay quiet,
you're out of mind.

38:01.826 --> 38:03.452
l did warn you, Maria.

38:06.623 --> 38:08.791
l need you to clear out this office tonight.

38:09.501 --> 38:13.003
- Expect a call from my union rep.
- You'll always have a place in the bullpen. . .

38:13.129 --> 38:14.380
And my fucking lawyer, too!

38:14.506 --> 38:17.716
- . .with the other detectives.
- This isn't fucking over, Tom!

38:17.842 --> 38:22.638
You goddamn son of a bitch!

38:29.354 --> 38:31.397
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

38:31.523 --> 38:32.648
How are you?

38:34.526 --> 38:35.985
How the hell do l look?

38:37.028 --> 38:38.862
l can barely remember how l got here.

38:38.989 --> 38:40.990
There's something we need to discuss.

38:41.324 --> 38:43.867
lf you came for an apology,
you wasted a tank of gas.

38:43.994 --> 38:45.244
Sit. l'm not finished.

38:45.370 --> 38:46.578
Fuck Dexter.

38:47.247 --> 38:49.498
Astor and Cody are in the other room.

38:52.961 --> 38:55.713
Jesus, you brought them here?

38:55.839 --> 38:57.214
l know this'll be difficult,

38:57.340 --> 38:59.883
but l need you to explain
to them why you're here.

39:00.010 --> 39:03.053
l have no fucking idea why l'm in this place.

39:04.806 --> 39:08.058
Fine. Fine.
You want to be in denial? Go ahead.

39:08.184 --> 39:10.185
You will never see your kids again.

39:10.311 --> 39:11.270
Wait, wait, wait.

39:11.396 --> 39:13.397
Rita, wait, wait.

39:15.775 --> 39:17.901
l fought so hard to win those kids back,

39:18.778 --> 39:19.737
especially Astor.

39:19.863 --> 39:22.781
lf they see me here like this,
l'm gonna lose them forever.

39:22.907 --> 39:27.327
Paul, the one good thing that
came out of our marriage are those kids.

39:27.454 --> 39:30.122
And l know you love them.

39:30.248 --> 39:33.709
But if you want to have
any kind of real relationship with them,

39:33.835 --> 39:35.878
it has to be with the father they have,

39:36.963 --> 39:39.089
not the father they wish they had.

39:39.215 --> 39:41.300
Now, you cheated on me.

39:41.426 --> 39:43.761
You broke my heart, you broke my bones,

39:43.887 --> 39:47.514
and l took it so those kids wouldn't have to.

39:47.640 --> 39:51.518
But l am giving you the chance
to make it all right.

39:51.644 --> 39:54.605
Not for me, but for them.

39:54.731 --> 39:58.525
l wouldn't know what to say.

39:59.778 --> 40:04.406
Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.

40:04.532 --> 40:06.784
lt's a valuable lesson.

40:06.910 --> 40:08.410
lt's one you never got.

40:12.373 --> 40:14.416
So what's it gonna be?

40:20.215 --> 40:21.465
OK.

40:23.426 --> 40:25.469
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

40:25.595 --> 40:26.804
Hey!

40:39.109 --> 40:41.276
All right. This won't take long.

40:41.402 --> 40:44.988
There was a drop of blood
on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours,

40:45.115 --> 40:47.533
so l need to check the back of your head.

40:47.659 --> 40:50.119
As long as it's only my head
you're checking back there.

40:53.248 --> 40:54.581
How're things with Rita?

40:57.085 --> 41:00.379
Not so good. actually.
We kind of. . .had words.

41:00.505 --> 41:03.257
- l think l really upset her.
- Oh, that's rough, man.

41:04.717 --> 41:07.553
Maybe l'm not the person for her.
Some people are meant to be alone.

41:07.679 --> 41:11.223
- Right?
- Dex, socio, alone sucks.

41:12.308 --> 41:13.475
Sorry.

41:15.645 --> 41:19.565
These are teeth marks.
You definitely wounded this guy.

41:19.691 --> 41:23.026
Good. l hope l broke his fucking nose. . .

41:23.153 --> 41:24.611
At least l gave him a fat lip.

41:28.575 --> 41:31.618
Angel. have you ever met
Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

41:31.744 --> 41:34.705
Yeah. l went by his office
a couple of days ago.

41:34.831 --> 41:37.166
Nice guy. Why?

41:42.422 --> 41:44.840
At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt
his lip that morning.

41:44.966 --> 41:48.051
He was lying,
and l was too distracted to care.

41:48.178 --> 41:50.220
But he's got my full attention now.

41:59.814 --> 42:01.023
- You here tonight?
- Yeah,

42:01.149 --> 42:03.692
we're tits-deep in the ice-truck killer.
Might be onto something.

42:03.902 --> 42:06.778
- lt will be an all-nighter.
- So that text you got from Rudy

42:06.905 --> 42:09.823
about going away with him,
you're not gonna do that?

42:09.949 --> 42:11.491
Tragically, no.

42:11.618 --> 42:14.244
l was psyched to meet him
at the Miami Beach Marina,

42:14.370 --> 42:16.622
but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.

42:16.748 --> 42:19.833
- Good.
- Good? l'm working on a theory that

42:19.959 --> 42:22.419
Rudy was gonna propose,
now he can't. ls it good?

42:22.545 --> 42:24.588
No, good you're making progress here.

42:24.714 --> 42:26.256
Yeah. We're getting closer.

42:26.382 --> 42:27.341
Fingers crossed.

42:27.467 --> 42:29.760
At least l know my sister
is safe tonight,

42:29.886 --> 42:33.055
which gives me time to check
out my own theory on Rudy.

42:34.724 --> 42:36.934
We defined the area
for the residential search.

42:37.060 --> 42:40.437
Good. So we'll start canvassing tonight.
You take the. . .

42:45.068 --> 42:46.902
That him?

42:47.528 --> 42:48.654
Yeah, how'd you know?

42:48.780 --> 42:51.657
'Cause you got that stupid-ass grin
on your face again.

42:52.742 --> 42:53.867
Go ahead. Answer it.

42:57.413 --> 43:00.666
- Hey.
- Hey, supercop, what's the word?

43:00.792 --> 43:04.127
- l'm kind of in a thing right now.
- Got it. l'll be quick.

43:04.254 --> 43:05.629
You never answered my text.

43:05.755 --> 43:07.631
Do l have the pleasure of your company. . .

43:07.757 --> 43:10.133
- this weekend?
- Uh, yeah, about that. . .

43:10.260 --> 43:12.135
Come on, Deb, it's only two days.

43:12.262 --> 43:15.722
lt's just we've had a major break
in the ice-truck-killer case.

43:15.848 --> 43:19.935
l promise, as soon as we catch
this douchebag,

43:20.061 --> 43:22.229
you and l are gonna spend
a whole week in bed.

43:22.355 --> 43:25.065
You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.

43:25.191 --> 43:27.859
OK, but how about dinner?

43:27.986 --> 43:29.987
Oh, my God, you are persistent.

43:30.113 --> 43:34.658
Well. you got to eat. right?
So why not eat dinner with me. . .

43:34.784 --> 43:36.827
on this yacht l'm on?

43:36.953 --> 43:39.329
- Where the hell did you get a yacht?
- l rented it.

43:40.373 --> 43:45.168
l thought we'd have a nice couple days
together, but we could still have a nice night.

43:45.295 --> 43:47.629
And there is that thing
we need to talk about.

43:49.632 --> 43:52.009
OK, well, maybe l can take
an hour for dinner.

43:52.135 --> 43:55.595
- l can work with an hour.
- l mean, a real hour, not one of your

43:55.722 --> 44:00.142
"Let's stretch this out till two a.m..
you might as well stay and have sex" hours.

44:02.145 --> 44:03.020
Right.

44:03.146 --> 44:05.439
Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.

44:05.565 --> 44:09.401
All right, l'll get out of here as fast as l can.
l'll see you soon.

44:17.410 --> 44:19.870
Thinking Rudy attacked Batista
doesn't make sense.

44:19.996 --> 44:21.204
He's a loving boyfriend.

44:21.331 --> 44:24.207
He spends his life helping people in need.

44:24.334 --> 44:25.917
He brought me steaks.

44:27.587 --> 44:29.504
Well, that's just rude.

44:29.922 --> 44:31.381
Why would loving and helpful Rudy

44:31.507 --> 44:33.550
need an industrial-grade lock. . .

44:34.761 --> 44:37.012
and a security camera?

44:38.139 --> 44:40.682
How do l get his DNA now?

44:59.702 --> 45:04.915
At times like this, l wish the truth was
more easily accessible. and less...

45:05.541 --> 45:06.792


45:08.461 --> 45:10.879
But Harry taught me to trust my gut.

45:11.005 --> 45:13.799
"People lie all the time," he said.

45:13.925 --> 45:16.176
"But your instinct will never fail Dexter."

45:18.888 --> 45:21.056
Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?

45:30.358 --> 45:31.733
Fuck me!

45:32.693 --> 45:35.570
l believe your rule specifically prohibits
such action.

45:41.911 --> 45:46.498
- Did you do all this?
- ln fact, l did.

45:46.624 --> 45:49.501
- You like?
- l like.

45:50.753 --> 45:53.505
l like so much that it makes
what l have to tell you harder.

45:53.631 --> 45:56.967
- Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.
- l'm sorry. l hit traffic.

45:57.093 --> 46:01.054
lt took me 30 minutes to get here.
l have to turn around and go right back.

46:02.223 --> 46:03.014
Oh, my God.

46:03.141 --> 46:07.185
- Hold on. Hold on! Wait.
- Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.

46:07.311 --> 46:11.815
l wanted to wait until we were
out in the water, but. . .here goes.

46:13.818 --> 46:16.027
l know this seems fast. . .

46:16.154 --> 46:17.612
but l feel. . .

46:18.531 --> 46:24.035
l feel that l waited my whole entire life
for Dexter. And now that you're here,

46:24.162 --> 46:26.538
l don't want you to leave.

46:28.249 --> 46:29.624
Debra Morgan. . .

46:30.418 --> 46:31.543
will you marry me?

46:33.171 --> 46:34.504
l knew it! l fucking knew it!

46:34.630 --> 46:36.506
ls that your version of a "yes"?

46:36.632 --> 46:39.176
Yes, yes, yes, yes, but. . .

46:39.302 --> 46:41.052
No, no, no! Stop at "yes."

46:41.179 --> 46:45.724
- l like that part.
- Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?

46:45.850 --> 46:48.351
Let me savor this.
l want to be with Dexter.

46:48.478 --> 46:49.853
l want to enjoy it, you know?

46:49.979 --> 46:53.440
- So it's a "yes," but. . .
- OK, l get it.

46:53.566 --> 46:55.692
- You do?
- Not really, but l can work with it.

46:55.818 --> 46:57.903
Good, good.

46:58.070 --> 47:03.700
- Oh, God, l can still wear the ring, right?
- Yes. but...there's a condition.

47:04.869 --> 47:07.037
l know you have to go to work, but. . .

47:07.163 --> 47:09.956
if you're gonna wear the ring,
we need to celebrate.

47:10.082 --> 47:12.542
One glass of champagne, that's all l ask.

47:12.668 --> 47:14.211
- Rudy. l...
- l mean it.

47:14.337 --> 47:17.422
You can't leave your sort-of fiance
on a yacht with a cold meal

47:17.548 --> 47:20.050
and an unopened bottle of champagne,
it's cruel.

47:20.176 --> 47:24.638
Just one glass of champagne. . .
to celebrate.

47:24.764 --> 47:28.725
And then you can go back,
save Miami from the ice-truck killer.

47:29.602 --> 47:31.353
l can live with that.

47:37.193 --> 47:40.529
l need these two tested against
each other. lt's kind of a rush.

47:42.031 --> 47:43.406
Excuse me, hi.

47:46.160 --> 47:48.954
Hey, these two - tested against
each other right now.

47:49.080 --> 47:50.372
OK.

47:55.628 --> 47:58.755
- lt's Deb. Do it.
- Hey, l know you're working,

47:58.881 --> 48:00.757
but let me know when you come up for air.

48:00.883 --> 48:03.927
l need to talk to Dexter. l'm in the building.

48:10.393 --> 48:12.519
This yacht's amazing.

48:12.645 --> 48:14.813
l didn't know you went for stuff like this.

48:14.939 --> 48:17.482
Oh, you have a lot to learn about me.

48:17.608 --> 48:19.609
- Was that the phone ringing?
- Yeah.

48:19.735 --> 48:23.321
Big brother. l let it go to voice mail.
He can wait till we're done here.

48:23.447 --> 48:26.241
Good. l want you all to myself.

48:27.368 --> 48:28.618
So. . .

48:28.744 --> 48:30.579
let the toasting begin.

48:30.705 --> 48:32.289
To. . .

48:32.415 --> 48:33.665
what comes next.

48:41.382 --> 48:42.757
You're not drinking.

48:49.098 --> 48:50.974
Tastes like menthol,

48:51.100 --> 48:53.810
which, it turns out, is not that sexy.

48:59.442 --> 49:02.277
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

49:04.530 --> 49:07.365
Just bad memories.

49:07.491 --> 49:09.868
Oh. That's right.

49:09.994 --> 49:11.161
That was the. . .

49:11.287 --> 49:15.123
the one clue
the ice-truck killer left behind, right?

49:15.750 --> 49:16.750
Right.

49:18.794 --> 49:21.379
Wait. How did you know that?

49:21.505 --> 49:23.006
l don't often make mistakes,

49:23.132 --> 49:26.134
but when l do, they haunt me.

49:27.928 --> 49:29.471
Hilarious.

49:31.390 --> 49:33.350
Your champagne's gonna get warm.

49:33.476 --> 49:37.020
You know the one thing
l've been dying to ask you?

49:37.146 --> 49:38.980
How did you not know who l was?

49:40.816 --> 49:42.317
You're a cop.

49:45.571 --> 49:46.655
This isn't funny.

49:47.615 --> 49:52.160
l think a real cop would at least have
a sense that she was in the presence

49:52.286 --> 49:55.497
of the person she was hunting, right?

49:55.623 --> 49:57.332
You're hurting me!

49:58.542 --> 50:01.836
l didn't show you the best part of my loft.
Built it myself.

50:03.422 --> 50:04.631
Stop it!

50:04.757 --> 50:06.883
My refrigerated room.

50:08.719 --> 50:10.553
Oh, God, why are you doing this?

50:10.680 --> 50:13.306
The tricky part was getting you on the boat.

50:14.016 --> 50:16.726
The other women l could just pay.

50:16.852 --> 50:18.186
But at the end. . .

50:19.105 --> 50:20.105
you made it easy.

50:22.274 --> 50:24.359
So desperate to fall in love.

50:27.947 --> 50:29.698
Stop.

50:43.629 --> 50:46.214
Dude, you got to see this.

50:46.340 --> 50:48.425
The autopsy on our Santa's Cottage victim?

50:48.551 --> 50:50.135
Check it out.

50:50.261 --> 50:53.138
One arm was shorter than the other.

50:53.264 --> 50:54.514
So that got me thinking.

50:54.640 --> 50:57.892
l mean, our guy isn't sloppy. He's precise.

50:58.018 --> 50:59.310
Not now, Vince.

50:59.437 --> 51:02.772
Her left wrist was
two inches shorter than her right.

51:02.898 --> 51:05.900
l mean, why cut off more
on the left side than the right?

51:07.278 --> 51:08.945
Because our girl. . .

51:09.071 --> 51:10.905
our girl was a fucking amputee.

51:13.033 --> 51:15.285
l looked up her medical records.

51:15.411 --> 51:16.619
She had a fake left hand.

51:16.746 --> 51:18.329
That's why we couldn't find it.

51:18.456 --> 51:20.582
The killer cut off that extra piece of wrist

51:20.708 --> 51:24.335
- . .so that we wouldn't see the stump.
- Let me see that.

51:24.462 --> 51:27.672
That night Batista was stabbed,
he was following up on a lead

51:27.798 --> 51:31.134
he got from a one-handed call girl.
Guess what the lead was about.

51:33.220 --> 51:35.138
The ice-truck killer.

51:41.353 --> 51:42.353
You sure?

51:42.480 --> 51:45.023
Positive. The samples
you gave me were a match.

51:45.149 --> 51:46.775
They were from the same person.

51:50.070 --> 51:52.197
Hey, you all right?

52:00.498 --> 52:01.998
Where's my sister?

52:02.124 --> 52:04.209
Took her Code 1 2. Left about an hour ago.

52:04.335 --> 52:07.462
She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

52:07.588 --> 52:09.214
Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.

52:09.340 --> 52:12.258
l need you to raise Officer
Debra Morgan on her radio.

52:17.097 --> 52:20.350
Sorry, sir. She's been out of range
for the last half-hour.

52:23.562 --> 52:25.104
lt's Deb. Do it.

52:25.231 --> 52:27.482
Where the fuck are you?
l'm here at work, you're not.

52:27.608 --> 52:28.608
l need to talk to Dexter.

52:28.734 --> 52:31.861
Do not see Rudy until you find me.

52:31.987 --> 52:34.113
Call me when you get this.
