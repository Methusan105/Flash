WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:03.716
Previously on Dexter. . .

00:03.842 --> 00:06.427
l got here as fast as l could.
What are we looking at?

00:06.553 --> 00:08.429
Female victim cut up into pieces.

00:08.555 --> 00:10.098
The ice-truck killer? So soon?

00:12.810 --> 00:15.395
This is what he wanted me to find all along.

00:18.607 --> 00:20.358
Laura Moser. . .

00:21.318 --> 00:22.235
My mother.

00:22.361 --> 00:25.113
Laura Moser and three others
found chopped up with a chainsaw.

00:25.239 --> 00:27.990
Your father was a decent man
and an honest cop,

00:28.117 --> 00:30.535
but what he saw in that
cargo container changed him.

00:36.041 --> 00:38.084
You think it's the attacker's blood?

00:38.210 --> 00:39.627
We know Batista fought back.

00:39.753 --> 00:42.130
The samples were a match.
They're from the same person.

00:42.256 --> 00:44.882
so if you or that bitch
try to screw with what's mine,

00:45.008 --> 00:47.135
l swear to God.
l don't care who l have to hurt.

00:48.053 --> 00:51.139
Let's face it. Paul.
You've been a problem.

00:54.059 --> 00:56.394
l need you to explain
to them why you're here.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.439
l have no fucking idea
why l'm in this place.

00:59.565 --> 01:01.232
You really don't want to do this.

01:01.358 --> 01:04.152
Effective immediately,
you will no longer serve as my Lieutenant.

01:04.278 --> 01:06.112
This isn't fucking over, Tom!

01:06.238 --> 01:08.114
Debra Morgan. . .

01:08.240 --> 01:10.116
will you marry me?

01:10.242 --> 01:11.576
Yes, yes, yes.

01:12.911 --> 01:14.245
Where's my sister?

01:14.371 --> 01:16.831
Took her Code 1 2.
Left about an hour ago.

01:16.957 --> 01:19.125
She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

01:20.169 --> 01:21.586
You made it easy.

01:23.130 --> 01:25.256
So desperate to fall in love.

01:27.050 --> 01:28.384
Where the fuck are you?

01:28.510 --> 01:30.803
l'm at work and you're not.
l need to talk to Dexter.

01:30.929 --> 01:33.347
Do not see Rudy until you find me.

03:40.893 --> 03:43.728
l've lived in darkness a long time.

03:43.854 --> 03:45.771
Over the years, my eyes adjusted

03:45.898 --> 03:49.066
until the dark became my world
and l could see.

03:54.489 --> 03:57.199
But then Rudy turned on the light.

03:57.326 --> 04:00.077
He flooded my memory, and now l'm blind.

04:04.124 --> 04:06.125
l don't have much time.

04:06.251 --> 04:09.378
To be more accurate,
my sister doesn't have much time.

04:09.504 --> 04:12.298
He wants me to find him,
but where do l look?

04:12.424 --> 04:15.426
l can't think. lt's too bright.

04:20.098 --> 04:21.807
Let me know if the tape's too tight.

04:21.934 --> 04:23.225
There's no need for you to be uncomfortable.

04:23.769 --> 04:26.187
Why are you doing this?

04:26.313 --> 04:27.980
Who am l to spoil the surprise?

04:31.109 --> 04:32.568
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

04:32.694 --> 04:34.070
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

04:34.947 --> 04:37.239
l'm just checking the supplies, OK?

04:37.366 --> 04:39.617
Things are moving faster
than l had planned.

04:41.078 --> 04:43.537
- This isn't Dexter.
- Pretty sure it is.

04:43.664 --> 04:45.498
No.

04:45.624 --> 04:48.376
l know there's more. l've seen it.

04:51.964 --> 04:54.131
l never wanted to hurt Dexter.

04:55.092 --> 04:57.468
l know. l know.

05:00.263 --> 05:02.765
Does this make it easier for you?
'Cause l can keep going.

05:02.891 --> 05:04.600
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

05:07.813 --> 05:09.438
Oh, Jesus Christ!

05:09.564 --> 05:11.857
There's nothing to be ashamed of, Deb.

05:11.984 --> 05:13.734
You're not the only one who bought it.

05:13.860 --> 05:17.613
Your name isn't even fucking
Rudy Cooper. is it?

05:17.739 --> 05:21.701
- Nope. But he died for a good cause.
- Yeah, well, so will Dexter.

05:23.286 --> 05:25.496
You kidnapped a cop this time, you know?

05:25.622 --> 05:28.582
Not some invisible hooker.
You kidnapped a cop.

05:28.709 --> 05:31.085
lt's all part of the plan.

05:32.087 --> 05:33.879
Jesus.

05:34.006 --> 05:37.049
lt's hard to believe
it's almost come to fruition.

05:37.175 --> 05:40.386
l mean, this is a lot of years
in the making.

05:41.638 --> 05:42.847
We're only hours away.

05:44.725 --> 05:45.850
He wouldn't have taken Deb

05:45.976 --> 05:48.769
unless he left me everything
a clever monster would need

05:48.895 --> 05:50.438
in order to find them.

06:41.031 --> 06:43.324
Seems l have a new screen saver.

06:43.450 --> 06:47.995
l knew he wouldn't leave me stranded,
but Born Free?

06:54.795 --> 06:56.087
Of course.

06:57.005 --> 07:00.591
Thanks to Rudy. now l know
where dearly disturbed Dexter was born.

07:06.431 --> 07:09.767
Born free of all that's human.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.269
That's where l'll find him.

07:44.761 --> 07:45.803
She knows.

07:46.388 --> 07:49.181
She knows. She knows.

07:49.307 --> 07:54.145
She knows. She knows.
She knows. She knows.

07:54.271 --> 07:55.312
She knows. She knows.

07:55.438 --> 07:56.856
All fucking night with that.

07:56.982 --> 07:58.607
She knows.

08:00.443 --> 08:02.027
Listen, we need your help.

08:02.154 --> 08:03.445
Masuka says you were following up a lead

08:03.572 --> 08:04.864
on the ice-truck killer
when you were attacked.

08:04.990 --> 08:06.824
A hooker with a prosthetic hand.

08:06.950 --> 08:09.994
John painted her nails different colors,
but it didn't go nowhere.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.997
Except she was just cut up
by the ice-truck killer.

08:13.123 --> 08:15.749
Holy shit. Monique was a victim?

08:16.793 --> 08:20.504
We're operating on the theory
that he found out you were on his trail.

08:20.630 --> 08:23.507
lf we're right. that means
you got stabbed for a reason.

08:23.633 --> 08:26.218
No one knew what l was doing
except Masuka.

08:26.344 --> 08:29.180
Someone else had to know. Think.

08:29.306 --> 08:33.017
l consulted with Rudy, Debra's boyfriend,
the prosthetics guy.

08:35.562 --> 08:37.062
But that's crazy, right?

08:37.189 --> 08:39.106
she's been AWOL
since she went to meet him.

08:39.232 --> 08:40.816
She was supposed to come back
and help me canvass,

08:40.942 --> 08:42.193
but she never made it.

08:42.319 --> 08:44.612
That's not like her. Angel, we got to go.

08:44.738 --> 08:46.197
Go. Just go.

08:59.085 --> 09:02.421
There are about 5,000 cargo containers
in the port of Miami.

09:02.547 --> 09:05.799
Finding the one where my mother
was butchered took a bit of magic.

09:05.926 --> 09:07.718
Presto.

09:21.733 --> 09:23.400
Shit.

09:24.027 --> 09:25.402
Just a second!

09:36.706 --> 09:37.915
l told you he was here.

09:38.041 --> 09:41.210
There some reason you're not
answering your damn phone?

09:41.336 --> 09:42.461
Ambien.

09:44.547 --> 09:46.548
What happened here, Dexter?

09:46.675 --> 09:48.634
l couldn't find the remote.

09:49.344 --> 09:51.470
Where's your sister?
She didn't come to work,

09:51.596 --> 09:53.138
and she's not at her apartment.

09:53.265 --> 09:55.307
l honestly don't know, Sergeant.

09:55.433 --> 09:59.979
Dexter, we think her boyfriend
is connected to the ice-truck killer.

10:00.105 --> 10:03.148
We're working on getting
a search warrant to search his home.

10:03.275 --> 10:05.651
Oh, my. No, wow.

10:05.777 --> 10:07.152
Cut the crap.

10:07.279 --> 10:09.488
- You know something. What?
- James.

10:09.614 --> 10:14.493
l saw him last night, skulking in the lab,
ordering secret blood tests.

10:15.787 --> 10:17.288
What kind of tests?

10:18.707 --> 10:22.126
l was looking for a match
on the blood on Batista's collar.

10:22.252 --> 10:23.294
And whose was it?

10:26.631 --> 10:27.589
Rudy's.

10:27.716 --> 10:28.841
Motherfucker.

10:28.967 --> 10:30.134
Knock it off!

10:30.260 --> 10:31.302
He knew all along!

10:31.428 --> 10:35.139
Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.
Angel headbutted his attacker in the face.

10:35.265 --> 10:37.349
- lt was just a hunch.
- Why didn't you tell us?

10:37.475 --> 10:39.810
l couldn't destroy
Deb's love life on a hunch.

10:39.936 --> 10:41.061
l had to get the facts.

10:41.187 --> 10:43.022
Here are the facts. lf he kills her, it's your fault.

10:43.148 --> 10:45.065
What else do you know?

10:45.191 --> 10:46.859
That's it.

10:46.985 --> 10:48.319
He's lying.

10:48.445 --> 10:51.196
Give him a break, James.
lt's his sister, all right?

10:52.449 --> 10:54.366
lf he knows what's good for her,
he'll stay home

10:54.492 --> 10:56.827
and answer the fucking phone when it rings.

11:03.918 --> 11:06.211
Call if you hear anything.

11:17.807 --> 11:18.724
Hello?

11:18.850 --> 11:20.059
Please don't hang up.

11:20.185 --> 11:21.310
Paul?

11:21.436 --> 11:23.604
The kids don't want to talk to you, OK?

11:23.730 --> 11:25.022
Give them more time.

11:25.148 --> 11:28.108
This isn't about them.
lt's about how l was arrested.

11:28.234 --> 11:29.818
Yeah, with a needle in your arm.

11:29.944 --> 11:31.070
l know all about it.

11:31.196 --> 11:32.738
Well, l don't.

11:32.864 --> 11:35.240
l take responsibility for all the shit l pull,

11:35.367 --> 11:37.576
but Rita, l was in the program.

11:37.702 --> 11:39.078
l kicked the hard stuff.

11:39.204 --> 11:40.454
Well, apparently not.

11:40.580 --> 11:43.415
l was clean. l swear on my kids' lives.

11:43.541 --> 11:45.084
lt's been driving me nuts.

11:45.210 --> 11:48.504
How l got from your house one minute
to the motel room the next.

11:48.630 --> 11:50.589
completely out of my mind on junk.

11:50.715 --> 11:53.467
- lt's called a blackout.
- lt's called a set-up.

11:53.593 --> 11:55.469
Last thing l remember,

11:55.595 --> 11:58.013
was standing
in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.

11:58.139 --> 11:59.556
Maybe he smacked me on the head

11:59.682 --> 12:02.518
and dragged me out of the house,
through the backyard.

12:02.644 --> 12:03.894
You're a piece of work.

12:04.020 --> 12:06.730
l'm telling Dexter.
Dexter is not who you think he is.

12:09.150 --> 12:10.234
Hello?

12:13.029 --> 12:15.406
Make sure it's distributed to everyone, OK?

12:15.532 --> 12:18.242
OK, his name is Rudy Cooper.

12:18.368 --> 12:21.870
Some of you may have met him.
He was dating Officer Morgan.

12:21.996 --> 12:23.997
She was last seen 1 6 hours ago,

12:24.124 --> 12:26.834
driving to meet him
at the Miami Beach marina.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.710
We need to canvass the entire area.

12:28.837 --> 12:31.171
Check boat rentals. You guys know the drill.

12:31.297 --> 12:34.299
l've sent a team
to his prosthetics lab at the hospital.

12:34.426 --> 12:37.052
The judge just signed off on
the warrant for Cooper's apartment.

12:37.178 --> 12:38.262
Let's tear that place apart.

12:39.013 --> 12:41.348
Jake, Sergio, Kim, you guys are with me.

12:41.474 --> 12:42.975
Your attention, please.

12:43.101 --> 12:46.895
l want to introduce you to
our new lieutenant, Esme Pascal.

12:47.021 --> 12:50.357
She agreed to put her vacation on hold,

12:50.483 --> 12:53.152
to provide us with much-needed leadership
at this critical time.

12:53.278 --> 12:55.487
Lieutenant, you're on.

12:56.990 --> 13:00.159
l understand we have a new suspect
in the ice-truck killer case.

13:00.285 --> 13:02.494
We're on our way over now
to search his place.

13:02.620 --> 13:04.329
And you are. . .

13:04.456 --> 13:06.331
Maria LaGuerta.

13:06.458 --> 13:08.709
An officer is missing.
so we need to move fast.

13:08.835 --> 13:11.128
l thought that Sergeant Doakes
was running that investigation.

13:11.254 --> 13:13.046
- He's out following a lead.
- What lead?

13:13.173 --> 13:15.924
He said he'd let me know
if it came to anything.

13:16.050 --> 13:19.052
l'll take it over from here. Thank you, Maria.

13:19.179 --> 13:21.346
Who can get me up to speed on the way over?

13:21.473 --> 13:23.515
l can, l guess.

13:23.641 --> 13:25.184
You're driving.

13:25.310 --> 13:28.645
Feel free to join us
when you locate your partner.

13:29.439 --> 13:31.273
Would you like to come with us, Captain?

13:31.399 --> 13:34.026
You seem to have everything under control.

13:34.152 --> 13:35.819
Let's go, people.

13:54.422 --> 13:57.174
lt's in there somewhere, my birthplace.

13:58.676 --> 14:00.677
Now what?

14:02.347 --> 14:05.307
No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.

14:05.433 --> 14:10.437
With billions spent on homeland security,
it can't be as easy as a couple of snips.

14:16.152 --> 14:18.695
So much for the war on terror.

14:43.388 --> 14:47.432
Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when
every straw is computerized.

14:58.236 --> 15:01.446
Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.

15:06.327 --> 15:08.287
l don't like this place.

15:08.413 --> 15:10.914
Something nameless was born here. . .

15:12.166 --> 15:14.668
Something that lives
in the deepest, darkest hole

15:14.794 --> 15:16.420
of the thing called Dexter.

15:31.352 --> 15:33.562
Get in there!

15:33.688 --> 15:35.606
Somebody else, get in there now!

15:36.441 --> 15:39.067
lt's all right, little guy. You're safe now.

15:39.944 --> 15:42.779
Nothing will hurt Dexter. l promise.

16:14.937 --> 16:17.606
OK, Deb. . .

16:17.732 --> 16:19.191
Don't be dead.

16:23.738 --> 16:25.489
Shit.

16:26.532 --> 16:28.700
Surprise, motherfucker.

16:30.244 --> 16:33.205
- Are you following me now?
- You better have a reason for being here.

16:33.331 --> 16:35.332
- l'm looking for my sister.
- ln a cargo box?

16:36.125 --> 16:37.626
Yeah, l'm kind of working on a theory.

16:37.752 --> 16:39.836
You forget you work for the cops?
We love theories.

16:39.962 --> 16:41.546
Spin me a story, asshole.

16:41.673 --> 16:44.883
- What l do on my time is my business.
- Me too, and l'm on my time now.

16:45.009 --> 16:48.720
There's no lieutenant here to save your ass, so
don't fuck with me. Morgan!

16:48.846 --> 16:51.306
All right, you got me.

16:51.432 --> 16:55.769
l ordered some furniture from Thailand.
l was waiting for it to be delivered.

17:02.944 --> 17:04.486
Lab geek my ass.

17:06.739 --> 17:08.073
What the hell's going on?

17:08.199 --> 17:10.617
Security, l need somebody
down here right now.

17:10.743 --> 17:11.743
Miami Metro PD.

17:11.869 --> 17:13.078
ls this guy under arrest?

17:13.204 --> 17:15.539
That's a good question.

17:15.665 --> 17:19.084
You're connected to this.
l don't know how, but l'm gonna find out,

17:19.210 --> 17:21.044
and what l find is gonna stick to Dexter.

17:41.023 --> 17:43.483
Let me out of here, asshole!

17:43.609 --> 17:46.153
Let me out! Let me out!

17:46.279 --> 17:48.530
Let me out, you piece of shit!

17:48.656 --> 17:51.408
Let me out of here, you fucker!

17:55.788 --> 17:57.122
Fuck! Let me out!

17:58.499 --> 18:01.334
Sorry, but you were drowning out Fred's radio,

18:01.461 --> 18:03.628
and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels.

18:03.755 --> 18:05.297
Don't do it!

18:07.091 --> 18:08.091
Bye!

18:20.313 --> 18:24.149
His happy place.
where he kills more than time.

18:24.275 --> 18:26.610
This is where he'd leave me a clue.

19:11.864 --> 19:14.074
Dexter, better bundle up.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.367
l like the cold.

19:15.493 --> 19:18.036
You know, hypothermia
can easily sneak up on Dexter.

19:18.162 --> 19:20.038
So can hypochondria.

19:20.164 --> 19:22.707
A home like this
would take years to put together.

19:22.834 --> 19:25.001
He must have hated leaving it behind.

19:25.127 --> 19:26.419
What are you looking for?

19:26.546 --> 19:28.630
A clue. A signature or a calling card.

19:28.756 --> 19:31.591
Anything that might give us
a sense of where he went.

19:31.717 --> 19:34.261
l don't think he was
thinking about us when he did this.

19:34.387 --> 19:36.388
l mean, look at this place.

19:36.514 --> 19:40.058
You were right about the victim.
He rushed his work.

19:40.184 --> 19:43.562
He killed that girl to keep us
busy so he could escape,

19:43.688 --> 19:45.355
but he wouldn't go without
leaving a message.

19:45.481 --> 19:46.898
We just need to find it.

19:49.068 --> 19:50.151
Check this out.

19:50.278 --> 19:52.362
This is where he played with his meat.

19:55.199 --> 19:56.449
Pretty whacked out.

19:56.576 --> 19:59.411
l can think of 1 01 uses for this table.

19:59.537 --> 20:01.079
Know what l mean?

20:01.205 --> 20:03.665
He has my sister, Vince.

20:03.791 --> 20:06.543
Right. l didn't mean. . . l'm sorry.

20:07.712 --> 20:08.587
Shit.

20:08.713 --> 20:10.422
You're Karen, right?

20:10.548 --> 20:11.506
That's right.

20:11.632 --> 20:14.509
You're in charge of evidence.
This entire room. evidence.

20:14.635 --> 20:17.596
Take photos of every item
in its original position.

20:17.722 --> 20:20.056
Show me the inventory list
when you're done.

20:23.519 --> 20:25.437
ls he in charge?

20:25.563 --> 20:27.022
Guess he is now.

20:33.404 --> 20:35.780
Hi. l'm Bob Hicks.

20:36.949 --> 20:37.866
Can l help you?

20:37.992 --> 20:40.160
l guess Paul never mentioned me.

20:40.286 --> 20:42.621
l'm his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.

20:44.081 --> 20:44.956
Right.

20:45.082 --> 20:47.959
So, having your sponsor do your dirty work,

20:48.085 --> 20:50.879
which step is that?

20:51.005 --> 20:52.756
He's just concerned for the kids.

20:52.882 --> 20:55.383
No, he's concerned for himself. Excuse me. . .

20:55.509 --> 20:59.054
l thought he was lying, too,
until l saw the proof.

20:59.180 --> 21:00.180
What proof?

21:00.306 --> 21:03.808
Well, the X-rays the prison
doctor took of Paul's head.

21:03.935 --> 21:05.560
They showed a skull fracture.

21:05.686 --> 21:07.812
Yeah, which l deservedly gave him.

21:07.939 --> 21:10.023
No. You didn't.

21:10.149 --> 21:14.653
After you struck him,
the hospital took X-rays, no fracture.

21:14.779 --> 21:16.780
But in prison, a fracture.

21:16.906 --> 21:20.158
lf you know Paul,
he'd bash his head against the wall

21:20.284 --> 21:21.493
to get what he wants.

21:21.619 --> 21:24.579
l do know Paul. l think l know him pretty well.

21:24.705 --> 21:27.165
No, listen, if Paul was attacked,

21:27.291 --> 21:30.168
the way that it happened.
that takes expertise, skill.

21:30.294 --> 21:32.420
No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

21:32.546 --> 21:35.632
Which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

21:35.758 --> 21:38.385
Dexter spends all his time
in a laboratory, for God's sake.

21:38.511 --> 21:40.470
So you've been there?

21:43.641 --> 21:45.725
You seem like a nice man,

21:45.851 --> 21:49.187
but this is none of your goddamn business.

21:49.313 --> 21:51.231
OK. Got it.

21:51.357 --> 21:53.191
We traced the social of Rudy Cooper

21:53.317 --> 21:56.403
to a New Jersey plumber
who mysteriously died in '98.

21:56.529 --> 21:57.570
You got to be kidding.

21:57.697 --> 22:00.031
We still don't have an lD on this guy?

22:00.157 --> 22:01.449
Rudy isn't his real name?

22:01.575 --> 22:04.411
- You trying to be smart?
- Not trying. no.

22:04.537 --> 22:05.745
lf you know his name. . .

22:05.871 --> 22:09.666
Whatever it is going on
between you two, it ends now.

22:14.463 --> 22:16.214
What did you find in there?

22:16.340 --> 22:18.800
Other than the obvious,
a lot of trace bloodstains.

22:18.926 --> 22:20.885
lt's probably where he killed them all.

22:21.012 --> 22:23.179
l'd like to look at the rest of the apartment.

22:23.305 --> 22:24.889
Yeah, OK.

22:37.111 --> 22:39.571
- You mind if l. . .
- Be my guest.

22:43.617 --> 22:45.994
lt's perfect. Right out in the open.

22:47.246 --> 22:49.205
At least he's consistent.

22:50.875 --> 22:52.459
Was there anything else near this?

22:52.585 --> 22:55.086
Yeah, a fucking doll sitting on top.

22:57.631 --> 22:59.257
"Home sweet home."

22:59.383 --> 23:04.429
ls he taking me back before the blood,
to a place where a boy was born?

23:04.555 --> 23:07.557
Home sweet home, but which home?

23:21.322 --> 23:23.448
Down on the floor, please.

23:28.412 --> 23:30.955
lt's kind of foolish, Deb.

23:40.132 --> 23:41.841
l don't usually work this way.

23:41.967 --> 23:46.262
Call it an homage to a fellow
traveler l greatly admire.

23:56.273 --> 23:57.816
Laura Moser.

23:57.942 --> 24:00.735
Addict, dealer.

24:00.861 --> 24:02.904
My mother.

24:03.030 --> 24:04.823
Arrested in '69, again in '71 .

24:04.949 --> 24:07.283
Same address listed both times.

24:07.409 --> 24:10.787
1 235 Mangrove Drive.

24:11.288 --> 24:13.832
They say home is where the heart is.

24:13.958 --> 24:16.292
Maybe this is where l left mine.

24:17.461 --> 24:19.754
Surprise.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.048
What are you doing here?

24:22.174 --> 24:24.342
White-chocolate mocha. Your favorite.

24:24.468 --> 24:26.469
l'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

24:26.595 --> 24:29.597
l've never even been here before.
l'd love a tour sometime.

24:29.723 --> 24:31.266
Sometime that's not now.

24:31.392 --> 24:33.184
Dexter, what's going on?

24:33.310 --> 24:35.019
lt's Deb, OK? She's in trouble.

24:35.146 --> 24:36.813
God. ls it serious?

24:36.939 --> 24:38.731
Yeah, actually, it's very serious,

24:38.858 --> 24:41.818
but l just can't worry
about you, too, right now.

24:49.827 --> 24:51.536
She knows.

24:51.662 --> 24:54.205
The notorious ice-truck killer,

24:54.331 --> 24:56.374
whose been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

24:56.500 --> 25:00.587
Authorities say their big break came
when they found a video of his latest victim.

25:00.713 --> 25:03.381
lf she knows, you yapping
about it ain't gonna change it.

25:03.507 --> 25:07.552
The suspect is operating
under an alias, "Rudy Cooper."

25:07.678 --> 25:09.888
We didn't have his fingerprints
in our database.

25:10.014 --> 25:12.724
so his identity is still unclear to us.

25:12.850 --> 25:14.058
She knows.

25:14.185 --> 25:15.977
So sorry, Mr. Batista.

25:16.103 --> 25:18.605
We had to take the psych
overflow from County,

25:18.731 --> 25:20.064
but this one's harmless.

25:20.191 --> 25:21.566
Don't be so sure.

25:21.692 --> 25:23.401
We never take the violent ones.

25:23.527 --> 25:25.778
They have the arsonists, the rapists,

25:25.905 --> 25:27.906
the psycho killers over there.

25:28.032 --> 25:30.700
l tell you, those people belong in prison.

25:33.537 --> 25:35.955
Do they fingerprint
psych patients at County?

25:36.081 --> 25:37.165
Yes, of course.

25:37.291 --> 25:39.167
Half of them don't know their own names.

25:39.293 --> 25:40.752
Got to lD them somehow.

25:40.878 --> 25:43.880
That should take care of him.
Enjoy the peace and quiet.

25:56.602 --> 25:57.602
lD Tech.

25:57.728 --> 26:00.188
lt's Batista. Can you do me a favor?

26:00.314 --> 26:03.024
l need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints

26:03.150 --> 26:05.443
against psych, mental, and institution records.

26:53.158 --> 26:55.827
Where are you, you silly little bear?

26:55.953 --> 26:58.955
l'm going to find you!

27:00.291 --> 27:02.000
Where can you be?

27:02.126 --> 27:04.127
You silly little goose.

27:04.253 --> 27:06.629
l'm gonna find you!

27:07.965 --> 27:10.883
You silly bear. Where is my baby?

27:11.010 --> 27:13.553
Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

27:13.679 --> 27:16.806
- Where's my Dexter?
- Here!

27:16.932 --> 27:18.850
Oh, my goodness, yes!

27:18.976 --> 27:21.019
You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

27:21.145 --> 27:24.022
Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

27:24.148 --> 27:26.399
Bynie's right there.

27:33.907 --> 27:35.116
Hey, Bynie.

27:35.242 --> 27:37.201
You weren't supposed to tell her.

27:37.328 --> 27:39.245
You remember now?

27:43.667 --> 27:45.460
Bynie.

27:45.586 --> 27:48.713
You always had trouble saying Brian.

27:50.716 --> 27:51.966
l have a brother.

27:52.092 --> 27:54.594
A real brother.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.679
None of this foster bullshit.

27:57.348 --> 28:01.225
We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

28:01.352 --> 28:03.561
Watching mom die,

28:03.687 --> 28:06.105
it's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

28:08.025 --> 28:12.195
The chainsaw, the flying body parts,

28:12.321 --> 28:13.529
the blood.

28:29.088 --> 28:30.254
You were there, too.

28:30.381 --> 28:34.550
Two days sitting in blood
before they found us.

28:34.676 --> 28:36.803
but you were young enough to block it out.

28:36.929 --> 28:38.805
l've never forgotten the day that we were. . .

28:38.931 --> 28:40.098
Born.

28:40.224 --> 28:41.557
Exactly.

28:43.060 --> 28:44.936
Where's Deb?

28:45.062 --> 28:47.647
l waited for you before we got started.

28:51.944 --> 28:54.112
- Debra!
- She's not in here.

28:59.493 --> 29:02.453
This is not the way
l envisioned our family reunion.

29:03.956 --> 29:06.749
Come on, let's just sit down
and have a beer.

29:10.295 --> 29:12.422
That was the best wipeout.

29:12.548 --> 29:13.965
You didn't even cry.

29:14.091 --> 29:18.678
Next time you try my skateboard,
bend your knees, OK?

29:21.557 --> 29:24.600
Hi.

29:26.311 --> 29:27.603
Look out!

29:29.481 --> 29:32.108
l didn't want to do it this way.

29:41.118 --> 29:44.912
OK, let's run his description
against lnterpol's fugitive list,

29:45.038 --> 29:46.289
in case he isn't American.

29:46.415 --> 29:49.625
Rudy Cooper? His real name is Brian Moser.

29:49.751 --> 29:51.711
What the hell are you doing here?

29:51.837 --> 29:53.504
l got a hit on his prints

29:53.630 --> 29:56.507
from a Tampa mental hospital
where he grew up.

29:56.633 --> 30:00.761
He was institutionalized for
antisocial personality disorder.

30:00.888 --> 30:04.265
At 21 , they said he was cured.
They released him.

30:04.391 --> 30:08.269
Run the name Brian Moser
for credit cards, bank accounts,

30:08.395 --> 30:11.272
anything that might tell us
where he's got Morgan.

30:11.398 --> 30:13.566
We've triangulated
Officer Morgan's cellphone.

30:13.692 --> 30:16.194
Last known location.
20 miles off the coast,

30:16.320 --> 30:17.904
which means he's got her on a boat.

30:18.030 --> 30:20.990
We have his real name.
We're digging into his records.

30:22.159 --> 30:24.535
His name's not gonna help us
find him in open water.

30:24.661 --> 30:26.704
Coordinated search with the coast guard.

30:26.830 --> 30:28.372
- Waste of time.
- Chain of command.

30:28.499 --> 30:30.708
Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

30:30.834 --> 30:32.502
That signal died last night.

30:32.628 --> 30:36.130
By now, he has most likely taken
her to his final location.

30:36.256 --> 30:37.423
Noted.

30:39.718 --> 30:42.303
Let's get busy, people.

30:47.392 --> 30:50.353
Flyovers look good to the press,
but they won't find Morgan.

30:50.479 --> 30:51.979
You think the press matters to me?

30:52.105 --> 30:54.857
lt matters to Captain Matthews,
and he calls the shots.

30:54.983 --> 30:57.151
l know you need to define yourself here

30:57.277 --> 30:59.403
and putting me in my place
is one way to do that.

30:59.530 --> 31:02.114
but one of our own is missing,

31:02.241 --> 31:04.367
and we shouldn't waste our time
pissing on trees.

31:04.493 --> 31:05.743
l agree.

31:05.869 --> 31:07.954
l can also see why you were reassigned,

31:08.080 --> 31:10.581
and it has nothing to do
with incompetence

31:10.707 --> 31:14.043
and everything to do with
the Captain trying to save his job.

31:14.878 --> 31:15.878
OK.

31:16.004 --> 31:20.216
Now, l was hired with the directive
to not make your life easy.

31:21.969 --> 31:25.054
So you're gonna ignore the lead?

31:27.182 --> 31:29.475
You don't know me very well,

31:29.601 --> 31:34.397
but luckily for Officer Morgan,
neither does the Captain.

31:45.576 --> 31:47.910
Nothing personal.

31:48.495 --> 31:52.290
l just wanted to have a beer
with you before we got started.

31:52.416 --> 31:55.334
You made that kind of difficult.

31:55.460 --> 31:56.752
Sorry.

31:57.838 --> 32:00.756
You don't ever have
to apologize to me, Dexter.

32:00.882 --> 32:04.093
Not for who you are or anything you do.

32:07.931 --> 32:10.391
Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

32:12.352 --> 32:14.395
Who does it belong to?

32:14.521 --> 32:16.314
Me.

32:20.152 --> 32:22.153
l got it for you, actually.

32:25.824 --> 32:28.618
l'm really more an apartment person.

32:30.871 --> 32:33.956
You're trapped in a lie, little brother,

32:34.082 --> 32:37.126
the same lie they tried forcing me into.

32:38.420 --> 32:39.503
They?

32:39.630 --> 32:41.172
You know. . .

32:41.298 --> 32:44.634
Doctors, therapists, group leaders.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.594
What a family they were.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.638
You were never put up for adoption.

32:48.764 --> 32:50.181
Afraid not.

32:50.307 --> 32:54.644
You were three, a little bird with a broken wing.

32:55.646 --> 33:00.483
First cop on the scene, Harry Morgan.

33:00.609 --> 33:03.069
He wanted to make you all better.

33:03.195 --> 33:07.406
But me. . . l could see it in his eyes.

33:07.532 --> 33:09.659
All he saw was a fucked-up kid.

33:10.827 --> 33:12.870
They all did.

33:12.996 --> 33:15.039
So they locked me up.

33:16.041 --> 33:18.042
l didn't even know you existed.

33:18.168 --> 33:19.669
Of course you didn't.

33:21.213 --> 33:24.215
Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

33:24.341 --> 33:28.844
And while you were being raised
by the Morgan family.

33:29.971 --> 33:32.807
l only had the memory of a family.

33:34.935 --> 33:37.311
Me.

33:37.437 --> 33:41.273
Mom always told me to look after Dexter.

33:41.400 --> 33:45.027
lmagine how l felt when l tracked you down

33:45.153 --> 33:47.530
and found out you were exactly like me.

33:48.699 --> 33:52.034
l don't have to imagine.

34:02.462 --> 34:05.214
l know what you've been going
through all these years.

34:05.340 --> 34:07.633
The isolation, the otherness,

34:07.759 --> 34:10.636
a hunger that's never satisfied.

34:10.762 --> 34:13.389
Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

34:13.515 --> 34:16.976
You can be yourself with me.

34:17.728 --> 34:21.272
Your real, genuine self.

34:26.194 --> 34:28.195
Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

34:53.221 --> 34:56.807
l think we're ready for Debra.

35:23.043 --> 35:25.085
l've prepared her just the way you like.

35:26.797 --> 35:29.799
This time, we'll do it together.

35:32.969 --> 35:34.804
Does it have to be Deb?

35:34.930 --> 35:37.640
lt's the only way.

35:39.100 --> 35:40.434
But she's my. . .

35:40.560 --> 35:42.478
Fake sister. l know.

35:43.814 --> 35:45.689
Tell me something. . .

35:48.151 --> 35:51.779
Your victims, are they all killers?

35:53.824 --> 35:54.865
Yes.

35:54.991 --> 35:56.659
Harry teach you that?

35:59.454 --> 36:03.290
He taught me a code. . .

36:03.416 --> 36:05.000
to survive.

36:07.128 --> 36:09.463
Like an absurd avenger?

36:09.589 --> 36:11.173
That's not why l kill.

36:11.508 --> 36:15.344
You can be yourself around me.

36:17.138 --> 36:19.807
Who am l?

36:21.184 --> 36:23.227
A killer. . .

36:26.731 --> 36:29.859
without reason or regret.

36:30.902 --> 36:33.070
You're free.

36:33.196 --> 36:34.697
You can be that way, too.

36:37.951 --> 36:40.870
What about the code?

36:41.371 --> 36:43.539
You don't have a code.

36:44.708 --> 36:46.542
Harry did.

36:46.668 --> 36:49.879
And he's been dead ten years.

36:50.005 --> 36:54.216
You can't keep him sitting
on your shoulder like Jiminy fucking Cricket.

36:55.927 --> 36:58.762
You need to embrace who you are now.

37:07.564 --> 37:10.441
l don't know who l am.

37:10.567 --> 37:12.234
Of course you don't.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.905
You've been away from
your family since you were three,

37:16.031 --> 37:19.783
but l'm here now. l can help Dexter.

37:19.910 --> 37:22.077
We can take this journey together.

37:30.420 --> 37:31.503
l can't.

37:33.423 --> 37:34.548
Not Deb.

37:34.674 --> 37:36.216
Don't say that.

37:36.343 --> 37:37.885
l'm very. . .

37:40.639 --> 37:41.722
fond of her.

37:41.848 --> 37:44.600
You can't be a killer and a hero.

37:44.726 --> 37:46.769
lt doesn't work that way!

38:03.328 --> 38:05.454
Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

38:06.790 --> 38:07.706
Fuck.

38:07.832 --> 38:10.459
ln the garage!

38:10.585 --> 38:13.170
Through that door!

38:13.296 --> 38:15.089
lt's locked. Fuck! Cover this door!

38:15.215 --> 38:16.548
Cover the door!

38:19.386 --> 38:22.054
Come on. Stay with me.

38:22.180 --> 38:23.555
Shit.

38:23.682 --> 38:25.391
Maria, stay on the door.

38:25.517 --> 38:28.435
He's trapped inside. l'm breaking in.

38:28.561 --> 38:30.104
Cover me, man.

38:36.987 --> 38:38.529
Get in.

38:45.954 --> 38:47.162
Shit.

38:58.216 --> 38:59.633
Chopper 1 to command,

38:59.759 --> 39:02.886
we're broadening the search
to a five-mile radius.

39:03.013 --> 39:05.347
Any headache, dizziness?

39:05.473 --> 39:08.058
l'm fine. l just want to go home.

39:08.184 --> 39:10.519
l'm afraid we have to take you
you to the hospital.

39:10.645 --> 39:12.771
Standard procedure.

39:12.897 --> 39:15.065
You're saying Rudy called you?

39:15.191 --> 39:17.026
Why would he do that?

39:17.152 --> 39:18.736
Maybe he wanted me to try to talk him down.

39:18.862 --> 39:21.155
He was having second
thoughts about killing Deb.

39:21.281 --> 39:23.157
He seemed to feel like we have
some kind of connection.

39:23.283 --> 39:24.533
He's not the only one.

39:24.659 --> 39:27.995
He said he'd kill Deb
if l didn't show up alone.

39:28.121 --> 39:30.039
Well, you almost fucking got her killed.

39:30.165 --> 39:32.958
l'm gonna request an immediate
suspension when we get back.

39:33.084 --> 39:35.085
You're gonna what?

39:35.211 --> 39:37.421
Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

39:37.547 --> 39:40.424
Are you questioning Dexter?

39:41.509 --> 39:42.801
Back the fuck off my brother!

39:42.927 --> 39:46.138
He just saved my life! He's a fucking hero!

39:46.264 --> 39:50.142
Want each of you to treat him
that way. God damn it!

40:02.405 --> 40:03.781
Way to go, Deb.

40:05.617 --> 40:08.327
l thought you were gonna burst
a frontal lobe out there.

40:08.453 --> 40:11.288
Assholes.

40:24.928 --> 40:26.637
Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

40:26.763 --> 40:28.680
Get it off me. l'm gonna be sick.

40:28.807 --> 40:29.973
Relax.

40:30.100 --> 40:31.934
Here.

40:37.732 --> 40:40.150
He's still out there.

40:41.569 --> 40:42.986
Yeah.

40:44.781 --> 40:46.990
And he didn't get what he wanted.

40:48.785 --> 40:50.202
No.

40:51.412 --> 40:54.331
Think he'll try it again?

40:55.792 --> 40:56.959
Maybe.

40:59.879 --> 41:01.296
l'll talk to Captain Matthews

41:01.422 --> 41:04.049
about getting us an officer stationed
outside your hospital room.

41:04.175 --> 41:06.301
No, l'm not staying in a fucking hospital.

41:06.427 --> 41:08.720
There's nothing fucking wrong with me.

41:08.847 --> 41:11.348
Well, you're not staying at home.

41:11.474 --> 41:13.142
Well, l'll just crash with Dexter.

41:14.602 --> 41:17.396
Let's just wait and see what
the doctor says. all right?

41:17.522 --> 41:18.772
Yeah.

41:28.449 --> 41:29.700
Why me, Dex?

41:31.536 --> 41:33.996
Why'd he choose me?

41:37.458 --> 41:40.502
You're just lucky, l guess.

41:56.019 --> 41:59.771
l was so scared. l was so scared.

41:59.898 --> 42:03.150
- l know.
- Thank Dexter.

42:03.276 --> 42:05.485
Thank Dexter. Thank Dexter.

42:09.365 --> 42:11.491
Dad would be so proud.

42:20.168 --> 42:22.044
lt's me.

42:22.170 --> 42:23.795
Paul, this is harassment.

42:23.922 --> 42:27.132
Just tell me if he's acting weird.

42:27.258 --> 42:28.175
Who?

42:28.301 --> 42:31.011
Dexter. He hasn't been
himself lately. has he?

42:31.137 --> 42:32.679
How could he be, after what he did to me?

42:32.805 --> 42:34.097
That's it. l'm done.

42:34.224 --> 42:37.434
Call again and you can forget
about ever seeing the kids.

42:37.560 --> 42:39.561
l am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

42:39.687 --> 42:42.648
Fine, if that's what it takes
for you to listen to me.

42:42.774 --> 42:45.817
- l want to know that they're safe.
- Why are you doing this?

42:45.944 --> 42:48.153
You want me to be
miserable and alone like you?

42:48.279 --> 42:52.449
All l want is for you to look for a shoe.

42:52.575 --> 42:53.784
A shoe?

42:53.910 --> 42:56.870
Could be in the kitchen or in the backyard.
lt's missing.

42:56.996 --> 43:00.666
l checked. and it wasn't in
the items that they got when l was arrested.

43:00.792 --> 43:02.209
Why would it be here?

43:02.335 --> 43:05.629
l was trying to figure out
why my ankle was so bruised.

43:05.755 --> 43:09.883
Now l'm thinking it got banged
when he dragged me out,

43:10.009 --> 43:11.760
when my shoe was knocked off.

43:11.886 --> 43:13.720
Good night, Paul.

43:14.847 --> 43:16.265
Night.

43:24.148 --> 43:25.315
Screw Dexter.

43:26.234 --> 43:28.860
What did l just do?

43:28.987 --> 43:33.323
l drove away a brother
who accepts me, sees me,

43:33.449 --> 43:36.618
for an adopted sister
who'd reject me if she knew

43:36.744 --> 43:40.831
and a foster father who betrayed me.

43:40.957 --> 43:43.333
That's what it was, a betrayal.

43:43.459 --> 43:46.169
The most important single fact about me.

43:46.296 --> 43:49.006
l'm not alone. And Harry kept it from me.

43:49.132 --> 43:51.591
What do l really owe him after that?

43:56.723 --> 43:57.764
Mr. Morgan?

44:01.269 --> 44:04.730
- Mr. Morgan?
- That's me.

44:04.856 --> 44:07.065
Your sister has some bruises,
but no major injuries.

44:07.191 --> 44:09.026
Still, you should keep an eye on her.

44:09.152 --> 44:11.320
l'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

44:11.446 --> 44:12.654
But she's OK, right?

44:12.780 --> 44:14.614
She can go home with you tonight,

44:14.741 --> 44:16.783
or we can keep her here at the hospital.

44:16.909 --> 44:19.411
lt's your choice.

44:24.876 --> 44:27.544
Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

44:27.670 --> 44:31.048
We aim to please here at Chez Dex.

44:33.468 --> 44:36.011
l'll be sleeping on the couch
with a spring in my side

44:36.137 --> 44:40.057
just to make sure
you're safe tonight, but. . .

44:40.183 --> 44:44.728
we're gonna have to talk
tomorrow about a long-term plan,

44:44.854 --> 44:47.898
after you get a good night's sleep.

45:02.622 --> 45:05.874
Good night, sister.

46:34.005 --> 46:36.465
l stopped by your prosthetics lab

46:36.591 --> 46:38.633
after l left Deb at the hospital.

46:40.470 --> 46:43.722
Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

46:46.893 --> 46:50.312
Sweet dreams, Bynie.

47:15.505 --> 47:16.505
Hey.

47:21.844 --> 47:24.095
You weren't supposed to wake up.

47:24.222 --> 47:25.764
l guess not.

47:25.890 --> 47:26.848
Sorry.

47:26.974 --> 47:30.852
Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

47:33.064 --> 47:35.607
Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

47:35.733 --> 47:37.609
Sterling.

47:39.570 --> 47:42.030
l keep it for special occasions.

47:43.199 --> 47:44.282
Which you are.

47:47.995 --> 47:50.622
l can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

47:52.208 --> 47:54.918
lt's a service l don't usually offer.

47:57.338 --> 47:59.965
What am l, one of your victims now?

48:00.841 --> 48:04.261
You going to collect a sample
of Bynie's blood for your collection?

48:04.387 --> 48:06.638
No, you're not a trophy. . .

48:08.599 --> 48:10.934
but you need to be put down.

48:11.060 --> 48:14.563
Why? Because of your code?

48:19.610 --> 48:23.405
And the safety of my sister.

48:23.531 --> 48:26.366
She's not your real sister.

48:26.492 --> 48:29.661
she's a stranger to Dexter.
and she'll always be one.

48:29.787 --> 48:32.455
l tried to help you by killing her.

48:32.582 --> 48:33.999
l know that!

48:42.425 --> 48:45.468
You should know this isn't easy for me.

48:54.228 --> 48:57.606
You've done more to deserve
my knife than anyone.

49:07.283 --> 49:10.035
You're the only one
l ever wanted to set free.

49:11.996 --> 49:16.791
You're the one that needs
setting free. little brother.

49:16.917 --> 49:19.961
Your life is a lie.

49:20.087 --> 49:21.963
You'll never be what Dexter. . .

49:29.180 --> 49:31.181
Sorry.

49:31.307 --> 49:35.810
l can't hear any more. . .

49:35.936 --> 49:38.480
'cause you're right.

50:20.523 --> 50:23.066
How did you know he was here?

50:23.192 --> 50:24.818
A neighbor saw the door open.

50:24.944 --> 50:27.570
We got his fingerprints on
the knife, a note on the fridge,

50:27.697 --> 50:30.073
and a single incised wound to the neck.

50:30.199 --> 50:32.200
Slight upward angle.

50:32.868 --> 50:37.247
Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

50:37.373 --> 50:40.083
Looks like a clear suicide.

50:40.209 --> 50:43.378
He does himself the same way
he did the hookers. Poetic.

50:43.504 --> 50:46.548
Retarded. Look at him. He's dead.

50:46.674 --> 50:50.885
The ice-truck killer always flaunted
his kills as if he was untouchable.

50:51.011 --> 50:52.721
By taking his own life,

50:52.847 --> 50:55.014
he's preventing us from ever catching him.

50:55.141 --> 50:57.892
l don't care why he did it.
l'm just glad he did.

51:15.411 --> 51:19.372
Decaf mochaccino, non-fat, no whip.
Your favorite.

51:19.498 --> 51:21.750
l got your message.

51:21.876 --> 51:23.585
How's Debra?

51:24.920 --> 51:26.963
She has all her limbs.

51:27.089 --> 51:28.923
Thank God she's alive.

51:29.049 --> 51:31.176
That poor thing must be a mess.

51:31.302 --> 51:33.344
Falling for a serial killer.

51:33.471 --> 51:34.888
What are the odds?

51:35.014 --> 51:37.682
- What about you?
- What about me?

51:37.808 --> 51:39.476
Are you all right?

51:39.602 --> 51:40.810
Yeah.

51:47.943 --> 51:48.943
No.

51:57.787 --> 52:00.121
l've been through a lot lately.

52:03.042 --> 52:07.796
l could use a little more time
with you and the kids.

52:09.799 --> 52:12.342
We could, too.

52:12.468 --> 52:13.968
l'm sorry l've been so. . .

52:27.650 --> 52:32.237
Next time, could you just
let me know what's going on?

52:33.322 --> 52:35.907
When you didn't return my calls,

52:36.033 --> 52:39.035
l started to get a little paranoid.

52:39.161 --> 52:41.079
l can be better about that.

52:42.498 --> 52:44.082
Good.

52:47.545 --> 52:48.586
Who knows?

52:48.712 --> 52:51.714
You might even find l can handle the truth.

52:54.343 --> 52:57.011
l wish that was the case.

52:57.137 --> 53:02.225
The reality is, there's nobody left alive
who can handle my truth.

53:11.694 --> 53:14.571
Doakes always sensed
l was hiding something.

53:14.697 --> 53:15.989
Now he knows.

53:16.115 --> 53:19.868
My devil danced with his demon,
and the fiddler's tune isn't over.

53:34.717 --> 53:37.760
l wonder what it would be like
for everything inside me

53:37.887 --> 53:41.973
that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

53:48.314 --> 53:50.023
But l'll never know.

53:50.149 --> 53:52.358
l live my life in hiding.

53:52.484 --> 53:55.862
My survival depends on it.

53:56.780 --> 53:58.740
Dearly damaged Debra,

53:58.866 --> 54:01.492
she's here to face what's left of the monster,

54:01.619 --> 54:04.996
spit on his carcass, mourn him.

54:05.789 --> 54:08.249
She's in hiding now, too.

54:08.375 --> 54:12.879
Harry's daughter won't let anyone see
what she's suffering inside.

54:13.005 --> 54:16.090
That's her tragedy.

54:17.718 --> 54:21.512
My tragedy is that l killed
the one person l didn't have to hide from.

54:21.639 --> 54:24.432
And l'm the only one who mourns him.

54:31.440 --> 54:33.316
Everyone would probably thank me

54:33.442 --> 54:35.860
if they knew l was the one
who drained him of his life.

54:35.986 --> 54:38.112
Good job. You sliced him up good.

54:40.324 --> 54:44.285
ln fact. l'm sure
they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

54:49.625 --> 54:52.710
Way to take out the trash. Thanks, man.

54:52.836 --> 54:55.463
All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

55:11.730 --> 55:16.234
This is what it must feel like
to walk in full sunlight.

55:16.360 --> 55:18.528
my darkness revealed,

55:18.654 --> 55:21.114
my shadow self embraced.

55:29.581 --> 55:32.417
Yeah, they see me.

55:32.543 --> 55:35.169
l'm one of them. . .

55:36.672 --> 55:39.340
ln their darkest dreams.
