WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:03.758
Previously on Dexter. . .

00:03.884 --> 00:06.886
No blood. What a gorgeous idea.

00:07.012 --> 00:13.017
Refrigerated truck. He wants a cold
environment to slow the flow of blood.

00:14.645 --> 00:17.397
l suppose l should be upset, but l'm not.

00:17.940 --> 00:22.777
ln fact, l think this is a friendly message, kind
of like, "Hey, wanna play?"

00:24.488 --> 00:26.280
Kara, it's me. lt's James.

00:27.241 --> 00:29.867
You just opened a dangerous door.

00:29.993 --> 00:31.577
No, man. You did. . .

00:31.704 --> 00:34.580
when you murdered a cop
and an innocent lady.

00:34.707 --> 00:38.167
Was Kara sleeping with someone
other than Ricky?

00:38.293 --> 00:39.544
Was it you?

00:41.422 --> 00:43.047
What the fuck were you thinking?

00:43.173 --> 00:45.633
Going out tonight with the guys,
blow off steam. You in?

00:45.759 --> 00:46.884
Hey, man. Sounds good.

00:47.010 --> 00:49.762
l thought you said you wanted
to go get shit-faced.

00:49.888 --> 00:51.514
l am shit-faced.

00:51.640 --> 00:56.394
l showed my face to Guerrero. his whole
church. They're gonna think l'm behind this.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.439
You fucked my sister.
You fucked a cop's wife.

00:59.565 --> 01:01.941
Now you're just fucked, buddy.

01:03.944 --> 01:05.486
He's escalating the thrill,

01:05.612 --> 01:08.781
posing his victim in the middle of
a 20,000-seat arena

01:08.907 --> 01:12.118
for all Miami to see.
to show us what he's capable of doing.

01:12.244 --> 01:14.620
- What did l miss?
- Fingertips.

01:14.747 --> 01:19.584
Fuckin'-A, that's my girl. This body belongs to
the frozen fingertips found in the truck.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.919
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:22.045 --> 01:24.714
l give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck killer.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.923
Bullshit.

01:26.049 --> 01:30.178
Of course l agree with my sister,
but unlike her. l'm not upset.

01:30.304 --> 01:33.264
He's still out there and l'm waiting. . .

01:34.224 --> 01:35.391
breathless.

03:38.891 --> 03:40.141
l find people around me

03:40.267 --> 03:44.729
are all making some kind of connection,
like friendship or romance.

03:45.314 --> 03:48.441
But human bonds always
lead to messy complications,

03:48.567 --> 03:53.112
commitment, sharing,
driving people to the airport.

03:53.989 --> 03:58.200
Besides, if l let someone get that close, they'd
see who l really am. . .

03:58.327 --> 04:00.786
and l can't let that happen.

04:01.830 --> 04:04.582
So, time to put on my mask.

04:08.045 --> 04:11.088
- l need your expertise.
- l live to serve.

04:11.214 --> 04:13.090
Excuse us, fellas.

04:17.763 --> 04:19.430
lnteresting hand job.

04:20.766 --> 04:22.600
That's funny.

04:23.685 --> 04:25.269
lt is?

04:26.271 --> 04:27.939
How long you think it's been there?

04:30.692 --> 04:32.443
This feels familiar.

04:34.821 --> 04:36.280
OK.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.324
So, how long's it been there?

04:41.870 --> 04:45.581
Blood stopped pooling, still wet,
couple hours at the most.

04:45.707 --> 04:47.083
What time was it found?

04:47.209 --> 04:49.585
A jogger called it in
this morning about 7:30.

04:50.337 --> 04:52.296
No prints. Wiped clean.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.422
Real creep show.

04:53.548 --> 04:56.759
- Any sign of the rest of the body?
- Just Mr. Hand.

04:57.844 --> 05:02.306
- Do you think this is our guy's work?
- The ice-truck killer?

05:02.432 --> 05:05.935
lt's hard to say.
There's blood. That's different.

05:06.061 --> 05:09.021
Plus. it's a male victim.
haven't seen that before.

05:09.147 --> 05:12.400
The cut appears to be almost delicate.

05:12.526 --> 05:17.154
You see between the first and second row
of carpals... Very surgical.

05:19.408 --> 05:21.826
Check out what else he left behind.

05:23.870 --> 05:27.039
A postcard to remember him by.

05:32.713 --> 05:34.714
How far is Rand Beach from here?

05:34.840 --> 05:36.340
This is Rand Beach.

05:36.466 --> 05:39.677
lt was renamed Petrie Beach
a few years ago.

05:50.856 --> 05:52.106
No, no, come on.

05:52.232 --> 05:53.774
OK, everybody.

05:57.112 --> 05:59.530
Everybody say. . .

05:59.656 --> 06:01.073
"stinky feet."

06:02.868 --> 06:05.411
Wait. Nobody move.
Dexter, were you smiling?

06:05.537 --> 06:06.412
No.

06:06.538 --> 06:09.749
We'll do another one.
This time everybody smile. You too, Dex.

06:09.875 --> 06:13.085
- Yeah, pretend you're burning ants.
- Shut your damn face, Deb.

06:13.211 --> 06:14.253
Language, please.

06:14.379 --> 06:18.424
- What? She always talks like that.
- Enough, you two. Dexter, come here.

06:24.347 --> 06:25.431
What's your problem?

06:25.557 --> 06:29.268
l hate the beach. lt's sandy and gross
and nasty. and l want to go home.

06:29.394 --> 06:31.437
Too bad. You're part of a family.

06:31.563 --> 06:35.066
And being part of a family
means smiling for photos.

06:36.359 --> 06:38.402
Why should l pretend l'm happy?

06:39.613 --> 06:42.114
Because it'll make your mom happy.

06:43.075 --> 06:45.326
And because it's how you fit in.

06:45.452 --> 06:47.953
- Remember we talked about that?
- Yeah.

06:48.080 --> 06:51.457
This is how you do it. When somebody takes
your picture. you smile.

06:51.583 --> 06:54.126
lt doesn't matter if you're happy or not.

06:54.252 --> 06:57.129
You just do it to fit in. OK?

06:57.255 --> 06:58.839
- OK.
- All right.

07:01.259 --> 07:02.927
Come here, handsome.

07:04.137 --> 07:06.555
OK. Everybody ready?

07:09.267 --> 07:11.435
One more time.

07:13.230 --> 07:14.939
Stinky feet!

07:18.276 --> 07:21.487
Yeah, l just need to stop by my
apartment to pick up a few labs.

07:21.613 --> 07:25.616
Straight to the station after, yeah.
Thanks. Lieutenant.

07:36.670 --> 07:38.671
Dexter Morgan. . .

07:38.797 --> 07:40.464
this is your life.

07:42.634 --> 07:45.427
lt is my new friend,
the ice-truck killer.

07:46.555 --> 07:50.182
When he broke into my apartment,
he took some time to get to know me,

07:50.308 --> 07:51.642
my life.

07:53.645 --> 07:55.479
My secrets.

08:05.991 --> 08:10.661
. .have brought in manpower from other
counties in an effort to expedite the search.

08:10.787 --> 08:13.706
Officially, Mr. Tucci has not
been charged with any crime. . .

08:13.832 --> 08:16.917
Then tell the fucking governor
to free up funds for overtime.

08:17.043 --> 08:21.005
The more guys l got out there,
the sooner we find Tucci.

08:21.840 --> 08:22.840
Kelly, l'll get back to Dexter.

08:22.966 --> 08:26.051
. .is still the department's top priority.

08:27.804 --> 08:28.762
What's wrong?

08:28.889 --> 08:31.891
Fingerprint lD came back
on that hand from the beach.

08:32.017 --> 08:36.145
lt belongs to Tony Tucci.
your ice-truck killer suspect.

08:36.271 --> 08:37.813
What?

08:40.108 --> 08:42.193
Wait a minute.

08:43.862 --> 08:46.280
No. No, no, no. No way.

08:47.032 --> 08:48.449
No way.

08:48.575 --> 08:50.951
l mean, this. . . This has to be a mistake.

08:51.077 --> 08:55.581
The mistake was unleashing a high-profile
manhunt before you had all the facts.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.085
Fuck.

09:03.882 --> 09:07.426
OK. This doesn't mean
that Tucci is not the killer.

09:07.552 --> 09:09.303
Don't.

09:09.429 --> 09:12.056
Just. . Just don't.

09:13.433 --> 09:17.978
You wanted to be on TV, well, get ready, cos
the press will annihilate us for this.

09:18.104 --> 09:22.233
We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother
doesn't file a lawsuit.

09:23.944 --> 09:25.110
All right.

09:26.154 --> 09:29.448
You go talk to that woman.
Do your mea culpas.

09:29.574 --> 09:31.116
lf we handle this right. . .

09:32.077 --> 09:33.953
maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

09:36.665 --> 09:38.749
l'm the last person she wants to see.

09:38.875 --> 09:40.668
l called her son a killer.

09:40.794 --> 09:43.045
And now's your chance to make it right.

10:03.149 --> 10:06.694
- LaGuerta screwed the pooch on this one.
- l'm taking point.

10:06.820 --> 10:09.530
You can get all non-essentials off the beach.

10:09.656 --> 10:12.283
- Secure and separate any witnesses.
- Will do.

10:12.409 --> 10:14.159
What did the captain say?

10:14.286 --> 10:16.328
Did he make her cry?

10:20.333 --> 10:22.793
Just control the fucking beach, Angel.

10:25.630 --> 10:27.673
l knew Tucci wasn't the killer. l knew it.

10:27.799 --> 10:30.551
LaGuerta whipped up a manhunt
for a rent-a-cop.

10:30.677 --> 10:33.429
l wish l could have been there
to see the captain rip her a new one.

10:33.555 --> 10:34.722
Morgan, calm down.

10:34.848 --> 10:37.308
LaGuerta insulted the killer's intelligence,

10:37.434 --> 10:40.519
now he's getting back at us
for chasing after the wrong guy.

10:40.645 --> 10:42.813
- You see all these people over here?
- Yeah.

10:42.939 --> 10:45.941
- What are they?
- Potential witnesses.

10:46.067 --> 10:48.444
And what do we do with
potential witnesses?

10:48.570 --> 10:49.653
We. . .

10:49.779 --> 10:51.655
We interview them.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.115
Got it.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.210
Where is he?

11:05.337 --> 11:06.795
The rest of him?

11:10.759 --> 11:12.801
We're. . . We're still looking.

11:12.927 --> 11:15.763
The entire force is looking.
We're making every effort.

11:15.889 --> 11:17.765
Are you sure it's Tony? Because. . .

11:19.142 --> 11:21.101
Yes.

11:21.853 --> 11:24.271
l'm afraid so.

11:28.651 --> 11:30.402
Mrs. Tucci.

11:31.946 --> 11:34.365
l said some very harsh things
about your son.

11:34.491 --> 11:35.991
Thank Dexter.

11:40.372 --> 11:42.206
"Thank you"? For what?

11:43.708 --> 11:45.542
For coming to tell me in person.

11:46.294 --> 11:47.795
For God's sake, please.

11:48.838 --> 11:54.093
- There's nothing more important than this.
- Can you find my son's body?

11:54.219 --> 11:56.011
lf it's the last thing l do.

11:58.181 --> 12:01.225
- l made a grave. . .
- Bring him home, please.

12:02.394 --> 12:04.770
l just want to bury my son.

12:20.078 --> 12:22.996
- l do love Halloween.
- What's inside of a pumpkin?

12:23.123 --> 12:25.082
See for yourself.

12:26.084 --> 12:29.753
What? You don't like this stuff? l do.
Come on. Get in there.

12:32.924 --> 12:36.260
l'll finish cleaning this out.
You can carve it tomorrow.

12:37.595 --> 12:39.263
There he is again, Mom.

12:39.931 --> 12:41.807
My God. lt's every night now.

12:41.933 --> 12:44.059
That dog? Where's it coming from?

12:44.185 --> 12:45.727
Next door. My neighbor's.

12:45.854 --> 12:48.939
Leaves the poor thing
in the yard all day and night.

12:49.065 --> 12:51.483
lt's been getting worse. l would talk to her,

12:51.609 --> 12:54.236
but l don't want to start something.

12:54.362 --> 12:56.780
Listen to him, Mom. He's so sad.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.158
l just wish he would shut up
so l could sleep.

12:59.284 --> 13:01.910
Do you want me to talk to her?

13:02.036 --> 13:04.288
No, you don't have to do that.

13:07.625 --> 13:09.293
l insist.

13:32.567 --> 13:37.029
- Hello. l don't think we've met.
- Boyfriend of the blonde next door.

13:37.155 --> 13:40.157
l've seen you around.
l'm just getting in. l'm tired.

13:40.283 --> 13:45.037
That's precisely why l'm here.
We can't help but notice your dog cries. . .

13:45.163 --> 13:46.955
- A lot.
- l know.

13:47.081 --> 13:48.957
My ex moved out and left his dog.

13:50.251 --> 13:52.252
l wish there was something l could do.

13:52.378 --> 13:54.087
You could. . .

13:54.214 --> 13:55.881
take him inside.

13:56.007 --> 13:57.466
Walter's an outside dog.

13:57.592 --> 14:01.845
- Put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.
- He doesn't like being inside.

14:03.473 --> 14:05.557
Did he tell you that?

14:08.603 --> 14:12.856
We'd appreciate it if you could find a way
to keep him quiet. The kids are upset.

14:13.608 --> 14:15.526
Maybe that's cos they think
their crackhead father

14:15.652 --> 14:18.070
is gonna come back
and beat their asses again.

14:20.198 --> 14:22.574
You know what works for me?
Earplugs.

14:32.585 --> 14:36.296
l could make things
so much easier for Rita. . .

14:37.465 --> 14:39.716
but that would be wrong.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.934
l love Halloween.

14:49.060 --> 14:53.063
The one time of year
when everyone wears a mask, not just me.

14:55.149 --> 14:57.734
People think it's fun
to pretend you're a monster.

14:57.860 --> 15:00.487
Me, l spend my life pretending l'm not.

15:02.407 --> 15:06.451
Brother. friend. boyfriend.
all part of my costume collection.

15:11.249 --> 15:13.542
Some people might call me a fraud.

15:13.668 --> 15:15.669
Let's see if it will fit.

15:17.171 --> 15:18.505
Boo!

15:19.257 --> 15:21.800
You stabbed me in the back!

15:21.926 --> 15:25.387
l prefer to think of myself
as a master of disguise.

15:28.099 --> 15:29.266
They're so excited.

15:29.392 --> 15:32.436
Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for
an entire day.

15:32.562 --> 15:33.979
Who wouldn't love that?

15:34.105 --> 15:36.982
What about a costume for you?
Maybe this one?

15:38.818 --> 15:42.654
No. l think l'll be Snow White again.
lt's kind of tradition.

15:44.449 --> 15:46.908
Dexter, look. l'm a princess, too.

15:47.035 --> 15:49.703
Just like your Mom.
two perfect princesses.

15:51.080 --> 15:56.209
- Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.
- No. l want to be Joe from Blue's Clues.

15:56.336 --> 16:00.797
l keep telling him that a rugby shirt
is not a costume.

16:07.472 --> 16:10.766
Another photo from my family album.

16:10.892 --> 16:14.978
He's recreating my past
with Tony Tucci's body parts.

16:15.438 --> 16:17.314
He's forcing me to see this.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.692
Nobody paying you to stand around
and goddamn stare.

16:20.818 --> 16:24.112
l thought Angel was working this case,
Sergeant.

16:25.573 --> 16:26.782
Sergeant?

16:30.078 --> 16:32.037
Friends of yours?

16:32.163 --> 16:34.456
Don't worry about it. Worry about this.

16:35.166 --> 16:38.251
The foot was severed between
the tarsus and the metatarsus.

16:38.378 --> 16:42.381
The wound is circular,
again, almost surgical.

16:42.507 --> 16:43.757
And there's blood.

16:43.883 --> 16:47.552
Guy gives us body after body with no blood.
Why he's making a switch now?

16:47.679 --> 16:49.221
He's trying to send a message,

16:49.347 --> 16:54.976
one that's more important than his ritual need
to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

16:55.103 --> 16:57.062
OK, so what's the message?

16:57.188 --> 16:58.730
l'm not sure.

16:58.856 --> 17:01.608
Well, who's he sending it to?

17:01.734 --> 17:04.069
l can't tell you that, either.

17:05.530 --> 17:08.407
What fucking good are you?

17:08.533 --> 17:11.410
No fucking good at all, apparently.

17:16.332 --> 17:18.750
- You OK?
- He's mocking me.

17:19.627 --> 17:23.046
Don't take it personally.
Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

17:23.798 --> 17:25.215
Who?

17:25.925 --> 17:27.426
- Relax, bro.
- Sorry.

17:27.552 --> 17:30.554
l need to bag this photo.
lt's under the ball. Do you mind?

17:48.948 --> 17:51.700
He knows.

17:51.826 --> 17:56.079
He's not corrupting the happy
hallmark images of my youth.

17:56.205 --> 17:59.332
He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

18:00.585 --> 18:02.252
Come on, Simon.

18:02.378 --> 18:04.796
You want it? lt's right there.

18:04.922 --> 18:06.673
Over there. Oh, yeah.

18:06.799 --> 18:08.800
- Guys, give it back!
- Pass it over here.

18:08.926 --> 18:10.302
You guys, give it back.

18:10.428 --> 18:12.304
Come on. simon.
What you gonna do?

18:12.430 --> 18:14.890
All right. Enough.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.519
Get out of here.

18:23.441 --> 18:26.234
- What the hell is going on?
- We're just having fun.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.070
lt didn't look like Simon
was having too much fun to me.

18:29.197 --> 18:33.283
You're always telling me to fit in,
l'm just trying to be part of the team.

18:33.409 --> 18:35.660
You can't be a bully, Dexter.

18:35.787 --> 18:37.579
First of all, it's wrong.

18:37.705 --> 18:40.081
Secondly, people remember bullies.

18:40.208 --> 18:42.083
People like me, cops.

18:43.127 --> 18:45.796
A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

18:45.922 --> 18:47.631
So?

18:48.591 --> 18:49.674
Blend in.

18:51.469 --> 18:52.928
Go on.

19:02.730 --> 19:05.023
Officer Morgan,
l have an assignment for Dexter.

19:05.149 --> 19:09.027
l heard we found a foot this morning.
You want me to head to the crime scene?

19:09.153 --> 19:10.695
No.

19:10.822 --> 19:13.281
Look. we pulled these
from security cameras

19:13.407 --> 19:16.243
around the beach, stores, hotels, ATMs.

19:16.369 --> 19:19.538
- l want you to check every frame.
- You are shitting me.

19:19.664 --> 19:22.415
lf we're lucky, we can see the killer
coming and going.

19:22.542 --> 19:24.584
We have techs who can do this.

19:24.710 --> 19:28.004
Not all techs have the skill
to spot suspicious activity.

19:28.130 --> 19:30.715
l'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

19:30.842 --> 19:33.218
Keep your eye out for another box
of surveillance tapes.

19:33.344 --> 19:36.012
lt's on its way from the new crime scene.

19:59.120 --> 20:02.664
Hey, Doakesy, what's up?
Fuck anyone's wife lately?

20:08.087 --> 20:12.507
Thanks to your little stunt, Guerrero's guys are
tailing me everywhere l go.

20:12.633 --> 20:16.136
That's not good, James.
You should alert the police.

20:16.262 --> 20:19.556
Unless, of course, for some reason
the officers of Miami wouldn't help you,

20:19.682 --> 20:21.725
like, you know,
you fucked one of their wives.

20:22.560 --> 20:26.605
You think this is a joke. l'm gonna
end up dead. lt's just a matter of when.

20:27.398 --> 20:31.610
You should have thought of that
before you stuck your dick in my sister.

20:31.736 --> 20:35.780
You're right. l should have waited
until the divorce came through.

20:38.409 --> 20:40.118
Bullshit.

20:40.745 --> 20:44.915
What? she didn't tell you?
She filed the papers, jackass.

20:45.833 --> 20:48.710
Ask the captain. He tried to pull Ricky
out of his assignment,

20:48.836 --> 20:51.463
- but Ricky didn't want to come out.
- Of course not.

20:51.589 --> 20:55.592
- His job was to bring down Guerrero.
- lt was his job to protect his wife.

20:58.137 --> 21:03.141
Ricky's the motherfucker who got her killed.
You backed the wrong cop. asshole.

21:08.230 --> 21:10.732
Let's go, guys. Time for school.

21:12.777 --> 21:17.447
Guys? Come on. You don't want to be
in the Halloween parade?

21:25.164 --> 21:26.831
Shut up!

21:26.958 --> 21:28.833
Shut up! Just. . .

21:31.295 --> 21:34.506
- l need to talk to you about your dog.
- l talked to your boyfriend.

21:34.632 --> 21:36.633
My kids are exhausted.

21:37.218 --> 21:40.595
When it comes to my kids,
l stop being nice.

21:40.721 --> 21:43.390
So l need you to bring him in at night,

21:43.516 --> 21:46.476
feed him on a schedule
and take him for some exercise. . .

21:48.980 --> 21:51.272
l'm sorry. ls this funny?

21:51.399 --> 21:53.858
No, no, no. lt's. . . lt's sad.

21:53.985 --> 21:57.028
But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.

22:00.241 --> 22:04.744
- l'm gonna call the police. l can do that.
- There's nothing you can do.

22:04.870 --> 22:09.040
The cops will tell me to keep him quiet,
l'll say l will. and then they'll leave.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.167
and he'll go back to doing what he does.

22:12.461 --> 22:14.004
But you're funny.

22:44.577 --> 22:48.663
Unlike Harry, my new friend
doesn't place much value in blending in.

22:48.789 --> 22:51.916
He wants me to see who he is
and what he does.

22:52.460 --> 22:56.713
Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

22:58.466 --> 23:00.133
What does that make me?

23:00.885 --> 23:02.719
Crap.

23:09.727 --> 23:12.062
- You OK, man?
- No.

23:12.188 --> 23:16.441
Don't let this bastard get to Dexter.
You're the best blood expert in the state.

23:16.567 --> 23:18.276
And we need you to stay with this.

23:18.402 --> 23:20.487
l'll be all right.

23:20.613 --> 23:25.533
Wait. Before you get back to work,
check this out.

23:28.662 --> 23:30.121
What is that, a butterfly?

23:30.247 --> 23:33.792
No. socio.
it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

23:35.252 --> 23:36.461
l'm. . .

23:36.587 --> 23:40.298
l'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary
tomorrow night.

23:40.424 --> 23:42.967
Oh, congratulations.
How many years?

23:43.094 --> 23:45.512
Ten years she's been
my lucky charm now.

23:46.180 --> 23:50.141
Tin is the traditional gift,
but l didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

23:50.851 --> 23:52.977
No. lt's probably a good plan.

23:53.104 --> 23:55.480
Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

23:57.942 --> 24:00.652
Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

24:04.281 --> 24:05.615
This can't be right.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.409
- What's up?
- You see that?

24:09.453 --> 24:11.663
- You see it?
- l don't know. What do l see?

24:11.789 --> 24:15.583
The blood in the hand suggested the heart was
still pumping when it was severed.

24:15.709 --> 24:17.502
Mean son of a bitch, no doubt.

24:17.628 --> 24:21.381
But look at the foot, it's the same blood flow,
plus the lividity.

24:21.507 --> 24:24.259
Look, it's the same bruising,
same ashen color.

24:24.385 --> 24:28.346
the same level of decomposition
as the hand the day we found it.

24:28.472 --> 24:29.681
But. . .

24:29.807 --> 24:32.225
- We found them a day apart.
- l know.

24:37.439 --> 24:39.524
Here's a picture. Hollywood.

24:39.650 --> 24:42.318
LT, you got to listen to him.

24:42.444 --> 24:46.072
lt's the guard, Tucci, l think he's alive.

24:46.198 --> 24:48.199
What are you talking about?

24:48.325 --> 24:52.704
The ice-truck killer is keeping him alive
to perform amputations.

24:52.830 --> 24:54.247
Tucci's alive?

24:54.373 --> 24:56.833
Both limbs were taken from a live body,

24:56.959 --> 24:59.127
and we found them 24 hours apart.

24:59.253 --> 25:01.212
That's not all. Tell them, Dexter.

25:01.338 --> 25:05.258
lf the hand came off yesterday at seven am,
and the foot this morning at seven...

25:05.384 --> 25:09.179
- We get another body part tomorrow.
- But he's alive.

25:09.305 --> 25:12.599
Put together a task force.
l want all available personnel on this.

25:12.725 --> 25:16.269
And put a priority status on all forensics related
to this case.

25:16.395 --> 25:18.354
Captain Matthews, please.

25:18.480 --> 25:21.482
Have him call me back immediately.

25:45.841 --> 25:47.258
Mrs. Tucci?

25:48.594 --> 25:51.054
Maria LaGuerta.

25:51.180 --> 25:53.389
l have some amazing news for Dexter.

25:54.892 --> 25:57.227
We believe your son is alive.

25:58.854 --> 26:01.689
No. No. We haven't,
but l promise we will.

26:05.402 --> 26:07.070
No, thank Dexter.

26:07.196 --> 26:09.572
Yes. Yes.

26:09.698 --> 26:11.407
OK, we'll be in touch. Bye.

26:18.540 --> 26:20.667
We've got a live body now, people.

26:20.793 --> 26:23.002
We want to find Tucci
while he's still breathing.

26:23.128 --> 26:27.215
That means figuring out where tomorrow's drop
is so we catch our man in the act.

26:27.341 --> 26:28.383
Any ideas?

26:30.636 --> 26:32.679
Don't forget the photos. They're new.

26:32.805 --> 26:36.099
Thank you, Officer Morgan.
We're doing just fine out here.

26:37.101 --> 26:38.935
Why do we think he's taking photos?

26:39.061 --> 26:40.520
He wants to be remembered.

26:40.646 --> 26:42.814
You use photos to record memories.

26:44.692 --> 26:47.777
l almost feel sorry for them,
trying to put together a puzzle

26:47.903 --> 26:52.115
when they don't know pieces are missing from
the box, pieces he gave me.

26:57.121 --> 26:59.455
He wants me to play the game his way.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.501
OK, what else could it be?

27:03.627 --> 27:05.169
Change.

27:07.798 --> 27:10.508
- You got something to say, speak.
- The beach changed names.

27:10.634 --> 27:12.677
The office park used to be a soccer field.

27:14.221 --> 27:18.766
He's dumping the body parts in places
that used to be something else.

27:18.892 --> 27:20.852
OK. Places that have changed.

27:20.978 --> 27:24.605
Let's make a list, assign surveillance
to each location for the morning.

27:24.732 --> 27:26.899
South Beach used to be
a mangrove swamp.

27:27.026 --> 27:30.028
Homestead Park was originally
an air force base. right?

27:30.154 --> 27:33.031
They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.

27:34.283 --> 27:35.742
Thank you, Officer Morgan.

27:35.868 --> 27:38.453
The whole city reinvents itself
every five years.

27:38.579 --> 27:42.040
Then we'll stay up all night
until our list is complete.

28:08.192 --> 28:09.859
Lieutenant.

28:17.618 --> 28:20.203
Anything?

28:21.413 --> 28:25.208
Well, l am so glad you could make it.

28:26.502 --> 28:29.045
Well, l just came by to show my support.

28:30.589 --> 28:33.800
lt's been a long time
since l've been to church.

28:35.552 --> 28:38.179
Excuse me, everyone.
Excuse me.

28:38.305 --> 28:40.264
l would like to introduce you

28:40.391 --> 28:42.016
- to someone very special.
- No.

28:42.142 --> 28:47.105
This is Maria LaGuerta.
She's the policewoman looking for Tony.

28:49.942 --> 28:51.275
Not just me.

28:51.402 --> 28:54.570
Actually. a lot of us.
There's a lot of us looking.

28:54.696 --> 28:59.283
You brought us all here together
by giving us hope.

29:03.539 --> 29:08.918
May the Lord bless you
and guide you, Maria.

29:10.295 --> 29:14.173
This is Saint Anthony, patron saint of. . .

29:14.299 --> 29:16.175
The lost.

29:19.012 --> 29:20.972
Find him.

29:23.392 --> 29:25.059
OK.

29:25.185 --> 29:28.146
l tried to apologize.
but l couldn't get a word in edgewise.

29:28.272 --> 29:29.772
And you wanted to apologize why?

29:29.898 --> 29:32.358
You don't think l should,
the way l went after her son?

29:33.110 --> 29:34.485
Yeah, you did fuck that up.

29:35.737 --> 29:38.990
Yeah. l crucified him
without having all the facts.

29:41.201 --> 29:43.244
l need to tell her that l'm sorry.

29:45.372 --> 29:47.874
l need to let her know that l'm sorry.
l need to tell her.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.960
Who is that gonna make
feel better, you or her?

29:51.086 --> 29:54.672
Leave that woman alone
with her candles and Kumbaya.

30:00.596 --> 30:02.013
So, where we at?

30:02.139 --> 30:05.850
l added additional patrols
at Dolphin Stadium,

30:05.976 --> 30:08.227
Bayside marketplace,
and Casa Casuarina.

30:08.353 --> 30:10.605
That's everybody we have out in the field.

30:10.731 --> 30:14.317
Homicide, robbery, off-duty patrol.
so what's next?

30:15.486 --> 30:19.572
What's next is you should go home.
You've had the shit kicked out of you all day.

30:19.698 --> 30:23.075
l like it here with Dexter. You're the only person
people hate more than me.

30:23.202 --> 30:24.577
Fuck Dexter.

30:25.787 --> 30:29.999
Come on. Let's both get out of here.
Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

30:44.014 --> 30:45.181
Officer Morgan.

30:45.724 --> 30:48.226
Call me on my cellphone
if you find anything.

31:04.868 --> 31:06.244
Son of a bitch.

31:09.706 --> 31:10.748
Fuck this.

31:17.381 --> 31:19.507
What? Want a piece of me?

31:21.134 --> 31:23.261
Fucking asshole!

31:26.807 --> 31:29.934
l will pay you $1 million

31:30.060 --> 31:34.105
if you help me figure out where
the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

31:34.231 --> 31:38.276
l'm afraid l'm lost on this one, Deb.
lt's like it's staring me right in the face, but. . .

31:38.402 --> 31:41.946
- $1 million.
- You don't have $1 million.

31:42.072 --> 31:44.323
l'll steal it from Evidence.

31:44.449 --> 31:46.701
l've been stuck
in a goddamn fishbowl all day.

31:46.827 --> 31:49.829
l want to be part of the hunt.
l'm almost off duty.

31:49.955 --> 31:51.872
Sorry, sister.

31:51.999 --> 31:53.416
$2 million.

31:54.042 --> 31:56.168
l know you made a list of locations.

31:56.295 --> 31:59.547
Just pick your favorite spot.
We'll stake it out together.

31:59.673 --> 32:02.883
My favorite spot. Of course.

32:03.010 --> 32:05.636
Come on. l want to play.

32:09.516 --> 32:12.768
Deb, l got to go.
We'll compare notes tomorrow, OK?

32:19.776 --> 32:24.989
l used to love this place, the bulldozers
pressing garbage, layer after layer,

32:25.115 --> 32:28.618
right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it.

32:29.453 --> 32:31.621
l found it soothing.

32:34.666 --> 32:36.751
But it wasn't condos back then.

32:40.172 --> 32:42.173
This has to be the right place.

32:47.471 --> 32:49.138
So what am l missing?

33:20.962 --> 33:22.672
Sorry about that.

33:22.798 --> 33:24.465
Go back to sleep.

33:31.306 --> 33:33.599
- Hello.
- Mr. Morgan. Dispatch.

33:33.725 --> 33:38.104
You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin
patch. Need the address?

33:38.230 --> 33:40.231
No, l know exactly where it is.

33:44.820 --> 33:45.778
Are you OK?

33:45.904 --> 33:48.072
Are you kidding? That was awesome.

33:48.198 --> 33:50.866
You've got some hay in your hair.

33:50.992 --> 33:53.119
- Where?
- Right there!

33:54.162 --> 33:57.456
OK. OK. OK. OK.
Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.

33:57.582 --> 34:00.584
Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

34:00.711 --> 34:03.295
You'll miss these moments
when they're older.

34:03.422 --> 34:05.047
Thanks.

34:05.757 --> 34:08.718
- lt's great to see you having a good time.
- Are you kidding?

34:08.844 --> 34:13.013
This hay's giving me an allergy attack, and
we're going in circles on a pumpkin patch.

34:13.140 --> 34:14.598
Ready?

34:14.725 --> 34:15.891
Smile!

34:20.105 --> 34:21.689
What do we have?

34:21.815 --> 34:24.275
Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.

34:28.363 --> 34:30.030
You think Tucci's still alive?

34:31.408 --> 34:33.075
lf he is, he won't be for long.

34:39.249 --> 34:41.208
Unless you're toting a portable DVD player,

34:41.334 --> 34:43.753
you better be finished
watching that security footage.

34:43.879 --> 34:46.255
l am on a break. l'm on my own time.

34:47.215 --> 34:50.134
So you are, but your shift
starts in two hours.

34:50.260 --> 34:52.553
so if l were Dexter.
l'd head back to the station.

34:52.679 --> 34:54.764
Traffic at this hour's a bitch.

34:56.391 --> 34:58.392
Speaking of bitch. . .

34:59.478 --> 35:02.313
Didn't Dad bring us here once
when we were kids?

35:02.439 --> 35:03.481
l don't remember.

35:03.607 --> 35:06.233
Hey, Dexter, come here.
Take a look at this.

35:06.359 --> 35:07.943
Excuse us.

35:08.570 --> 35:11.238
She's right, you know, about the traffic.

35:15.285 --> 35:18.329
There's no sign of infection
where the foot was cut off.

35:18.455 --> 35:22.666
like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics
before amputating.

35:22.793 --> 35:25.544
At least he's looking after his patient.

35:26.922 --> 35:28.380
Hey, check this out.

35:30.467 --> 35:32.301
ls this appropriate?

35:33.970 --> 35:37.139
lt's our anniversary.
And it's the big one.

35:38.642 --> 35:40.476
Nina deserves the best.

35:42.979 --> 35:45.022
"Ox"?

35:45.148 --> 35:46.565
No.

35:46.691 --> 35:48.150
Fuck!

35:48.276 --> 35:51.111
What's the matter with you?
lt's Xs and Os.

35:51.238 --> 35:52.363
Like tic-tac-toe?

35:52.489 --> 35:55.199
No, like hugs and kisses.

35:55.325 --> 35:59.578
Diamond-filled hugs and kisses
in a white-gold setting.

36:00.622 --> 36:06.210
That's good. You wouldn't want it to look like
someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

36:09.881 --> 36:11.549
Goddamn it.

36:17.722 --> 36:20.099
- Where's Mom?
- She had to run a few errands

36:20.225 --> 36:22.434
before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

36:22.561 --> 36:25.020
But l'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

36:25.146 --> 36:27.231
l heard you two were up a lot last night.

36:27.357 --> 36:29.191
lt was that damn dog.

36:29.317 --> 36:32.152
Hey, Code, grown-up language
is for grown-ups.

36:32.279 --> 36:34.321
l don't think that dog will bother you anymore.

36:34.447 --> 36:35.990
How do you know?

36:36.116 --> 36:37.658
My mystic powers told me.

36:37.784 --> 36:40.578
l heard Lindsay Lohan say damn.

36:40.704 --> 36:43.080
All right, tell you what,
l'll make you a deal.

36:43.206 --> 36:45.958
When you become a rock star,
you can swear, too.

36:46.084 --> 36:48.627
Walter! Walter!

36:49.296 --> 36:51.380
You're right. He's gone.

36:53.717 --> 36:56.719
Where's my dog? What did you do with it?

37:13.486 --> 37:15.779
All right. Here he is.

37:16.656 --> 37:20.367
Just remember to walk him,
feed him, and love him,

37:20.493 --> 37:21.785
OK?

37:23.538 --> 37:26.582
My nieces are shy sometimes.
Girls, say thank you to Rita.

37:26.708 --> 37:28.375
- Thank Dexter.
- Thank Dexter.

37:29.628 --> 37:32.504
They already made a doggy bed,
sweaters. towels.

37:32.631 --> 37:35.424
lt actually looks more comfortable
than my bed.

37:35.550 --> 37:38.260
l knew this would be a perfect fit.

37:38.386 --> 37:41.388
You did a good thing, Rita. Thank Dexter.

37:46.603 --> 37:48.812
Harry was the only one who saw me,

37:48.939 --> 37:50.940
really saw me,

37:51.066 --> 37:52.816
so he taught me to hide.

37:53.777 --> 37:55.277
And that's what's kept me safe.

37:56.947 --> 38:00.240
But sometimes, l'm not sure
where Harry's vision of me ends

38:00.367 --> 38:02.034
and the real me starts.

38:03.536 --> 38:05.996
lf l'm just a collection
of learned behaviors,

38:06.122 --> 38:08.999
bits and pieces of Harry.
maybe my new friend is right,

38:09.125 --> 38:10.960
maybe l am a fraud.

38:26.351 --> 38:27.851
Hi.

38:27.978 --> 38:29.812
Hey.

38:34.150 --> 38:35.401
Where's Astor and Cody?

38:35.527 --> 38:40.155
They're passed out
in a sugar coma at Colleen's.

38:43.493 --> 38:45.202
Can l come in?

38:45.328 --> 38:47.830
Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry.

38:55.213 --> 38:58.882
l should warn you,
l haven't really been myself lately.

38:59.009 --> 39:02.177
Well, maybe l can cheer you up.

39:08.810 --> 39:11.020
Trick or treat.

39:16.359 --> 39:18.360
You look great.

39:23.575 --> 39:24.491
Who are you?

39:24.617 --> 39:26.493
Lara Croft.

39:27.537 --> 39:28.704
Tomb Raider.

39:31.249 --> 39:33.917
You raid tombs dressed like that?

39:34.044 --> 39:35.878
That's impressive.

39:37.088 --> 39:39.757
- What happened to Snow White?
- Well, l'm. . .

39:39.883 --> 39:41.800
l'm sick of her.

39:44.429 --> 39:47.514
You know, l never did
get to thank you

39:47.640 --> 39:50.059
for picking the kids up for me.

39:50.685 --> 39:52.144
You took care of your "errand"?

39:52.270 --> 39:53.437
Yes.

39:53.813 --> 39:57.149
The beagle has landed happily
in the arms of two loving girls.

39:57.275 --> 39:58.567
You are a superhero.

40:05.909 --> 40:10.454
lt was such an incredible feeling
rescuing that dog.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.040
You upset your neighbor.

40:14.793 --> 40:16.126
Fuck her.

40:19.089 --> 40:23.634
Well, l guess you're used to dealing with
people like her. right?

40:23.760 --> 40:25.385
Considerably worse.

40:26.137 --> 40:29.348
ls that why you haven't been yourself lately?

40:30.266 --> 40:33.310
There's a case
l just can't seem to get out of my mind.

40:35.188 --> 40:36.647
Well. . .

40:36.773 --> 40:39.024
Maybe l can help.

40:40.276 --> 40:43.904
No. l'm afraid
there's nothing you can do.

40:44.030 --> 40:46.865
Oh, l don't know.

40:46.991 --> 40:48.867
l'm a dognapper now. . .

40:48.993 --> 40:50.577
And a tomb raider.

40:50.703 --> 40:53.872
There's all sorts of things l can do.

41:06.469 --> 41:08.512
What. . . What are you doing?

41:09.472 --> 41:11.515
Whatever l want.

41:14.936 --> 41:16.019
l've come to appreciate

41:16.146 --> 41:20.816
the comfortable moments with Rita,
the easy, quiet moments.

41:23.194 --> 41:24.611
This. . .

41:26.197 --> 41:27.865
might be better.

41:31.161 --> 41:33.954
Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy
bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy

41:34.080 --> 41:35.998
another bucket of fried chicken.

41:43.339 --> 41:46.216
- Where's your brother?
- l'm not his keeper.

41:48.261 --> 41:50.137
What do you think of this?

41:53.057 --> 41:56.101
lt's an anniversary present for Nina.

41:56.227 --> 41:59.646
See, it's a diamond key to my heart.

42:00.899 --> 42:04.234
lt's a key. but. you see.
it's shaped like a heart.

42:04.360 --> 42:10.073
You can't tell me it looks like anything else, cos
that's what it is. That's what l like.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.242
And l'm not gonna take it back.

42:12.368 --> 42:15.412
lt's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.

42:16.748 --> 42:17.748
Really?

42:19.417 --> 42:21.710
l would.

42:25.673 --> 42:27.174
How do l look?

42:27.300 --> 42:29.134
Like the tie?

42:38.436 --> 42:40.062
Angel.

42:40.855 --> 42:42.606
Happy anniversary, baby.

42:43.733 --> 42:46.443
You know you can't just walk in here
anymore.

42:52.909 --> 42:54.368
l just thought. . .

42:56.371 --> 42:57.746
Our anniversary. . .

43:01.042 --> 43:04.169
Maybe tonight we could put all that
behind us.

43:05.088 --> 43:07.756
lt doesn't matter what night it is.

43:07.882 --> 43:09.591
l told you l need time.

43:10.009 --> 43:12.719
lt's been three months, baby.

43:13.763 --> 43:15.472
How much time do you need?

43:15.598 --> 43:18.141
Don't turn this around on me, Angel,

43:18.268 --> 43:19.935
not after what you did.

43:21.771 --> 43:24.106
l need as much time as l need.

43:39.497 --> 43:42.249
As long as you're here,
you want to see Aury?

44:34.552 --> 44:36.386
Thank Dexter.

44:51.778 --> 44:53.612
That was. . .

44:57.825 --> 44:59.159
unexpected.

45:00.620 --> 45:02.704
Yeah. For me, too.

45:06.667 --> 45:09.669
l have no problem with. . .

45:09.796 --> 45:11.046
unexpected.

45:13.007 --> 45:15.592
No, you certainly don't.

45:24.394 --> 45:26.353
l have to get back to the kids.

45:30.900 --> 45:32.734
Hey, what are these?

45:35.613 --> 45:39.074
l've been reorganizing my photos a little.

45:42.203 --> 45:44.621
Look how cute you are.

45:44.747 --> 45:47.040
And your dad, such a nice face,

45:47.166 --> 45:48.667
just like Dexter.

45:50.586 --> 45:52.129
l was adopted.

45:52.255 --> 45:54.214
l know.

45:54.340 --> 45:55.966
But you're both good men.

45:56.092 --> 45:58.093
l can tell.

46:03.224 --> 46:04.808
Very poetic.

46:04.934 --> 46:07.519
Poetic? lt's a water fountain.

46:08.604 --> 46:12.399
Yeah, but look at the way
your dad took the photo.

46:12.525 --> 46:17.028
His shadow's on the wall right next to Dexter.
lt's like he's always with Dexter.

46:17.780 --> 46:19.781
l'd frame this one.

46:21.284 --> 46:23.660
All this time the answer was right here.

46:23.786 --> 46:27.164
Harry. photographer
and foster father extraordinaire.

46:27.290 --> 46:29.499
He is always with me,

46:29.625 --> 46:31.751
and he's the common denominator.

46:34.505 --> 46:36.173
You're a genius.

46:38.634 --> 46:42.762
All those years of smiling for the camera,
it was empty and fake,

46:42.889 --> 46:44.931
the pictures meaningless.

46:45.057 --> 46:46.558
Until now.

46:47.602 --> 46:48.977
Pictures of Harry.

47:04.994 --> 47:06.703
So. . .

47:06.829 --> 47:08.538
This is it.

47:08.664 --> 47:10.665
lt's cool.

47:11.334 --> 47:12.459
Cool.

47:13.711 --> 47:16.755
Dexter, this is the place
where my father,

47:16.881 --> 47:19.591
your grandfather,
worked for 30 years.

47:20.635 --> 47:22.552
He started out as a janitor,

47:22.678 --> 47:25.013
worked his way up
to chief of maintenance.

47:25.139 --> 47:27.098
This place put food on our table.

47:28.059 --> 47:31.478
- ln two weeks, it'll all be shut down.
- l know.

47:31.604 --> 47:34.773
Excuse me, miss! Miss?
Would you mind?

47:34.899 --> 47:37.067
Oh, come on, Dad. l don't want to. . .

47:41.030 --> 47:42.906
Hey, you all right?

47:43.032 --> 47:46.076
lt's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch.
l'm OK.

47:46.202 --> 47:50.288
l'm sorry, miss. lt's OK. Thanks.
We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

47:50.414 --> 47:51.540
Yeah, we are.

47:51.666 --> 47:54.709
- l really don't feel like doing this now.
- Don't be a baby.

47:54.835 --> 47:59.047
Being part of a family
means smiling for family photos, right?

48:09.892 --> 48:11.601
My friend left this.

48:11.727 --> 48:13.979
He's showing me where to go.

48:15.314 --> 48:21.236
Am l going because it's what he wants
or because that's what Harry would want?

48:22.196 --> 48:24.447
And what do l want?

48:52.560 --> 48:56.313
Hospital's shut down now,
abandoned for years,

48:56.439 --> 48:59.107
but tonight it's visiting hours again.

49:30.890 --> 49:32.641
Well, James. . .

49:35.353 --> 49:37.896
Why did you have to be
such a pain in the ass?

49:44.070 --> 49:46.655
- Fuck!
- l didn't tell you you could get up.

50:05.466 --> 50:08.218
Please, please.

50:11.681 --> 50:13.390
Now you get up.

50:20.898 --> 50:23.650
You traumatize my little girl in church.

50:26.112 --> 50:28.363
Break the knees of my best turner.

50:31.200 --> 50:33.159
You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

50:36.163 --> 50:38.248
The only thing to do with a wild dog. . .

50:39.417 --> 50:41.668
Police! Hands in the air!

50:47.758 --> 50:49.175
Thought you could use backup.

50:49.301 --> 50:51.594
You could have filled me in, man. Shit.

50:54.265 --> 50:57.684
Got you going after a goddamn cop,
motherfucker.

50:57.810 --> 50:59.561
We own your ass now.

51:02.523 --> 51:06.901
So this was the plan all along,
to use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?

51:08.154 --> 51:11.239
Yeah, and now my sister
can rest in peace.

51:12.158 --> 51:14.117
We're done now, Doakes. We're even.

51:14.243 --> 51:16.953
- Fuck!
- l'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

51:18.080 --> 51:20.415
Get this piece of shit out of here.

51:57.620 --> 51:58.620
Please.

52:03.375 --> 52:04.626
Just do it.

52:07.546 --> 52:08.755
Kill me.

52:11.050 --> 52:18.640
l'm ready.

52:23.813 --> 52:26.231
Just don't cut me anymore.

52:29.819 --> 52:32.445
Please don't cut me anymore.

52:32.571 --> 52:35.406
Gift-wrapped and begging for death.

52:35.533 --> 52:36.699
Tools at the ready.

52:36.826 --> 52:38.201
Just kill me. lt's OK.

52:38.327 --> 52:41.120
He was left here so l would kill him,

52:41.247 --> 52:45.416
but my new friend doesn't see me
as clearly as he thinks.

52:45.543 --> 52:47.585
l can't kill this man.

52:47.711 --> 52:51.506
Harry wouldn't want it.
And neither would l.

53:13.362 --> 53:17.365
- Are you Morgan?
- Message came through dispatch for Dexter.

53:22.246 --> 53:24.414
Who left this?

53:26.041 --> 53:28.376
Who left it?

53:37.386 --> 53:40.096
Oh, Jesus, stop that. l'm getting bruises.

53:40.222 --> 53:42.098
l'm sorry. l'm so excited.

53:42.224 --> 53:44.225
Try a hug once in a while.

53:46.896 --> 53:50.481
l don't know who your contacts are, Morgan,
but you are my up-and-comer.

53:50.608 --> 53:53.234
You saved a man's life tonight.

53:53.360 --> 53:57.280
- l'm just the one who got the call, sir.
- But you followed it up.

53:57.406 --> 54:00.450
- Right place at the right time, sir.
- Where we at?

54:00.576 --> 54:04.037
Morgan's tip was good.
They're taking Tucci over to County.

54:04.163 --> 54:05.330
Alive?

54:05.748 --> 54:07.290
Alive.

54:13.422 --> 54:17.800
So, l suppose this gets Deb off
of surveillance-tape duty.

54:17.927 --> 54:19.928
Really? ls that what you suppose?

54:20.054 --> 54:21.763
l got your page, Lieutenant.

54:21.889 --> 54:24.098
Doakes is caught up
in the Guerrero bust.

54:24.224 --> 54:25.975
- You're taking point.
- You got it.

54:26.101 --> 54:29.020
l'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow.
l want forensic evidence.

54:29.146 --> 54:33.483
l don't care if you have to tear apart
this building brick by brick.

54:34.860 --> 54:36.277
Use Morgan here.

54:41.575 --> 54:43.952
How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?

54:44.078 --> 54:47.789
You were right. She loved it.
You nailed that one.

55:13.440 --> 55:16.484
Everyone hides who they are
at least some of the time.

55:20.864 --> 55:23.408
Sometimes you bury
that part of yourself so deeply

55:23.534 --> 55:26.494
that you have to be reminded
it's there at all.

55:37.047 --> 55:40.258
Good work, man.
l told you we'd get that son of a bitch. . .

55:43.846 --> 55:47.932
And sometimes you just want to forget
who you are altogether.

56:00.738 --> 56:03.197
And what about me?

56:03.323 --> 56:06.617
Maybe l'll never be the human
Harry wanted me to be. . .

56:07.828 --> 56:09.704
but l couldn't kill Tony Tucci.

56:10.956 --> 56:13.124
That's not me, either.

56:14.168 --> 56:18.629
My new friend thought l wouldn't be able
to resist the kill he left for me,

56:18.756 --> 56:20.757
but l did.

56:29.099 --> 56:31.559
l'm not the monster he wants me to be.

56:33.228 --> 56:35.897
So l'm neither man nor beast.

56:36.774 --> 56:39.275
l'm something new entirely,

56:39.401 --> 56:41.069
with my own set of rules.

56:50.329 --> 56:52.121
l'm Dexter.

56:54.249 --> 56:55.583
Boo.
