WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:04.217
Previously on Dexter. . .

00:06.053 --> 00:07.887
Open up, Perry, it's the police. Open up.

00:08.013 --> 00:10.139
Hey, Angel, l got him!

00:10.265 --> 00:11.933
They really found the ice-truck killer?

00:12.059 --> 00:14.435
l saw him, Dex. l chased him.

00:14.561 --> 00:20.108
The fun part was hanging them like cattle right
before l cut their throats.

00:20.234 --> 00:21.567
Son of a bitch.

00:21.694 --> 00:24.195
l have so many questions for him.

00:24.321 --> 00:26.989
What was his message to me?

00:27.116 --> 00:28.700
Now l need to know him.

00:28.826 --> 00:30.576
Hi.

00:30.703 --> 00:32.120
Fuck are you?

00:34.289 --> 00:36.499
Paul Bennett, father on parole.

00:36.625 --> 00:38.918
Dexter Morgan.

00:39.044 --> 00:40.920
l can't think of anything clever to say.

00:41.046 --> 00:45.675
Divorce papers. Sign them now, and l'll agree
to supervised visits twice a week.

00:45.801 --> 00:47.677
You think you can
really make me back down?

00:47.803 --> 00:49.679
Are you fucking my wife?

00:51.765 --> 00:53.933
l just wish he'd go away.

00:54.059 --> 00:56.352
Why can't he just go
away and disappear forever?

00:56.478 --> 01:01.816
All along, l thought this was a game
my alter ego and l were playing.

01:02.735 --> 01:08.948
But relationships change, evolve,
and this one's getting deep.

01:09.074 --> 01:12.493
l realize now my days are numbered.

01:12.619 --> 01:15.413
So l'd better make the most of them.

01:17.583 --> 01:19.375
Your instincts were dead-on.

01:19.501 --> 01:23.045
They're always dead-on when it
comes to killers. Why is that?

01:23.172 --> 01:24.756
l'm watching Dexter.

03:25.294 --> 03:30.047
- What are we looking at here?
- l'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.

03:30.716 --> 03:33.885
- You?
- No, it looks like a lobster. See the claws?

03:37.347 --> 03:40.141
Why do bloodstains always
look like crustaceans to you?

03:40.267 --> 03:41.267
l like seafood.

03:41.393 --> 03:44.896
Rorschach would say you have
a hard time relating to others.

03:45.772 --> 03:49.108
- Not as hard as her.
- lt does look like a suicide.

03:49.234 --> 03:51.068
Can l get some light in here, please?

03:51.194 --> 03:53.654
- Damn power outages.
- l don't know, Angel.

03:53.780 --> 03:55.448
Most firearm suicides
are committed by men.

03:55.574 --> 03:58.951
Women slash their wrists, take pills, something
more ladylike.

03:59.077 --> 03:59.994
Not in Miami.

04:00.120 --> 04:04.081
We closed a couple of suicide cases
just like this last year. remember?

04:10.297 --> 04:13.090
- Look at this mess.
- That's a fancy bathtub. Rich husband?

04:13.216 --> 04:16.052
Househusband and aspiring artist.

04:17.054 --> 04:20.139
- Promising. So, she supported him?
- lt looks like that.

04:20.265 --> 04:22.141
She was some kind of big-time prosecutor.

04:22.851 --> 04:26.145
Those other suicides we closed, those were
high-powered women, too, right?

04:26.271 --> 04:28.147
l don't know. l think so.

04:29.608 --> 04:31.275
Note to self.

04:32.819 --> 04:34.987
l don't care what it looks like.
somebody killed her.

04:35.113 --> 04:37.156
We're checking out all the possibilities.

04:37.282 --> 04:40.701
Was your wife dealing
with any emotional problem?

04:40.827 --> 04:44.205
You know. job stress, the usual,
but she was working through it in therapy.

04:44.331 --> 04:46.832
She have any other problems
that you're aware of?

04:46.959 --> 04:49.919
Are you listening to me?
Vanessa didn't kill herself.

04:50.045 --> 04:53.547
Criminals stage suicides.
Maybe one of the guys that she put away.

04:53.674 --> 04:56.676
- We'll check into it.
- We need your clothes for evidence.

04:56.802 --> 04:58.636
Standard procedure.

05:10.524 --> 05:12.692
l got to go.
There's a dead body in the house.

05:12.818 --> 05:14.527
There's a hot body in here.

05:14.653 --> 05:16.862
l so want to maul you right now.

05:16.989 --> 05:20.157
l so want you to.
Call me when you're done, OK?

05:20.283 --> 05:22.410
Yeah, l'll bring handcuffs.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.505
Morgan, what took you so long?

05:35.048 --> 05:36.966
Playing Hide the Salami
with Mr. Prosthetics?

05:37.092 --> 05:39.343
- l don't fuck and tell.
- since when?

05:39.469 --> 05:41.137
Can we go inside?
l'm kind of wet.

05:41.263 --> 05:42.596
Don't.

05:42.723 --> 05:46.976
see what you can find out about
the victim's relationship with her husband.

05:47.102 --> 05:50.396
- lt's always the husband. right?
- Looks like a suicide, but you never know.

05:50.522 --> 05:53.983
Younger guy, unemployed. Maybe he was
a boy toy. killed her for her money.

05:54.109 --> 05:55.568
l'm on it.

05:57.279 --> 05:59.739
He is sending you away
from a crime scene in the rain,

05:59.865 --> 06:01.198
and you're not putting up a fight?

06:01.324 --> 06:03.284
- l'm a team player.
- You are?

06:03.410 --> 06:06.245
Fuck you!

06:08.331 --> 06:10.875
Hey, Dex, come on in.

06:15.380 --> 06:18.174
- Where's Rita?
- She's stuck in traffic.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.259
Power's out in half the city.

06:20.385 --> 06:22.678
Of course, l love the extra kid time, but

06:23.722 --> 06:26.390
court supervisor - not so much.

06:28.769 --> 06:32.521
Hey, you know, l feel really bad
about the last time l was here.

06:32.647 --> 06:34.940
l didn't mean to get
all Alpha male on Dexter.

06:35.067 --> 06:39.361
What are you supposed to say to the guy
who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

06:40.906 --> 06:44.533
Sorry. Sorry l'm late.

06:44.659 --> 06:47.953
- Thanks for holding down the fort.
- Do you mind if l get going?

06:48.080 --> 06:51.373
- l got kids of my own at home to look after.
- No, it's OK.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.335
- Dexter and l are here now.
- Thanks. Bye, kids.

06:54.461 --> 06:57.171
- Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.
- They are?

06:57.297 --> 07:00.341
- Hey, l brought hot chocolate.
- Dad already made us some.

07:00.467 --> 07:02.426
With extra marshmallows.

07:02.552 --> 07:04.345
Tag. You're it!

07:04.471 --> 07:05.805
l'd love some hot chocolate.

07:05.931 --> 07:10.017
Take two. Looks like he's got extra.
Come here, buddy.

07:10.143 --> 07:15.022
Mom, can Dad stay
and put us to bed, please?

07:15.148 --> 07:18.359
- l think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.
- Dexter doesn't mind.

07:19.111 --> 07:22.363
Only a song. no story.
lt's way past your bedtime.

07:22.489 --> 07:26.325
All right. bedbugs.
let's leave these two alone.

07:26.451 --> 07:28.577
lt's not like they need a chaperone.

07:39.965 --> 07:42.633
Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian,
and now Vanessa Gayle.

07:42.968 --> 07:47.221
all three powerful women. all three
shot themselves in the past two years.

07:48.181 --> 07:52.351
They've got to have more in common than
career ambition and fondness for firearms.

07:52.477 --> 07:55.729
Why the sudden interest in suicides?

07:55.856 --> 07:58.190
Morbid curiosity.

07:58.316 --> 08:00.526
What can l do for you?

08:00.652 --> 08:02.444
So many things.

08:02.571 --> 08:05.114
l need the blood-spatter report
on Vanessa Gayle.

08:08.034 --> 08:11.912
Blood spatter's inconclusive.
All l can tell is she was shot at close range.

08:12.038 --> 08:15.541
- l wish l had more for Dexter.
- Me too.

08:16.293 --> 08:20.212
Maria, the D.A. needs the work sheet
for the ice-truck killer case.

08:20.338 --> 08:23.340
l'm working on it.
When'd you talk to the D.A.?

08:23.466 --> 08:24.717
We had dinner last night.

08:24.843 --> 08:30.181
Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate
Neil Perry's arrest. Hell of a good time.

08:33.393 --> 08:36.854
l'm the one who gets Perry to confess.
and he's got the mayor kissing his ass.

08:36.980 --> 08:38.063
l wouldn't be too upset.

08:38.190 --> 08:40.608
Matthews will be the one
with the egg on his face.

08:40.734 --> 08:44.403
- You still believe we got the wrong guy?
- Perry's the pretender to the throne.

08:44.529 --> 08:48.032
The real king is still out there,
and he'll kill again. lt's a matter of time.

08:48.158 --> 08:51.577
Or the ice-truck killer will use Perry
as a get out of jail free card.

08:55.123 --> 08:56.916
You really think that might happen?

08:57.042 --> 09:02.504
lf Perry's the wrong guy
and we let him take the fall, definitely.

09:03.548 --> 09:04.715
Thanks, Dexter.

09:05.550 --> 09:09.929
What if LaGuerta's right?
What if the ice-truck killer does disappear?

09:13.058 --> 09:16.268
No. He's got unfinished business with me.

09:16.394 --> 09:20.397
still. l can't just sit on my hands
waiting for something to happen.

09:21.608 --> 09:22.733
l need a distraction.

09:25.237 --> 09:29.406
Nothing like some little Debbies and
a worthy new adversary to clear my head.

09:34.746 --> 09:36.997
Talk to me, ladies.

09:37.123 --> 09:39.875
What do you have in common?

09:40.001 --> 09:43.963
Same sorority? Pilates instructor?

10:00.939 --> 10:04.233
Dr. Emmett Meridian.

10:08.780 --> 10:12.116
The three suicide sisters
shared the same therapist,

10:12.242 --> 10:14.493
Dr. Emmett Meridian.

10:15.662 --> 10:17.663
He must be terrible at his job.

10:29.843 --> 10:31.844
So far, he comes up squeaky clean,

10:31.970 --> 10:34.555
no malpractice suits.
no disgruntled patients.

10:34.681 --> 10:37.057
And l thought l was a master
at damage control.

10:37.183 --> 10:40.352
Perhaps l should schedule
a session with the good doctor

10:40.478 --> 10:43.022
and try out a little reverse psychology.

10:43.148 --> 10:45.524
Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

10:45.650 --> 10:48.110
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

10:48.236 --> 10:50.612
l expect the police
to show up when l call, right?

10:50.739 --> 10:53.824
The least l can do is clear
my lunch hour for a cop in need.

10:53.950 --> 10:57.661
So, what brought you here?

10:58.830 --> 11:00.372
A friend of mine died.

11:03.668 --> 11:05.002
She killed herself.

11:06.504 --> 11:08.464
l need to understand why.

11:08.590 --> 11:09.923
How come?

11:10.050 --> 11:11.884
She had everything going for her.
lt doesn't make sense.

11:12.010 --> 11:15.220
To some people.
death makes perfect sense.

11:15.347 --> 11:17.806
Life - now, that's the puzzle.

11:17.932 --> 11:19.767
Like you, Sean.

11:19.893 --> 11:22.227
What really brought you here?

11:22.354 --> 11:26.065
- l just told you l came...
- . .to talk about your friend's suicide, l know.

11:26.191 --> 11:30.027
l think you're using this suicide deal
as an excuse to come see me.

11:33.740 --> 11:35.324
You're absolutely right.

11:38.870 --> 11:40.412
How could you tell?

11:40.538 --> 11:43.874
l'm sensing you do it a lot
to keep the world at arm's length.

11:46.002 --> 11:47.753
And what are my real intentions?

11:52.258 --> 11:56.845
As soon as l pay for my lunch,
you're gonna tell me that.

11:56.971 --> 11:58.389
Excuse me a second.

11:58.515 --> 12:01.433
Judging from what l've seen
so far. l probably will.

12:01.559 --> 12:03.310
This guy's good.

12:03.436 --> 12:06.563
So why do his patients keep dying?

12:08.274 --> 12:12.945
Vanessa's estimated time of death
was Monday at seven p.m.

12:13.071 --> 12:15.697
Meridian was in session
with Scott Solomon.

12:15.824 --> 12:18.742
l wonder if Mr. Solomon kept
his appointment that night.

12:23.373 --> 12:28.085
So, we got almond chicken,
and pork fried rice.

12:29.504 --> 12:32.172
- Let's start with the basics. You married?
- No.

12:32.298 --> 12:35.217
- Girlfriend?
- Yes.

12:35.343 --> 12:36.385
Sex life?

12:38.054 --> 12:39.471
lt's personal.

12:39.597 --> 12:42.307
And this is therapy,
where we share personal things.

12:46.771 --> 12:50.274
You know. it might help me open up
if you shared something about yourself.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.984
Why did you become a psychiatrist?

12:53.403 --> 12:57.531
See what you just did?
Trying to take control like that?

12:59.617 --> 13:01.493
You probably get away with it
most of the time, right?

13:01.619 --> 13:05.497
That's a way of preventing other people
from getting close to Dexter.

13:05.623 --> 13:07.749
May l ask you something, Sean?

13:12.881 --> 13:14.798
Have you ever been close to anybody?

13:19.053 --> 13:21.472
My foster father.

13:23.183 --> 13:25.767
He's the only one
who ever really knew me.

13:25.894 --> 13:28.353
You're adopted?

13:28.480 --> 13:31.273
Harry took me in when l was three.

13:32.650 --> 13:37.237
So tell me about Harry. What kind of stuff
did you guys do together?

13:37.363 --> 13:39.781
You know, normal father/son stuff.

13:48.833 --> 13:50.667
All right. Stop. Enough.

13:54.005 --> 13:58.008
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine. l'm fine.

13:58.134 --> 14:00.219
Nice ambush.

14:00.345 --> 14:02.387
That was the perfect point of attack.

14:02.514 --> 14:06.141
l can't believe l finally got Dexter. l won.

14:08.186 --> 14:11.104
- This isn't a game, Dexter.
- No. l know.

14:11.231 --> 14:14.733
- lt's not supposed to be fun.
- Yeah. Yeah, it's just. . .

14:14.859 --> 14:17.319
You think l want to teach you these things?

14:17.445 --> 14:20.739
This is the only way l know
how to keep you out of an electric chair.

14:20.865 --> 14:25.285
This is about survival, Dex, nothing else.

14:25.411 --> 14:27.704
Got it?

14:44.180 --> 14:46.223
You've got a visitor, Perry.

14:46.349 --> 14:49.518
- Miss me?
- Don't flatter yourself.

14:49.644 --> 14:52.813
l have to comb through your case
before the trial.

14:52.939 --> 14:56.567
make sure l have my facts straight
on the notorious ice-truck killer.

14:57.902 --> 15:00.362
l confessed. What more do you need?

15:00.488 --> 15:01.613
The evidence to line up.

15:01.739 --> 15:05.701
We haven't matched your prints against
the partial on the lozenge wrapper

15:05.827 --> 15:07.119
we found at the abandoned hospital.

15:07.245 --> 15:10.414
Liquid nitrogen.
l use it to freeze the body parts.

15:10.540 --> 15:13.500
lt's extremely effective.
but it burns like a bitch.

15:16.379 --> 15:18.547
Or you knew your prints wouldn't match,

15:18.673 --> 15:22.342
so you purposely burned
your fingertips to hide it.

15:22.468 --> 15:24.219
Are you suggesting that l'm a liar?

15:24.345 --> 15:27.931
Just covering my bases, Neil.
We both want the same thing.

15:29.475 --> 15:31.476
Ten minutes alone with Angelina?

15:31.603 --> 15:33.437
To see you convicted.

15:36.608 --> 15:40.110
What's in it for me if l help you do your job?

15:42.822 --> 15:45.240
How about immortality?

15:49.746 --> 15:52.164
We found your mother's body
under your house.

15:52.290 --> 15:55.125
Now, you can go down
as a pathetic loser who killed Mom

15:56.336 --> 16:02.674
or the most heinous killer in Florida's history.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.593
Your choice.

16:08.931 --> 16:14.102
lf l'm going to become a legend,
l need to be memorialized.

16:14.228 --> 16:17.314
l want a reporter here
to interview me. Front page.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.483
You're not allowed to talk
to the press before the trial.

16:20.693 --> 16:26.490
lf you want me to cooperate,
l'm sure you'll find a way.

16:33.831 --> 16:37.417
Meridian had one thing right.
l do crave control.

16:37.543 --> 16:42.339
The longer the ice-truck killer maintains
radio silence. the less control l have.

16:43.716 --> 16:48.261
Craigslist. lt's desperate, l know, but apropos,

16:48.388 --> 16:51.264
personal ads are filled with desperation.

16:51.391 --> 16:55.268
"Tyler from Key West.
Speedos tanning on the beach.

16:55.395 --> 16:57.437
"Touched your tits on Friday night."

16:57.563 --> 16:59.898
At least these folks aren't just standing by

17:00.024 --> 17:03.485
waiting for something
to happen, and neither am l.

17:06.364 --> 17:09.825
"Dear Ken, l'm in pieces.

17:09.951 --> 17:13.954
"Why the cold shoulder?
Love, Barbie."

17:30.138 --> 17:32.097
Hey, l got it.

17:33.891 --> 17:37.310
- Thanks.
- Hey, l know Dexter. Monday night at Meridian's.

17:37.437 --> 17:40.063
You're always leaving your seven o'clock
when l'm arriving for my eight o'clock.

17:40.189 --> 17:43.275
- You missed last week, right?
- No. l was there.

17:43.401 --> 17:46.653
- l don't remember ever seeing you, though.
- How do you like him?

17:46.779 --> 17:48.155
Meridian?

17:48.281 --> 17:50.282
Best thing that's ever happened to me. . .

17:50.408 --> 17:52.784
So far.

17:52.910 --> 17:55.203
How about you? You finding him helpful?

17:55.329 --> 17:57.831
l'm a sociopath.
There's not much he can do for me.

17:57.957 --> 18:00.459
Cute and funny.

18:00.585 --> 18:02.502
Let me guess - taken.

18:02.628 --> 18:05.464
- Girlfriend.
- Lucky girl.

18:05.590 --> 18:08.425
Well, thanks for the help,
but l can handle it from here.

18:08.551 --> 18:09.760
All right.

18:09.886 --> 18:12.971
So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

18:13.097 --> 18:15.974
My sexual hang-ups
and control issues aside,

18:16.100 --> 18:21.146
l need a follow-up appointment
to dig a little deeper.

18:21.272 --> 18:24.107
lsn't that what therapy's all about?

18:58.434 --> 19:00.185
Oh, my God.

19:00.311 --> 19:02.687
l love your body.

19:06.609 --> 19:08.985
l love your legs.

19:10.822 --> 19:12.656
l love your arms.

19:14.575 --> 19:16.993
l couldn't have made them better myself.

19:22.166 --> 19:23.750
Are you crying?

19:25.336 --> 19:26.837
l'm fine.

19:28.923 --> 19:30.882
Then what?

19:32.885 --> 19:34.845
l don't know.

19:37.640 --> 19:41.142
l'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.

19:41.269 --> 19:44.563
Everything about you is hot.

19:47.149 --> 19:49.359
Tell me what you're feeling.

19:55.241 --> 19:57.033
lt's. . .

19:59.078 --> 20:01.204
lt's just. . .

20:01.330 --> 20:04.040
Every time l've ever
been naked with someone. . .

20:06.836 --> 20:09.045
. .we just fuck.

20:10.756 --> 20:13.842
But not this time?

20:13.968 --> 20:16.970
lt's different.

20:17.096 --> 20:18.597
lt feels like. . .

20:20.975 --> 20:24.436
l hate saying this.
lt sounds so fucking cheesy.

20:24.562 --> 20:27.689
lt feels like making love.

20:32.862 --> 20:33.862
Yes.

20:36.240 --> 20:39.326
But promise me you'll never say that again.

20:39.452 --> 20:43.705
What if l do? Are you gonna cry about it?

20:46.167 --> 20:48.168
You're so fucked up.

20:48.294 --> 20:50.962
What's up, rock star?

20:55.217 --> 20:57.260
Look at Dexter. What you doing? Hey.

20:59.221 --> 21:00.472
Where's the supervisor?

21:00.598 --> 21:02.682
Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.

21:02.808 --> 21:05.185
Who wants to play Monster Tag?

21:05.311 --> 21:06.269
- l do.
- Yeah?

21:06.395 --> 21:08.480
l'm coming after Dexter.

21:08.606 --> 21:10.815
You better run.

21:10.942 --> 21:13.485
You know you're not
allowed unsupervised visits.

21:13.611 --> 21:16.571
l know. Big bad Paul needs a baby-sitter.

21:17.573 --> 21:18.782
lt's your day off, right?

21:19.784 --> 21:23.161
Now, would it really be so terrible
if we spent time with our kids together?

21:23.287 --> 21:27.207
- l have a lunch date with Dexter.
- Come on. lt'll be fun.

21:28.501 --> 21:30.293
Mom, Dad, come on.

21:36.092 --> 21:39.052
l guess l could call Dexter.

21:39.178 --> 21:42.347
lt's official. l'm nominating
you for Mom Of The Year.

21:43.641 --> 21:47.143
Here comes the monster.
Here comes the monster.

21:53.234 --> 21:55.527
Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks,

21:55.653 --> 21:58.196
l don't always keep others at a distance.

21:58.322 --> 22:00.740
Things are looking up already.

22:02.118 --> 22:04.411
"Hey, Barbie. How'd you like to suck my cock?"

22:04.537 --> 22:06.705
Or not.

22:06.831 --> 22:10.750
Clearly nobody here is
my missing partner in crime.

22:12.003 --> 22:13.962
Hey, what's up?
You were looking for me?

22:14.088 --> 22:16.423
What did forensics come back
with on Vanessa Gayle?

22:16.549 --> 22:19.134
Gunpowder on her hand,
none on her husband's,

22:19.260 --> 22:22.053
high-angle trajectory,
drugs in the tox screen.

22:22.179 --> 22:25.557
- lt all points to suicide.
- No chance it was murder?

22:25.683 --> 22:28.143
Too bad, huh?
l had the husband pegged, too.

22:28.269 --> 22:30.603
Was hoping he could help me
score my own sugar mama.

22:30.730 --> 22:31.730
Try Craigslist.

22:31.856 --> 22:36.151
l already did,
nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

22:40.156 --> 22:45.285
Miami Metro can close this case
as a suicide, but l'm still not convinced.

22:45.411 --> 22:48.872
Maybe my new therapist can shed
some light on my doubts.

22:50.708 --> 22:52.709
You seem on edge today.

22:54.879 --> 22:58.339
- l'm not getting what l came here for.
- What'd you come here for?

22:59.550 --> 23:02.427
We established in our last visit
that it wasn't to talk about suicide.

23:02.553 --> 23:06.056
- Or feelings.
- Heaven forbid.

23:06.891 --> 23:09.559
- So, what do you want to talk about?
- Fakes.

23:11.896 --> 23:14.606
People who pass themselves off
as something they're not.

23:14.732 --> 23:18.026
- Like a pre-owned-car salesman?
- A brave politician.

23:18.861 --> 23:22.739
- A Jew for Jesus.
- A wolf in sheep's clothing.

23:24.241 --> 23:25.909
ls that how you feel, Sean?

23:26.869 --> 23:30.955
- Like you're hiding a dark secret?
- No. l wasn't talking about me.

23:31.082 --> 23:32.874
Who were you talking about?

23:40.132 --> 23:41.883
Dexter.

23:43.385 --> 23:45.804
That's a common first-time
reaction to therapy.

23:45.930 --> 23:47.806
You think l can't care about you,

23:47.932 --> 23:50.850
that l'm only pretending to care
because l have another motive.

23:50.976 --> 23:53.645
- Bingo.
- You got me.

23:53.771 --> 23:56.815
l do have another motive.
lt's called a paycheck.

23:56.941 --> 24:00.652
But that doesn't mean that l can't care
for my patients or enjoy my job.

24:00.778 --> 24:03.113
How are things at your job?

24:04.281 --> 24:06.074
Frustrating, to tell you the truth.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.244
- What kind of forensics do you do?
- Blood spatter.

24:09.370 --> 24:10.954
Most people can't stand blood.

24:12.081 --> 24:13.498
l hate it.

24:13.624 --> 24:17.085
Categorizing and analyzing
must be very soothing for Dexter.

24:19.130 --> 24:21.673
Yeah, it is, actually.

24:21.799 --> 24:24.676
So, OK, how are things with your girlfriend?

24:24.802 --> 24:27.220
She canceled lunch with me
to be with her ex-husband.

24:28.472 --> 24:30.932
Sounds like things are out
of your control right now.

24:31.058 --> 24:33.351
No wonder you cut yourself
off from your emotions.

24:33.477 --> 24:35.520
That way you never have to feel powerless.

24:35.646 --> 24:37.939
So, then, what should l do?

24:38.482 --> 24:42.068
Accept that certain things
are out of your hands. Let go.

24:45.072 --> 24:47.407
Hey, Morgan. l can't believe,
out of two million sperm,

24:47.533 --> 24:49.159
you were the fastest swimmer.

24:49.994 --> 24:52.704
What are you gonna do about it?

24:52.830 --> 24:54.372
l wanted to kill him, Dad.

24:54.498 --> 24:58.126
lt must have been tough
for you to walk away, son.

24:58.252 --> 25:00.211
l'm proud that you did that.

25:00.337 --> 25:03.256
Don't be, 'cause l still want to kill him.

25:03.382 --> 25:05.592
When's that gonna go away?

25:07.887 --> 25:10.763
l think l have everything
l need. Mr. Perry.

25:10.890 --> 25:12.223
When's the story gonna run?

25:12.349 --> 25:15.393
Well, they're saving space
for tomorrow, front page.

25:15.519 --> 25:17.395
l just got to get back and write.

25:17.521 --> 25:20.815
Thanks so much for your time.

25:22.693 --> 25:24.903
- How was your interview?
- lt was fine.

25:25.029 --> 25:26.863
You ready to talk about the case?

25:26.989 --> 25:30.909
Sure, as soon as l get
to talk to a reporter.

25:31.035 --> 25:32.243
You just did.

25:32.369 --> 25:33.578
Oh, give me a break.

25:33.704 --> 25:36.623
That poser was one of your
cop buddies. but nice try.

25:36.749 --> 25:41.336
ln case you forgot, Neil,
you're the one in jail. l call the shots.

25:41.462 --> 25:43.796
l could invoke my Miranda rights
at any time and lawyer up.

25:43.923 --> 25:46.883
lf you wanted a lawyer,
you'd have one by now.

25:50.054 --> 25:52.972
l know your game, Lieutenant.

25:53.098 --> 25:55.767
You think l'm a fraud
and you're trying to prove it,

25:55.893 --> 25:59.437
but the truth is you're the fraud.

26:01.232 --> 26:02.774
You know what, Neil?

26:02.900 --> 26:04.943
l'm really not in the mood for your shit today.

26:05.069 --> 26:06.736
l found out how you got promoted.

26:13.869 --> 26:16.788
Back when you and Sergeant Doakes
were still partners,

26:16.914 --> 26:20.083
Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer,
brought you along for the ride.

26:20.209 --> 26:21.459
How did you get. . .

26:21.585 --> 26:23.795
When the perp bailed
from a third-story apartment,

26:23.921 --> 26:25.004
Doakes took the fire escape,

26:25.130 --> 26:28.091
sent you to cover the stairs just in case.

26:28.217 --> 26:31.970
Only. . .you got lucky

26:32.096 --> 26:36.349
and you made the headline grab,
and so the legend began.

26:36.475 --> 26:39.602
l wonder if Doakes would have
made a good lieutenant.

26:41.563 --> 26:45.400
- l deserved that promotion.
- l'm sure you did. lt was a big bust.

26:46.402 --> 26:50.780
Not as big as catching me, of course,
but, let's be honest.

26:50.906 --> 26:55.076
You didn't catch me. Your captain did.

27:00.749 --> 27:03.459
At least that's what
they're saying on the news.

27:11.051 --> 27:14.887
My therapist wants me to accept
the things that are out of my hands.

27:15.014 --> 27:18.266
Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands.

27:18.392 --> 27:19.767
Not if l can find proof

27:19.893 --> 27:24.772
that the death of at least three women
under his care was not a coincidence.

27:31.196 --> 27:32.780
Breaking and entering.

27:45.502 --> 27:47.712
l hope he got my good side.

27:55.304 --> 27:59.015
Now, what's he recording
for posterity's sake?

28:11.904 --> 28:14.989
Goodbye, Dexter.

28:16.450 --> 28:19.035
Hello, ladies.

28:20.537 --> 28:23.373
l need another prescription.

28:23.499 --> 28:26.751
l'm sorry, Vanessa. l can't do that.

28:26.877 --> 28:30.463
Just one more, please.

28:30.589 --> 28:33.966
We talked about this.

28:34.093 --> 28:37.053
The antidepressants
were a temporary crutch

28:37.179 --> 28:40.473
so that you could start
taking steps on your own.

28:40.599 --> 28:43.976
But you don't understand.
l can't do this on my own.

28:44.103 --> 28:46.729
l can't even get out of fucking bed.

28:50.359 --> 28:54.070
l just. . . l want to die.

28:54.196 --> 28:56.864
Look at me.

28:56.990 --> 29:00.034
l understand the appeal of death, OK?

29:00.160 --> 29:02.787
No more pain.

29:02.913 --> 29:06.249
All the career pressure,
the hopelessness, gone.

29:07.835 --> 29:11.129
ln many cultures, there's no stigma
attached to taking one's life.

29:11.255 --> 29:15.508
Suicide's respected, even revered
as a matter of personal conscience.

29:17.636 --> 29:19.095
How do most people do it?

29:19.221 --> 29:22.723
Well, painkillers are the most common.

29:22.850 --> 29:25.017
But they're entirely unreliable.

29:25.144 --> 29:28.479
The truly courageous of heart. . .

29:28.605 --> 29:30.398
use guns.

29:32.609 --> 29:37.238
You took women who trusted you
at their weakest possible moment,

29:37.364 --> 29:40.783
but rather than help them.
you suggested they end it all.

29:40.909 --> 29:44.328
God, you even gave them
permission to use a gun.

29:44.455 --> 29:47.373
You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

29:47.499 --> 29:50.251
Create their drug addiction, pull them off,

29:50.377 --> 29:54.172
then fill their addled heads
with noble thoughts of suicide.

29:54.298 --> 29:57.091
l think l've had a breakthrough in therapy.

30:08.103 --> 30:11.439
Hey, l got your texts. ls everything. . .

30:15.319 --> 30:17.028
. .OK?

30:17.154 --> 30:20.406
lt is now.

30:20.532 --> 30:23.242
OK, just. l wanted to see Dexter.

30:23.368 --> 30:27.830
l felt bad about missing lunch
to be with Paul and the kids.

30:27.956 --> 30:30.374
l hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

30:30.501 --> 30:33.461
No, of course not.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.257
How'd it go?

30:38.383 --> 30:42.512
Really good and incredibly scary.

30:42.638 --> 30:46.474
For the first time in a long while,
l saw how easy it would be

30:46.600 --> 30:48.893
for me to fall back into my old life.

30:49.019 --> 30:50.478
Why is that scary?

30:50.604 --> 30:55.149
Because. . . l like my new life.

30:55.275 --> 30:58.694
And l finally feel like l'm in control.
l never felt that way with Paul.

31:00.197 --> 31:01.822
l do with Dexter.

31:09.206 --> 31:10.831
This is a disaster.

31:10.958 --> 31:13.167
l chose Rita because she was damaged.

31:13.293 --> 31:16.003
lf she gets better, l'll lose her for sure.

31:20.050 --> 31:21.968
l'm ready, Dexter.

31:32.896 --> 31:35.106
l don't know what l've been so afraid of.

31:35.232 --> 31:38.025
You're the perfect boyfriend.

31:44.199 --> 31:46.742
l want you to spend the night, for real.

31:55.252 --> 31:56.836
l'm so sorry.

31:58.380 --> 32:00.965
l came over here because
l thought something was wrong.

32:01.091 --> 32:04.594
But tonight's really not a good night.

32:05.470 --> 32:08.764
l'm right in the middle of a case.
l'm way too distracted.

32:09.349 --> 32:11.809
Now? lt's so late.

32:11.935 --> 32:15.271
That's all the more reason to get back to work.

32:15.397 --> 32:18.190
The clock's ticking.

32:18.317 --> 32:19.942
Here.

32:21.945 --> 32:26.282
But l'll call you tomorrow. OK?

32:28.201 --> 32:29.660
OK.

32:32.581 --> 32:33.831
Shit.

32:33.957 --> 32:35.374
l can't have sex with Rita.

32:35.500 --> 32:40.171
Every time l sleep with a woman,
she sees me for what l really am. Empty.

32:40.297 --> 32:43.299
And then she's gone.

32:45.969 --> 32:51.265
But l don't want Rita to go.
which means l have to deal with this.

32:51.391 --> 32:55.853
l can't kill Meridian yet.
l need another therapy session.

33:12.996 --> 33:15.790
Stay where you are. l'm armed.

33:17.876 --> 33:19.293
With bad puns?

33:24.925 --> 33:26.884
You said you needed a favor. What's up?

33:27.010 --> 33:28.344
Take off your pants.

33:28.470 --> 33:30.262
Oh, l should have known
it was that kind of favor.

33:30.389 --> 33:34.475
- You never ask me to come by before work.
- No. but l like the way you think.

33:34.601 --> 33:38.354
l have a patient who lost
both her legs in a car accident,

33:38.480 --> 33:39.897
Really brutal.

33:40.023 --> 33:42.441
Like your mom?

33:42.567 --> 33:45.611
Which is why l want to do
something special for her.

33:45.737 --> 33:50.741
l want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs.

33:50.867 --> 33:52.284
- Yours.
- No.

33:52.411 --> 33:54.578
- Let me just take a cast.
- No way. No.

33:54.705 --> 33:57.707
lt'll take 20 minutes, tops.
Come on. please?

33:57.833 --> 34:01.085
Stop being such a chick.

34:01.211 --> 34:03.212
Sit down.

34:23.066 --> 34:24.442
Feels good.

34:37.914 --> 34:39.415
Can l make one of your cock?

34:39.541 --> 34:42.126
That'd be a hell of a story
to tell the bullpen, huh?

34:42.252 --> 34:45.087
Not likely.

34:45.213 --> 34:46.922
l haven't told anyone about us.

34:47.048 --> 34:49.967
Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?

34:50.093 --> 34:54.013
- Not even a little.
- Then why?

34:56.433 --> 34:59.185
l guess this matters to me.

34:59.311 --> 35:02.980
So if l talk about it and it goes away,

35:03.106 --> 35:05.941
l'm actually losing something.

35:09.488 --> 35:10.571
ls that retarded?

35:13.742 --> 35:15.576
No.

35:15.702 --> 35:20.331
l got to tell you, l'm not going anywhere.

35:20.457 --> 35:23.292
Seriously?

35:30.175 --> 35:33.761
And neither are you,

35:33.887 --> 35:36.263
'cause l got your leg.

35:47.859 --> 35:49.318
Where the hell you been?

35:49.444 --> 35:52.696
- With my boyfriend.
- Boyfriend?

35:52.823 --> 35:55.783
Yep. We just fucked in his office.

35:55.909 --> 35:59.036
And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

35:59.162 --> 36:03.165
- You looking for me?
- Yeah. Shut the door.

36:06.795 --> 36:11.215
Did you tell anyone about our bust,
the one that got me promoted?

36:11.341 --> 36:12.675
No.

36:14.219 --> 36:15.553
Nobody in the press?

36:15.679 --> 36:17.721
Maria, we talked about this
when it happened.

36:17.848 --> 36:20.516
lt would fuck up your rep
and make me look like a whiny bitch.

36:20.642 --> 36:22.268
lt's bad for both of us.

36:22.394 --> 36:25.396
so then the only way
to access that information

36:25.522 --> 36:27.565
would be to read to police report, right?

36:27.691 --> 36:29.608
l guess.

36:32.028 --> 36:34.196
We have to have our firewall checked.

36:36.366 --> 36:39.660
She was sitting on top of me,
basically naked...

36:42.205 --> 36:45.040
. .asking me to spend the night,

36:45.166 --> 36:46.709
and l didn't know what to do.

36:46.835 --> 36:49.587
lt's OK, Sean. Don't beat yourself up.

36:49.713 --> 36:53.799
Your girlfriend really means
something to Dexter. l know that.

36:53.925 --> 36:56.176
lf she means something.
why did l run away from her?

36:56.303 --> 36:58.470
The same reason you work so hard
to shut everybody else out.

36:58.597 --> 37:00.431
You're afraid they won't like what they see.

37:00.557 --> 37:02.391
Yeah, l think you're right.

37:04.394 --> 37:05.603
How can l change that?

37:05.729 --> 37:07.730
Well, for starters, you accept the fact

37:07.856 --> 37:11.108
that we all have a big, bad wolf
hiding inside of us.

37:11.234 --> 37:13.944
a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

37:14.070 --> 37:15.446
Do you?

37:15.572 --> 37:17.197
Of course l do.

37:19.284 --> 37:20.284
Really?

37:21.912 --> 37:23.954
And how do you deal with your wolf?

37:24.080 --> 37:27.833
Well, first of all, l accepted that it was there.

37:27.959 --> 37:29.877
l made friends with it.

37:31.588 --> 37:35.549
And now l just let it out
for a big meal once in a while.

37:35.675 --> 37:38.928
At least three times that we know about.

37:40.889 --> 37:42.848
Can we get back to the sex thing?

37:42.974 --> 37:44.141
This is all about sex.

37:44.267 --> 37:47.186
The reason you avoid sexual intimacy

37:47.312 --> 37:49.271
is because you don't want
to surrender control.

37:49.397 --> 37:50.898
No, l've surrendered control.

37:51.024 --> 37:55.027
lt's not like my girlfriend hasn't been,
you know. south of the border.

37:55.153 --> 37:57.655
That's not what l'm talking about. lntimacy. . .

37:59.282 --> 38:01.659
Really letting go, face-to-face.

38:01.785 --> 38:04.036
There's nothing more difficult than that.

38:04.162 --> 38:09.041
The minute you start to accept who you are,
you just might feel free enough

38:09.167 --> 38:10.960
to share that intimacy together.

38:19.803 --> 38:20.928
What are you doing?

38:21.054 --> 38:23.222
l'd like to talk you through
a deep-relaxation technique.

38:23.348 --> 38:25.641
lt might bring some things to the surface.

38:25.767 --> 38:27.309
What kinds of things?

38:28.645 --> 38:31.522
There must have been a time
in your life when you felt powerless.

38:31.648 --> 38:35.693
Foster child, no control over your destiny.

38:35.819 --> 38:38.237
lf we can bring some
of those memories to the surface,

38:38.363 --> 38:40.030
we might find the root of your control issues.

38:40.156 --> 38:44.660
First, l want you to close your eyes
and focus on your breathing.

38:44.786 --> 38:47.037
l want you to count each breath, OK?

38:47.163 --> 38:51.083
ln, one, and out, two.

38:51.209 --> 38:53.043
Just give it a try.

38:54.045 --> 38:56.922
This is ridiculous.
l could be killing him right now.

38:57.048 --> 38:58.716
Now l want you to think of a time

39:01.761 --> 39:06.682
when you felt completely
and totally powerless.

39:13.815 --> 39:16.066
Hey, Morgan. You still fucking your sister?

39:16.192 --> 39:17.609
Leave me alone, Josh.

39:25.869 --> 39:28.037
l told you to walk away.

39:29.205 --> 39:30.914
God damn it, Dexter.

39:31.041 --> 39:33.792
There are consequences
to everything you do in life.

39:34.711 --> 39:38.255
Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.

39:38.381 --> 39:39.548
l found the grave, son.

39:39.674 --> 39:41.175
You're saying l'll be like this forever.

39:45.096 --> 39:47.139
Mommy!

39:49.684 --> 39:50.893
l have to get out of here.

39:51.019 --> 39:53.854
Hey, hey. Sean, come here.

40:13.374 --> 40:15.584
Oh, my God.

40:19.089 --> 40:21.131
Are you OK?

41:06.427 --> 41:08.762
Stay. Stay with me.

42:14.412 --> 42:15.913
You're sweet.

42:18.750 --> 42:20.375
l am?

42:20.501 --> 42:23.921
Next time, we'll figure out
what to tell the kids

42:24.047 --> 42:27.174
so you don't have to sneak out like this.

42:29.260 --> 42:32.095
You want there to be a next time?

42:32.972 --> 42:35.265
And a time after that.

42:37.060 --> 42:38.477
Don't you?

42:43.524 --> 42:47.402
No. l mean, yeah.

42:47.528 --> 42:49.529
l just. . .

42:53.076 --> 42:55.285
l didn't freak you out?

42:57.413 --> 42:59.748
Why would you think that?

42:59.874 --> 43:03.335
Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that
would scare me away.

43:17.767 --> 43:19.476
l really hope you came to apologize.

43:19.602 --> 43:21.645
Nope. l came for a consult.

43:21.771 --> 43:24.064
And you brought beverages?

43:24.190 --> 43:26.149
l got this on loan from the morgue.

43:26.276 --> 43:29.111
Now, l could use an expert opinion,

43:29.237 --> 43:31.613
specifically, your expert opinion.

43:31.739 --> 43:35.117
See, we can't figure out

43:35.243 --> 43:37.869
exactly how the killer cut off this head.

43:38.037 --> 43:39.997
Can you?

43:40.123 --> 43:41.832
Nope.

43:41.958 --> 43:45.002
Really? l think you can.

43:45.128 --> 43:47.045
l mean, you chop people up, don't you?

43:47.171 --> 43:48.672
Maybe you need a closer look.

43:48.798 --> 43:51.133
No. Keep it away.

43:57.140 --> 43:59.016
l talked to the medical examiner.

43:59.142 --> 44:01.059
He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

44:01.185 --> 44:03.061
Said it might have been a heart attack.

44:03.187 --> 44:05.397
- l killed her.
- You don't have the balls.

44:05.523 --> 44:08.358
l mean, you had to wait
till she died to chop her up.

44:08.484 --> 44:12.529
And even then you were too
squeamish to cut off her head.

44:12.655 --> 44:16.074
Not exactly the same
as stuffing roadkill, is it?

44:16.200 --> 44:17.743
Oh, fuck Dexter.

44:17.869 --> 44:20.829
Serial killers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?

44:20.955 --> 44:23.248
Especially the ice-truck killer.

44:23.374 --> 44:27.711
You know. you're not the first groupie
to take credit for someone else's work.

44:27.837 --> 44:29.046
Oh, bullshit.

44:29.172 --> 44:30.464
l know details about the case,

44:30.590 --> 44:32.257
things that weren't
published in the newspapers.

44:32.383 --> 44:34.885
That's because you hacked
into our computer system.

44:35.011 --> 44:36.887
l had the lT guys check our firewall.

44:37.013 --> 44:39.639
The DMZ was breached.
You read all our police reports.

44:39.766 --> 44:42.559
You even got yourself
a nice paneled car last month.

44:42.685 --> 44:43.894
Nice touch, by the way.

44:44.020 --> 44:45.228
Why are you doing this?

44:45.355 --> 44:48.231
Because you're not a killer.

44:48.358 --> 44:51.860
You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?

44:56.991 --> 44:59.868
Maybe you need another look.

44:59.994 --> 45:02.120
No, take it away.

45:04.707 --> 45:08.043
All right, l lied, OK?

45:10.213 --> 45:13.924
Just, l need you to take it away from me. . .

45:15.551 --> 45:16.885
. .please.

45:27.438 --> 45:29.439
So, what's on your mind, Lieutenant?

45:29.565 --> 45:31.858
We got a lot to get done
before Perry's trial.

45:31.984 --> 45:35.612
Yeah, about that trial,
l've got some bad news.

45:35.738 --> 45:38.782
Perry recanted his confession this morning.

45:38.908 --> 45:40.700
What are you talking about?

45:40.827 --> 45:43.370
l was going over some details
with him at County,

45:43.496 --> 45:46.123
and he admitted that
he gave us a false confession.

45:47.375 --> 45:48.792
He's a wannabe, Tom.

45:48.918 --> 45:51.336
Just wanted his 1 5 minutes, that's all.

45:51.462 --> 45:53.422
How do you know which time he was lying?

45:55.258 --> 45:57.634
All due respect, Maria,
if we dropped charges

45:57.760 --> 46:02.139
every time someone recanted his confession,
our jails would be empty.

46:02.265 --> 46:03.807
We're going to trial.

46:03.933 --> 46:07.269
All due respect. Captain.
that's really not up to Dexter.

46:08.896 --> 46:11.314
lt's up to the DA.

46:11.441 --> 46:13.608
l understand your frustration, Maria,

46:13.734 --> 46:16.987
but l reviewed the DA worksheets.
The evidence is compelling.

46:17.113 --> 46:18.989
We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

46:24.579 --> 46:26.955
Fair enough.

46:27.081 --> 46:30.167
lf that's what you two want, l'm fully behind it.

46:30.293 --> 46:33.128
l was really worried about Dexter.
You sure you're all right?

46:33.254 --> 46:36.506
l called your house but l think
the number you gave me didn't work.

46:36.632 --> 46:39.676
You wouldn't have reached me anyway,
'cause l was at my girlfriend's.

46:42.430 --> 46:45.724
l spent the night, face-to-face.

46:45.850 --> 46:49.811
Sean, that's very good.

46:49.937 --> 46:52.689
lt's all good, Doctor.

46:52.815 --> 46:54.524
l even stopped worrying
about that friend of mine

46:54.650 --> 46:55.775
who's been out of touch.

46:55.902 --> 46:57.611
You can't control other people, you know?

46:57.737 --> 47:00.238
This is a real breakthrough.
You should be proud of yourself.

47:00.364 --> 47:02.282
l am proud.

47:08.331 --> 47:09.414
Truth be told,

47:09.540 --> 47:12.876
l never expected to make progress in therapy.

47:13.002 --> 47:14.127
That's not true.

47:14.253 --> 47:15.545
lf that were true,

47:15.671 --> 47:19.174
you never would have come
in here in the first place.

47:21.093 --> 47:22.719
What do you want to focus on today?

47:22.845 --> 47:24.888
l'm glad you asked that.

47:31.145 --> 47:32.938
l'm gonna tell you something

47:33.064 --> 47:35.315
that l've never told anyone before.

47:35.441 --> 47:37.108
OK.

47:38.903 --> 47:41.112
l'm a serial killer.

47:45.034 --> 47:48.495
Oh, God.

47:48.621 --> 47:53.875
Oh, that feels so amazing to say out loud.

47:54.919 --> 47:57.629
Well, you must be letting go, 'cause
l've never heard you make a joke before.

47:57.755 --> 48:00.048
l'm not joking. l kill people.

48:02.218 --> 48:03.343
There it is again.

48:06.806 --> 48:09.182
You should try it.

48:09.308 --> 48:10.850
l know.

48:10.977 --> 48:15.522
Your big, bad wolf has racked up
a tidy little death toll.

48:17.775 --> 48:21.319
l'm just kidding. l disabled the cameras,
and l copied the files.

48:21.445 --> 48:23.697
l don't know what you're talking about.

48:23.823 --> 48:25.782
Then focus on your breathing,
and maybe you'll remember.

48:25.908 --> 48:27.325
Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.

48:27.451 --> 48:31.413
- Those sessions are confidential.
- l'm a control freak, l know.

48:31.539 --> 48:32.872
But l watched your home movies.

48:32.999 --> 48:36.293
lt's amazing stuff.
Drugs, guns, and a crazy psychiatrist.

48:36.419 --> 48:39.379
No wonder you're so well versed
in control issues.

48:39.505 --> 48:41.423
You got quite the God complex.

48:42.675 --> 48:44.551
This session's over.

48:53.477 --> 48:55.520
Not so fast, Doc.

49:14.707 --> 49:16.708
You're awake.

49:16.834 --> 49:19.336
Shall we analyze your dreams?

49:21.339 --> 49:23.381
No. That's right.

49:23.507 --> 49:26.051
You've already told me
everything l need to know,

49:26.177 --> 49:29.888
except why powerful women?

49:30.014 --> 49:33.850
You took powerful women
and made them powerless.

49:33.976 --> 49:37.812
They left behind families, children.

49:47.114 --> 49:49.574
l have to confess, l'm a little conflicted.

49:49.700 --> 49:52.661
You've helped me make
a major self-discovery.

49:56.332 --> 49:59.334
The fact that l'm a killer. . .

50:12.515 --> 50:15.558
. .that's something l can't control.

50:22.525 --> 50:25.985
You helped me to accept what l really am.

50:26.112 --> 50:27.946
l'm grateful for that.

50:28.072 --> 50:31.241
But. . .

50:31.367 --> 50:35.203
l was raised with a certain set of principles.

50:38.207 --> 50:39.499
l'm sorry, Doc.

50:39.625 --> 50:42.711
Actions have consequences, and this is yours.

50:44.547 --> 50:46.881
l'm gonna have to let you go.

51:21.041 --> 51:24.919
- Hello?
- ls that Eric Carmen?

51:27.590 --> 51:30.008
No. What's up?

51:30.134 --> 51:32.385
l'm running late.
l'm in the middle of some housework.

51:32.511 --> 51:35.221
lf l don't get it done,
it's gonna drive me crazy.

51:35.347 --> 51:36.723
l never knew you were so anal.

51:36.849 --> 51:38.808
And l'm a neat freak.

51:38.934 --> 51:41.436
You're just full of surprises, huh?

51:42.688 --> 51:44.397
Oh, you have no idea.

51:44.523 --> 51:47.400
- l'll be there as soon as l can, OK?
- OK.

52:09.298 --> 52:15.970
"Barbie. Be patient.
One day we'll share a cold one."
