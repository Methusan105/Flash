WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:04.050
Previously on Dexter. . .

00:04.176 --> 00:06.928
You still don't remember
anything from before?

00:07.054 --> 00:08.513
Before we took you in?

00:08.639 --> 00:09.639
No.

00:10.516 --> 00:11.432
What are you doing?

00:11.558 --> 00:13.851
l'll talk to you through
a relaxation technique.

00:13.977 --> 00:16.312
lt might bring some things to the surface.

00:20.693 --> 00:22.026
lt was a match.

00:22.945 --> 00:24.612
Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

00:26.532 --> 00:28.700
And this is Rudy.

00:28.826 --> 00:30.368
- Dexter.
- Hey.

00:31.620 --> 00:33.871
l have waited a long time to meet Dexter.

00:35.124 --> 00:38.084
Why the different nail polishes?
What's this guy thinking?

00:38.210 --> 00:39.961
The real king is still out there.

00:40.504 --> 00:41.421
Hungry.

00:41.547 --> 00:42.839
Ready.

00:44.049 --> 00:45.216
He'll kill again.

00:45.342 --> 00:46.968
lt's just a matter of time.

00:47.094 --> 00:50.388
Dex, Rudy's different.
l feel safe with him. l think. . .

00:50.764 --> 00:52.765
l'm falling for him.

00:52.891 --> 00:54.058
Divorce papers.

00:54.184 --> 00:57.186
Sign them and l'll agree
to supervised visits twice a week.

00:57.312 --> 00:59.272
You think you can make me back down?

00:59.398 --> 01:01.232
Are you fucking my wife?

01:03.986 --> 01:07.947
Kids are settled at Colleen's.
You can visit them when we get back.

01:10.159 --> 01:14.495
l just wish he'd go away. Why can't he
just go away and disappear forever?

01:15.330 --> 01:17.915
- No.
- Fuck you, whore.

03:24.126 --> 03:25.918
Come on, buckaroos. lt's Monday.

03:26.044 --> 03:28.588
Can't be late on Monday.
Throws the whole week off.

03:28.714 --> 03:29.964
What about breakfast?

03:30.090 --> 03:31.382
Made and eaten.

03:31.508 --> 03:33.593
- The kids' lunches?
- Packed. Ready to go.

03:34.386 --> 03:35.720
Did you tell the locksmith?

03:35.846 --> 03:38.723
Yeah, new locks on every door,
reinforced strike plates.

03:38.849 --> 03:42.351
seven-pin keyways.
Here you go, buddy.

03:42.477 --> 03:45.646
Go wait in my car.
l want to talk to your mom for a sec.

03:46.315 --> 03:48.983
- Are you gonna make out?
- None of your business.

03:49.109 --> 03:50.985
- Are you?
- Astor.

03:55.073 --> 03:56.282
You don't have to do this.

03:56.408 --> 03:59.035
Getting attacked
by your ex-husband merits a day off.

03:59.161 --> 04:00.244
l'm fine.

04:00.370 --> 04:03.497
l won't let Paul control my life anymore.
Those days are over.

04:03.624 --> 04:04.790
lt will be OK.

04:04.917 --> 04:07.501
The police have been notified. They'll find him.

04:07.628 --> 04:09.295
What if they don't?

04:10.672 --> 04:12.590
l got you some pepper spray.

04:13.926 --> 04:15.176
Aim for the eyes.

04:27.272 --> 04:29.148
You want some? lt's Kirk Bliloc's cake.

04:29.274 --> 04:32.151
l had some at Kirk's birthday. Ten days ago.

04:32.986 --> 04:35.863
Having lunch every day with your boyfriend,
you miss some things around here.

04:35.989 --> 04:38.532
Cake's still good. lt's mocha, l think.

04:38.659 --> 04:40.451
lt started out vanilla.

04:43.789 --> 04:45.998
Guys, you should look at this.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.501
Put that thing down.

04:48.627 --> 04:51.712
- lt was addressed to Homicide.
- Put it down!

04:51.838 --> 04:52.838
Jesus, is that blood?

04:52.965 --> 04:54.674
Morgan, get your ass over here.

04:55.717 --> 04:56.676
Ass en route.

04:56.802 --> 04:59.762
You're the blood expert. What is this shit?

04:59.888 --> 05:01.681
lt's a little watery for jam.

05:01.807 --> 05:04.684
Maybe you should open it.

05:05.936 --> 05:08.688
What if there's an airborne toxin
in here waiting to be released?

05:08.814 --> 05:11.023
l got to wash my hands.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.443
So gullible.

05:19.574 --> 05:20.491
What is it?

05:20.617 --> 05:22.702
lt's definitely blood.

05:23.495 --> 05:24.870
There's something in here.

05:35.215 --> 05:37.675
Marina View hotel.

05:38.677 --> 05:39.677
lt's a key.

05:41.013 --> 05:44.890
Maybe a promotional gag.
Stay the weekend, get a jar of blood.

05:45.726 --> 05:46.976
Show-and-tell's over.

05:47.102 --> 05:48.894
Let's try and find out who sent this.

05:49.021 --> 05:50.938
Grab Batista and get over to that hotel.

05:51.064 --> 05:53.024
He's working on the explosion
at the smack lab.

05:53.150 --> 05:55.401
Morgan, put the cake down. You're with me.

05:56.528 --> 06:01.532
A jar of blood. Dramatic, cryptic, playful.

06:01.658 --> 06:03.075
Could it be him?

06:13.378 --> 06:16.839
Got an extra key from the manager.
Said the same thing as the front-desk clerk.

06:16.965 --> 06:19.925
The guy who checked into 1 03
was white and normal-looking.

06:20.052 --> 06:22.386
l haven't seen a security
camera since we came here.

06:22.512 --> 06:25.181
lt's likely he scouted hotels
and chose one with lax security.

06:25.307 --> 06:28.476
Be ready to cancel your lunch.

06:29.352 --> 06:31.353
Police. Open up.

06:39.613 --> 06:41.238
Oh, my God! Jesus.

06:41.364 --> 06:43.157
Get back in your room.

06:44.242 --> 06:47.787
Metro dispatch, this is 3 Henry 88
out of the Marina View hotel.

06:47.913 --> 06:50.414
l need uniformed backup, forensics.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.583
Fuck it. Just send everybody out.

07:03.053 --> 07:05.221
lt's been a while
since we went prophylactic.

07:05.347 --> 07:08.808
- Not me. Last night l met this chick. . .
- l'll stop you there, Vince.

07:08.934 --> 07:11.519
They tell you anything about what's inside?

07:11.645 --> 07:15.314
- No one's been inside. Too much blood.
- Dexter.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.274
Just a heads-up. lt's bad in there.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.111
- l'm serious.
- OK.

07:20.237 --> 07:22.780
she's not kidding.
lt's your wet dream in there.

07:24.199 --> 07:27.785
You're going in first alone.
Get a sense of what we're dealing with.

07:27.911 --> 07:30.121
Give me a report. Don't fuck up.

07:48.098 --> 07:51.225
Now l'm really curious.
He's been gone so long.

07:51.351 --> 07:53.519
He had to be planning a splashy return.

07:53.645 --> 07:55.646
But a crime scene just for me?

08:09.494 --> 08:11.537
Mommy!

08:31.349 --> 08:33.017
Tell me you found something.

08:33.143 --> 08:35.853
l talked to the guests in 1 05.
They didn't see anyone go in or out.

08:35.979 --> 08:37.479
- Across the hall?
- German tourists.

08:37.606 --> 08:39.565
Got their head up their lederhosen.

08:39.691 --> 08:40.983
They heard a whirring sound

08:41.109 --> 08:44.862
but thought someone was mixing
margaritas or vacuuming.

08:47.574 --> 08:50.701
Oh, my God! Are you OK?

08:55.874 --> 09:00.252
l'm just a little queasy. l fell down in there.
Never should have skipped breakfast.

09:00.378 --> 09:02.379
You're shaking. What happened up there?

09:02.505 --> 09:04.632
No, l'm OK. l just need a little air.

09:04.758 --> 09:07.676
Something finally got to Dexter.
You're human after all.

09:07.802 --> 09:09.720
Cut him some slack, all right?

09:10.388 --> 09:12.514
l hate to disappoint Dexter.
l think it's low blood sugar.

09:12.641 --> 09:14.600
Tell us what you saw, Dex.

09:14.726 --> 09:17.978
- How many dead?
- A lot.

09:18.104 --> 09:21.482
But no bodies, just blood. 50. 60 liters.

09:22.651 --> 09:24.944
Maybe half a dozen dead. l don't know.

09:25.070 --> 09:28.155
There was a mass murder in there,
but they took the bodies?

09:28.281 --> 09:31.575
How is that possible?
There's one elevator, stairs with alarms.

09:31.701 --> 09:34.620
Someone would have seen
corpses coming out.

09:34.746 --> 09:36.705
l don't fucking know.

09:37.123 --> 09:40.876
- Hey, Dexter, you all right?
- l can't go back in there.

09:41.002 --> 09:42.253
You don't have to.

09:42.379 --> 09:45.464
Fine, just get yourself cleaned up

09:45.590 --> 09:47.967
and work from the hallway or something.

09:58.395 --> 09:59.395
You're in room 422.

09:59.521 --> 10:02.398
Elevators are to your right,
and Bobby will see to your bags.

10:02.524 --> 10:04.233
Excuse me.

10:05.944 --> 10:09.655
Dade County, Sheriff's Department.
l'm looking for Rita Bennett.

10:09.781 --> 10:12.533
That's me. Did you find Paul?

10:12.659 --> 10:13.575
l'm sorry?

10:13.702 --> 10:15.953
Paul Bennett.

10:18.373 --> 10:22.334
My ex-husband attacked me last night.
My boyfriend filed a police report.

10:22.460 --> 10:25.713
We only have the report Mr. Bennett filed.

10:25.839 --> 10:27.381
What? Wait.

10:27.507 --> 10:31.093
- Paul filed a police report? For what?
- Assault.

10:31.219 --> 10:35.014
Your ex-husband was just released
from Baptist Memorial Hospital.

10:35.140 --> 10:36.849
He's pressing charges against Dexter.

10:36.975 --> 10:40.853
- He attacked me!
- Not according to him.

10:40.979 --> 10:43.355
All right. Can we talk about this later?

10:43.481 --> 10:45.024
We need a formal statement.

10:45.150 --> 10:48.319
You have to come with us
right now to the station.

10:48.445 --> 10:50.487
Fine.

10:50.947 --> 10:54.325
Make sure you label the section of the grid
each blood sample came from.

10:54.451 --> 10:55.701
All right?

10:55.827 --> 10:57.995
Sweet.

10:58.580 --> 11:00.789
You should really get in here, Dex.

11:00.915 --> 11:02.791
l never seen anything like this.

11:02.917 --> 11:05.544
Wait till you see a few more
Columbian drug busts.

11:05.670 --> 11:08.547
l got misting up the walls,

11:09.758 --> 11:12.801
across the ceiling,

11:12.927 --> 11:15.137
but no tissue. Come see.

11:15.263 --> 11:16.930
Photos, Vince.

11:18.183 --> 11:19.767
Why the blood's not clotting?

11:19.893 --> 11:22.436
The blood's not clotting?

11:26.566 --> 11:28.817
Genuine medical mystery.

11:28.943 --> 11:32.321
Just keep getting samples.
l'll test it at the lab.

11:46.669 --> 11:48.003
Hello? Don't hang up.

11:48.129 --> 11:50.422
Dexter, l'm at the Sheriff's station.

11:50.548 --> 11:52.424
Paul's pressing
assault charges against me.

11:52.550 --> 11:54.802
How's it possible? l was defending myself.

11:55.637 --> 11:58.138
Just stay calm. l know a lawyer.

11:58.264 --> 11:59.598
l'll straighten it out.

11:59.724 --> 12:02.434
l am calm. They're the hysterical ones.

12:02.560 --> 12:05.938
They're charging me with
a Class Two felony.

12:09.109 --> 12:10.692
Hello, Dexter? Are you there?

12:10.819 --> 12:11.860
l'm right here.

12:11.986 --> 12:13.487
This is ridiculous.

12:13.613 --> 12:16.240
l could lose my job. l could lose my kids.

12:16.908 --> 12:18.158
l won't let that happen.

12:18.284 --> 12:21.328
- l'm glad you're so confident.
- Rita, just trust me.

12:21.454 --> 12:23.872
l know how the system works.
l'm at a crime scene now,

12:23.998 --> 12:26.750
l have to go.
l'll talk to my lawyer friend right away.

12:28.128 --> 12:29.044
You're OK?

12:29.170 --> 12:32.256
Yeah, l'm OK.

12:33.425 --> 12:35.926
- Thank Dexter.
- Bye.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.685
ls there a wall socket there? Check it out.

12:44.811 --> 12:47.312
- What? A wall socket?
- Yeah.

12:47.439 --> 12:50.274
Of course there's a wall socket.
There's lots of wall. . .

12:51.067 --> 12:53.068
You're right.

12:54.279 --> 12:56.113
There was something plugged in here.

12:56.239 --> 12:57.990
Probably a power tool to cut them up.

12:58.116 --> 13:00.033
Come take a look.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.161
Photos, Vince.

13:03.037 --> 13:05.122
Lots and lots of photos.

13:07.417 --> 13:09.001
Open Sesame.

13:09.127 --> 13:10.794
Blood samples for the fridge.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.046
Make room. There's a lot more coming.

13:14.632 --> 13:16.592
Shooters at the Bel Canto tonight. You're in?

13:16.718 --> 13:18.135
l'm not in the mood.

13:18.261 --> 13:22.055
Angel, you're on the market,
and the Bel Canto is hottie central.

13:23.057 --> 13:25.476
Look at this.

13:25.602 --> 13:27.186
They were for Nina's birthday.

13:27.312 --> 13:30.981
- Backstage passes to Neil Diamond.
- You're in worse shape than l thought.

13:43.870 --> 13:45.621
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

13:46.956 --> 13:50.167
Masuka was looking for Dexter.
Something about drinks at the Bel Canto.

13:50.293 --> 13:52.169
l told him l had a yeast infection.

13:53.796 --> 13:55.130
A bit of an overshare.

14:03.139 --> 14:05.933
You want to talk about
what happened today?

14:06.059 --> 14:07.226
Already did.

14:08.478 --> 14:11.063
The last time l saw you
like that was when Dad died.

14:12.565 --> 14:16.443
You can talk to me. You've just
got to open your mouth and move it.

14:16.569 --> 14:18.570
l'll tell Rudy l'll be late.

14:18.696 --> 14:20.322
Deb, seriously.

14:21.366 --> 14:22.282
l puked.

14:22.408 --> 14:24.076
l'm fine. l know you want to help,

14:24.202 --> 14:26.954
but unless you have breath mints,
there's nothing to do.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.831
- Why do you always do this?
- Do what?

14:29.958 --> 14:31.792
You shut me out.
Like your birth father

14:31.918 --> 14:33.961
that lived up the highway your whole life
and never contacted Dexter.

14:34.087 --> 14:36.129
l still don't know how that makes you feel.

14:40.718 --> 14:43.554
lf some random emotion strikes me
in the middle of the night.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.722
you'll be the first one l'll call.

14:46.891 --> 14:48.392
Fine.

14:49.227 --> 14:50.644
Whatever.

14:51.396 --> 14:54.565
- Did Paul force his way into the house?
- No.

14:54.691 --> 14:55.899
Did you ask him to leave?

14:56.025 --> 14:58.193
Yes, and he refused.

14:58.319 --> 14:59.987
But in your statement,

15:00.113 --> 15:06.201
it says you invited your
ex-husband into your bedroom.

15:06.327 --> 15:08.954
He was drunk and the kids were asleep,

15:09.080 --> 15:11.164
and l knew exactly where this was heading.

15:11.291 --> 15:12.874
Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.

15:13.001 --> 15:15.961
And you didn't want it to escalate.
l understand that.

15:16.087 --> 15:17.462
But we can't prove intent.

15:17.589 --> 15:20.632
Your ex-husband
has the injuries here, not Dexter.

15:20.758 --> 15:22.551
Paul has a record of spousal abuse.

15:22.677 --> 15:25.178
Spousal abuse can be mutual.

15:25.305 --> 15:27.598
lt was never mutual.

15:30.435 --> 15:34.229
But the man is a model parolee.
His drug tests are clean.

15:34.355 --> 15:36.648
He's got glowing reports from
the court-appointed supervisor.

15:36.774 --> 15:38.609
Corrections will want to see
this guy transition.

15:38.735 --> 15:39.901
l don't care.

15:40.028 --> 15:42.446
He's not going near my children.
Do you understand?

15:44.532 --> 15:49.536
Rita, if you deny him visitation,
you could lose your children.

15:50.288 --> 15:52.664
Now, you have deposition in two days.

15:52.790 --> 15:55.917
Do not give him any more
ammunition than he already has.

16:04.218 --> 16:06.678
Damn. Just blood?

16:06.804 --> 16:08.430
What happened to the bodies?

16:08.556 --> 16:12.601
Hell if l know. l don't want to know.

16:13.770 --> 16:14.853
Blood was bad enough.

16:14.979 --> 16:19.024
No wonder you seem so amped.
Your brother must have loved it.

16:19.150 --> 16:21.735
- Fuck no. He freaked.
- Really?

16:22.570 --> 16:25.572
l thought blood was his thing.
What happened?

16:25.698 --> 16:27.658
l don't know. He shut me out like usual.

16:29.077 --> 16:30.077
Did he say anything?

16:30.203 --> 16:32.496
Let's not talk about Dex right now.

16:37.418 --> 16:39.086
Was it like a panic attack?

16:40.963 --> 16:44.758
l don't know. He's not really big into sharing his
feelings, in case you hadn't noticed.

16:44.884 --> 16:46.051
Kiss me.

16:56.437 --> 16:59.523
What's the matter?
You don't even have wood.

16:59.649 --> 17:04.027
- You're the one who wanted to talk.
- Yeah. but not now. l'm horny.

17:04.737 --> 17:07.197
Maybe l should call him.

17:09.075 --> 17:12.869
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- What? We bonded last weekend.

17:12.995 --> 17:14.663
lsn't that what boyfriends
are supposed to do?

17:14.789 --> 17:17.249
Show some interest in the family?

17:17.375 --> 17:20.168
Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's
trying to get into his pants.

17:20.294 --> 17:21.461
Deb, that's not fair.

17:21.587 --> 17:25.048
You take me out on a couples' weekend
to get to know your brother.

17:25.174 --> 17:27.926
and then you punish me for giving a damn?

17:28.052 --> 17:30.011
l mean, your issues don't have to be mine.

17:32.223 --> 17:33.890
You know what?

17:35.852 --> 17:38.395
Forget it. Let's just go to sleep.

17:39.939 --> 17:43.233
OK. l'm gonna go watch TV.

17:52.076 --> 17:54.619
She loved him so goddamn much,

17:54.746 --> 17:59.541
She took every one of his CDs
in the separation.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.752
She wouldn't even give me Greatest Hits.

18:01.878 --> 18:04.421
Nina loved Neil Diamond.

18:04.547 --> 18:07.090
Song Sung Blue.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.593
September Morn.

18:09.719 --> 18:11.762
Oh, my God, Kentucky Woman.

18:11.888 --> 18:13.805
You got to love that shit.

18:21.814 --> 18:24.941
That's like the fourth chick you've driven off.

18:25.067 --> 18:26.485
Waitress! ls there a waitress?

18:26.611 --> 18:29.279
l need a drink. Waitress!

18:29.405 --> 18:30.655
Bro, you're a train wreck.

18:30.782 --> 18:33.658
- You got to stop talking about the divorce.
- l ain't ashamed.

18:33.785 --> 18:37.829
Yeah, l think that's clear, but it's pathetic.

18:37.955 --> 18:41.041
Look. don't talk about
the divorce unless they ask.

18:42.210 --> 18:44.461
Oh, and eighty-six the ring.

18:44.587 --> 18:47.172
l have to take a squirt.

18:58.976 --> 19:00.977
She's gonna fuck me silly.

19:04.357 --> 19:07.359
My sister's right.
l don't share my problems with her

19:07.485 --> 19:08.860
or with anybody.

19:09.487 --> 19:10.487
Harry taught me that.

19:10.613 --> 19:12.572
Secrecy, self-reliance,

19:12.698 --> 19:16.451
and a well-stocked cupboard of Hefty bags.

19:16.577 --> 19:19.663
Fortunately, l've never met
a problem l can't manage.

19:21.249 --> 19:22.666
Until that boy in the blood.

19:24.752 --> 19:27.212
He scares me. l want him to go away.

19:27.338 --> 19:29.965
You awake?

19:31.509 --> 19:32.676
What?

19:35.137 --> 19:37.264
Are you sure you locked the door?

19:37.390 --> 19:40.600
Yeah, l'm positive. Bolt and chain.

19:43.104 --> 19:44.855
What am l gonna do?

19:46.357 --> 19:48.650
Don't worry. l'll figure it out.

19:52.905 --> 19:53.905
And l will.

19:54.031 --> 19:57.868
l can always see other people's problems
more clearly than my own.

19:57.994 --> 20:00.036
Fortunately, Rita's has a name.

20:02.540 --> 20:05.959
Everyone who set foot on the bloody
carpet in room 1 03 left a footprint,

20:06.085 --> 20:09.004
and since we do shoe molds
of everyone on personnel,

20:09.130 --> 20:12.257
that leaves only one
set of footprints unaccounted for.

20:12.383 --> 20:13.717
The killer's.

20:13.843 --> 20:15.427
This shows everywhere he went in the room.

20:15.553 --> 20:17.095
The question is why.

20:17.221 --> 20:21.683
Hold on. Aren't we missing something?
Where are the victims' footprints?

20:21.809 --> 20:23.184
Give that lady a lollipop.

20:23.311 --> 20:26.980
Are you suggesting there were
never any bodies in room 1 03?

20:27.106 --> 20:29.190
Why would a guy stage a massacre
and not have any bodies?

20:29.317 --> 20:30.650
And where'd he get the blood?

20:30.776 --> 20:32.611
l've just got a preliminary blood report.

20:32.737 --> 20:35.280
The blood in that room came from
at least five different bodies.

20:35.406 --> 20:36.531
Possibly more.

20:36.657 --> 20:38.825
My fellow traveler had five victims.

20:38.951 --> 20:41.912
- lce-truck killer had five victims.
- Five bloodless victims.

20:42.038 --> 20:43.955
l always wondered
what he did with the blood.

20:44.081 --> 20:46.458
Wait. The ice-truck killer
did not horde his victims' blood

20:46.584 --> 20:48.668
just to have a party at the Marina View hotel.

20:48.794 --> 20:50.045
Why would he do that?

20:50.171 --> 20:51.463
To chase me down the rabbit hole.

20:51.589 --> 20:53.423
What was that, Morgan?

20:54.759 --> 20:56.635
l didn't say anything.

20:58.596 --> 21:01.348
l'll remind you people.
We arrested the ice-truck killer.

21:01.474 --> 21:03.683
His name is Neil Perry.
and he's awaiting trial in County.

21:03.809 --> 21:05.685
Bullshit.

21:05.811 --> 21:08.772
Neil Perry recanted his confession.
He's a fraud.

21:08.898 --> 21:10.815
- Try telling that to the Captain.
- l did.

21:10.942 --> 21:12.859
Do we have any more evidence
to support this theory?

21:12.985 --> 21:14.736
When Masuka noticed
the blood wasn't clotting,

21:14.862 --> 21:15.779
l ran some tests,

21:15.905 --> 21:18.031
and it was loaded with coumadin and heparin.

21:18.157 --> 21:20.575
One's an anticoagulant.
The other's a preservative.

21:20.701 --> 21:22.160
lt means the blood's old.

21:22.286 --> 21:25.080
Plus the blood spatter's all impact and castoff.

21:25.206 --> 21:27.791
There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns

21:27.917 --> 21:30.460
to indicate the presence of any actual victims.

21:30.586 --> 21:32.253
Run the DNA on all five vics

21:32.380 --> 21:34.965
and see if it matches
the ice-truck killer's victims.

21:35.091 --> 21:37.008
You two get out to the Marina View hotel.

21:37.134 --> 21:39.344
Retrace his steps. Maybe it'll tell us something.

21:39.470 --> 21:42.806
And not a word to anyone
about the ice-truck killer.

21:50.481 --> 21:52.816
Astor, just stand up straight.

21:52.942 --> 21:55.360
Do you have
the emergency phone number list?

21:55.486 --> 21:56.736
lt's in my backpack.

21:56.862 --> 21:59.114
Do l have to show it to you again?

21:59.240 --> 22:01.992
Just promise me you won't let
your brother out of your sight.

22:08.207 --> 22:10.542
- You're scaring them.
- Well, they should be.

22:10.668 --> 22:13.920
l didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.

22:14.046 --> 22:16.214
What'd you say when you dragged
them to the neighbors'?

22:16.340 --> 22:17.924
l smelled gas.

22:18.050 --> 22:20.093
l should have just thrown them in the car

22:20.219 --> 22:22.762
and headed out of state,
gone back to Michigan.

22:22.888 --> 22:24.472
Remember what the lawyer said.

22:24.598 --> 22:26.516
You don't want to do anything rash.

22:27.643 --> 22:31.521
Just relax. The court supervisor
will be there the whole time.

22:35.693 --> 22:38.695
Hey. buddy. Come on.
Where's the love? Come on.

22:38.821 --> 22:41.072
Daddy, what happened?

22:41.198 --> 22:44.159
Nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head.

22:44.285 --> 22:46.661
We're going to the circus,

22:46.787 --> 22:49.706
'cause Daddy always keeps
his promises, remember?

22:49.832 --> 22:52.042
Good. All right. Ready?

22:52.793 --> 22:54.377
Got your stuff?

22:55.171 --> 22:56.546
Let's go.

22:58.049 --> 23:00.967
You OK? Come on.

23:08.225 --> 23:11.936
l prefer the enchanting Rita
over the worried one.

23:12.063 --> 23:14.731
lf l can find a way to make
her ex-husband my problem,

23:14.857 --> 23:17.567
l can help her sleep much easier tonight.

23:26.243 --> 23:29.537
All l need is a little proof
of his inner monster.

23:29.663 --> 23:31.414
Harry would have insisted on that.

23:42.093 --> 23:44.177
Harry didn't believe in preemptive killing,

23:44.303 --> 23:46.387
but maybe l can bend the rules, just this once.

23:46.514 --> 23:48.139
After all, Harry wasn't perfect.

23:48.265 --> 23:50.100
He lied about my birth father.

23:54.522 --> 23:57.690
The trifecta. Weapon, ammo,
and impaired judgment.

23:57.817 --> 23:59.734
Throw in a little domestic violence,

23:59.860 --> 24:03.071
and you have the perfect recipe
for a family slaughter.

24:05.699 --> 24:07.492
Mommy!

24:10.788 --> 24:14.290
Close your eyes, Dexter. Close your eyes.

25:01.005 --> 25:04.382
So, after he soaked the room in blood,
he crossed to the desk

25:06.552 --> 25:08.344
and then over to the bedside table.

25:10.472 --> 25:14.100
There's a clock radio
and some smeared blood.

25:14.226 --> 25:15.977
Maybe he turned it on.

25:17.688 --> 25:20.273
No, we're missing something.
Let's go over it again.

25:20.399 --> 25:21.691
We've been over it three times.

25:21.817 --> 25:24.319
Maybe the map's wrong. Call your brother.

25:26.572 --> 25:27.530
What?

25:27.656 --> 25:29.407
Why is everybody's first move
to call Dexter?

25:29.533 --> 25:30.491
You don't even like him.

25:30.618 --> 25:34.162
What'd the freak do this time,
boil your goldfish?

25:34.288 --> 25:35.788
No, it's just. . .

25:37.124 --> 25:40.293
lt's Rudy. We had our first fight.

25:40.419 --> 25:42.337
Tiff. l don't know. Whatever you want to call it.

25:42.463 --> 25:43.796
l thought we were talking about your brother.

25:43.923 --> 25:45.089
We were.

25:45.216 --> 25:47.217
And we'll be back with
Billy Joel, the Eurythmics

25:47.343 --> 25:49.886
and Devo on 1 03 FM, hits from the '80s.

25:50.012 --> 25:51.304
Turn that off.

25:51.430 --> 25:52.805
No, wait. l want to hear it.

25:52.932 --> 25:54.766
lt's Devo. Turn that shit off.

25:54.892 --> 25:58.353
He said 1 03 FM. This is room 1 03.

25:59.897 --> 26:01.356
Leviticus 1 0:3.

26:01.482 --> 26:02.815
1 0:3. 1 03.

26:02.942 --> 26:04.525
Son of a bitch.

26:04.652 --> 26:06.277
You think he's trying
to tell us something?

26:06.403 --> 26:08.947
"l will be sanctified in them
that come nigh me,

26:09.073 --> 26:12.408
"and before all people, l will be glorified."

26:28.467 --> 26:29.884
Hey.

26:30.552 --> 26:32.804
Deb's pissed at me. l need advice.

26:33.597 --> 26:34.973
So you came here?

26:35.099 --> 26:36.975
You know her better than anyone.

26:38.602 --> 26:43.273
Come on. l got two Porterhouses
and a sixer of Microbrew.

26:43.399 --> 26:45.984
Well, one minute we're talking about her day,

26:46.110 --> 26:48.027
you know, the whole bloodbath thing.

26:48.153 --> 26:49.320
Right.

26:49.446 --> 26:52.991
And the next, she wants to jump my bones.

26:53.117 --> 26:54.492
l mean, Deb's hot and all,

26:54.618 --> 26:58.246
but sprinkle in a little conversation
once in a while, you know?

26:58.372 --> 27:00.123
No, she's my sister. l don't know.

27:01.875 --> 27:03.251
Can l help you find something?

27:03.377 --> 27:07.130
You wouldn't happen to have
a good meat knife?

27:10.342 --> 27:11.718
Thanks.

27:13.429 --> 27:17.557
Anyway, the other half
of the argument was about Dexter.

27:19.018 --> 27:19.976
Me?

27:20.102 --> 27:24.272
Yeah. lt was already tense enough.
but when l brought your name, she lost it.

27:27.860 --> 27:30.194
So, what do l do?

27:30.321 --> 27:31.904
Tell her it's all your fault.

27:32.031 --> 27:34.282
- Seriously?
- You will eventually.

27:34.408 --> 27:36.284
Deb has a way of wearing you down.

27:36.410 --> 27:38.453
Just start from there. lt's easier.

27:45.210 --> 27:47.253
l got to take this.

27:47.379 --> 27:49.172
You mind if l. . .

27:54.678 --> 27:55.803
Where are you?

27:55.929 --> 27:57.597
Still at work, chasing a lead.

27:57.723 --> 28:00.350
Let me guess. The bloodbath case.

28:00.476 --> 28:02.226
l don't want to talk shop right now.

28:02.353 --> 28:06.022
Baby, l am so sorry.
You were totally right.

28:06.148 --> 28:08.274
l was mad at Dexter,
and l took it out on Dexter.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.943
My shift's almost done.
You want to come over and talk?

28:11.070 --> 28:15.406
l'd love to, babe, but l'm about
to eat dinner with Dexter.

28:21.872 --> 28:23.164
Well, after.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.667
Yeah, but here's the thing.

28:26.794 --> 28:30.046
l think l'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

28:31.382 --> 28:35.218
l mean. it's closer.
and l'm drinking, you know.

28:36.553 --> 28:38.596
You understand, right?

28:38.722 --> 28:39.680
Yeah.

28:39.807 --> 28:42.141
l'll call you tomorrow.

29:14.508 --> 29:17.552
- Care to dance?
- You dance to this?

29:17.678 --> 29:19.137
A bit.

29:19.263 --> 29:20.638
What about your wife?

29:22.599 --> 29:24.684
Tan line on your ring finger.

29:24.810 --> 29:26.102
Well, um. . .

29:27.604 --> 29:29.647
l'm not gonna talk about that tonight.

29:29.773 --> 29:32.650
Divorced? l get it.

29:32.776 --> 29:34.944
Mine was just finalized.

29:39.741 --> 29:41.075
Let's go.

30:30.417 --> 30:32.960
Will you excuse me? Excuse me.

30:36.507 --> 30:38.007
Police. l need to talk to Dexter.

30:38.133 --> 30:40.176
l'm not a hooker anymore.

30:40.302 --> 30:43.221
l work for a legitimate escort service now.

30:43.347 --> 30:45.723
l'm not here to bust anyone.

30:45.849 --> 30:49.393
l just need to know why
you paint your nails the way you do.

30:49.520 --> 30:52.647
- He was a real good client.
- You want to spend the night in a cell?

30:53.357 --> 30:56.150
All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.

30:56.276 --> 30:57.276
Guy or client?

30:57.402 --> 31:01.572
A john. OK?
That's when l worked Calle Ocho.

31:01.698 --> 31:05.576
Anyway, he started getting all
rough with me until he saw this.

31:05.702 --> 31:06.744
Then what?

31:06.870 --> 31:09.080
Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

31:09.206 --> 31:11.582
Told me to take my fake hand off.

31:11.708 --> 31:14.710
He started doing some kinky, weird stuff,

31:14.836 --> 31:16.337
like he was worshipping it.

31:16.463 --> 31:19.048
To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish

31:19.174 --> 31:21.759
and paints each nail a different color.

31:21.885 --> 31:23.928
l liked it, so l kept doing it.

31:24.054 --> 31:26.639
You know that guy they arrested
for the ice-truck killings?

31:26.765 --> 31:28.641
Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?

31:28.767 --> 31:30.810
- ls that the guy?
- No way.

31:30.936 --> 31:34.397
My trick, he's sexy. A freak, but sexy.

31:41.071 --> 31:44.407
From the beginning and with more detail.

31:45.409 --> 31:48.119
Well, thanks for the hospitality.

31:48.912 --> 31:50.788
Thanks for the steaks.

31:50.914 --> 31:53.791
You know, l didn't get a chance to ask.

31:53.917 --> 31:58.129
Deb mentioned that you had
a little incident at the crime scene.

31:58.255 --> 31:59.422
Did she?

31:59.548 --> 32:02.592
Most of my prosthetic
clients are pretty traumatized

32:02.718 --> 32:04.635
by the time they get to me.

32:04.761 --> 32:08.764
Anyway, l'm a good listener
if you ever want to talk.

32:08.890 --> 32:12.810
Thanks. but unless you know
an expert in repressed memories. . .

32:12.936 --> 32:14.770
For real?

32:17.107 --> 32:19.275
You know something about it?

32:19.401 --> 32:21.819
More than l ever wanted to.

32:21.945 --> 32:23.154
When l was in high school,

32:23.280 --> 32:27.199
l started having these dreams
of a woman hit by a truck.

32:29.286 --> 32:30.953
Who was she?

32:32.497 --> 32:35.249
l didn't know.

32:35.375 --> 32:39.170
Then one day l stopped by a mailbox,

32:40.297 --> 32:42.381
and it all came crashing back.

32:45.135 --> 32:49.013
My mom getting out to mail a letter,

32:50.140 --> 32:52.183
me still in the car.

32:54.645 --> 32:57.813
l watched her die.

33:01.193 --> 33:02.985
How old were you?

33:04.154 --> 33:05.237
Four.

33:08.158 --> 33:11.869
l didn't remember anything
till l went and mailed a letter.

33:13.622 --> 33:16.666
Walked right into the belly
of the beast without knowing it.

33:20.545 --> 33:23.339
What kind of memories
are you having?

33:26.802 --> 33:29.095
They're still a little vague.

33:29.221 --> 33:30.388
Right.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.892
Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.

33:36.186 --> 33:37.770
Maybe next time.

33:48.281 --> 33:50.157
When you see Deb, go with white roses.

33:50.283 --> 33:52.368
They're her favorite.

33:54.037 --> 33:56.330
That's a good tip.

33:56.957 --> 33:59.750
lt's funny how life brings people together.

34:10.887 --> 34:13.806
Rudy misunderstands my problem.

34:13.932 --> 34:17.977
l want the boy and blood to go away,
not come crashing back.

34:18.103 --> 34:21.647
Fortunately, l have other people's
problems to focus on right now

34:23.316 --> 34:24.775
like forgotten cellphones.

34:30.949 --> 34:32.199
What you got?

34:32.325 --> 34:34.660
So far we're chasing a ghost.

34:34.786 --> 34:37.246
Couple of employees helped with the sketch,

34:37.372 --> 34:39.331
but it's pretty generic.

34:39.458 --> 34:42.460
Only real lead we have is a couple
of numbers at the crime scene.

34:42.586 --> 34:44.462
Screw the numbers. Who was killed?

34:44.588 --> 34:45.796
Where are the bodies?

34:45.922 --> 34:48.215
l heard some pretty wild theories out there.

34:48.341 --> 34:50.718
Just theories. We're still
waiting for full blood results.

34:50.844 --> 34:52.303
Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.

34:52.429 --> 34:54.555
l'm just trying to avoid speculation.

34:54.681 --> 34:56.432
You got to give me something and soon.

34:56.558 --> 35:00.561
This department can't afford
another public relations disaster.

35:00.687 --> 35:06.150
Well, maybe you should tell
the DA to let Neil Perry go.

35:06.276 --> 35:07.651
He's not the ice-truck killer.

35:07.778 --> 35:10.154
Are you still hung up. . .
l can't believe this.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.782
Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.

35:15.035 --> 35:17.077
The DA takes his cues from us.

35:17.204 --> 35:19.371
lf you just tell him you made a mistake. . .

35:19.498 --> 35:21.582
Not going to happen.

35:21.708 --> 35:24.585
Now let it go.

35:24.711 --> 35:28.088
First break in this case.
you come straight to me.

35:38.433 --> 35:41.519
This may be a shot in the dark,
but l met this hooker last night.

35:41.645 --> 35:44.021
Going with a pro.
Now, that's how you get over the ex.

35:44.147 --> 35:45.606
No, that's not what l mean.

35:45.732 --> 35:48.067
So you didn't fuck her. But she blew you, right?

35:48.193 --> 35:49.902
Would you shut up?

35:50.028 --> 35:52.279
- lt was a lead.
- On what?

35:52.405 --> 35:54.949
l'll let you know if it pans out,

35:55.075 --> 35:58.327
but what do you know
about amputee fetishes?

36:01.373 --> 36:02.540
Oh, yeah.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.752
Yeah. Yeah, it's called acrotomophilia.

36:07.754 --> 36:11.215
But don't let them hear you call it that.
lt sounds like a disease.

36:11.341 --> 36:14.051
No, they prefer to be known as devotees.

36:14.177 --> 36:16.220
l knew you were the man to ask.

36:16.346 --> 36:18.305
Not really.

36:18.431 --> 36:20.140
l prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.

36:22.686 --> 36:24.228
You know who you should talk to?

36:24.354 --> 36:26.647
What's-his-face, Deb's boyfriend.

36:26.773 --> 36:30.359
Prosthetics guys deal
with devotees all the time.

36:30.485 --> 36:32.027
Thanks.

36:37.701 --> 36:39.577
No memory flashes here.

36:40.036 --> 36:42.162
No little lost boy in blood.

36:43.248 --> 36:47.543
Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant
reaches of my cerebral cortex.

36:49.421 --> 36:51.505
Here's to hoping.

36:53.758 --> 36:54.884
Yo, Dex.

36:58.430 --> 37:01.223
So, this is what you do for a living?

37:02.726 --> 37:05.853
l'm trying to match castoff
patterns from a crime scene.

37:05.979 --> 37:07.897
A power tool was used.

37:08.690 --> 37:10.733
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

37:13.653 --> 37:14.987
Circular saw.

37:16.573 --> 37:19.491
Seems like there'd be an easier
way to make a mess like this.

37:19.618 --> 37:21.785
Yeah. trust me. l know.
l've been in here for hours.

37:21.912 --> 37:26.081
ln my line of work.
you hear all sorts of horror stories.

37:26.207 --> 37:29.168
Boat propellers, garbage disposals.

37:30.378 --> 37:32.922
lt seems like something
you'd see with a chainsaw.

37:33.048 --> 37:37.635
Yeah, l hear that but this power tool
was plugged into a socket.

37:37.761 --> 37:40.930
Guess you haven't heard
of an electric chainsaw.

37:44.935 --> 37:46.894
Come on. people.
We're coming up empty.

37:47.020 --> 37:50.773
Those numbers mean something. 1 -0-3.

37:50.899 --> 37:53.359
We need to find the connection,
and until we do.

37:53.485 --> 37:56.487
you need to go over every page
of every police report you wrote

37:56.613 --> 37:57.821
in the last six months.

37:57.948 --> 37:59.865
Think. 1 -0-3.

37:59.991 --> 38:01.325
1 03.

38:01.451 --> 38:03.661
Bus station locker, piece of a bank account,

38:03.787 --> 38:05.788
area code, partial license plate.

38:05.914 --> 38:08.290
What is it? l want answers.

38:17.092 --> 38:19.510
What are you doing here?

38:19.636 --> 38:21.637
How do you always do it?

38:21.763 --> 38:22.680
Do what?

38:22.806 --> 38:25.015
Make me feel like
l'm six years old all the time.

38:28.103 --> 38:30.187
lf this is about Rudy, he was
just picking up his cellphone.

38:30.313 --> 38:32.731
Where'd he leave it?

38:34.025 --> 38:36.318
- My apartment.
- What was he doing there?

38:37.153 --> 38:40.406
- Eating steaks.
- And?

38:40.532 --> 38:42.282
l don't know. Drinking beer.

38:42.409 --> 38:43.826
And?

38:44.452 --> 38:46.370
- Debra. . .
- And?

38:47.038 --> 38:50.165
- Talking?
- Talking. You talked.

38:50.291 --> 38:52.084
You opened your mouth,
and sounds came out.

38:52.210 --> 38:55.504
On the same night that l wanted
to talk to you, but you shut me out.

38:56.923 --> 38:58.173
Yeah, "oh."

39:02.429 --> 39:05.597
You don't talk to me, Dex.

39:05.724 --> 39:10.102
You've spent our entire lives
keeping me at a distance.

39:10.228 --> 39:13.605
But my boyfriend shows up
on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones. . .

39:13.732 --> 39:15.733
They were Porterhouses.

39:17.610 --> 39:20.029
Porterhouses.

39:20.155 --> 39:23.907
And you end up tossing beers back
into the middle of the night.

39:24.034 --> 39:28.746
You are all the family
that l have, and l barely know Dexter.

39:28.872 --> 39:31.498
so. if you're gonna eat steaks
with somebody after a rough day,

39:31.624 --> 39:34.877
if somebody's gonna break
through your walls, l think it should be me.

39:35.003 --> 39:36.587
l think l have earned it.

39:46.890 --> 39:50.559
l'm late for Rita's deposition.

39:53.897 --> 39:56.315
Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.

40:15.585 --> 40:17.002
You Rudy Cooper?

40:18.421 --> 40:21.006
Angel Batista.
l work with your girlfriend, Debra.

40:21.132 --> 40:23.509
Hi. Nice to meet Dexter.

40:23.635 --> 40:26.428
l'd like to ask you a few questions,
if you don't mind.

40:26.554 --> 40:29.431
Sure. Let me just grab the door.

40:35.438 --> 40:38.273
So, does this have to do with a case?

40:38.900 --> 40:39.900
You could say that.

40:42.779 --> 40:44.488
Well, fire away.

40:45.281 --> 40:48.617
l ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand,

40:48.743 --> 40:50.452
call girl, actually.

40:51.037 --> 40:53.914
Said she had a very unique client,

40:54.040 --> 40:56.750
an amputee devotee.

40:57.544 --> 40:59.336
You have a lead on this client?

40:59.462 --> 41:00.546
That's the bitch of it.

41:00.672 --> 41:04.675
l don't have a goddamned clue,
except for the freaky sex stuff.

41:05.677 --> 41:09.805
l was hoping that you could steer me
toward some of those weirdos.

41:09.931 --> 41:13.392
l'm afraid l got into this business
to help people get better,

41:13.518 --> 41:14.852
not help people get off.

41:14.978 --> 41:17.604
l'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.

41:17.730 --> 41:21.233
But l can talk to some of my colleagues,
see if l can draw up a list of contacts for Dexter.

41:21.359 --> 41:22.526
That'd be great.

41:22.652 --> 41:27.322
How often does someone get a chance
to help catch a bad guy?

41:29.325 --> 41:32.202
- You in a rush for this information?
- No. no. l'm good.

41:32.328 --> 41:34.079
l'm chasing a long shot, really.

41:36.166 --> 41:40.586
Well, just give me a call at the station

41:40.712 --> 41:42.212
when you got something.

41:42.338 --> 41:44.673
Will do.

41:45.675 --> 41:50.846
Good to meet Dexter.

42:04.611 --> 42:06.486
Last question.

42:06.613 --> 42:07.905
According to your ex-husband,

42:08.031 --> 42:10.240
you left town with
your boyfriend last weekend.

42:10.366 --> 42:12.534
That's right. His father died.

42:13.411 --> 42:15.913
Did your ex-husband
have a scheduled visitation

42:16.039 --> 42:18.123
with his children during that time?

42:18.249 --> 42:20.500
l told Paul l'd make it up to him.

42:20.627 --> 42:23.253
So, then he gave you permission?

42:25.423 --> 42:26.590
No.

42:27.884 --> 42:30.260
l'm the one that gave him
visitation in the first place.

42:30.386 --> 42:33.180
l'm the custodial parent.
l didn't have to do that.

42:33.306 --> 42:34.765
Could you give us a second?

42:34.891 --> 42:37.434
Yes, of course.

42:37.560 --> 42:41.855
Why didn't you tell me you broke
your visitation agreement?

42:41.981 --> 42:44.107
l didn't know it was a big deal.

42:45.985 --> 42:49.446
l think she's answered that last question,
so unless there's something else. . .

42:49.572 --> 42:50.447
No, that's fine.

42:50.573 --> 42:52.866
lf l missed anything, we'll get to it

42:52.992 --> 42:55.869
at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.

42:55.995 --> 42:58.622
Nobody told me about
any psychiatric evaluation.

42:58.748 --> 43:00.832
lt's mandatory in these cases.

43:00.959 --> 43:04.253
The psych test determines
if there's a competency hearing.

43:04.379 --> 43:07.214
For me? But he's the ex-con.

43:07.340 --> 43:09.007
lt's standard. You should be fine.

43:09.133 --> 43:12.928
Should be?
You mean she could actually lose this?

43:14.681 --> 43:15.847
Guys,

43:17.267 --> 43:19.101
l'm handcuffed here.

43:20.019 --> 43:22.437
You violated a custody agreement.

43:23.147 --> 43:26.024
You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.

43:26.150 --> 43:27.276
He has a case.

43:34.701 --> 43:37.202
Mama, look at my henna tattoo.

43:39.497 --> 43:42.124
- So, how much candy have you had?
- Lots.

43:42.250 --> 43:43.709
Thanks, now she'll never get to sleep.

43:43.835 --> 43:47.087
She'll come down soon.
This one's already crashed.

43:47.213 --> 43:50.299
Mom, can my dad read me a story?

43:50.425 --> 43:52.009
l don't think so, honey.

43:52.135 --> 43:54.011
Please?

43:57.598 --> 44:00.309
OK. But just one.

44:00.435 --> 44:03.770
Put your duds on. buddy.
Spider-man ones l bought Dexter.

44:03.896 --> 44:05.814
l'll get him ready.
You've got 20 minutes left.

44:05.940 --> 44:08.942
Thanks, Betty. Thank Dexter.

44:11.362 --> 44:13.572
lt doesn't have to be this way.

44:13.698 --> 44:17.534
l mean, we can make this easier
on each other, right?

44:17.660 --> 44:20.996
l could drop the charges if you agree
to unsupervised visitation.

44:21.122 --> 44:22.122
Fuck Dexter.

44:32.216 --> 44:33.342
Hey, Dexy.

44:35.678 --> 44:40.182
l don't think your girlfriend
appreciates the gravity of the situation.

44:40.308 --> 44:44.770
lf she loses that case,
she could lose the kids.

44:44.896 --> 44:47.481
- That won't happen.
- Never say "won't."

44:47.607 --> 44:50.067
We live in a world of wills,
wills and wonders.

44:50.193 --> 44:52.652
That's what l'm trying
to teach my children.

44:52.779 --> 44:55.155
And they are my children, too,

44:55.281 --> 44:57.908
something she seems to forget.

44:58.034 --> 45:02.871
OK, so l made some mistakes,
but l learned from it. right?

45:02.997 --> 45:04.122
l'm sober.

45:04.248 --> 45:07.626
Look, no needle marks.

45:07.752 --> 45:11.588
l got the Alaskan pipeline
running through these veins,

45:11.714 --> 45:16.093
and all because of those two little glowsticks
of love in the next room.

45:24.936 --> 45:27.521
My heart beats for those two kids.

45:27.647 --> 45:30.607
So if you or that skinny bitch
try to screw with what's mine,

45:30.733 --> 45:33.151
l swear to God, l don't care
who l have to hurt...

45:41.077 --> 45:44.162
Harry's first rule was,
"Don't get emotionally involved."

45:44.288 --> 45:45.914
l think this is why.

45:46.040 --> 45:48.333
Astor, go brush your teeth.

45:53.297 --> 45:54.214
Someone once said

45:54.340 --> 45:57.801
it's easier dealing with other people's
problems than your own.

45:59.595 --> 46:01.304
They were wrong.

46:30.585 --> 46:33.837
- Where were you?
- Taking out the trash.

46:33.963 --> 46:35.255
Did you see Paul?

46:38.468 --> 46:41.386
When l was in the side yard,
l heard the front door open.

46:44.682 --> 46:47.851
My dad's car is gone!

47:01.282 --> 47:05.327
Let's face it, Paul. You've been a problem.

47:18.007 --> 47:19.841
lt's time for you to go away.

47:26.474 --> 47:29.976
The ice-truck killer case
has been reopened. Officially.

47:30.102 --> 47:32.979
We have new forensic evidence
that shows that the DNA

47:33.105 --> 47:35.732
from the blood at the Marina View hotel

47:35.858 --> 47:38.777
matches the DNA from his victims.

47:38.903 --> 47:40.070
What about Neil Perry?

47:40.196 --> 47:41.738
lsn't he supposed to be the ice-truck killer?

47:41.864 --> 47:44.950
All those questions should be
directed to Captain Matthews.

47:45.076 --> 47:48.161
He's been personally handling the Perry case.

47:48.287 --> 47:50.997
Oh, shit. l hope she told the Captain.

47:51.123 --> 47:55.585
- Where is he going?
- Thank you so much.

47:55.711 --> 47:57.337
Who knew?

48:01.217 --> 48:02.926
Who knew about this?

48:03.052 --> 48:05.595
This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.

48:05.721 --> 48:07.764
The ice-truck killer is still at large.

48:07.890 --> 48:09.057
Sure.

48:10.685 --> 48:12.477
l'll call you back.

48:18.317 --> 48:21.611
You overplayed your hand, Maria.

48:21.737 --> 48:24.364
l gave you a chance to make it right.

48:24.490 --> 48:27.617
- l told Dexter. . .
- You don't tell me shit!

48:27.743 --> 48:31.288
This is my department.
l made you lieutenant. Me.

48:31.414 --> 48:34.249
You were just another spic detective.

48:34.375 --> 48:36.501
Nice, Tom. Real nice.

48:37.461 --> 48:39.129
Your true colors finally come out.

48:39.255 --> 48:40.964
Oh, no.

48:41.090 --> 48:44.342
No, you haven't seen
my true colors, Maria.

48:46.012 --> 48:47.429
But you're about to.

48:51.475 --> 48:54.060
Enjoy this office while it's still yours.

49:14.790 --> 49:17.667
What happened? What's wrong?

49:20.296 --> 49:22.505
lt's Paul.

49:22.632 --> 49:24.007
l don't know all the details,

49:24.133 --> 49:26.509
but he violated Florida's three strikes law.

49:26.636 --> 49:29.346
The cops picked him up
totally strung out on heroin.

49:29.472 --> 49:31.431
He's back in jail.

49:34.185 --> 49:37.520
lt is truly amazing the things you can do
when you put your mind to it.

49:37.647 --> 49:38.730
What's so funny, Mom?

49:38.856 --> 49:40.398
Yeah, why are you laughing?

49:40.524 --> 49:43.068
No problem is insurmountable,
not when you have

49:43.194 --> 49:45.779
the most accessible
evidence locker in Miami.

49:45.905 --> 49:49.199
The equipment that the navy has
is state-of-the-art.

49:49.325 --> 49:50.784
Paul did need to go away.

49:52.995 --> 49:54.871
This is the police.

49:55.831 --> 49:57.040
But death wasn't the answer.

49:57.166 --> 50:00.710
Police. Open up.
We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.

50:00.836 --> 50:05.256
Life in prison will do just fine.

50:05.383 --> 50:06.966
They train you to be the best,

50:07.093 --> 50:08.635
and they expect you to be the best.

50:09.220 --> 50:12.972
For now, at least, the code
of Harry remains unbroken.

50:16.727 --> 50:20.480
Get over here. You're part of this family, too.

51:19.206 --> 51:21.624
l need an ambulance at 1 228 Caldon Street.

51:21.751 --> 51:23.418
A guy's been stabbed.

51:23.544 --> 51:25.336
Stay with us.

51:25.463 --> 51:28.965
Just breathe, man. Don't try to get up.

51:29.091 --> 51:32.761
Just hang in there, OK? Keep looking at us.

51:38.100 --> 51:40.351
Heard they're dropping
murder charges on Perry.

51:40.478 --> 51:43.646
Yeah, l'm sure he'll be filing
a lawsuit any minute now.

51:43.773 --> 51:45.565
More shit for us to deal with.

51:45.691 --> 51:47.776
Speaking of which, watch out
for reporters out there.

51:47.902 --> 51:50.695
They're still waiting on
a comment from the Captain.

51:50.821 --> 51:53.948
So, things still rocky at home?

51:55.034 --> 51:55.950
With Rudy?

51:56.076 --> 51:58.620
Yeah. l'm not calling until he apologizes.

51:58.746 --> 52:00.497
l'm done being second choice.

52:00.623 --> 52:03.291
Good for you, Morgan.

52:03.876 --> 52:06.252
lf you're not doing anything tonight,

52:06.378 --> 52:08.505
Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.

52:26.524 --> 52:28.942
- For Dexter.
- lt's too late. You blew it.

52:29.068 --> 52:31.194
This is the first chance l've had to talk.

52:31.320 --> 52:32.821
l'm too tired to talk.

52:34.532 --> 52:37.534
Well, let's go home,

52:37.660 --> 52:38.910
fall into bed.

52:39.036 --> 52:42.163
Why, Rudy? l mean, fucking why?

52:42.289 --> 52:44.082
You didn't want to fall into bed
the other night

52:44.208 --> 52:46.167
when l laid my heart out on the phone.

52:46.293 --> 52:48.878
- You wanted to talk to my brother.
- l was confused.

52:49.004 --> 52:50.755
l'm not confused. l know what l want.

52:50.881 --> 52:52.590
l was confused because l love Dexter.

52:52.716 --> 52:56.052
What l want is very simple
and uncomplicated.

52:56.178 --> 52:57.428
What did you say?

52:57.555 --> 52:58.680
l love Dexter.

53:01.141 --> 53:02.141
Don't try to. . .

53:06.939 --> 53:09.858
- Fuck.
- What?

53:13.112 --> 53:14.737
l love you, too.

53:22.830 --> 53:25.123
What happened to your lip?

53:25.249 --> 53:27.917
lncident with a tool at the workshop.

53:31.088 --> 53:33.381
Let's get you home and take care of it.

54:02.745 --> 54:05.121
So, this is doom.

54:05.247 --> 54:07.373
l've been the architect of so much of it.

54:07.499 --> 54:10.084
lt's only fair l should know
what the fuss is all about.

54:12.087 --> 54:14.464
He left me this room for a reason.

54:14.590 --> 54:18.927
Five women gave their blood,
their lives for this moment.

54:20.387 --> 54:24.057
There's only one way to find out why.

54:32.858 --> 54:34.400
Close your eyes, Dexter.

54:34.526 --> 54:37.111
l want Mama.

54:37.237 --> 54:38.446
No!

54:39.239 --> 54:41.908
No! Not in front of my baby!

54:51.126 --> 54:53.211
Please don't cry. lt's gonna be OK.

54:53.337 --> 54:56.214
Not in front of my baby!

54:56.340 --> 54:58.508
Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!

55:05.641 --> 55:10.269
Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.

55:11.021 --> 55:12.939
Dexter, close your eyes.

55:13.065 --> 55:15.650
l want Mama!

55:26.161 --> 55:31.499
Mommy loves you, Dexter.
