00:02.007 --> 00:03.841
Previously on Dexter. . .

00:03.967 --> 00:06.010
What if the ice-truck
killer does disappear?

00:07.012 --> 00:09.889
No, he's got unfinished business with me.

00:10.015 --> 00:15.395
"Dear Ken. l'm in pieces.
Why the cold shoulder? Love, Barbie."

00:15.813 --> 00:17.230
Paul called after you left.

00:17.356 --> 00:20.066
He's already out of jail. Overcrowding.
Can you believe it?

00:20.192 --> 00:21.859
Are you fucking my wife?

00:23.070 --> 00:26.239
Next time. we'll figure
out what to tell the kids.

00:26.365 --> 00:30.910
- So you don't have to sneak out like this.
- You want there to be a next time?

00:31.036 --> 00:34.914
l just wish he'd go away. Why can't he
just go away and disappear forever?

00:35.040 --> 00:38.042
- l so want to maul you right now.
- l so want you to.

00:38.168 --> 00:40.712
lt's different.

00:40.838 --> 00:44.882
lt feels like. . .

00:45.008 --> 00:48.177
l hate saying this.
lt sounds fucking cheesy.

00:48.303 --> 00:50.555
lt feels like making love.

00:52.933 --> 00:57.895
"Barbie, be patient.
One day we'll share a cold one."

03:08.819 --> 03:10.403
Thank God for showers.

03:10.529 --> 03:11.821
Private time to think -

03:11.947 --> 03:16.033
harder to come by now that
l'm in a real relationship.

03:17.494 --> 03:19.579
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

03:22.666 --> 03:25.042
- Could you pass the soap?
- Yeah.

03:35.012 --> 03:36.888
Mom, l got to pee!

03:37.931 --> 03:39.265
l'll be right there, sweetie!

03:39.391 --> 03:41.267
- Hold on a second, buddy!
- l can't!

03:42.060 --> 03:46.105
- Sorry. One-bathroom house.
- Nature calls.

03:48.942 --> 03:51.277
Cool. How did you get that ugly scar?

03:51.403 --> 03:54.238
- Cody.
- Sword fight. l won.

03:56.783 --> 04:00.077
- Mom. l got to brush.
- Whatever happened to knocking?

04:00.203 --> 04:01.621
l'm gonna be late for school.

04:01.747 --> 04:03.956
You brush, you pee, l'm just gonna. . .

04:06.501 --> 04:07.960
Wow, big scar.

04:08.086 --> 04:10.630
Sword fight. He won.

04:16.845 --> 04:18.971
l mean, what does separation mean to you?

04:19.097 --> 04:22.433
To me is that you're separated,
And you work it out.

04:22.559 --> 04:24.435
Now, this was false pretences.

04:24.686 --> 04:28.272
Nina knew she wanted a divorce when
she asked for the separation. She lied.

04:28.398 --> 04:30.191
And you didn't when you
were cheating on her, right?

04:30.317 --> 04:31.984
"Cheat". One cheat.

04:32.110 --> 04:33.986
- That's in the singular.
- One. OK.

04:34.112 --> 04:36.447
And l felt so crappy, l told her the next day.

04:36.573 --> 04:39.742
- Your problem is you're too honest.
- she wouldn't even talk about it.

04:39.868 --> 04:42.328
And l tried to get her to see
a counselor with me.

04:42.829 --> 04:44.956
Stop the car, man! Stop the goddamn car!

04:47.626 --> 04:48.793
Hey!

05:04.810 --> 05:05.851
Stop! Police!

05:35.173 --> 05:36.173
- You all right?
- Yeah.

06:12.044 --> 06:15.713
The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard,
according to his driver's license.

06:15.839 --> 06:18.674
- Haitian?
- That'd be my guess.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.760
All right. Let's go over it again.

06:20.886 --> 06:22.845
l saw a gun in the suspect's waistband.

06:22.971 --> 06:25.598
l went to question him,
and he took off running.

06:25.724 --> 06:29.685
- Angel. you saw all this.
- Yeah, l saw Bayard bolt,

06:29.811 --> 06:31.645
and l turned the car around in pursuit.

06:31.772 --> 06:35.274
- And when you went under the causeway. . .
- He took a shot at me.

06:35.400 --> 06:39.320
l took cover and returned fire from that corner.

06:39.446 --> 06:41.614
No, not from there.

06:41.740 --> 06:43.032
Yes, from fucking there.

06:44.242 --> 06:45.242
But. . .

06:47.287 --> 06:51.624
if you shot him from right there,
the blood spatter would go in that direction.

06:51.750 --> 06:54.085
You questioning me?
l got questions for Dexter.

06:54.211 --> 06:57.171
- The man's doing what he's supposed to.
- He is a creep job!

06:57.297 --> 06:59.840
Just focus on the facts, OK?

06:59.966 --> 07:02.009
The DA's team is ready for Dexter. You good?

07:02.135 --> 07:05.805
- l'm good.
- Yeah.

07:05.931 --> 07:06.931
You're up next.

07:12.813 --> 07:14.647
Sorry, but l didn't invent physics.

07:14.773 --> 07:16.190
He just got mixed up, is all.

07:17.109 --> 07:19.401
l'm not even sure what the hell happened.

07:19.945 --> 07:21.821
Trauma can distort the memory.

07:37.129 --> 07:39.088
l want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

07:39.214 --> 07:42.383
- lt's hard to get a baby-sitter on Friday night.
- You're my brother.

07:42.509 --> 07:46.345
- You should know my boyfriend.
- You really like using the B word.

07:46.471 --> 07:49.682
Rudy is my goddamn boyfriend,
so stop making bullshit excuses.

07:49.808 --> 07:53.185
Honestly, our last double date
was a little awkward.

07:53.311 --> 07:56.522
l just want to make sure this one's gonna stick.

07:56.648 --> 07:59.191
Well, thanks for the vote
of fucking confidence.

07:59.317 --> 08:01.861
Dex, Rudy's different.

08:01.987 --> 08:06.198
l feel safe with him. l think. . . l'm falling for him.

08:06.324 --> 08:09.076
Excuse me.
Where can l find Dexter Morgan?

08:09.202 --> 08:12.997
- Right here.
- Oh, that was easy.

08:14.708 --> 08:17.793
An urgent registered letter?
Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

08:17.919 --> 08:21.630
- Dex, you got a second?
- Yeah.

08:25.468 --> 08:27.511
You finish your report on the shooting?

08:27.637 --> 08:29.471
l'm walking it up to lA right now.

08:29.598 --> 08:32.266
You still think Doakes' version doesn't add up?

08:32.392 --> 08:34.518
Blood never lies.

08:35.562 --> 08:39.064
Shit. Listen, um. . .

08:39.191 --> 08:42.860
- Can you sit on that till l talk to Doakes?
- Here.

08:43.445 --> 08:46.197
No, it's yours to sit on, stand on.
Do what you want.

08:47.157 --> 08:48.866
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.746
lt's a federal offence to read
someone else's mail.

08:53.872 --> 08:56.707
"We regret to inform you
of the death of your father"?

08:58.210 --> 09:01.378
- Dad died ten years ago.
- This isn't about Harry.

09:01.504 --> 09:06.133
"Joseph Driscoll of Dade City. Florida.
names his son, Dexter Morgan of Miami,

09:06.259 --> 09:09.094
"as his executor." lt's a will.

09:09.221 --> 09:12.431
He can't be your biological father. Dad said
he died before you came to live with us.

09:12.557 --> 09:13.766
he wouldn't make a mistake like that.

09:14.392 --> 09:17.770
"The body's awaiting cremation
while they notify the next of kin."

09:17.896 --> 09:21.065
Hey, l'm your only next of kin.
Don't you fucking forget it.

09:23.902 --> 09:25.945
Oh, and l inherited a house.

09:27.030 --> 09:29.782
l know the truth, because Harry
always told me the truth.

09:29.908 --> 09:33.494
He had to.
He was teaching me principles, a code.

09:33.620 --> 09:35.663
He knew what l would become without it.

09:35.789 --> 09:39.124
So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City
must have been mistaken.

09:40.543 --> 09:41.710
You know what this is?

09:42.921 --> 09:45.798
This is Dexter's new birth certificate.

09:45.924 --> 09:48.968
The adoption finally went through.

09:49.094 --> 09:52.012
- You're a Morgan now.
- l thought l was already a Morgan.

09:52.138 --> 09:54.765
Well, you have been to us,
but it's official now.

09:57.269 --> 09:59.395
lt took a long time and a lot of hurdles.

09:59.521 --> 10:02.940
- This is an important day for us.
- Hey. Dad?

10:03.066 --> 10:06.944
How come you never told us
what happened to Dexter's real parents?

10:07.070 --> 10:08.696
Well, they died.

10:08.822 --> 10:11.615
- l know, but how?
- l don't know.

10:11.741 --> 10:14.952
- Let's not talk about it.
- No, how did they die, Dad?

10:16.037 --> 10:19.290
lt was an accident, a tragic accident.

10:21.960 --> 10:25.879
So, have you found out anything else
about this Joe Driscoll?

10:26.006 --> 10:30.634
Well, l looked online.
l even looked at police records.

10:30.760 --> 10:34.596
There are no birth records, no driver's license,
just the deed to the house.

10:35.557 --> 10:38.475
And a mention in the local paper
about his bowling team.

10:39.102 --> 10:42.146
- That's odd.
- Yeah, l spoke to the probate lawyer,

10:42.272 --> 10:45.691
the guy who drafted the will,
and apparently Joseph Driscoll

10:45.817 --> 10:48.527
was an insurance adjuster of sound mind,

10:48.653 --> 10:51.405
with no doubts about who l was.

10:55.118 --> 10:57.411
You're not feeling any of this, are you?

10:58.413 --> 11:01.915
You're obviously so overwhelmed
that you've shut down.

11:07.047 --> 11:09.006
Maybe.

11:10.717 --> 11:14.386
- lt's too much for you to handle.
- Yeah. l guess.

11:14.512 --> 11:19.391
- So l think l should come with Dexter.
- Oh. no. you don't have to do that.

11:19.517 --> 11:22.102
Trust me. You'll need me.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.720
Did l fall asleep?

11:58.932 --> 12:01.141
Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.

12:09.234 --> 12:11.485
Are we still seeing your brother
Friday night?

12:11.611 --> 12:14.029
No. He's got to go to Dade City.

12:15.407 --> 12:20.202
- What's in Dade City?
- l told you he was adopted, right?

12:20.328 --> 12:23.956
Some dead guy in Dade fucking City
thought he was his biological father

12:24.624 --> 12:27.918
- and left him a house.
- Really?

12:36.136 --> 12:40.722
- lt's a mistake. a big one.
- Still, though, that's got to. . .

12:42.183 --> 12:45.269
Open up some old wounds.

12:47.105 --> 12:50.649
- When are you leaving?
- Me?

12:50.775 --> 12:52.901
l'm staying in bed with you all weekend.

12:54.320 --> 12:58.824
- l thought you two were close.
- We are.

12:58.950 --> 13:02.161
Dex likes to deal with things on his own.
He doesn't need my help.

13:02.287 --> 13:03.454
Or. . .

13:05.790 --> 13:08.625
He doesn't know how to ask for it.

13:17.010 --> 13:19.761
l left a message not to have
this conversation.

13:19.888 --> 13:21.889
Yeah, which is why l hustled over here,

13:22.015 --> 13:27.019
- so we could hash this out like adults.
- l'm an adult but l'm still going out of town.

13:27.145 --> 13:30.856
Not if it means blowing off
my scheduled visit with my kids.

13:30.982 --> 13:33.817
That's not your call.
The kids are already at Colleen's.

13:33.943 --> 13:36.737
You can have your visit when we get back.

13:43.745 --> 13:47.164
lt's just that l already laid out cash
for the tickets.

13:48.750 --> 13:50.876
A death in the family trumps the circus.

13:51.002 --> 13:52.669
Dexter is not your family. l am.

13:56.758 --> 13:57.758
You ready?

14:00.345 --> 14:02.304
Hey, Paul. Better hit the road.

14:38.550 --> 14:40.842
They should serve a cardiologist
with these burgers.

14:40.969 --> 14:45.556
We had to eat them.
Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.

14:45.682 --> 14:46.723
lt's nice.

14:48.351 --> 14:51.228
The lawyer said there should be
a key under the mat.

14:55.441 --> 14:59.319
- Are you my new neighbors?
- No.

14:59.445 --> 15:02.114
We're just here to clear up
some things with the estate.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.908
So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

15:05.034 --> 15:08.287
He was only 60. you know -
too young for a heart attack.

15:08.413 --> 15:13.250
He used to clean my gutters every fall.
l don't know what l'm gonna do now. . .

15:14.794 --> 15:17.421
Unless you know how to clean gutters.

15:18.631 --> 15:22.926
We're not gonna be here for that long.
But you have a good day.

15:42.030 --> 15:44.615
A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.

15:48.536 --> 15:52.956
We can head back tomorrow morning.
as soon l straighten things out at the morgue.

15:53.082 --> 15:55.542
l don't want a house in Dade City.

15:55.668 --> 15:57.919
Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.

15:58.046 --> 16:02.799
And l don't think anybody else is gonna do it,
so l guess that leaves us.

16:05.470 --> 16:06.845
Told you you'd need me.

16:33.498 --> 16:36.041
- Hey, James.
- Hey, man.

16:36.167 --> 16:39.044
lA is pressing me
on my report of the shooting.

16:39.170 --> 16:43.090
- Yeah.
- There's one thing that l can't get clear on.

16:43.216 --> 16:46.259
- lt's pretty clear from where l was standing.
- Yeah...

16:47.637 --> 16:53.100
Except l could have sworn that l heard
your 9mm go off before the .38.

16:53.226 --> 16:56.770
Now, there's lots of reasons
it could have gone down that way.

16:56.896 --> 17:00.982
lf Bayard even just aimed at you,
it's still all right to shoot.

17:01.109 --> 17:03.777
- Except he shot first.
- Maybe you're confused about that, too.

17:03.903 --> 17:07.155
But the blood-spatter report says
it couldn't have gone that way.

17:07.281 --> 17:11.368
- You saying l'm a liar?
- l'm saying maybe you're not remembering.

17:11.494 --> 17:16.164
This may come as a shock to Dexter. Angel.
but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.

17:18.501 --> 17:21.586
Look, l just want to know
why a man is dead.

17:21.713 --> 17:26.591
- You want to come at me, you do it straight.
- You want it straight? l did not see a gun.

17:27.969 --> 17:30.887
Angel. l need to talk to Dexter.

17:32.890 --> 17:33.890
Help me out, man.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.867
- ls that Joe?
- Must be.

17:55.538 --> 18:01.334
lt's weird, but he looks a little bit like Dexter. . .
But not really.

18:01.461 --> 18:04.838
Those seem to be the only pictures
in the house. There's no. . .

18:06.174 --> 18:08.425
family or kids' photos.

18:09.635 --> 18:10.635
Lonely.

18:19.729 --> 18:20.812
Dexter.

18:20.938 --> 18:22.689
- Hi.
- Hey.

18:22.815 --> 18:26.318
Surprise.

18:27.945 --> 18:31.573
l know you can't ask for my help,
but it's my duty to,

18:31.699 --> 18:33.158
you know. . .

18:33.284 --> 18:37.746
help while you deal with old wounds.

18:37.872 --> 18:40.165
Or wha. . .
Jesus. Whatever. l'm here.

18:40.291 --> 18:44.044
- so it appears.
- And this is Rudy.

18:44.962 --> 18:46.463
Hey.

18:48.716 --> 18:50.717
l've waited a long time to meet Dexter.

18:52.470 --> 18:55.180
And you must be Rita.

18:55.306 --> 18:57.349
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:57.475 --> 19:02.646
He came here for me - for the both of us.
lsn't he great?

19:11.656 --> 19:13.365
A lot of work to pack all this up.

19:13.491 --> 19:16.535
Even with the four of us,
it'll take us the whole weekend.

19:16.661 --> 19:18.870
- The weekend?
- Where should l put our stuff?

19:20.665 --> 19:24.251
lt's too eerie.
sleeping in a dead man's house.

19:24.377 --> 19:25.794
l saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.963
We could stay here and save the money.

19:28.381 --> 19:29.422
l mean, it is late,

19:29.549 --> 19:32.342
and we'd probably get more
packing done if we stayed here.

19:33.052 --> 19:35.470
lt's up to you, Dex. Just say the word.

19:38.599 --> 19:40.517
As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.

19:42.019 --> 19:44.521
OK, l'll go look for some clean sheets.

19:52.572 --> 19:55.156
How did a death
turn into a couples' weekend?

20:01.706 --> 20:04.541
Luckily, l get up earlier than normal people.

20:05.167 --> 20:06.167
Coffee?

20:09.422 --> 20:12.215
Thanks. l've got to hit the morgue.

20:15.636 --> 20:17.721
Want company?

20:18.598 --> 20:19.931
No.

20:20.975 --> 20:23.059
- Thank you, though.
- lt's private.

20:24.687 --> 20:25.896
l get it.

20:36.324 --> 20:38.783
l gave Joe a physical once a year,
like clockwork,

20:38.910 --> 20:41.620
so no history of heart disease, but it happens.

20:41.746 --> 20:42.829
lt appears so.

20:42.955 --> 20:45.790
We were about to send him
to a crematorium when we found Dexter.

20:45.917 --> 20:50.921
We thought his son should have a chance
to pay his last respects.

20:51.047 --> 20:52.923
l'm not his son.

20:53.341 --> 20:56.092
Estrangement in a family is a shame, but. . .

20:56.844 --> 20:59.262
death is the great unifier.

21:37.885 --> 21:39.803
That's an interesting tattoo.

21:40.930 --> 21:44.933
Joe said he picked that up in Nam.
You can be proud. He was a patriot.

21:45.351 --> 21:49.020
- Perhaps he was also an ex-convict.
- Excuse me?

21:49.146 --> 21:51.773
lt's a prison tattoo.
it's a pen and ballpoint ink one.

21:53.317 --> 21:56.069
lt's three or four decades old,
judging by the fade.

21:57.279 --> 21:59.572
Son, l knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.

21:59.699 --> 22:04.828
He was a good man, a quiet man,
and a damn good bowler.

22:07.665 --> 22:11.626
How'd you determine cardiac arrest?
Was there damage to the coronary artery?

22:11.752 --> 22:14.587
lt's professional curiosity.

22:14.714 --> 22:18.717
- l work in forensics, down in Miami.
- l see.

22:18.843 --> 22:23.304
Well, l found micro aneurisms in the retinas.

22:23.431 --> 22:26.391
lt's common with seizures
during a heart attack.

22:26.517 --> 22:30.520
lt's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.

22:30.646 --> 22:34.733
son. l may be a small-town doctor.
but l know a heart attack when l see one.

22:37.236 --> 22:38.528
Who knows what caused it?

22:39.155 --> 22:41.698
Stress, inactivity. . .

22:43.034 --> 22:44.034
French fries.

22:45.911 --> 22:48.580
But knowing won't bring him back.

23:01.510 --> 23:05.221
lt's hard to accept so many unanswered
questions, but sometimes. . .

23:05.973 --> 23:07.557
No, you're right. . .

23:09.060 --> 23:10.393
Dr. Pittman.

23:11.812 --> 23:15.607
Yeah, this is really hard.

23:15.733 --> 23:20.779
You mind if l just take
a minute alone with. . . Dad?

23:22.239 --> 23:23.782
l'll be next door in my office.

23:52.937 --> 23:53.812
Masuka.

23:53.938 --> 23:55.605
Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

23:56.023 --> 24:00.652
- Dude, l know your last name.
- l need a favor, a DNA comparison.

24:00.778 --> 24:02.946
l thought you were away with the girlfriend.

24:03.072 --> 24:07.826
- What? She surfing the crimson wave?
- l'm just helping out a local agency.

24:07.952 --> 24:11.704
l'm gonna send you two blood samples.
l need it AsAP.

24:11.831 --> 24:14.833
- Do a tox screen, will you?
- Hey, Romeo,

24:14.959 --> 24:19.087
if this is your idea of a romantic weekend,
you will be a bachelor for a long time.

24:29.598 --> 24:32.183
Run another lV.
Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

24:32.309 --> 24:35.019
- What's his pressure?
- lt's 80 and dropping.

24:35.604 --> 24:36.980
We may need to do a belly tap.

24:37.898 --> 24:40.066
Hey, Dex. Buddy, l'm here.

24:40.192 --> 24:42.193
- lt hurts. Dad.
- What happened?

24:42.695 --> 24:45.029
He tried to climb a fence
to get Debra's ball,

24:45.156 --> 24:48.700
but a dog chased after him.
and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

24:48.826 --> 24:51.786
- ls he gonna be all right?
- We can keep him stable for a while.

24:51.912 --> 24:55.915
But he's gonna need surgery to repair some
internal bleeding. That's a problem.

24:56.041 --> 24:59.127
Can we talk over here, please?
Dex, l'll be right back.

24:59.253 --> 25:01.546
Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.425
OK. the complication is
with your son's blood type.

25:05.551 --> 25:08.761
- l don't want to talk about this.
- Why are you being like this?

25:08.888 --> 25:10.930
Don't mention that in front of anybody.

25:11.056 --> 25:15.351
Are you crazy? He could die.
You've got to go now.

25:19.899 --> 25:23.193
So, you heard the .38 go off before
Sergeant Doakes' 9mm.

25:23.319 --> 25:26.070
Then l went under the causeway,
and l saw the suspect...

25:26.197 --> 25:30.533
- Mr. Bayard.
- . .Mr. Bayard on the ground,

25:30.659 --> 25:34.245
- his gun lying next to him.
- And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's gun?

25:34.371 --> 25:38.791
Well, the .38 wasn't mine. . .and
Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.

25:38.918 --> 25:42.086
Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the gun
before the foot chase began?

25:42.213 --> 25:44.589
Sergeant Doakes did.

25:44.715 --> 25:47.467
Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?

25:48.594 --> 25:53.932
- Did you know Mr. Bayard was a janitor?
- l. . . How the fuck would l know that?

25:54.058 --> 25:58.061
Never got even a parking ticket since
he immigrated from Haiti 1 5 years ago.

26:01.523 --> 26:05.026
He got a lot more than that this time,
didn't he?

26:10.741 --> 26:16.329
Are you sure you heard the .38 go off
before sergeant Doakes' 9mm?

26:25.422 --> 26:28.174
Joe bought this house outright in 1 976.

26:28.300 --> 26:34.931
- Paid cash. no records before that.
- No records, no childhood photos. . .

26:35.349 --> 26:38.768
The guy was 60.
but it's like his life started when he was 30.

26:39.228 --> 26:42.522
- You know, you're right. He's right.
- So, what happened

26:42.648 --> 26:44.440
between years one and 29?

26:44.566 --> 26:47.652
- Maybe he butchered his entire family.
- Yeah,

26:47.778 --> 26:51.864
or he walked out on his two wives
and a lot of bad debt.

26:51.991 --> 26:55.660
The guy was a loser. after all.
Who else owns this many bowling balls?

26:55.786 --> 27:02.208
- What do you think, Dex?
- l think Joe spent some time in prison,

27:02.334 --> 27:06.212
probably mixed with some bad people.
Maybe he had to hide from them.

27:06.338 --> 27:10.675
Whatever it was, drugs were involved.
Narcotics anonymous.

27:10.801 --> 27:15.013
Paul used to get these, except he never
made it past the welcome chip.

27:15.139 --> 27:18.850
- Looks like Joe was clean for. . .
- Let me guess - 30 years.

27:18.976 --> 27:21.477
Joe said no to the drugs,
but not his rock 'n' roll.

27:21.603 --> 27:25.898
Nothing in his collection post-1 980.
Got to love a purist.

27:44.126 --> 27:45.626
Oh, good. Dancing.

28:38.222 --> 28:41.224
- Hello?
- Hey, babe. lt's Paul.

28:43.811 --> 28:45.812
Just making sure dear Dexter

28:45.938 --> 28:50.525
is dealing decently with his dead dad.

28:51.777 --> 28:54.278
We're fine. Everyone's fine, all right?

28:54.405 --> 28:57.031
- We'll see you on Monday.
- No. no. no.

28:57.157 --> 29:01.327
Talk to me. You having fun? 'Cause l'm not.

29:01.453 --> 29:04.622
- Paul.
- l would have.

29:04.748 --> 29:09.127
l could have taken my kids to the circus.

29:09.253 --> 29:12.922
We'd be eating peanuts right now,
stepping in elephant shit.

29:13.340 --> 29:15.633
Paul, this's not helping my confidence in Dexter.

29:15.759 --> 29:19.345
Oh, l think you've got enough
confidence for both of us.

29:19.471 --> 29:22.598
Look, if you want to work towards
building more visitation days,

29:22.724 --> 29:25.101
you need to avoid this behavior right here.

29:29.940 --> 29:34.861
Now, l think you might just want
to politely hang up.

29:38.907 --> 29:42.452
OK. You're right.

29:43.620 --> 29:46.080
l'm sorry.

29:46.206 --> 29:48.458
You have a great weekend.

29:59.219 --> 30:03.514
A secret life - the only thing
Joe and l have in common.

30:04.308 --> 30:07.393
There's nothing else
in this house to connect us.

30:07.519 --> 30:09.812
Hiding out?

30:11.482 --> 30:12.607
Cleaning up.

30:16.487 --> 30:19.864
l can only imagine what you're going through.

30:19.990 --> 30:22.575
A lot of lemon-fresh joy.

30:22.701 --> 30:25.828
You joke. lt's a good defense, by the way.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.038
Thank you, l think.

30:27.956 --> 30:31.542
Still, the possibility has
got to be weighing on Dexter.

30:31.668 --> 30:36.797
- What possibility?
- That Joe could actually be your dad.

30:36.924 --> 30:40.092
The only way that's a possibility
is if Harry was wrong.

30:40.219 --> 30:46.682
- And that's just not possible.
- Or he lied.

30:48.936 --> 30:51.896
Don't you worry, little man.
You're not gonna feel a thing.

30:52.022 --> 30:54.524
l thought there was a problem,
you know, the blood?

30:54.650 --> 30:55.816
Your dad fixed it.

30:55.943 --> 30:59.529
See, you have a very special
blood type - AB negative.

30:59.655 --> 31:01.989
lt's hard to come by.
and our supply was low.

31:02.115 --> 31:05.409
But your dad knew somebody
with blood like yours. You're lucky.

31:05.536 --> 31:08.329
- Can l have a moment with my son?
- Yeah.

31:08.455 --> 31:12.833
Hey, Dex. Everything's gonna be fine.
You'll be good as new.

31:12.960 --> 31:17.547
- l will?
- Hey, would l lie to you?

31:21.218 --> 31:25.763
When my father was dying.
he just asked me for one thing.

31:32.354 --> 31:33.771
"Be an honest man."

31:37.818 --> 31:39.527
That's all he asked.

31:41.780 --> 31:46.033
l made him that promise,
and that's why l'm a cop.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.748
Now this Haitian man is dead,

31:52.874 --> 31:55.626
and l don't know why.

31:55.752 --> 31:57.545
But l know it ain't right.

32:01.091 --> 32:02.216
But if l talk. . .

32:03.302 --> 32:06.095
l'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

32:07.472 --> 32:10.099
- But if l lie. . .
- Hold on.

32:20.902 --> 32:22.111
Go ahead.

32:36.793 --> 32:39.962
The blood spatter
doesn't match Doakes' report.

32:44.384 --> 32:45.509
Also. . .

32:49.514 --> 32:53.643
. . l heard Doakes' 9mm go off before the .38.

32:53.769 --> 32:57.188
- But he must have had good cause.
- so Doakes fired first.

33:03.654 --> 33:05.321
Doakes fired first.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.586
- l hope tuna's all right.
- Love me a little mercury.

33:22.339 --> 33:25.216
- lt's Dexter's.
- He's out stealing garbage space. . .

33:25.342 --> 33:28.052
- from the neighbors.
- Criminal - l like it.

33:28.178 --> 33:30.388
lt's the station.

33:30.514 --> 33:31.514
Morgan here.

33:33.392 --> 33:37.269
Wait. Did l call the hot Morgan by mistake?

33:37.396 --> 33:41.565
Freudian.
My subconscious has been exposed.

33:41.692 --> 33:44.819
- Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.
- l got the results.

33:44.945 --> 33:46.612
On Doakes' shooting? ls he cleared?

33:46.738 --> 33:50.866
- On the DNA test.
- What DNA test?

34:11.221 --> 34:14.181
You trusted Dad your entire life,
so why question him now?

34:17.394 --> 34:22.231
- Am l missing something?
- DNA test?

34:24.651 --> 34:25.651
Masuka called?

34:25.777 --> 34:30.448
Your biological father was dead.
Dad told us that. l remember.

34:30.574 --> 34:32.408
So, the DNA came back negative?

34:35.412 --> 34:38.289
lt was a match.

34:38.415 --> 34:40.624
Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

34:53.138 --> 34:54.138
lnteresting.

34:56.808 --> 35:00.436
Do you think Dad. . .lied?

35:02.189 --> 35:04.815
l think he might have known Joe was here. . .

35:06.318 --> 35:08.778
five hours up l-95 my whole life.

35:09.446 --> 35:11.280
He must have had a damn good reason.

35:12.491 --> 35:15.910
l'm not gonna let some guy you
didn't even know draw him into question.

35:16.036 --> 35:18.078
Deb, l'm not questioning anything.

35:19.080 --> 35:21.957
That's why you got a tox screen, too.

35:27.172 --> 35:28.380
l need to clear my head.

35:31.009 --> 35:32.301
Where are your car keys?

35:37.557 --> 35:41.143
l ordered the tox screen because
Joe had no history of heart disease.

35:41.269 --> 35:45.439
- And the coroner's report was inept.
- You did it because he's important to Dexter.

35:45.565 --> 35:48.776
- lt was professional curiosity.
- So you'll be professionally glad

35:48.902 --> 35:51.862
to know that the only toxin
in his system was a sedative,

35:51.988 --> 35:53.697
which he probably took to. . .

35:53.824 --> 35:58.327
- l don't know. sleep.
- That would surprise me.

35:58.453 --> 36:00.079
Joe was 30 years sober,

36:00.205 --> 36:05.876
and l haven't found anything
stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

36:06.002 --> 36:08.754
lt wouldn't be
the first addict falling off the wagon.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.631
Or someone slipped him the sedative

36:10.757 --> 36:13.509
so he wouldn't struggle
once injected with something.

36:14.052 --> 36:16.512
- Like?
- Diabetic insulin.

36:17.514 --> 36:20.057
lt can cause cardiac arrest.
We've seen it before.

36:20.183 --> 36:24.353
lt's nearly impossible to detect unless
you find a point of injection.

36:24.479 --> 36:27.606
- But if l had a chance to examine the body. . .
- Jesus Christ!

36:27.732 --> 36:30.943
He's not even your family.

36:31.069 --> 36:34.530
Mom and Dad were. l am.

36:37.450 --> 36:41.912
- Will you start questioning me now?
- You? Why would l...

36:42.038 --> 36:44.582
Joe Driscoll was
obviously bad fucking news,

36:44.708 --> 36:47.626
which is why Dad didn't want you
to know anything about him!

36:47.752 --> 36:49.545
Doesn't that matter to you?

36:53.008 --> 36:55.009
l don't know what you want from me.

37:01.433 --> 37:05.728
l want what Dad wanted.
l want nothing to do with this guy.

37:07.022 --> 37:11.942
Let's just finish packing up
this crappy house and walk the fuck away!

37:12.068 --> 37:14.361
All right. That sounds like a good plan. OK?

37:31.379 --> 37:33.422
l guess l understand why Deb is upset.

37:33.548 --> 37:37.801
We both idolized Harry,
lived by what he taught us. . .

37:37.928 --> 37:41.138
Though Deb never had
to be taught not to kill innocent people.

37:44.434 --> 37:47.269
That's why she doesn't understand
why l need to know.

37:52.609 --> 37:54.944
Howdy, neighbor. Let me get that for Dexter.

37:55.070 --> 37:57.112
Oh. Well, thank Dexter.

37:58.114 --> 38:01.659
l was wondering, did you notice any visitors
over at Joe's last week?

38:02.327 --> 38:05.037
Visitors? Oh, l'm not sure.

38:05.163 --> 38:08.707
l'm just wondering
if he has any outstanding bills.

38:08.833 --> 38:12.920
A gardener, maybe,
or a delivery person, repairman?

38:13.046 --> 38:17.800
Well. come to think of it.
there was a cable repairman here last week.

38:18.218 --> 38:19.885
He was polite.

38:20.011 --> 38:23.055
But, you know,
he couldn't fix my TV antenna.

38:23.181 --> 38:24.473
You remember what he looked like?

38:27.394 --> 38:30.521
Well, he had dark hair. . .

38:30.647 --> 38:34.525
average height, normal, l suppose.

38:38.321 --> 38:41.532
l did some checking
on our suspect Jacques Bayard.

38:41.658 --> 38:43.450
You lending lA a hand?

38:43.576 --> 38:46.078
l just like to know what's
going on in my department.

38:46.204 --> 38:48.539
And what is going on?

38:49.082 --> 38:52.960
Turns out Mr. Bayard changed
his name when he immigrated here.

38:53.086 --> 38:55.087
Used to be Rene Thibault,

38:55.213 --> 38:58.340
a former officer in the Haitian military.

38:59.843 --> 39:04.013
Didn't your tour in the army
include some special op in Haiti?

39:05.974 --> 39:06.890
Right.

39:07.017 --> 39:09.018
Special means you don't talk about it.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.563
But l know you've heard
as many horror stories as l have,

39:12.689 --> 39:17.067
about what went on down there
with those death squads.

39:17.193 --> 39:18.318
What were they called?

39:19.904 --> 39:22.322
Tonton Macoutes.

39:22.449 --> 39:25.242
Yeah, "the bogeymen."

39:27.120 --> 39:29.079
They did a lot of terrible things,

39:29.497 --> 39:31.165
killed a lot of people.

39:35.211 --> 39:38.464
They made mothers carry
the heads of their dead sons.

39:38.590 --> 39:41.967
Forced fathers to rape their daughters.

39:42.093 --> 39:44.636
Tied cinder blocks around
people's necks and drowned them

39:44.763 --> 39:48.891
and put mutilated bodies in trees and
killed anybody who tried to take them down.

39:52.937 --> 39:54.605
This man, Jacques Bayard,

39:56.107 --> 39:57.941
if he did those things. . .

39:59.402 --> 40:01.445
He deserved a lot worse than he got.

40:08.912 --> 40:11.830
Don't worry, James. lt'll be over soon.

40:16.878 --> 40:18.253
l know it will.

40:38.191 --> 40:42.319
lf Joe was shot up with insulin,
there will be an injection welt. . .

40:42.445 --> 40:45.155
maybe between his toes or in a freckle.

40:45.281 --> 40:46.865
lf it's there, l'll find it.

40:52.122 --> 40:53.747
Small towns.

41:17.856 --> 41:21.316
Come on, Dr. Pittman,
which crematorium did you send Joe to?

41:41.087 --> 41:42.337
Hey! You! Stop!

41:43.047 --> 41:43.881
Come on!

42:05.695 --> 42:06.862
Get in!

42:15.997 --> 42:17.080
Heard you sneak out.

42:17.790 --> 42:22.211
- Took a guess where you were headed.
- Figuring l'd need a ride?

42:22.337 --> 42:27.049
Figured l could talk you out of it.
No such luck. huh?

42:27.175 --> 42:31.053
- Deb will be delighted.
- As far as l know, you went out for a walk.

42:36.517 --> 42:38.227
Jesus, did you steal something?

42:40.230 --> 42:44.608
My fingerprints were all over it. l figured
it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.

42:44.734 --> 42:46.318
lt's just a box of ashes.

42:48.738 --> 42:51.698
- Joe was cremated, then.
- Yep.

42:53.284 --> 42:56.536
Guess you weren't able to find out
if he was injected with anything.

42:56.663 --> 42:57.537
No.

43:00.917 --> 43:03.293
- What are you gonna do with him?
- l don't know.

43:07.423 --> 43:08.423
Dumpster?

43:11.386 --> 43:12.719
l have a better idea.

43:28.820 --> 43:29.820
You know. . .

43:32.031 --> 43:36.118
No matter what Harry said.
no matter what Deb thinks,

43:37.328 --> 43:41.039
- that's your father.
- Cardboard box.

43:41.165 --> 43:43.208
l know you don't want to acknowledge it,

43:43.334 --> 43:45.544
which is why you're breaking and entering,

43:45.670 --> 43:47.838
searching for some killer.

43:49.340 --> 43:50.716
But you took that

43:50.842 --> 43:53.343
because there's a part of Dexter. . .

43:53.469 --> 43:55.137
that knows that this. . .

43:57.307 --> 43:58.307
That box. . .

43:59.726 --> 44:01.601
is your real father.

44:20.330 --> 44:21.747
My father.

44:37.388 --> 44:38.930
Sounds strange.

44:40.725 --> 44:42.392
l know.

45:40.743 --> 45:42.369
Oh, hey.

45:42.954 --> 45:47.124
- You all right?
- l was just getting some air.

45:51.963 --> 45:56.091
l found something in Joe's closet.

45:56.217 --> 46:00.178
lt's just a bunch of papers.
They're over there.

46:14.777 --> 46:16.111
Any clues?

46:26.622 --> 46:27.622
Hey, buddy.

46:28.958 --> 46:31.293
- How you feeling?
- Good.

46:31.419 --> 46:33.879
lt kind of itches.
but they have ice cream here.

46:34.755 --> 46:36.381
Life's a trade-off.

46:36.507 --> 46:39.342
- What are you making there?
- A thank-you card.

46:40.428 --> 46:43.096
See? The nurse brought me
the crayons and everything.

46:43.222 --> 46:44.848
Who's it for?

46:44.974 --> 46:49.978
Well. she said l should thank
the man who gave me the blood.

46:50.104 --> 46:54.566
l mean, that's normal, right,
giving thank-you cards?

47:00.156 --> 47:01.156
Yes, it is.

47:03.367 --> 47:05.035
lt's just that he's gone.

47:05.161 --> 47:07.454
And we won't be seeing him again.

47:08.581 --> 47:14.044
- l'm sorry.
- That's all right, it doesn't mean anything.

47:23.638 --> 47:28.016
Yeah, it does. You keep drawing, son.

47:28.684 --> 47:32.312
- l'll make sure it finds him.
- OK.

47:50.915 --> 47:52.624
You had the case dropped?

47:53.626 --> 47:54.876
Excuse me.

47:58.089 --> 47:59.589
lA dropped Doakes' case.

47:59.715 --> 48:02.467
Do you seriously think
l have any say over what lA does?

48:02.593 --> 48:05.887
l put everything on the line.
l told lA the truth,

48:06.013 --> 48:09.474
and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.
What the hell happened?

48:09.600 --> 48:13.853
- Maria. l deserve to know.
- All l know is that lA got a call

48:13.980 --> 48:15.105
from an agency in Washington.

48:15.231 --> 48:17.107
- What agency?
- l'm guessing military.

48:17.233 --> 48:20.944
They said the case involves
some sensitive foreign-relations issues. . .

48:21.070 --> 48:24.239
- so they will handle it from there.
- They disappeared it.

48:24.365 --> 48:27.284
Doakes had a history with them
l figured special forces,

48:27.410 --> 48:30.161
- but this kind of reach. . .
- You think it was Black Ops, ClA?

48:30.288 --> 48:34.916
Maybe. Probably.

48:36.127 --> 48:39.337
- And l ratted him out. Jesus Christ.
- Angel...

48:40.256 --> 48:41.965
You did what you thought was right.

48:48.598 --> 48:51.808
- squeak. squeak.
- Do you have a problem?

48:51.934 --> 48:52.934
Officer Benson,

48:54.729 --> 48:56.605
you just bumped into your superior.

48:58.482 --> 49:01.776
l believe you owe Detective Batista
an apology!

49:04.155 --> 49:05.322
Yes, sir.

49:07.617 --> 49:09.159
l'm sorry, sir.

49:47.782 --> 49:51.117
l know l should be sorry
that we met under these circumstances,

49:51.243 --> 49:54.496
but truthfully, l think
it was the best way to get to know Dexter.

49:58.042 --> 50:00.168
Realtor says you won't get much for it.

50:03.589 --> 50:07.467
- Well. . .more than if l kept it.
- Are we good?

50:12.598 --> 50:13.848
We're fine.

50:20.064 --> 50:23.149
All right. l'll see you back at the station.

50:39.083 --> 50:41.835
Cable repairman.

50:41.961 --> 50:45.588
Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.

50:45.715 --> 50:46.715
Wait!

50:47.341 --> 50:49.467
Please, l want to ask you something.

50:51.929 --> 50:53.179
Wait!

50:55.474 --> 50:59.269
- Alone again.
- Finally.

51:02.857 --> 51:06.443
You know what?

51:06.569 --> 51:10.238
- l'm glad you were here.
- Thought you would be.

51:16.454 --> 51:19.622
The cable repairman. . .

51:19.749 --> 51:23.418
Did he say anything
about my TV antenna?

52:03.000 --> 52:04.751
Rita, it's me.

52:08.464 --> 52:09.380
They're asleep.

52:09.507 --> 52:11.716
Yeah, well, l should have been here, OK?

52:11.842 --> 52:15.261
lt's late, you're drunk and you can't
keep coming here unannounced.

52:15.387 --> 52:20.183
- You don't call the shots. OK?
- Look, Paul, l want you to leave.

52:20.309 --> 52:22.060
l don't give a fuck what you want.

52:22.186 --> 52:24.938
- l want my fucking kids!
- You're gonna scare them.

52:25.064 --> 52:27.398
They don't want to see me?
They are gonna remember

52:27.525 --> 52:30.985
who the head of this fucking family is. Hey!

52:32.696 --> 52:36.491
You're right. l've been awful.

52:36.617 --> 52:38.993
l just didn't realize l was hurting you so much.

52:39.703 --> 52:43.331
But l can make it up to Dexter. Let me try.

52:58.973 --> 53:00.098
Where are you going?

53:01.433 --> 53:03.726
Want to play rough?
Huh? ls that what you want?

53:03.853 --> 53:05.520
No! No!

53:06.355 --> 53:07.605
Fuck you, whore.

53:07.731 --> 53:10.400
Come on. Come on!

53:20.411 --> 53:22.120
Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

54:01.577 --> 54:03.578
l had a father. . .

54:04.288 --> 54:06.915
someone other than Harry
who called me son.

54:08.250 --> 54:11.336
The thought never even occurred to me.

54:11.462 --> 54:14.047
Harry was all l needed.

54:14.798 --> 54:18.134
lt was Harry who always had the answers.

54:18.260 --> 54:21.554
He knew who was good, bad, safe. . .

54:22.723 --> 54:24.641
And dangerous.

54:24.767 --> 54:26.976
l built my life on Harry's code.

54:27.102 --> 54:29.771
l lived by it.

54:29.897 --> 54:31.981
But Harry lied.

54:32.107 --> 54:33.858
Why would he do that?

54:33.984 --> 54:36.486
What else don't l know?

54:36.612 --> 54:40.281
My concrete foundation is turning
to shifting sand.

54:40.407 --> 54:42.367
Maybe Rudy was right.

54:42.493 --> 54:46.329
You never can truly know anyone.
