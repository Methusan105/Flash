WEBVTT

00:02.132 --> 00:03.925
Previously on Dexter. . .

00:04.051 --> 00:05.677
Think this is our guy's work?

00:05.803 --> 00:07.095
The ice-truck killer?

00:07.221 --> 00:08.680
LaGuerta insulted the real
killer's intelligence,

00:08.806 --> 00:11.683
and now he's getting back at us
for chasing after the wrong guy.

00:11.809 --> 00:14.852
lt's the guard - Tucci. l think he's alive.

00:14.978 --> 00:16.354
Tucci's alive?

00:16.480 --> 00:20.608
The ice-truck killer is keeping him alive
to perform amputations.

00:21.026 --> 00:23.319
He's sending me a message.

00:23.445 --> 00:24.654
He wants me to go there.

00:26.615 --> 00:27.824
Please.

00:27.950 --> 00:30.702
- He was left here so l would kill him.
- Just kill me.

00:30.828 --> 00:32.412
l can't kill this man.

00:34.873 --> 00:37.375
They're taking Tucci over to County alive.

00:37.501 --> 00:40.878
l don't know who your contacts are, Morgan,
but you are my up-and-comer.

00:41.004 --> 00:42.714
You saved a man's life tonight.

00:42.840 --> 00:47.719
The thing that surprises me most about Rita
is how much l like being with her.

00:47.845 --> 00:51.514
There's all sorts of things l can do.

00:59.314 --> 01:01.399
What. . . What are you doing?

01:02.359 --> 01:04.068
Whatever l want.

01:05.612 --> 01:09.449
My new friend thought l wouldn't be able
to resist the kill he left for me. . .

01:10.659 --> 01:12.160
but l did.

01:13.036 --> 01:16.164
l'm not the monster he wants me to be.

01:16.290 --> 01:18.291
l'm Dexter.

03:16.410 --> 03:18.953
l like to pretend l'm alone.

03:19.079 --> 03:21.330
Completely alone,

03:21.456 --> 03:23.875
maybe post-apocalypse or plague,

03:25.919 --> 03:29.547
whatever. No one left to act normal for,

03:29.673 --> 03:32.008
no need to hide who l really am.

03:33.343 --> 03:36.345
lt would be freeing.

03:37.097 --> 03:40.016
Stop grinning like a fucking psycho
and get back to work.

03:40.142 --> 03:41.642
Sorry, Sergeant.

03:41.768 --> 03:46.647
l was just waiting for Forensics to wrap up
before l tear the bed apart.

03:47.983 --> 03:50.568
l'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.

03:52.988 --> 03:56.324
My shadow companion
chose this place well.

04:01.371 --> 04:03.748
This was his sanctuary,

04:03.874 --> 04:05.583
for a while, at least.

04:05.709 --> 04:08.711
All these people pawing over it, it seems. . .

04:10.380 --> 04:12.214
disrespectful.

04:15.552 --> 04:17.845
Tell me the sick bastard
bled on something, Dexter.

04:17.971 --> 04:19.847
He was here for days,
playing with sharp objects.

04:19.973 --> 04:23.517
l'll keep looking. but so far
this place is spotless, amazingly so.

04:23.644 --> 04:26.187
The only blood l found
belongs to the security guard.

04:26.313 --> 04:29.065
- Has he said anything yet?
- Mr. Tucci's still unconscious.

04:29.191 --> 04:30.608
Lieutenant, up here!

04:30.734 --> 04:32.610
There's got to be something here. Find it.

04:32.736 --> 04:36.280
The guy's not a ghost.
Tony Tucci is evidence of that.

04:37.908 --> 04:40.201
Hey, Dexter, you get
all this blood on camera yet?

04:40.327 --> 04:42.578
lt's like shooting a Jackson Pollock.

04:48.585 --> 04:51.921
Well, your Jackson Pollock is in the bag.

04:55.092 --> 04:56.467
Ready?

04:56.593 --> 04:57.927
OK.

05:00.722 --> 05:02.598
What was that? Did you see that?

05:02.724 --> 05:05.142
- What?
- Damn rats.

05:06.353 --> 05:09.939
We're all gonna get histoplasmosis
from all their shit in the dust.

05:10.065 --> 05:14.276
We'll be coughing up blood,
skin lesions, mouth sores.

05:14.403 --> 05:16.904
Lovely.
Can we get the lights, guys?

05:19.950 --> 05:22.326
You ever hear of rat-bite fever?

05:22.452 --> 05:26.080
Masuka. what did l say
about the fucking rats?

05:38.135 --> 05:41.429
You haven't found anything,
won't find anything. This is a bust, right?

05:41.972 --> 05:43.806
ln so many words.

05:43.932 --> 05:46.517
Which means l'm just jerking off
till Tucci wakes up.

05:46.643 --> 05:50.104
so take a break.
You've been working this thing 24-7.

05:50.230 --> 05:53.357
- Or are you still avoiding a personal life?
- Oh. fuck Dexter.

05:53.483 --> 05:55.860
And, yeah, l'm better off
just focusing on the job.

05:55.986 --> 05:57.653
Thanks, guys.

05:59.990 --> 06:02.033
lt doesn't have to be either/or.

06:02.159 --> 06:03.367
Maybe not for Dexter.

06:03.493 --> 06:05.870
lf l found someone, so can you, right?

06:05.996 --> 06:08.164
Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.

06:09.833 --> 06:11.500
Tell me about it.

06:32.647 --> 06:34.523
Yelina?

06:35.025 --> 06:35.983
Are you OK?

06:36.109 --> 06:38.110
l'm sorry. l'm fine.

06:40.072 --> 06:42.239
Ernesto hasn't arrived?

06:52.167 --> 06:54.251
l'm sure he'll be here soon.

06:54.377 --> 06:55.920
No.

06:56.046 --> 06:58.756
The coyote wanted more money,
and l didn't have it.

07:00.592 --> 07:01.884
Coyote?

07:02.010 --> 07:04.678
You mean the man you paid
to bring him here?

07:05.222 --> 07:08.432
He said he sent Ernesto back to Cuba.

07:08.558 --> 07:09.600
But that was a week ago,

07:09.726 --> 07:12.103
and no one in Cardenas
has heard from Ernesto.

07:12.229 --> 07:15.648
Yelina, how did you contact this coyote?

07:21.154 --> 07:24.365
This was his number
but it's not working anymore.

07:24.783 --> 07:27.118
l was supposed to leave him
money in a park.

07:27.244 --> 07:30.162
Listen, my boyfriend works for the police.
l'm sure he...

07:30.288 --> 07:32.623
No. no. no.
We can't go to the police.

07:32.749 --> 07:35.084
He said he'd hurt my family in Cuba
if we go to the police.

07:35.210 --> 07:37.419
lt's OK. lt's OK.

07:37.546 --> 07:39.380
Dexter will know what to do.

07:47.305 --> 07:49.140
l feel just terrible for her.

07:49.266 --> 07:52.101
And they were supposed to be married
after he got here.

07:53.854 --> 07:56.564
l do know someone in the department
who deals with immigration issues.

07:56.690 --> 07:57.857
l can talk to him.

07:57.983 --> 07:59.984
That's really kind of you, Dex.

08:00.110 --> 08:05.781
l mean, can you imagine
not knowing if your fiance is dead or alive?

08:06.283 --> 08:07.741
No.

08:07.868 --> 08:11.370
Every night after work Yelina goes across the
street, to the beach.

08:12.372 --> 08:16.292
l've seen her there.
just staring out at the water.

08:16.418 --> 08:18.752
willing him to walk out of it.

08:21.423 --> 08:25.050
Have you ever longed
for anything like that?

08:27.846 --> 08:29.180
She wants something from me.

08:29.306 --> 08:30.514
Ever since the blow job,

08:30.640 --> 08:33.350
she assumes we've taken it
to the next level.

08:33.476 --> 08:36.395
She doesn't know yet -
l don't have a next level.

08:36.521 --> 08:40.649
Well, when l was a kid,
l would have killed for an Atari.

08:41.318 --> 08:42.568
You know?

08:42.694 --> 08:46.864
Cody would laugh at the graphics now,
but back then. man...

08:50.785 --> 08:52.870
lt always comes to this
once sex is introduced.

08:52.996 --> 08:54.705
Small talk no longer cuts it.

08:54.831 --> 08:59.668
Eventually she'll call me a science project
and slam the door in my face.

08:59.794 --> 09:03.172
But when do you think he'll wake up?

09:04.174 --> 09:06.884
Yeah, l did call an hour ago,
but there's a killer out there

09:07.010 --> 09:08.844
that's into whores and security guards,

09:08.970 --> 09:11.430
but l'll bet nurses are next.

09:12.474 --> 09:15.184
Yo, check you, all "MMPD Blue."

09:16.019 --> 09:19.355
Shanda, what are you doing here? You have
another lead on the ice-truck killer?

09:19.481 --> 09:21.565
Man, l got bigger worries
than that sick shit.

09:21.691 --> 09:24.401
Now l got me a girl on the inside, right?

09:24.527 --> 09:26.904
l'm not springing your pimp,
if that's what you're after.

09:27.030 --> 09:29.573
Hell, no.
But my landlord's another fucking story,

09:29.699 --> 09:31.992
trying to kick me out of my home.

09:32.118 --> 09:35.621
He got no cause, except he's a born-again
hypocrite motherfucker.

09:35.747 --> 09:37.248
And you want me to talk to him?

09:37.374 --> 09:39.667
No, l want you to beat in
his pasty. white face.

09:42.963 --> 09:44.255
Found this in evidence.

09:44.381 --> 09:46.382
Masuka was gonna grease it through.

09:47.425 --> 09:48.676
A cigarette butt?

09:48.802 --> 09:51.220
Jesus. we could pull DNA
off of that, or even a print.

09:51.346 --> 09:52.680
Except it would be your print.

09:53.181 --> 09:55.766
You were smoking on a crime scene.

09:55.892 --> 09:59.061
Not on a crime scene.
like on the way-far end of the park.

09:59.187 --> 10:02.856
The whole area's a crime scene.
You should know that by now.

10:02.983 --> 10:05.067
Maybe you ought to just calm
the hell down. my brother.

10:05.193 --> 10:10.406
- Who the fuck is that?
- Give it a rest, Shanda.

10:10.532 --> 10:12.199
Morgan, go do something useful.

10:12.325 --> 10:14.660
Go sit on that security guard
until he wakes up.

10:14.786 --> 10:17.454
And do not talk to him without me.

10:19.749 --> 10:22.710
Believe me, your maid is not the first one
to get screwed.

10:22.836 --> 10:25.671
No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.

10:27.465 --> 10:30.801
So, have you heard of any other
Cuban immigrants disappearing?

10:30.927 --> 10:33.387
A few. The poor bastards.

10:33.513 --> 10:36.223
They spend their life savings,
get stuffed into a fishhold.

10:36.349 --> 10:38.100
puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.

10:38.226 --> 10:41.812
Then they get here, thinking,
"l'm an American. l'm free."

10:41.938 --> 10:43.939
Except the damn coyote. . .

10:45.817 --> 10:50.654
he won't let him go till his family comes up
with a surprise release fee.

10:52.991 --> 10:54.408
lf they can't pay. . .

10:54.534 --> 10:56.493
They disappear.

10:56.619 --> 10:59.955
Freedom's just another word
for one more way to get fucked.

11:03.126 --> 11:05.878
sounds like someone's
doing something very bad.

11:09.174 --> 11:10.674
You have any suspects?

11:10.800 --> 11:14.011
Sure, four or five.
Mostly Cubans themselves,

11:14.137 --> 11:17.848
but not enough evidence for a conviction
or even a warrant.

11:18.892 --> 11:22.895
lf warrants were applied for,
their names will be in the database.

11:24.898 --> 11:26.440
Look, buddy. . .

11:26.566 --> 11:31.195
l know you want to help out your maid.
but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

11:34.282 --> 11:35.949
You'd be surprised.

11:55.762 --> 11:57.137
Jorge Castillo.

11:57.263 --> 12:00.516
Number three on the department's
list of suspects,

12:00.642 --> 12:02.935
but the only one even
remotely close to the park

12:03.061 --> 12:05.729
where Yelina was supposed
to drop the money.

12:08.149 --> 12:10.984
They never got enough evidence
for a search warrant.

12:11.111 --> 12:14.196
but l don't need permission
to keep an eye on this guy.

12:30.255 --> 12:32.381
No neighbors, no foot traffic. . .

12:32.966 --> 12:34.633
lt's promising.

12:37.011 --> 12:39.263
A good place for human trafficking. . .

12:40.056 --> 12:41.723
or worse.

12:47.897 --> 12:49.231
Excuse me.

12:49.357 --> 12:50.941
Private yard.

12:51.067 --> 12:56.363
l'm just praying you have a '69 Stingray
headlight somewhere in here.

12:56.489 --> 12:57.656
Dave Cutler.

12:58.074 --> 12:59.616
Jorge Castillo.

12:59.742 --> 13:01.201
l'm sorry, but l don't.

13:01.327 --> 13:04.788
Man, my restoration's almost done.
She's a beauty.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.707
l don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler,

13:06.833 --> 13:09.710
but l can give you the name
of a Corvette shop that l deal with.

13:09.836 --> 13:12.129
l'll be happy to look around myself.

13:13.173 --> 13:15.883
No offense, man,
but l can't take my phone orders

13:16.009 --> 13:17.926
if l'm watching over my merchandise.

13:18.052 --> 13:20.596
You run this whole place alone?

13:20.722 --> 13:22.181
Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

13:23.224 --> 13:25.184
l'm sorry you made the trip out here.

13:25.310 --> 13:27.144
You know what?

13:28.521 --> 13:30.272
Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.

13:30.398 --> 13:31.857
That's my Vette guy.

13:33.693 --> 13:35.444
Must be nice being your own boss.

13:35.570 --> 13:37.446
Get out in the water whenever you want.

13:37.572 --> 13:40.324
l saw that floater on your key chain.
l got to get one of those.

13:40.450 --> 13:43.160
Lost my keys overboard
twice in the past year.

13:43.286 --> 13:46.038
l do a little fishing.
l got a 32-foot Concept.

13:46.164 --> 13:47.539
What about you?

13:47.665 --> 13:49.917
l got a rowboat with a hole in it.

13:56.299 --> 13:58.217
l don't speak Spanish, sir.

13:59.260 --> 14:02.012
Sorry. l just assumed you were Cuban.

14:03.056 --> 14:05.390
American, pal, just like Dexter.

14:09.604 --> 14:11.271
Just like me.

14:28.831 --> 14:30.874
He's on heavy sedatives at the moment.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.584
l think he deserves them.

14:34.087 --> 14:35.420
l'll wait.

14:57.694 --> 14:59.194
Mr. Tucci.

15:03.616 --> 15:05.325
Tony.

15:08.955 --> 15:11.331
l'm gonna find this cocksucker.

15:15.712 --> 15:17.045
l swear.

16:22.904 --> 16:26.156
l don't understand
America's obsession with cars.

16:28.785 --> 16:31.745
l can just imagine squeezing
Rita and the kids into this thing,

16:31.871 --> 16:34.998
hitting the open road -
cramped quarters, public bathrooms,

16:35.124 --> 16:37.834
hours of nothing but conversation.

16:41.005 --> 16:43.840
lt's someone's American Dream -
my nightmare.

17:11.452 --> 17:13.995
This must be where Castillo locks them up.

17:15.039 --> 17:18.625
But if he's killing them when they can't pay,
he's not doing it here.

17:22.755 --> 17:25.424
So where are they?

17:45.653 --> 17:46.570
Dexter Morgan.

17:46.696 --> 17:49.573
Gerard here. There's a floater
down in South Beach morgue.

17:49.699 --> 17:51.783
Could be a match for your maid's fiance.

17:52.410 --> 17:54.786
She's a maid. She's not my. . .

17:55.621 --> 17:58.540
- ls it all right if l bring her down?
- The sooner, the better.

17:58.666 --> 18:01.376
OK, then. Thanks. Have a good day.

18:01.502 --> 18:03.754
Tonight at the salsa room.

18:03.880 --> 18:06.298
You got to help me
celebrate my pay-grade bump.

18:09.719 --> 18:12.012
Actually, l have a personal project
l'm working on tonight.

18:12.138 --> 18:14.264
Blow it off. l'm buying.

18:14.390 --> 18:16.349
Do you have that list
of prioritized witnesses?

18:16.476 --> 18:18.560
l can't deal with 800 anonymous tips.

18:18.686 --> 18:20.061
l'm working on it.

18:20.188 --> 18:23.607
Well, how about you stop talking
and earn your bump?

18:25.693 --> 18:27.444
Sexy.

18:27.570 --> 18:29.905
Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro.
lt's you and me.

18:30.031 --> 18:33.909
l wonder what l did to make him
think we're so close.

18:34.911 --> 18:36.745
l wonder if it'd work on Rita.

18:42.543 --> 18:44.544
Dexter Morgan. l called earlier.

18:45.588 --> 18:48.131
Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

18:48.257 --> 18:49.966
Yeah.

18:50.092 --> 18:52.594
Jerry. can you take
these guys around back?

18:54.847 --> 18:56.264
Should l?

18:56.390 --> 18:57.766
No, l'll go with her.

18:57.892 --> 19:00.101
She might need a shoulder.

19:00.228 --> 19:02.020
She senses l'm not a shoulder.

19:02.146 --> 19:04.397
Bad sign - she's catching on.

19:07.109 --> 19:09.986
l don't know what kind of idiot
thinks an inner tube

19:10.112 --> 19:13.532
is gonna get him
over 90 miles of open ocean.

19:14.075 --> 19:17.786
lf you ask me. man.
it's Darwin's theory at work.

19:29.382 --> 19:31.591
That must be what love looks like.

19:38.057 --> 19:40.642
The inability to feel
has its advantages. . .

19:45.314 --> 19:46.982
sometimes.

19:52.780 --> 19:55.115
- Hey, Dexter.
- Hey, Mindy.

19:55.241 --> 19:56.533
Do you need any help?

19:56.659 --> 19:58.493
No.

19:58.619 --> 20:01.496
So, are you gonna go
to the spring formal?

20:03.332 --> 20:05.542
Why would l want to do that?

20:14.343 --> 20:17.220
She wanted you to ask her
to the dance. Dexter.

20:17.847 --> 20:19.472
That's not what she said.

20:19.599 --> 20:22.183
You have to learn their signals.

20:23.019 --> 20:25.854
Yeah, well, l don't really care about girls.

20:27.523 --> 20:30.150
l just like being alone.

20:35.031 --> 20:38.992
But most normal people don't,
and it's important that you seem normal.

20:39.118 --> 20:41.953
- Even though l'm not.
- Because you're not.

20:48.002 --> 20:50.337
We'll start you off with a temporary prefab

20:50.463 --> 20:52.589
and then make adjustments as we go.

20:52.715 --> 20:57.135
Rudy here's gonna put me
back together again, good as new.

20:58.804 --> 21:02.140
Half the battle is attitude,
and you have a great one.

21:02.266 --> 21:04.017
Well, l'm alive.

21:05.061 --> 21:08.229
l didn't see that happening, but here l am.

21:12.735 --> 21:16.446
Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder,

21:16.572 --> 21:19.491
and l got a hottie waiting on me, so. . .

21:20.952 --> 21:22.285
l don't know.

21:22.411 --> 21:24.412
l just might have to fight you for this one.

21:25.665 --> 21:27.374
OK, we'll arm-wrestle later.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.000
Now get out of here.

21:29.877 --> 21:32.337
Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.

21:33.673 --> 21:35.131
Excuse me.

21:42.515 --> 21:46.601
l know what you need, guys,
but l didn't see much.

21:47.019 --> 21:49.437
Any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.

21:49.563 --> 21:51.481
Well. . .

21:52.525 --> 21:54.567
He came up on me from behind,

21:54.694 --> 21:57.946
and he wore a mask
when he made me put the. . .

22:01.742 --> 22:03.785
things on the ice.

22:05.663 --> 22:06.997
l'll get it.

22:07.707 --> 22:09.165
Angel of mercy.

22:09.291 --> 22:11.001
Just how merciful are you?

22:11.127 --> 22:12.794
Oh, you are a dog, aren't you?

22:13.462 --> 22:14.504
So the ladies tell me.

22:14.630 --> 22:18.591
Can you tell us how tall he was
or if he was black, white, Latino?

22:19.969 --> 22:25.348
White, l think.
l'm guessing maybe average height.

22:25.474 --> 22:28.560
Not fat, not thin, just average.

22:30.771 --> 22:32.856
l don't know.

22:32.982 --> 22:36.192
And when he started, you know,
working on me.

22:36.318 --> 22:38.570
l was blindfolded, so. . .

22:39.321 --> 22:42.949
Did you hear anything?
Did he have an accent or anything?

22:43.951 --> 22:46.745
He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

22:46.871 --> 22:49.039
And that's all you heard?

22:50.332 --> 22:52.208
Except the rats.

22:52.334 --> 22:55.712
Sometimes they would
crawl up on the bed,

22:55.838 --> 22:57.797
and l'd have to shake 'em off.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.137
Some crap-ass witness l am, huh?

23:04.847 --> 23:06.639
You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.

23:06.766 --> 23:08.767
Yeah?

23:10.936 --> 23:16.232
You know, sometimes when l'm trying
to remember something, l close my eyes.

23:16.358 --> 23:18.234
Really?

23:18.360 --> 23:19.944
We could even blindfold you again.

23:30.915 --> 23:32.332
l'm kind of tired right now.

23:32.917 --> 23:35.043
lt's OK. Get some rest.

23:35.169 --> 23:37.545
Officer Morgan and l are leaving.

23:46.722 --> 23:48.181
Alone.

23:48.307 --> 23:51.184
No pretending. No hiding.

24:08.244 --> 24:11.412
No time to relax.
l'm too close.

24:11.539 --> 24:14.332
Jorge Castillo is bad. That l know.

24:14.458 --> 24:17.585
But bad enough to have killed
Yelina's fiance?

24:17.711 --> 24:19.879
That l have to prove.

24:21.173 --> 24:23.174
Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

24:26.095 --> 24:27.762
New money.

24:28.848 --> 24:32.559
Normal people dream of this -
a new car, a big home,

24:32.685 --> 24:34.644
a boat at the reef shore marina. . .

24:38.232 --> 24:39.941
and a beautiful wife.

24:40.067 --> 24:43.027
Too bad - l never enjoy
making someone a widow.

24:43.737 --> 24:45.530
They're so happy.

24:45.656 --> 24:48.032
She has no clue who she's with.

24:49.952 --> 24:53.288
Maybe that's the key
to a successful relationship.

24:55.499 --> 24:57.834
Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds
of the same hospital

24:57.960 --> 24:59.836
where we found Mr. Tucci.

24:59.962 --> 25:02.255
And you were alone that night?

25:02.381 --> 25:05.341
lt was just me and Caesar, my dog.

25:05.801 --> 25:09.137
He likes abandoned buildings.
Caesar's a ratter.

25:09.263 --> 25:12.098
- What did this guy do?
- Why? Does he look familiar?

25:12.224 --> 25:16.477
Yes, he looks like an actor
from that John Singleton movie.

25:16.604 --> 25:17.854
"What was that?"

25:17.980 --> 25:21.733
How about you focus on whether or not
he was the man at the old hospital?

25:22.193 --> 25:25.028
Well, it was difficult to tell. lt was dark.

25:25.154 --> 25:26.821
You said you got a look at him.

25:32.828 --> 25:33.828
He had a cap.

25:36.081 --> 25:40.543
Hey. is that KG-230 hooked
into a digital CCTV network?

25:40.669 --> 25:42.212
You better have a hell of a firewall.

25:42.338 --> 25:44.923
You get better resolution with the 440.

25:45.049 --> 25:45.965
Hello.

25:46.091 --> 25:47.842
We're done here.

25:56.727 --> 25:58.728
Give me a minute.

26:04.693 --> 26:07.987
Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit
and send him home.

26:09.114 --> 26:11.157
Christ on a crutch,
he could tell us something.

26:11.283 --> 26:12.992
Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.

26:13.118 --> 26:15.370
We get dozens like that every
time a story hits the news.

26:15.496 --> 26:17.455
Now do me a favor -
get him out of my precinct.

26:17.581 --> 26:18.957
Thank Dexter.

26:21.502 --> 26:23.628
You could try being a little more optimistic.

26:23.754 --> 26:27.298
l mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic,
l think we can.

26:27.675 --> 26:29.300
You might get more out of people.

26:30.010 --> 26:32.262
How do you know Perry
doesn't know anything?

26:32.388 --> 26:35.807
Because l've been doing this
a lot longer than Dexter.

26:37.851 --> 26:40.853
This case is getting colder every minute
you waste on bullshit like Perry.

26:40.980 --> 26:45.441
And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?
What the fuck were you thinking?

26:46.860 --> 26:49.445
Tucci's closed for business now,
and you shut him down.

26:50.406 --> 26:52.115
l. . .

26:52.574 --> 26:54.158
l was trying a new approach.

26:56.745 --> 27:01.291
Maybe you should just learn the basics
before you reinvent the damn wheel.

27:23.564 --> 27:25.857
Come on.
How can you not dance to this?

27:25.983 --> 27:26.899
lt's a gift.

27:27.026 --> 27:29.068
You just need some more Patron, compadre.

27:29.903 --> 27:31.779
- Another round!
- No more for me.

27:31.905 --> 27:33.656
l got to get up early, killers to catch.

27:33.782 --> 27:34.866
Forget that.

27:34.992 --> 27:37.160
The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

27:37.286 --> 27:38.286
Yes!

27:38.412 --> 27:40.288
Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.

27:41.665 --> 27:43.791
Your wife - she's probably worrying.

27:43.917 --> 27:46.461
l don't know what she'd think
of your new friend.

27:46.587 --> 27:49.881
She don't mind who l flirt with
as long as l bring home la pasion .

27:51.175 --> 27:53.384
Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

27:54.511 --> 27:59.182
Hey, what about, communication, trust?

28:01.477 --> 28:02.393
Wait.

28:02.519 --> 28:05.063
What if she wants something more?

28:05.189 --> 28:08.191
Then you reciprocate - you know.

28:08.317 --> 28:11.069
No, l meant what if she wants
something more emotionally?

28:11.195 --> 28:13.071
Don't go down that emotional road.

28:13.197 --> 28:14.405
Just go down on her.

28:14.531 --> 28:16.324
lt's easier, and she'll be distracted.

28:16.450 --> 28:18.910
Come on. Let's dance, Angel.

28:23.582 --> 28:24.999
So. . .

28:29.004 --> 28:31.214
What do you want to do now?

28:32.257 --> 28:35.093
Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.

28:35.219 --> 28:37.845
Get her punch.
Open the door for her.

28:38.680 --> 28:41.307
And if you find yourself alone with her
and things get romantic...

28:41.433 --> 28:43.184
Dad, l've kissed a girl before.

28:43.310 --> 28:44.894
- You have?
- Yeah.

28:45.020 --> 28:46.354
And?

28:46.480 --> 28:48.856
l don't know. lt was OK.

28:50.943 --> 28:54.070
- Dexter, women are different from men.
- We've had this talk, Dad.

28:54.196 --> 28:57.407
l'm saying they have a whole
different experience of things.

28:57.533 --> 29:00.410
When they're with someone, physically,
they feel connected.

29:00.536 --> 29:02.245
And they know when you're not.

29:02.371 --> 29:04.455
They can sense it
because you're very exposed.

29:04.581 --> 29:05.915
You're naked.

29:06.041 --> 29:07.917
l mean emotionally.

29:08.043 --> 29:11.003
son. this is going to be
very dangerous for Dexter.

29:11.130 --> 29:13.464
l can fake it.

29:13.590 --> 29:16.592
Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

29:16.718 --> 29:18.553
This is a tough one.

29:35.446 --> 29:37.071
ls this it?

29:43.078 --> 29:46.873
Angel, l've only been here one time.
l don't remember.

29:47.624 --> 29:49.292
Wake up.

29:55.966 --> 29:58.217
Your wife's gonna love me.

30:01.930 --> 30:03.639
The problem with acting normal

30:03.765 --> 30:06.851
is normal people get into
stupid situations like this.

30:09.813 --> 30:11.397
You scared the hell out of me.

30:11.523 --> 30:13.149
Sorry, Nina.

30:13.275 --> 30:16.235
l'm Dexter. You remember?
l work with Angel down at the station.

30:16.361 --> 30:17.612
What are you doing here?

30:18.780 --> 30:22.783
lt's funny. We were out celebrating
Angel's pay-grade bump.

30:22.910 --> 30:24.494
He got a raise?

30:25.621 --> 30:27.747
Yeah.

30:27.873 --> 30:32.877
Well. as you can see.
he had a little too much to drink,

30:33.003 --> 30:35.171
So l gave him a ride home.

30:35.839 --> 30:37.381
He doesn't live here anymore.

30:43.138 --> 30:44.305
We're separated.

30:47.142 --> 30:50.311
So, good night.

30:51.813 --> 30:53.147
OK.

30:54.816 --> 30:56.359
Good night.

30:58.987 --> 30:59.987
Come on.

31:04.868 --> 31:06.452
Angel.

31:07.704 --> 31:11.123
Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

31:16.296 --> 31:18.130
l guess l had one too many, huh?

31:18.257 --> 31:20.424
And then about ten more.

31:30.060 --> 31:32.562
How did l end up here?

31:32.688 --> 31:34.105
You don't remember?

31:35.691 --> 31:37.233
So you live here, huh?

31:37.359 --> 31:38.943
l live here.

31:43.198 --> 31:45.533
You're kind of neat, aren't you?

31:45.659 --> 31:48.202
Bad habit instilled by Mom.

32:11.935 --> 32:13.102
We better get going.

32:13.228 --> 32:15.771
Pressure's on with this
ice-truck killer situation.

32:15.897 --> 32:17.773
Yeah. You go ahead. l'll lock up.

32:17.899 --> 32:20.234
l have to stop by home anyway.

32:20.360 --> 32:23.696
My wife's gonna be worried.
She gets so hot and bothered.

32:23.822 --> 32:26.991
No, l'll just wait,
and l'll drop you at your car.

32:28.035 --> 32:30.077
Where's your bathroom?

32:33.165 --> 32:34.415
Somehow it's reassuring

32:34.541 --> 32:38.419
to know l'm not the only one
pretending to be normal.

32:38.545 --> 32:41.547
l found hair on this one
that doesn't belong to Tucci.

32:42.591 --> 32:44.091
Rat hair.

32:44.217 --> 32:45.635
l probably picked up a parasite. . .

32:45.761 --> 32:47.470
Don't test me, Masuka.

32:48.639 --> 32:51.682
see all that shredding?
Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

32:51.808 --> 32:53.517
They took evidence from the crime scene?

32:53.644 --> 32:55.686
- Exactly.
- So we check their nest.

32:58.523 --> 33:01.651
Wild-goose chase.
without knowing what we're looking for.

33:01.777 --> 33:03.152
We could talk to Tucci again.

33:04.196 --> 33:06.822
He knows more than he thinks,
and my gut tells me he can take it.

33:06.948 --> 33:09.700
Cos you got the instincts
of a veteran on the force.

33:09.826 --> 33:11.160
Masuka, run the sheet.

33:11.286 --> 33:13.037
See if we can trace it to a manufacturer.

33:13.163 --> 33:15.539
l've got court in the morning,
so call me on my cell.

33:15.666 --> 33:17.667
l get it. l'm a newbie.

33:17.793 --> 33:20.252
But you are old and tired,
and you need new eyes on this.

33:20.379 --> 33:22.672
So when you're ready to let me do my job,
let me know.

33:22.798 --> 33:25.216
And don't you fucking say a word, Masuka.

33:30.514 --> 33:33.224
How do you get rid of the ones
who don't pay out?

33:33.350 --> 33:35.851
You drop them
in the middle of the ocean,

33:35.977 --> 33:38.229
tell them to swim for shore?

33:39.272 --> 33:41.899
You can't hide for long, Jorge.

33:43.068 --> 33:45.111
- Hello?
- Dexter, it's me.

33:45.237 --> 33:48.948
Look, l'm sorry l haven't talked to you
since that place.

33:49.074 --> 33:50.366
The morgue.

33:51.368 --> 33:54.704
Do you think they'll be able
to catch whoever did this?

33:54.830 --> 33:56.747
l'm sure he'll get what he deserves.

33:56.873 --> 33:58.582
How are you doing?

33:58.709 --> 34:00.292
Still a little shaky.

34:00.419 --> 34:06.507
l have some late-night work l have to do,
but l could stop by earlier. if you want.

34:06.633 --> 34:08.634
Maybe we could rent a movie.

34:08.760 --> 34:11.011
Yeah, l'll pick up a DVD.

34:11.138 --> 34:13.139
Something light.

34:28.655 --> 34:31.449
Maybe if l don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

34:34.745 --> 34:38.289
l hate this. l'm questioning every move.
lt's exhausting.

34:39.332 --> 34:42.251
l should just break it off already,

34:42.377 --> 34:44.628
unless l can pacify her,

34:44.755 --> 34:46.756
give her something.

34:49.217 --> 34:50.968
Reciprocate.

34:57.851 --> 34:58.851
Dexter?

35:01.855 --> 35:04.023
l'm sorry. l. . .

35:05.025 --> 35:06.984
l was just. . .

35:07.110 --> 35:10.196
You were so generous with me.

35:10.322 --> 35:13.449
l was gonna return the favor.

35:14.159 --> 35:16.035
No, that's very sweet,

35:16.161 --> 35:20.539
but sorry, l'm just not in the mood for that.

35:31.718 --> 35:33.385
That you, Dex?

35:33.512 --> 35:35.429
Yeah. Sorry l'm late.

35:37.349 --> 35:40.184
lt's OK. son.
You must have been having fun.

35:40.310 --> 35:41.477
l pretended to.

35:41.603 --> 35:42.770
That's good, Dexter.

35:42.896 --> 35:44.396
Dad?

35:46.274 --> 35:50.152
Do you think that maybe one day
l'll feel it for real?

35:52.656 --> 35:54.031
l hope so, son.

35:58.161 --> 36:00.204
l really do.

36:04.668 --> 36:07.837
Alone, l'd be better off.

36:07.963 --> 36:10.381
Relationships are too confusing.

36:13.301 --> 36:15.010
But this l can figure out.

36:15.136 --> 36:16.804
This l do well.

36:16.930 --> 36:18.848
Jorge Castillo's boat.

36:18.974 --> 36:21.100
lf he's a killer, then there's proof.

36:21.226 --> 36:24.353
There's always proof, and l'll find it.

36:41.496 --> 36:43.539
Happy and in love.

36:43.665 --> 36:45.124
The perfect couple.

36:46.209 --> 36:48.961
l wonder if Rita and the kids
would like fishing.

36:49.671 --> 36:51.338
Focus.

37:03.977 --> 37:07.897
lf one of these matches the contact number
for Ernesto's coyote.

37:08.023 --> 37:09.690
you're it, Jorge.

37:52.567 --> 37:55.110
He drowns them here.
then dumps them out there.

37:55.946 --> 37:59.573
lf they wash up, it'll be chalked up to
another inner-tube mishap.

39:00.635 --> 39:04.096
Yep - this l do well.

39:07.559 --> 39:09.852
Think about his shoes.

39:09.978 --> 39:11.770
Did he walk with a limp?

39:13.481 --> 39:16.066
Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

39:17.277 --> 39:20.029
Try to remember, Tony, for me.

39:21.698 --> 39:23.532
l would if l could, hon.

39:24.325 --> 39:28.996
You're a sweet lady, and smart -
using your charms on me.

39:29.998 --> 39:32.041
No, no, l don't mind.

39:32.167 --> 39:36.170
lt's probably the last time
a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

39:37.130 --> 39:38.589
lt's OK, Tony.

39:38.715 --> 39:40.257
Maybe later.

39:41.259 --> 39:42.676
We should try the blindfold.

39:44.012 --> 39:46.221
What?

39:46.347 --> 39:48.682
- l don't want to do that.
- l'm sorry. Mr. Tucci.

39:48.808 --> 39:50.851
l can't even begin to imagine
what you've been through.

39:50.977 --> 39:54.813
but it's our job to make sure
that nobody else goes through it, too.

39:54.939 --> 39:57.024
So, Morgan, you're up.

40:20.590 --> 40:24.426
He was hard to hear.
l never knew where he was.

40:24.803 --> 40:27.888
So he's agile. That's good, Tony.
What else did you hear?

40:29.516 --> 40:32.935
Rats. Always those damn rats.

40:33.061 --> 40:35.062
Try to focus on him, Tony.

40:36.064 --> 40:39.066
What did you hear?
What did you smell?

40:41.486 --> 40:44.196
- Menthol.
- Menthol?

40:44.614 --> 40:47.366
Yeah, like cough drops.

40:47.867 --> 40:50.369
He cleared his throat a lot.
You know, like. . .

40:54.374 --> 40:55.958
He unwrapped 'em.

40:57.418 --> 41:01.088
l could hear those wrappers,
that crinkly sound.

41:04.092 --> 41:06.093
And he sucked on 'em.

41:08.179 --> 41:11.640
l could hear 'em clicking
against his teeth when he. . .

41:19.649 --> 41:23.360
The son of a bitch
loved those fucking lozenges.

41:30.410 --> 41:32.870
Come on, pretty girl. Come on.

41:34.956 --> 41:36.331
Nothing in this nest.

41:36.457 --> 41:39.042
Check another floor.
They're all over this dump.

41:40.587 --> 41:41.795
Fuck this.

41:46.384 --> 41:47.467
Masuka.

41:48.803 --> 41:50.554
We got another one over here.

41:51.347 --> 41:54.308
Promising.
Several fragments from the sheet here.

41:55.268 --> 41:57.728
These rat bastards
were repeat customers.

42:00.982 --> 42:02.357
Who had garlic for lunch?

42:02.483 --> 42:04.359
l'm gonna punch you in the neck.

42:04.485 --> 42:06.862
Actually. . .

42:06.988 --> 42:09.198
l think you're gonna French me.

42:21.002 --> 42:22.836
. .934.

42:24.339 --> 42:26.089
l like being right.

42:26.216 --> 42:29.843
l usually am about these things.

42:34.224 --> 42:36.225
"Be prepared." lt's my motto.

42:36.351 --> 42:38.936
The boy scouts and l
have that in common.

42:39.062 --> 42:42.231
Of course, there's no merit badge
for tonight's outing.

43:03.378 --> 43:05.128
What are we looking at?

43:05.255 --> 43:07.756
They found the ice-truck killer's
lozenge wrapper,

43:07.882 --> 43:10.133
thanks to your sister.

43:10.260 --> 43:12.094
Lozenge wrapper?

43:12.220 --> 43:14.221
After two months of finding
fuck all in this case,

43:14.347 --> 43:16.598
a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

43:16.724 --> 43:19.643
My favorite serial killer
is a lozenge eater.

43:20.353 --> 43:21.478
How human of him.

43:26.359 --> 43:27.359
We have a partial.

43:27.819 --> 43:31.363
- Partial print! A partial fucking print!
- Let me see.

43:31.489 --> 43:32.906
Proud of you, sis.

43:33.366 --> 43:36.201
lt's a celebration here.
Where are you going?

43:36.327 --> 43:37.661
Crime scene.

43:38.413 --> 43:40.080
Excuse me.

43:40.456 --> 43:41.957
What's. . . What's going on?

43:42.083 --> 43:45.002
We've got our first piece of tangible evidence
on the ice-truck killer.

43:45.128 --> 43:47.671
- A partial fucking print.
- You run it through AFlS yet?

43:47.797 --> 43:50.299
- We're workin' on it.
- lt doesn't even matter if we get a match.

43:50.425 --> 43:52.426
He gets pulled in for anything, we got him.

43:52.552 --> 43:54.261
Get it photoed before we scan it.

43:54.387 --> 43:58.473
And l want Labelle to lD
the points of comparison if you get an AFlS hit.

43:58.599 --> 44:00.976
Masuka, l want that thing
swabbed for DNA.

44:01.102 --> 44:03.603
And let's keep working
the old hospital site, people.

44:03.730 --> 44:05.814
We might get lucky again.

44:05.940 --> 44:08.608
lt wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.

44:24.208 --> 44:28.420
Come on.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.468
Come on!

46:02.682 --> 46:04.266
God bless America.

46:14.110 --> 46:15.444
Hon?

46:17.530 --> 46:19.197
Where are you?

46:21.409 --> 46:22.742
Honey?

46:33.588 --> 46:35.255
Honey, you in here?

46:48.352 --> 46:50.729
Get back in there, you Cuban piece of shit!

46:54.942 --> 46:56.610
Fucking animals.

46:57.653 --> 46:59.946
lncredible.

47:00.072 --> 47:02.282
They're an even better match
than l thought.

47:02.408 --> 47:04.409
A true partnership.

47:13.878 --> 47:16.338
You know, l rarely deviate from a plan,

47:16.464 --> 47:19.674
but l just didn't have the heart
to split up such a. . .

47:21.260 --> 47:22.802
perfect couple.

47:26.766 --> 47:28.558
You two. . .

47:28.684 --> 47:33.647
have quite a lucrative operation going.

47:35.316 --> 47:37.025
You're a really good team.

47:41.656 --> 47:43.573
lt's clever, too.

47:43.699 --> 47:49.538
No one questions
another drowned Cuban man

47:49.664 --> 47:51.665
or woman. . .

47:52.667 --> 47:54.668
or child.

47:54.794 --> 47:56.336
So, which one of you thought this up?

47:56.462 --> 47:59.005
They get freedom. We free them.

47:59.131 --> 48:00.924
They thank us, for God's sake.

48:01.717 --> 48:05.720
For drowning them and dumping
their bodies in the ocean? Please.

48:05.846 --> 48:08.515
We can pay Dexter. We have money.

48:08.641 --> 48:11.393
That's what it's all about, right?

48:11.894 --> 48:13.853
- l love Dexter.
- l love you so much.

48:13.980 --> 48:16.022
l love you so much.

48:23.781 --> 48:27.242
l'm gonna ask you a question.
l want you to answer me honestly.

48:27.368 --> 48:29.703
No more bullshit.
Do you understand?

48:32.415 --> 48:33.999
How long have you been married?

48:35.001 --> 48:36.126
1 2 years.

48:36.252 --> 48:38.378
How do you love each other?

48:40.965 --> 48:44.676
You're like me.
and you make it work. How?

48:44.802 --> 48:46.344
We want the same life.

48:46.470 --> 48:48.597
We both. . . We want the same thing.

48:48.723 --> 48:50.473
Same life.

48:51.225 --> 48:52.517
You share the same dream.

48:52.643 --> 48:53.810
Yes, exactly, yes.

48:53.936 --> 48:56.062
Yes, that's it.

48:56.188 --> 48:58.148
That's. . .

49:00.401 --> 49:02.402
helpful.

49:03.029 --> 49:04.362
Thank Dexter.

50:51.971 --> 50:54.889
l like doing things properly,

50:55.015 --> 50:58.017
but l'm out of time
and l still have to dispose of them.

51:01.021 --> 51:03.148
Valerie got short shrift.

51:04.859 --> 51:07.402
But all in all, it was a very good night.

52:01.749 --> 52:06.169
l like this place.
A lot of memories are buried down there.

52:12.176 --> 52:15.178
Deviating from the plan
may have been ill-advised.

52:30.027 --> 52:32.737
But sometimes
you just have to take a risk.

52:46.293 --> 52:47.710
After all. . .

52:50.756 --> 52:53.424
isn't that what
relationships are all about?

53:13.654 --> 53:15.321
Do you have a dream. . .

53:18.826 --> 53:20.785
for your life?

53:22.621 --> 53:24.539
Your future, l guess?

53:24.665 --> 53:26.499
Of course.

53:26.625 --> 53:28.668
Do you?

53:30.129 --> 53:32.213
lt might sound weird.

53:40.139 --> 53:42.390
l want to someday be content,

53:43.434 --> 53:45.101
just to feel...

53:47.187 --> 53:50.857
comfortable, like everyone else.

53:52.192 --> 53:54.652
- l want...
- A normal life.

54:00.868 --> 54:02.452
Yeah, a normal life.

54:03.454 --> 54:05.121
That's all l want.

54:06.165 --> 54:07.165
Just that.

54:08.042 --> 54:10.418
No fame and fortune,

54:10.544 --> 54:12.545
excitement at every turn?

54:14.006 --> 54:17.175
No, l've had enough excitement.

54:17.301 --> 54:18.760
Thank Dexter.

54:18.886 --> 54:21.679
Now, l'll take boring.

54:22.723 --> 54:23.806
Average.

54:25.309 --> 54:26.351
Ordinary.

54:29.355 --> 54:30.813
That's weird, huh?

54:35.235 --> 54:36.903
Yeah.
