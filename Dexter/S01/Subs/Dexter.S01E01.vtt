00:40.003 --> 00:42.088
Tonight's the night.

00:44.591 --> 00:47.969
And it's going to happen
again and again -

00:48.679 --> 00:50.680
has to happen.

00:55.477 --> 00:57.478
Nice night.

00:59.523 --> 01:01.065
Miami is a great town.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.734
l love the Cuban food.

01:02.860 --> 01:06.112
Pork sandwiches - my favorite.

01:13.036 --> 01:16.080
But l'm hungry
for something different now.

01:45.903 --> 01:47.904
There he is.

01:48.030 --> 01:50.114
Mike Donovan.

01:51.575 --> 01:53.242
He's the one.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.809
You're mine now.
so do exactly as l say.

02:19.645 --> 02:22.980
- What do you want?
- l want you to be quiet.

02:23.106 --> 02:24.190
Now drive.

02:52.135 --> 02:53.719
Turn here.

03:23.792 --> 03:25.126
You have to listen.

03:27.212 --> 03:29.005
And do what l say.

03:40.017 --> 03:41.517
Look.

03:41.643 --> 03:42.560
No.

03:42.686 --> 03:44.896
Uh, yes.

03:46.356 --> 03:47.273
No, no.

03:47.399 --> 03:50.318
lt's horrible, isn't it? lsn't it?

03:50.444 --> 03:52.194
Please.

03:53.238 --> 03:57.033
Open your eyes
and look at what you did!

03:58.368 --> 04:00.703
Look or l'll cut your eyelids
right off your face.

04:06.835 --> 04:10.171
lt took me a long time
to get these little boys clean.

04:11.590 --> 04:14.425
One was in the ground so long
he was falling apart.

04:14.551 --> 04:16.928
l pulled him out in bits and pieces.

04:17.054 --> 04:19.472
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is. . .

04:19.598 --> 04:21.599
Stop! That never helped anybody.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.563
Please, you can have anything.

04:27.689 --> 04:30.399
That's good. Beg.
Did these little boys beg?

04:36.823 --> 04:39.784
l couldn't help myself.
l couldn't. l just. . .

04:39.910 --> 04:41.911
Please, you have to understand.

04:45.082 --> 04:48.626
Trust me, l definitely understand.

04:48.752 --> 04:51.003
See, l can't help myself, either.

04:53.173 --> 04:56.050
Children - l could never do that,
not like Dexter.

04:56.176 --> 04:59.470
Never, ever kids.

05:00.597 --> 05:01.847
Why?

05:03.725 --> 05:05.101
l have standards.

05:29.960 --> 05:33.462
Soon you'll be packed

05:33.588 --> 05:38.467
into a few neatly wrapped Hefties

05:40.303 --> 05:45.349
in my own small corner of the world.

05:47.144 --> 05:51.355
lt'll be a neater, happier place.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.778
A better place.

06:20.510 --> 06:23.304
My name is Dexter, Dexter Morgan.

06:23.430 --> 06:25.347
l don't know what made me the way l am,

06:25.474 --> 06:28.768
but whatever it was
left a hollow place inside.

06:28.894 --> 06:32.063
People fake a lot
of human interactions,

06:32.189 --> 06:35.441
but l feel like l fake them all
and l fake them very well.

06:37.778 --> 06:40.571
Ahoy. there!
Any big marlin out there today?

06:40.697 --> 06:43.908
And that's my burden, l guess.

06:44.034 --> 06:45.659
l don't blame my foster parents.

06:45.786 --> 06:49.246
Harry and Doris Morgan
did a wonderful job raising me.

06:50.707 --> 06:52.875
But they're both dead now.

06:53.001 --> 06:55.127
l didn't kill them.

06:55.253 --> 06:56.462
Honest.

06:58.173 --> 07:00.716
You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

07:00.842 --> 07:05.679
- What do you mean. Pop?
- The Billups said Buddy disappeared.

07:08.225 --> 07:09.517
l found the grave, son.

07:09.643 --> 07:11.727
That dog was a noisy little creep, Dad.

07:11.853 --> 07:14.438
He was barking all night
and Mom's very sick.

07:14.564 --> 07:18.317
That lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that
blew down the sidewalk.

07:18.902 --> 07:23.072
There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter,
and not just Buddy's.

08:23.383 --> 08:25.301
Blood -

08:25.427 --> 08:27.803
sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

08:30.974 --> 08:33.809
Other times,
it helps me control the chaos.

08:35.812 --> 08:39.607
The code of Harry.
my foster father, is satisfied.

08:40.275 --> 08:41.609
And so am l.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.570
Harry was a great cop here in Miami.

08:44.696 --> 08:48.407
He taught me how to think like one,
how to cover my tracks.

08:49.492 --> 08:51.160
l'm a very neat monster.

08:54.831 --> 08:57.041
Dexter, are you there?

08:58.084 --> 09:00.544
OK. Dex. please.
as soon as you get in,

09:00.670 --> 09:03.881
l'm at a crime scene
by the shithole, the Seven Seas Motel,

09:04.007 --> 09:06.550
and l need you here, OK?

09:06.676 --> 09:08.219
Dex? Please.

09:08.345 --> 09:10.846
Pretty fucking please
with cheese on top.

09:10.972 --> 09:14.016
That's my foul-mouthed
foster sister, Debra.

09:14.351 --> 09:16.769
She has a big heart
but won't let anyone see it.

09:16.895 --> 09:19.605
She's the only person
in the world who loves me.

09:19.731 --> 09:21.482
l think that's nice.

09:21.608 --> 09:23.359
l don't have feelings

09:23.485 --> 09:27.321
but if l could have feelings at all,
l'd have them for Deb.

09:31.201 --> 09:32.826
There's something strange

09:32.953 --> 09:36.497
about looking at a homicide scene
in the daylight of Miami.

09:36.623 --> 09:39.083
lt makes grotesque killings look staged,

09:39.209 --> 09:42.169
like you're in a daring section
of Disney World.

09:43.171 --> 09:44.088
Dahmer Land.

09:44.214 --> 09:45.297
You better be a cop.

09:45.423 --> 09:47.216
No. Forensics.

09:53.390 --> 09:54.556
Dex!

09:55.850 --> 09:57.935
Hey, what's up?

10:01.773 --> 10:05.067
Jeez, Deb. Where the hell
do you keep your gun?

10:05.193 --> 10:06.777
They found another hooker in the pool.

10:06.903 --> 10:09.280
- Another?
- Chopped up in bits and pieces.

10:09.406 --> 10:12.574
- The third one in five months.
- Third? You mean there's a...

10:12.701 --> 10:14.410
A serial killer, that's right.

10:14.536 --> 10:18.455
The other two were in Broward,
chopped up just like this one.

10:18.581 --> 10:21.625
- Any suspects?
- Wish l knew.

10:21.751 --> 10:25.629
l'm on Vice so LaGuerta told me
to stay out of sight.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.715
God forbid she listens to Dexter.

10:27.841 --> 10:30.009
Tell me about it.

10:30.135 --> 10:32.636
How does someone so dumb
get so much power?

10:33.221 --> 10:36.598
She knows how to play the game.
You could take a lesson.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.642
ln what, ass-kissing?

10:38.768 --> 10:40.269
Politics.

10:44.607 --> 10:47.943
l just want to catch this guy
before he kills another one of my girls.

10:48.069 --> 10:49.695
Don't get so emotionally invested.

10:49.821 --> 10:51.989
- You always say that.
- So did Dad.

10:52.782 --> 10:55.826
Yeah. but he also said.
"Go after what you want."

10:55.952 --> 10:58.829
l want out of Vice and into Homicide.

10:58.955 --> 11:01.081
What can l do to help?

11:02.667 --> 11:05.711
You get these hunches
with these types of murders.

11:06.963 --> 11:08.422
Only sometimes.

11:08.548 --> 11:10.424
Well, see if you get one this time.

11:10.550 --> 11:14.345
And can l bounce some ideas off you?
l get smarter when l talk to Dexter.

11:14.471 --> 11:16.638
You just need
a little more confidence.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.897
All right, l'll take a look.

11:25.023 --> 11:27.608
Avoid LaGuerta
and talk to Captain Matthews.

11:27.734 --> 11:29.943
He and Dad were tight.
He may put you on the case.

11:30.070 --> 11:32.196
You're making me smarter already, see?

11:33.490 --> 11:37.785
And keep the sex suit on when you talk
to the captain. lt'll help your cause.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.882
That's a nice haircut, Masuka.

11:52.008 --> 11:54.343
l saw your sister.
Damn, looking hot.

11:54.469 --> 11:56.678
Yeah, she should.
lt's hot as hell out here.

11:57.555 --> 12:01.141
- So, why are you here?
- lt's a crime scene.

12:01.267 --> 12:03.894
- Yeah, but you do blood spatter.
- so?

12:04.020 --> 12:06.105
So. . . There's no blood here.

12:07.816 --> 12:11.360
- What was that?
- Yeah. There's no blood in or on

12:11.486 --> 12:12.569
or near the body at all.

12:12.695 --> 12:14.905
lt's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

12:15.031 --> 12:17.032
Hey, Angel, let's show him.

12:17.158 --> 12:18.409
No blood.

12:18.535 --> 12:21.495
No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood.

12:21.621 --> 12:23.080
No blood at all.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.419
Why hadn't l thought of that?
No blood.

12:29.879 --> 12:32.089
What a beautiful idea.

12:32.215 --> 12:34.007
How does the killer get rid of the blood?

12:34.134 --> 12:35.592
lt's hard to say.

12:35.718 --> 12:37.386
The body's in good shape.

12:37.512 --> 12:39.471
She had a nice ass too.

12:40.515 --> 12:43.183
Head is over there.
if you want to take a look.

12:43.309 --> 12:44.768
This is unique.

12:44.894 --> 12:48.021
No shit. And no prints, either.

12:48.440 --> 12:53.068
l've never seen such clean.
dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

12:53.194 --> 12:54.194
Wonderful.

12:55.071 --> 12:57.865
- lt's very clean.
- Yeah, but he didn't finish.

12:59.659 --> 13:01.285
lt looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

13:01.411 --> 13:02.453
No, no. Look.

13:02.579 --> 13:07.875
He cut the leg in four pieces,
almost like using a ruler.

13:08.001 --> 13:10.919
But this leg is in three pieces.

13:12.755 --> 13:15.632
Now, look, he started to make
a fourth cut but stopped.

13:15.758 --> 13:17.593
lt's possible that he got interrupted.

13:17.719 --> 13:20.971
LaGuerta's looking for a witness,
working on the motel porter.

13:21.097 --> 13:22.431
God help him.

13:25.268 --> 13:26.435
No blood.

13:26.561 --> 13:28.979
l can't think.
l have to get out of here.

13:32.275 --> 13:34.526
- Where are you going?
- Hey, no blood. . .

13:47.707 --> 13:49.208
l wish she'd stop that.

13:49.334 --> 13:52.961
lt's one of those mating rituals
which l really don't understand.

13:59.511 --> 14:01.512
But that bloodless body. . .

14:02.889 --> 14:05.933
This guy may have exceeded
my own abilities.

14:11.064 --> 14:12.105
Morning, Dex.

14:12.232 --> 14:13.565
Morning.

14:16.402 --> 14:17.653
Hey, Dex.

14:17.779 --> 14:19.488
Hey, Sue. Dan.

14:19.614 --> 14:21.573
How are the families?

14:22.617 --> 14:25.202
Good. You?

14:25.328 --> 14:28.705
- See you at the next bloodbath?
- Never miss a party.

14:28.831 --> 14:30.499
Thanks.

14:33.461 --> 14:36.797
Salt of the earth, these people,
and they work hard.

14:36.923 --> 14:39.049
But with the solve rate
for murders at about 20%,

14:39.175 --> 14:41.343
Miami is a great place for me,

14:41.469 --> 14:44.137
a great place for me to hone my craft.

14:47.559 --> 14:50.894
- l like your other outfit better.
- You're a sick bastard.

14:51.104 --> 14:53.855
Guess what. Sex suit worked.
Captain put me on the case.

14:53.982 --> 14:56.775
LaGuerta wasn't happy
but she needs to get laid.

14:57.610 --> 14:59.278
l guess. So congrats.

15:00.655 --> 15:02.906
- So you got any ideas yet?
- Nope.

15:03.032 --> 15:05.242
Well. start working
on your mental autopsy

15:05.368 --> 15:07.744
cos l could use your theories.

15:07.870 --> 15:10.539
And thanks for the fucking doughnut.
l got to go.

15:13.334 --> 15:14.334
Doughnut?

15:18.798 --> 15:20.716
You keeping your fingernails clean?

15:20.842 --> 15:23.135
Never leave home
without my rubber gloves.

15:23.261 --> 15:24.386
Good boy.

15:27.515 --> 15:28.849
So, anything new?

15:37.817 --> 15:40.110
One of these days
you're gonna tell me.

15:40.236 --> 15:43.280
l already told Dexter. Blood spatter
doesn't take up all my time.

15:43.406 --> 15:45.282
l like doing it. Maybe l can help out.

15:45.408 --> 15:46.908
lt fills my nights.

15:47.035 --> 15:49.620
You have
a morbid sense of fun.

15:49.746 --> 15:51.038
That's probably true.

15:51.831 --> 15:53.415
You should find a pretty girl.

15:53.541 --> 15:55.542
l found Dexter.

15:56.753 --> 15:58.253
Charming like your father.

15:58.379 --> 16:01.048
Just don't get me fired.

16:01.174 --> 16:04.051
Then who would
l bring doughnuts to?

16:16.773 --> 16:18.398
Just like me -

16:18.524 --> 16:20.192
empty inside.

16:32.622 --> 16:36.375
- Where the hell you been?
- Crime scene.

16:37.293 --> 16:41.254
What about the hotel cokehead murders,
this dealer and the girl?

16:43.049 --> 16:46.510
This Hallmark-looking couple didn't die
by the hands of a professional.

16:46.636 --> 16:50.847
This is child's play.
Messy work.

16:50.973 --> 16:53.558
That blood on the walls
looks like a finger painting.

16:54.477 --> 16:56.687
You give me the fuckin' creeps,
you know that, Dexter?

16:56.813 --> 16:59.856
Yeah, l know. Sorry about that.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.442
Fuck Dexter.

17:02.568 --> 17:04.111
OK.

17:04.237 --> 17:05.529
ls there something l can do?

17:05.655 --> 17:08.240
Give me your fucking analysis
on the blood spatter.

17:08.366 --> 17:11.451
You think l'm here to invite you
to my nephew's Bris?

17:11.577 --> 17:12.869
l didn't know you were Jewish.

17:12.995 --> 17:15.872
Shut the fuck up
and write your report already.

17:15.998 --> 17:17.207
Don't even know why l need Dexter.

17:17.333 --> 17:19.501
Grab a crayon, psycho,
and scribble this down.

17:19.627 --> 17:23.547
Rival dealer came in, two scumbags slashed to
hell, dealer stole the drugs.

17:23.673 --> 17:25.382
Wham, bam, done.

17:25.508 --> 17:26.925
l don't give a shit what you say.

17:27.051 --> 17:29.594
That's what happened
and that's who l'm looking for.

17:30.847 --> 17:34.224
We are looking for
a motherfucking thief dealer. You got it?

17:34.767 --> 17:36.268
OK. Sure.

17:38.020 --> 17:41.398
l guess, but l should get over there.

17:41.524 --> 17:44.151
Then get over there already,
you fucking weirdo.

17:44.277 --> 17:46.945
- l need it quick.
- l'm on it, Sergeant.

17:52.118 --> 17:54.494
The only real question l have is why,

17:54.620 --> 17:56.204
in a building full of cops,

17:56.330 --> 17:59.332
all supposedly with a keen insight
into the human soul.

18:00.084 --> 18:04.880
is Doakes the only one
who gets the creeps from me?

18:05.840 --> 18:08.049
So this killer used a sword?

18:10.386 --> 18:14.139
No, probably a very sharp knife.

18:14.265 --> 18:16.641
Look at the blood spatter.
lt tells a story.

18:16.768 --> 18:19.561
You see this big pond of blood
right there?

18:19.687 --> 18:21.855
That's from the initial stab.

18:21.981 --> 18:24.816
The male victim was standing right here,

18:24.942 --> 18:27.736
and the killer plunged his knife
into the shoulder,

18:27.862 --> 18:30.030
severing the carotid artery, and. . .

18:31.199 --> 18:33.575
Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?

18:33.701 --> 18:34.659
Yeah, nice.

18:34.786 --> 18:38.246
Now, over here, you have nice,
clean sprays of blood.

18:38.372 --> 18:41.416
That only happens when you're holding
something light and moving quick -

18:41.542 --> 18:43.376
nice, sharp slices through the body.

18:43.503 --> 18:45.754
No splashes, no drips.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.381
Clean and easy.

18:49.091 --> 18:52.427
This guy knew how to use a blade.

18:54.388 --> 18:56.890
So we're looking for a sushi chef.

18:57.850 --> 18:59.309
Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

18:59.435 --> 19:03.355
Wouldn't be my first choice,
but. hey. you never know.

19:04.524 --> 19:07.192
- Now what?
- Now l eat.

19:07.693 --> 19:10.570
The problem with eating and driving,
which l love to do,

19:10.696 --> 19:13.657
is not being able to employ
the 1 0:00-2:00 hand position on the wheel.

19:13.783 --> 19:16.368
lt's a matter of public safety.

19:17.537 --> 19:20.372
But there's always a sacrifice.

19:27.004 --> 19:30.799
This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

19:30.925 --> 19:34.177
Six months ago, l think he fell
in love with a pretty brunette,

19:34.303 --> 19:36.471
Mrs. Jane Saunders -

19:37.139 --> 19:40.058
a sweet mother of two married
to a successful banker -

19:40.184 --> 19:41.768
all living a pleasant life

19:41.894 --> 19:43.770
until she, unfortunately, disappeared,

19:43.896 --> 19:46.398
leaving the kids
emotionally devastated forever.

19:51.571 --> 19:53.530
The cops arrested my favorite valet

19:53.656 --> 19:57.158
but his lawyer got him off
on a faulty search warrant.

20:00.872 --> 20:03.707
lt's a good thing
l don't bother with them.

20:55.551 --> 20:58.887
Animals don't like me, especially dogs.

20:59.889 --> 21:04.684
l don't think they approve of what
l sometimes do to their masters.

21:04.810 --> 21:10.148
That dog recognizes me
as easily as l can recognize Jaworski

21:10.274 --> 21:12.734
or any other killer.

21:36.133 --> 21:38.426
lnteresting taste in literature.

21:39.470 --> 21:42.806
His needs are evolving,
turning violent.

21:44.308 --> 21:45.767
He's on the fast track.

21:46.602 --> 21:49.270
Have you ever wanted
to kill anything else?

21:49.397 --> 21:52.816
You know, something bigger than a dog?

21:54.902 --> 21:56.152
Yes.

21:56.988 --> 21:59.239
Like a person?

21:59.365 --> 22:02.117
Yeah, but no one in particular.

22:04.286 --> 22:06.496
Why didn't you?

22:08.958 --> 22:11.292
l thought you and Mom wouldn't like it.

22:21.053 --> 22:22.971
Come here.

22:31.230 --> 22:34.149
Friday night - date night in Miami.

22:35.192 --> 22:39.070
Every night is date night in Miami
and everyone's having sex.

22:40.281 --> 22:43.408
But for me sex never enters into it.

22:43.534 --> 22:45.994
l don't understand sex.

22:46.120 --> 22:50.081
l have nothing against women
and an appropriate sensibility about men,

22:50.207 --> 22:53.752
but when it comes
to the actual act of sex,

22:53.878 --> 22:57.130
it's always just seemed so. . .

22:58.007 --> 22:59.841
undignified.

23:01.218 --> 23:03.011
But l have to play the game.

23:03.137 --> 23:05.180
And after years
of trying to look normal,

23:05.306 --> 23:07.307
l think l met the right woman for me.

23:08.350 --> 23:12.562
Deb saved her life
on a domestic-dispute call, introduced us,

23:12.688 --> 23:14.481
and we've been dating for six months.

23:15.733 --> 23:19.402
She's perfect because Rita is,
in her own way.

23:19.528 --> 23:21.905
as damaged as me.

23:22.031 --> 23:25.575
l'm running late. l'll just be a sec.
l have to change.

23:25.701 --> 23:26.785
Okey-doke.

23:33.209 --> 23:34.667
Hi, Dexter.

23:35.836 --> 23:38.421
May l say that you look lovely
this evening?

23:38.547 --> 23:39.672
OK.

23:40.883 --> 23:42.884
Master Cody.
handsome as ever.

23:43.010 --> 23:44.344
High five.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.895
Do the Space Shuttle.

23:56.899 --> 23:58.858
Vanilla. . .

23:58.984 --> 24:01.528
chocolate, and strawberry.

24:01.654 --> 24:03.404
No coffee?

24:03.531 --> 24:05.406
Which one do you think melts faster?

24:06.909 --> 24:07.909
Ready?

24:09.537 --> 24:11.704
Rita's ex-hubby, the crack addict,

24:11.831 --> 24:15.208
repeatedly raped her,
knocked her around.

24:15.876 --> 24:20.088
Ever since then. she's been
completely uninterested in sex.

24:21.173 --> 24:22.924
That works for me.

24:23.926 --> 24:25.301
Will you be back?

24:25.427 --> 24:26.803
Of course l'll be back.

24:26.929 --> 24:28.638
l meant Dexter.

24:28.764 --> 24:30.140
You'll be asleep.

24:30.266 --> 24:31.474
No, l won't.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.894
Then l'll stop in and we'll all play cards.
Texas hold 'em?

24:36.814 --> 24:38.773
Give Mommy a kiss.

24:40.234 --> 24:41.484
Ready?

24:41.610 --> 24:43.194
Yeah.

24:55.624 --> 24:58.376
Needless to say.
l have some unusual habits.

24:58.502 --> 25:00.378
Yet all these socially acceptable people

25:00.504 --> 25:05.049
can't wait to pick up hammers
and publicly smash their food to bits.

25:06.468 --> 25:09.345
Normal people are so hostile. . .

25:10.556 --> 25:12.390
but not her.

25:33.662 --> 25:35.163
Where are we going?

25:37.082 --> 25:38.625
They might need me.

25:43.005 --> 25:45.548
Just stay right there.
l'll be right back.

26:07.947 --> 26:10.448
Son of a whore.

26:10.574 --> 26:11.908
Who?

26:12.034 --> 26:14.494
Talking about this hijo de puta ,
this asshole killer,

26:14.620 --> 26:17.580
this maricon savage who makes us
work on a Friday night.

26:17.706 --> 26:21.084
Only Mondays through Thursdays,
that's what l always say.

26:21.210 --> 26:23.419
Of course. Be reasonable.

26:23.545 --> 26:25.797
Who wants to work
on a Friday night?

26:25.923 --> 26:27.423
l have my needs.

26:30.219 --> 26:32.011
So, what are you doing here?

26:32.763 --> 26:34.722
l was in the neighborhood.
l'm on a date.

26:34.848 --> 26:36.432
A date? Nice.

26:37.726 --> 26:40.019
- Same guy, same pattern.
- Bone dry.

26:40.145 --> 26:41.479
No blood again.

26:44.066 --> 26:46.442
There's some small differences in the cuts.

26:46.944 --> 26:50.571
Over here -
rough, almost emotion.

26:50.698 --> 26:53.324
Then over here, not so much.

26:53.450 --> 26:55.702
And then over here - clean.

26:57.538 --> 26:59.747
Yeah, nice. But look at this.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.875
All bone.

27:03.002 --> 27:06.170
The killer flayed the skin,
the flesh. completely off.

27:07.089 --> 27:11.551
- Now, why would he do that?
- He's experimenting.

27:11.677 --> 27:16.097
- ls he experimenting with the head, too?
- What do you mean?

27:16.223 --> 27:19.100
La bestia left her tits
and took her fucking head.

27:19.226 --> 27:22.895
l don't find anyone around here.
God only knows what he's doing with it.

27:23.022 --> 27:24.689
He's certainly raising the bar.

27:24.815 --> 27:26.357
Damn.

27:26.483 --> 27:29.110
This guy is good.

27:30.404 --> 27:32.864
Will they catch him soon?

27:32.990 --> 27:35.616
l doubt it.

27:36.618 --> 27:41.622
- The killer is an artist.
- What do you mean?

27:44.126 --> 27:49.589
His technique is incredible.

27:55.304 --> 27:59.515
l'm sorry. l don't think l want to.

27:59.641 --> 28:03.269
l mean, l'm not ready.

28:04.563 --> 28:06.064
Damn it, Dexter.

28:08.525 --> 28:10.735
What have l done now?

28:12.488 --> 28:16.741
And why can't l get that neat stack
of body parts out of my head?

28:16.867 --> 28:19.327
No blood.

28:20.454 --> 28:23.122
Why did l touch her that way?

28:24.666 --> 28:26.667
l need to get back to my work.

28:29.505 --> 28:33.132
Jaworski's website -
Scream, Bitch, Scream -

28:33.258 --> 28:35.343
the mother of all rape sites.

28:51.527 --> 28:54.195
That's it. He's definitely the one.

28:56.949 --> 29:01.536
lt's just a matter of time before he becomes a
drop of blood in my glass slide collection.

29:03.872 --> 29:08.000
But l have to wait. l have to be careful

29:08.127 --> 29:10.878
and follow the code of Harry.

29:21.223 --> 29:22.723
Hey, Dad.

29:26.645 --> 29:29.439
- l can explain.
- You and l had an understanding.

29:29.565 --> 29:33.568
Whenever you get an urge, you tell me,
and we deal with it together.

29:33.694 --> 29:35.403
- l do tell you, Dad.
- The hell you do!

29:35.529 --> 29:37.321
There's blood on this knife.

29:37.448 --> 29:39.949
Animals. l find animals, that's all.

29:40.075 --> 29:41.659
Are you sure?

29:41.785 --> 29:44.370
- Are you telling me the truth?
- Yes.

29:45.038 --> 29:46.706
l thought we had this under control.

29:55.716 --> 29:58.426
You still don't remember
anything from before,

29:58.552 --> 30:00.011
you know, before we took you in?

30:00.137 --> 30:01.596
No.

30:03.974 --> 30:06.017
ls that why l have these urges?

30:09.438 --> 30:11.814
What happened
changed something inside Dexter.

30:13.025 --> 30:15.026
lt got into you too early.

30:16.904 --> 30:19.322
Your urge to kill is only gonna get stronger.

30:20.324 --> 30:23.493
You're saying l'll be like this forever.

30:23.619 --> 30:26.078
You're a good kid, Dex.

30:26.205 --> 30:31.167
You are. Otherwise, it would have been
a lot worse than animals.

30:34.046 --> 30:37.215
OK? We can't stop this.

30:38.800 --> 30:39.800
But maybe. . .

30:42.179 --> 30:45.181
we can do something to channel it.

30:49.561 --> 30:50.603
Use it for good.

30:51.813 --> 30:53.356
How could it ever be good?

30:53.482 --> 30:56.817
Son, there are people out there
who do really bad things.

30:57.694 --> 30:59.904
Terrible people.

31:00.656 --> 31:03.449
And the police can't catch them all.

31:06.745 --> 31:09.455
Do you understand what l'm saying?

31:10.499 --> 31:13.876
You're saying they deserve it.

31:14.002 --> 31:15.670
That's right.

31:17.673 --> 31:20.466
But. of course. you have
to learn how to spot them,

31:21.510 --> 31:23.010
how to cover your tracks.

31:25.722 --> 31:27.431
But l can teach Dexter.

31:29.851 --> 31:31.310
Dad. . .

31:31.436 --> 31:32.979
lt's OK, Dex.

31:33.105 --> 31:34.897
You can't help
what happened to you,

31:35.566 --> 31:38.401
but you can make the best of it.

31:38.527 --> 31:40.486
Remember this forever.

31:41.446 --> 31:43.531
You are my son.

31:43.657 --> 31:46.450
You are not alone and you are loved.

31:49.997 --> 31:51.038
OK.

31:52.249 --> 31:54.834
Preparation is vital.

31:54.960 --> 31:56.711
No detail can be overlooked.

32:02.426 --> 32:05.344
And the ritual is intoxicating.

32:13.812 --> 32:16.105
Duct tape,

32:16.231 --> 32:17.898
rubber sheets.

32:19.735 --> 32:21.736
Necessary tools of the trade.

32:27.451 --> 32:29.285
You can't bullshit me, Dex.

32:29.411 --> 32:31.996
Help me out. LaGuerta still
has me interviewing hookers.

32:32.122 --> 32:34.290
lt's a waste of time.

32:35.709 --> 32:38.294
Deb, if he was interrupted. . .

32:38.420 --> 32:40.004
Think.

32:41.548 --> 32:43.090
Jesus Christ, right.

32:43.216 --> 32:45.968
Then how do you have
time to wrap all the pieces?

32:46.094 --> 32:49.180
She's dumber than the boat people.
Throw her a fucking raft.

32:49.306 --> 32:52.058
But now we have a fourth body,
and the cuts were different.

32:52.184 --> 32:53.809
And that's telling us a story.

32:53.935 --> 32:56.103
The ritual is changing.

32:57.397 --> 33:00.107
He's looking for inspiration
and not finding it.

33:00.233 --> 33:02.026
So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.

33:02.152 --> 33:03.736
l could be wrong.

33:05.906 --> 33:08.282
So how the hell was your date
with Rita last night?

33:08.408 --> 33:11.535
Great. You should try it sometime.
You need a life.

33:11.662 --> 33:13.663
Well, find me a guy l can trust.

33:13.789 --> 33:17.541
l need a transfer to Homicide, bro,
then we'll see about a life.

33:17.668 --> 33:19.710
lt certainly would sound better

33:19.836 --> 33:22.546
for the kids to say.
"Mommy's on Homicide."

33:22.673 --> 33:24.090
Don't make me hit Dexter.

33:24.216 --> 33:25.549
Come on.

33:26.635 --> 33:30.262
Then we could talk about
more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

33:30.389 --> 33:32.848
You sound like Mom.

33:32.974 --> 33:36.936
Just tell me what you know
about cell crystallization.

33:37.062 --> 33:38.604
What do you mean?

33:38.730 --> 33:42.191
l heard the coroner say it last night.
He was talking about that dead...

33:42.317 --> 33:43.693
The headless chick.

33:43.819 --> 33:45.653
You got that look in your eye.

33:46.446 --> 33:47.446
l was there before you,

33:47.572 --> 33:51.951
And l noticed this body looked
different than the other ones.

33:52.077 --> 33:53.744
The pieces were cold.

33:54.413 --> 33:59.417
They were meat-packing cold.
ls that what cell crystallization means?

33:59.543 --> 34:02.962
My God, why didn't l think of that?
lt's beautiful.

34:03.088 --> 34:04.880
Dex?

34:05.006 --> 34:06.424
What are you thinking?

34:06.550 --> 34:10.594
Sorry. That makes sense.

34:10.721 --> 34:12.179
Cold.

34:14.349 --> 34:19.562
- lt slows the flow of blood.
- Why the hell is that important?

34:19.688 --> 34:22.064
lt's just a feeling.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.442
Well, it's not good enough.

34:24.568 --> 34:28.028
l got to show LaGuerta and her boys.
They're making fun of me.

34:28.697 --> 34:31.574
They're saying the only way
l can close a case is on my back.

34:32.701 --> 34:36.495
l got to get out of Vice.
Dex, please, you got to. . .

34:36.621 --> 34:38.372
Refrigerated truck.

34:40.584 --> 34:43.669
What the fuck are you talking about?

34:43.795 --> 34:45.629
A refrigerated truck.

34:47.174 --> 34:53.596
He wants a cold environment
to slow the flow of blood,

34:53.722 --> 34:58.559
clean and mobile so he can dump
the garbage afterwards.

34:59.227 --> 35:01.771
So l'm looking for
a refrigerated truck now?

35:01.897 --> 35:04.231
Probably a stolen one.

35:05.942 --> 35:08.027
You think there are a lot
of stolen trucks out there?

35:08.153 --> 35:11.489
Are you nuts? ln Miami?

35:13.575 --> 35:16.160
Choir. Kids.

35:17.037 --> 35:19.914
Can't you do something?
Just find my husband.

35:20.040 --> 35:23.667
Ma'am. the detectives
are looking into everything.

35:24.544 --> 35:27.171
l'm pretty sure l covered all my tracks.

35:27.297 --> 35:29.173
What do you care about that woman?

35:30.592 --> 35:31.967
l don't. l was just. . .

35:32.093 --> 35:35.304
You like when women cry?
You like that?

35:35.430 --> 35:38.808
- What's your thing. psycho?
- l was just heading to the briefing room.

35:38.934 --> 35:40.643
You got no call to be in there, so flee.

35:40.769 --> 35:43.687
Lieutenant, this fucking guy
doesn't belong.

35:43.814 --> 35:47.650
l'm still waiting for his spatter report
on the cokehead murders. Go do that.

35:47.776 --> 35:49.985
lt's OK.
l don't want to upset anybody.

35:51.112 --> 35:55.366
He can stay. l'd like your input.
We'll discuss your case after the meeting.

35:57.202 --> 35:59.620
How about we get started?

36:12.634 --> 36:14.176
You ready?

36:14.302 --> 36:16.387
l'm gonna shame this bitch.

36:16.513 --> 36:19.515
Just state your case clean and easy.
You'll be the hero.

36:19.641 --> 36:22.017
OK, settle down.

36:23.144 --> 36:25.521
Now, has anyone tracked down
that witness?

36:28.024 --> 36:31.652
Oh, come on, people.
Someone needs to find something here.

36:33.321 --> 36:34.947
Lieutenant LaGuerta?

36:35.073 --> 36:37.867
Officer Morgan. l didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.

36:40.370 --> 36:44.081
l have an idea.
something in a different direction.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.042
An idea?

36:48.420 --> 36:50.254
Well, please, share it with us.

36:55.010 --> 36:56.844
Cell crystallization.

36:56.970 --> 36:58.220
Excuse me?

36:58.346 --> 37:00.598
A little more confidence, please.

37:03.018 --> 37:05.227
On the last victim.
l'd like to check and see

37:05.353 --> 37:10.858
if any refrigerated trucks
have been stolen in the last week or so.

37:12.193 --> 37:14.653
Refrigerated trucks
like ice-cream trucks?

37:19.200 --> 37:21.744
No, not ice-cream trucks.

37:21.870 --> 37:25.748
A refrigerated vehicle that could cause
that kind of tissue damage.

37:25.874 --> 37:29.293
A refrigerated truck that's mobile

37:29.419 --> 37:32.004
so he'll be harder to catch.

37:32.130 --> 37:37.217
A refrigerated truck
that might give us a lead.

37:39.763 --> 37:43.682
That's very interesting, very creative,
but let's keep looking for the witness.

37:43.808 --> 37:45.559
We know that he or she is out there.

37:45.685 --> 37:49.396
The interrupted cut proves
that there was an eyewitness.

37:49.522 --> 37:51.941
Now, somebody out there saw something,

37:52.067 --> 37:54.610
so let's concentrate
on finding that person, OK?

37:54.736 --> 37:57.321
- But...
- Just keep talking to all your hookers.

37:59.866 --> 38:01.533
That's all for today.

38:08.750 --> 38:11.085
What the fuck was l supposed to say?

38:11.211 --> 38:14.380
l'm only in here because the Captain said they
had to let me in.

38:14.506 --> 38:16.799
But he didn't say
they had to listen to Dexter.

38:16.925 --> 38:18.342
Well, right again.

38:18.468 --> 38:21.136
so say adios to my career.
l'm gonna die a meter maid.

38:21.262 --> 38:24.473
Stop it. Deb, there's another way.
Find the truck.

38:29.437 --> 38:32.523
Excuse me, Dexter. . .
My office. please.

38:41.282 --> 38:43.283
What the hell?

38:46.329 --> 38:47.871
What the fuck?

38:49.958 --> 38:51.834
Are you boning her?

38:52.877 --> 38:55.129
- No.
- Oh, my God!

38:55.255 --> 38:56.422
Deb, wait.

38:56.548 --> 38:58.424
Shut up.

39:01.803 --> 39:03.470
lt had nothing to do with drugs.

39:03.596 --> 39:05.514
Lieutenant, this is a waste of our damn time.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.141
l think Sergeant Doakes is right.

39:07.267 --> 39:09.560
l read all the other forensic analysis.

39:09.686 --> 39:14.023
The cokehead murders had nothing to do with
cocaine. lt was a crime of passion.

39:14.149 --> 39:16.525
The murderer came to kill
the woman, not the dealer.

39:16.651 --> 39:18.444
He did him quick
and got him out of the way.

39:18.570 --> 39:21.196
But he sure as hell took his time
slicing up that lady.

39:21.322 --> 39:25.576
You don't do that unless you have a close,
personal relationship with someone.

39:25.702 --> 39:28.537
Probably an ex-boyfriend.

39:28.663 --> 39:30.539
That's who l'd look for.

39:33.376 --> 39:34.376
OK.

39:35.420 --> 39:38.964
lt's a bit of a push, but, Sergeant,
you should check it out.

39:47.682 --> 39:49.683
l'm watching you, motherfucker.

40:03.656 --> 40:06.241
Jaworski's been
coming here for weeks -

40:06.367 --> 40:08.660
likes to steal all the copper plumbing.

40:08.787 --> 40:10.788
There's good money in that.

40:11.831 --> 40:15.084
No security guards - that's good.

41:21.151 --> 41:22.818
- Talk.
- What do you mean?

41:22.944 --> 41:25.362
- l think you know what l mean.
- No.

41:25.488 --> 41:27.990
Oh, God!

41:28.116 --> 41:30.075
Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

41:31.953 --> 41:34.454
OK. l did her.

41:34.581 --> 41:37.541
- How?
- ln a movie, snuff film.

41:38.251 --> 41:39.835
But l'm not sorry.

41:39.961 --> 41:41.420
Of course not.

41:43.047 --> 41:45.048
Now l'm not sorry, either.

42:07.405 --> 42:08.322
Hello?

42:08.448 --> 42:12.993
Hey. l'm sorry.

42:13.119 --> 42:16.622
l mean. l'm sorry
about the other night, but. . .

42:18.124 --> 42:21.877
Look. Dex.
l really, really need to see Dexter.

42:22.003 --> 42:26.965
So can you come by later,

42:27.091 --> 42:29.301
you know, just for a little while?

42:29.427 --> 42:31.845
l mean, l'm really -

42:33.181 --> 42:36.141
All right.
What are you doing now?

42:36.684 --> 42:40.729
l'm just finishing up a little project,
but l'll come by later.

42:40.855 --> 42:42.189
OK, bye.

42:57.872 --> 43:00.415
All in all, it was a good night.

43:00.541 --> 43:04.211
One less amateur filmmaker
polluting the internet.

43:36.160 --> 43:37.869
No way.

45:13.508 --> 45:15.509
Give us a minute.

45:16.719 --> 45:18.553
Hanging in there?

45:18.679 --> 45:20.263
This will teach me to tailgate.

45:22.183 --> 45:24.684
- Let's go over this again.
- l'm all yours.

45:24.811 --> 45:25.894
So. . .

45:26.020 --> 45:27.938
All the ice trucks in Miami -

45:28.064 --> 45:30.065
bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

45:30.191 --> 45:31.483
Sure, during business hours.

45:31.609 --> 45:34.277
But this time of night,
a truck like that sticks out.

45:34.404 --> 45:38.657
- And you followed it.
- That's right.

45:38.783 --> 45:40.325
You never saw the driver?

45:40.451 --> 45:42.452
Just high beams and a flying head.

45:44.163 --> 45:47.749
So then he must have already had
the head with him in the front seat.

45:47.875 --> 45:51.044
That's weird.
Why would he keep it there?

45:51.170 --> 45:53.922
l don't know, so he could use
a carpool lane?

45:57.552 --> 45:59.094
lt just seems odd.

45:59.220 --> 46:04.307
Your sister has this ice-truck theory,
and then here you are to back it up.

46:04.434 --> 46:06.977
She's good.
You should give her a chance.

46:08.146 --> 46:10.188
You know, you should call me Maria.

46:11.065 --> 46:14.192
But l'll tell you who's good - you are.

46:14.318 --> 46:17.404
Doakes picked up the killer
in the cokehead murders.

46:17.530 --> 46:19.823
You were right.
lt was her boyfriend.

46:19.949 --> 46:22.617
Of course.
Doakes still hates Dexter.

46:22.743 --> 46:23.743
Of course.

46:27.707 --> 46:29.791
Tell me, Dexter,

46:29.917 --> 46:31.918
how did you get to be so smart?

46:35.882 --> 46:37.507
Lots of sleep.

46:41.471 --> 46:43.430
ls it OK if l fill out that report tomorrow?

46:45.391 --> 46:47.601
Sure thing. You're tired.

46:50.271 --> 46:51.813
Good night, Lieutenant.

46:51.939 --> 46:53.815
l'll catch you later.

47:11.250 --> 47:12.834
lt's been a while.

47:13.544 --> 47:15.003
l'm sorry.

47:15.129 --> 47:18.757
l was worried.
l didn't know what to do.

47:18.883 --> 47:20.300
l called in sick.

47:21.302 --> 47:22.969
l mean. . .

47:25.431 --> 47:26.640
Are you OK?

47:26.766 --> 47:28.558
l'm fine. l was just. . .

47:29.060 --> 47:32.979
l'm sorry.
There was another. . . You know.

47:41.030 --> 47:44.741
Well, the kids slept over next door.

47:46.035 --> 47:47.285
OK.

47:49.205 --> 47:51.623
Would you like to come in?

47:52.083 --> 47:53.792
OK.

48:08.516 --> 48:11.017
l don't want to lose you, Dex.

48:13.145 --> 48:14.854
OK, sure.

48:17.692 --> 48:18.692
And. . .

48:20.236 --> 48:22.654
Well, l want Dexter.

48:24.031 --> 48:25.198
l mean. . .

48:35.209 --> 48:36.459
OK.

48:37.503 --> 48:38.503
Thanks.

48:40.131 --> 48:41.631
You're welcome.

49:03.529 --> 49:05.447
Do you mind?

49:05.573 --> 49:07.365
Um, no.

49:22.048 --> 49:26.509
- lt could be the kids.
- Better get it, then.

49:30.765 --> 49:31.765
Hello?

49:33.559 --> 49:35.352
Cody.

49:35.478 --> 49:37.479
Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

49:40.441 --> 49:42.692
All right. l'll come get Dexter.

49:46.781 --> 49:49.658
Cody just threw up
all over Colleen's couch.

49:51.786 --> 49:53.453
l gotta go get him.

49:59.001 --> 50:00.293
Tell me we're OK.

50:02.338 --> 50:03.463
Better than.

50:04.882 --> 50:05.799
OK.

50:05.925 --> 50:07.425
Go be a good mom.

50:27.321 --> 50:29.572
OK, that was close.

50:32.326 --> 50:34.536
l'll admit, making out with Rita was. . .

50:35.538 --> 50:37.330
interesting.

50:38.165 --> 50:41.668
But if l don't keep a lid on this,
it could be the end of us.

51:04.608 --> 51:06.818
l suppose l should be upset,

51:06.944 --> 51:08.695
even feel violated,

51:08.821 --> 51:10.280
but l'm not.

51:12.575 --> 51:13.867
No.

51:13.993 --> 51:15.660
ln fact l think this is a friendly message,

51:15.786 --> 51:19.414
kind of like, "Hey, wanna play?"

51:20.458 --> 51:22.459
And, yes, l wanna play.

51:23.919 --> 51:25.754
l really, really do.
