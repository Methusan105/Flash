00:02.132 --> 00:03.675
Previously on Dexter. . .

00:03.801 --> 00:06.594
What happened changed
something inside you, Dex.

00:06.720 --> 00:08.680
lt got into you too early.

00:08.806 --> 00:11.307
Your urge to kill is only gonna get stronger.

00:11.433 --> 00:13.935
l wanna catch him
before he kills another one of my girls.

00:14.061 --> 00:15.186
What can l do to help?

00:15.312 --> 00:16.646
No blood.

00:16.772 --> 00:18.690
What a beautiful idea.

00:18.816 --> 00:20.024
Refrigerated truck.

00:20.150 --> 00:24.779
He wants a cold environment
to slow the flow of blood.

00:26.615 --> 00:30.493
l suppose l should be upset,
even feel violated,

00:30.619 --> 00:32.787
but l'm not.

00:32.913 --> 00:35.206
l think this is a friendly message,

00:35.332 --> 00:38.042
kind of like, "Hey, wanna play?"

00:38.168 --> 00:41.045
Finding that truck is your
golden ticket into Homicide.

00:41.171 --> 00:44.173
so Miami's the haystack.
and the ice truck's the needle.

00:44.299 --> 00:46.300
l just found the fucking needle.

00:49.138 --> 00:50.972
This is seriously fucked-up.

00:51.098 --> 00:52.724
l think he's trying to impress me.

00:53.809 --> 00:55.393
And it's working.

00:55.519 --> 00:58.312
The captain wants you
reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

00:58.439 --> 01:00.106
Thank you, sir.

01:02.484 --> 01:07.238
Rita is, in her own way,
as damaged as me.

01:10.367 --> 01:13.369
- Are you gonna kiss him?
- Actually. yes.

01:14.538 --> 01:17.039
We just got an lD on the body
from under the causeway.

01:17.166 --> 01:20.543
His name is Ricky Simmons.
He was a cop.

01:21.378 --> 01:24.422
Ricky Simmons was under deep cover
in Carlos Guerrero's family.

01:25.215 --> 01:27.258
Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

01:27.384 --> 01:30.344
Now he's pissed off
the entire Miami Police Department.

01:32.347 --> 01:35.892
lt's me. lt's James, OK? lt's OK.

01:36.977 --> 01:39.896
Was Kara sleeping with someone
other than Ricky?

01:40.022 --> 01:41.647
Was it you?

01:43.901 --> 01:44.901
James, she died.

03:44.855 --> 03:46.898
Miami's full of good cops,

03:47.024 --> 03:49.025
a lot of them here today.

03:50.736 --> 03:53.654
But no offense, l wouldn't want
any of you hitting on my sister.

03:54.615 --> 03:56.532
Ricky was different.

03:56.658 --> 03:59.243
He was the kind of guy
you hoped your sister would fall for.

03:59.369 --> 04:01.537
Most people have a hard time
dealing with death.

04:01.663 --> 04:03.205
but l'm not most people.

04:03.332 --> 04:06.334
lt's the grief
that makes me uncomfortable.

04:06.460 --> 04:10.630
Not because l'm a killer. really.
l just don't understand all that emotion,

04:11.590 --> 04:13.799
which makes it tough to fake.

04:13.926 --> 04:17.053
ln those cases, shades come in handy.

04:17.179 --> 04:18.179
Mac.

04:21.058 --> 04:23.434
- l'm sorry, man.
- Thanks, man.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.977
lt's a fucking travesty.

04:25.103 --> 04:26.812
You going after Guerrero?

04:26.939 --> 04:29.357
Guerrero ordered these hits.

04:29.483 --> 04:32.401
l'm gonna make something stick
to that Cartel cocksucker.

04:32.527 --> 04:34.779
l didn't know
you and Ricky were so tight.

04:34.905 --> 04:39.408
lt ain't about that. Fuck with a cop.
you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

04:39.534 --> 04:40.701
You're right.

04:40.827 --> 04:43.871
. .tragic loss of our fellow officer
but we praise his courage.

04:43.997 --> 04:45.748
Ricky knew no fear.

04:46.750 --> 04:49.335
Can you believe LaGuerta?
She didn't even know Simmons.

04:49.461 --> 04:52.713
She knew he was a cop.
Wait. Did you tell her?

04:54.174 --> 04:56.759
Proud of you for coming, bro.
l know you hate funerals.

04:56.885 --> 04:58.970
- How you holding up?
- l'm managing.

04:59.096 --> 05:04.892
l'm not. Keeping my face pinched in sorrow for
two hours straight is a real chore.

05:06.019 --> 05:08.145
A whole life reduced to ashes.

05:08.271 --> 05:11.232
For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

05:12.609 --> 05:15.194
But sometimes.
you get a second chance.

05:17.114 --> 05:20.783
Florida prisons kick free
25,000 inmates a year.

05:20.909 --> 05:23.035
They don't do that for me,
but it feels like it.

05:23.954 --> 05:26.330
l search for the ones who think
they've beat the system.

05:26.456 --> 05:30.292
They're not hard to find,
like Jeremy Downs.

05:31.253 --> 05:32.336
Jeremy got off easy.

05:32.462 --> 05:36.090
Four years in a juvenile facility
for manslaughter.

05:36.216 --> 05:39.844
To the coroner, the knife strokes
looked random, impulsive,

05:39.970 --> 05:42.847
but l saw the work of a young virtuoso.

05:42.973 --> 05:46.809
Too many major arteries were severed -
femoral. brachial. carotid.

05:48.437 --> 05:51.188
Today Jeremy is just another
piece of trash on the street,

05:51.314 --> 05:53.357
but four years ago.
he was the toast of Miami.

05:53.483 --> 05:57.069
lt was a gruesome scene today -
the bloody body of a teenage boy

05:57.195 --> 06:00.114
found stabbed to death
inside this south Miami park.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.950
Police haven't released
the name of the victim yet

06:03.076 --> 06:08.205
but investigators are holding
a 1 5-year-old suspect in custody.

06:08.331 --> 06:10.750
We're hearing that the suspect
lured the older boy

06:10.876 --> 06:13.919
to the pond to spot alligators,
but once they were alone.

06:14.046 --> 06:17.048
the victim was robbed
and repeatedly stabbed.

06:17.174 --> 06:19.341
But l knew what he was
and what he'd do again.

06:19.468 --> 06:23.387
All l had to do was circle
my calendar and wait.

06:29.394 --> 06:32.146
Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

06:32.272 --> 06:34.106
What do you say, crew?
Anybody parched?

06:34.232 --> 06:36.233
What's parched?

06:37.903 --> 06:39.570
When we put in the new lemon tree,

06:39.696 --> 06:43.157
we'll be able to make our own
fresh-squeezed lemonade.

06:43.283 --> 06:45.076
Can we have a lemonade stand?

06:45.994 --> 06:49.080
l'll apply for a business license
first thing in the morning.

06:49.206 --> 06:51.749
Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

06:51.875 --> 06:55.252
l moved here from Michigan
with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

06:55.378 --> 06:57.505
But they keep dying.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.008
l can't help it. l kill things.

07:01.134 --> 07:03.094
That must be awful.

07:03.220 --> 07:05.096
Fortunately, l have a green thumb.

07:05.222 --> 07:08.390
The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.
Bone meal works the best.

07:08.517 --> 07:10.601
Hey, Rita.

07:14.231 --> 07:15.981
Paul doesn't live here anymore.

07:17.192 --> 07:19.568
No shit. He's in jail, but. . .

07:19.694 --> 07:21.946
See, he still owes me
for two ounces of blow,

07:22.072 --> 07:23.489
which means you owe me.

07:23.615 --> 07:25.866
Don't get involved.

07:25.992 --> 07:28.619
l never know in these situations.

07:28.745 --> 07:31.455
- l don't have money.
- You got a car.

07:32.874 --> 07:34.333
You want my car?

07:34.459 --> 07:36.377
Yeah. The keys in it?

07:36.503 --> 07:38.629
You know my dad?

07:39.881 --> 07:41.674
l sure do, little man.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.135
And you want to know something?

07:44.261 --> 07:45.970
You look just like him.

07:46.096 --> 07:48.472
l'm gonna tell him you said hi, OK?

07:50.976 --> 07:53.477
Look, if you want,
l could go in the house,

07:53.603 --> 07:56.021
throw your furniture around,
make a real mess,

07:56.148 --> 08:00.025
but what kind of message
would that send to the little ones?

08:00.152 --> 08:01.944
Just give me the fucking car.

08:02.070 --> 08:05.072
You go inside and get the keys.
l'll wait with our friend.

08:06.324 --> 08:08.450
Come on, kids, let's go inside.

08:09.578 --> 08:11.162
What?

08:11.288 --> 08:14.415
You think you can take me
with your little red shovel?

08:45.906 --> 08:47.489
Everything OK in there?

08:47.616 --> 08:49.491
Yeah.

08:52.329 --> 08:53.829
You need toilet paper?

08:53.955 --> 08:55.623
No.

09:02.005 --> 09:04.215
The guy had no idea
who he was dealing with.

09:04.341 --> 09:06.342
l'll file a report.
We'll get your car back.

09:06.468 --> 09:09.553
No, no reports, Dexter.

09:09.679 --> 09:13.766
Thank you, but Paul's out of my life.

09:13.892 --> 09:16.518
l filed for divorce.

09:16.645 --> 09:18.687
l just want my past to go away.

09:18.813 --> 09:21.440
Well, it went away in your Rav 4.

09:24.486 --> 09:25.945
Whatever it takes.

09:26.071 --> 09:28.864
l can give you a ride to work
until you get another car.

09:28.990 --> 09:32.034
Or l could take the bus
like millions of other people.

09:32.452 --> 09:35.537
Come on. let's go outside
and enjoy this beautiful day.

09:35.664 --> 09:37.289
Come on, kids.

09:37.791 --> 09:39.083
What did they use, an ax?

09:41.628 --> 09:44.713
lt's blunt force.
See the way the head's caved in?

09:46.549 --> 09:49.760
You guys check out the new hottie McGotass
in Dispatch yet?

09:49.886 --> 09:51.387
She's a butter face.

09:51.930 --> 09:53.264
What's a butter face?

09:53.390 --> 09:57.142
You know, she's got a hot body,
but her face...

09:57.686 --> 10:00.646
How great would it be
to pull a bronco on her?

10:00.772 --> 10:02.314
Yeah.

10:02.440 --> 10:04.233
Yeah?

10:04.359 --> 10:06.568
You do it doggy-style, right?

10:06.695 --> 10:08.404
And just when she's getting into it,

10:08.530 --> 10:11.824
you grab her by the hips
and you yell another woman's name.

10:11.950 --> 10:15.286
You're riding her like a bronco
cos she's trying to buck you off.

10:15.412 --> 10:19.206
Often in life l feel like l'm missing
some essential piece of the human puzzle.

10:19.332 --> 10:20.541
This is one of them.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.543
What are you doing?
Oh, the bronco.

10:22.669 --> 10:24.128
See? She knows.

10:24.254 --> 10:27.214
l just got my first official Homicide call.
He's back.

10:27.966 --> 10:30.092
- Who? The ice-truck killer?
- That's right.

10:30.218 --> 10:32.803
You won't believe
where he left the body.

10:58.455 --> 10:59.872
l knew he'd be back.

10:59.998 --> 11:02.666
lt feels like Christmas morning.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.336
Look at that - a miracle on ice.

11:05.462 --> 11:06.754
Stunning.

11:13.053 --> 11:15.054
You all right, Dexter?

11:16.306 --> 11:18.140
This is like a dream.

11:19.601 --> 11:22.478
Standing on the home ice
of the Miami Blades.

11:22.604 --> 11:24.355
l never pegged you for a hockey fan.

11:24.481 --> 11:27.232
Yeah. there's something
about standing in a big, cool hole

11:27.359 --> 11:30.152
l find very relaxing.

11:32.530 --> 11:34.656
So, what do we know?

11:35.784 --> 11:37.743
Same as the others. No blood.

11:37.869 --> 11:42.706
So far, l don't see any hesitation cuts,
no bones flayed.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.625
l think our boy's got his confidence back.

11:45.335 --> 11:48.295
He never lost it.
He was just getting bored.

11:48.421 --> 11:51.423
What do you think he's trying to tell us?

11:51.549 --> 11:53.634
That hockey's a violent sport.

11:56.554 --> 11:57.513
What else?

11:57.639 --> 12:00.224
He's escalating the thrill.

12:01.518 --> 12:04.395
Posing his victim
in the middle of a 20,000-seat arena

12:04.521 --> 12:06.230
for all Miami to see,

12:06.356 --> 12:08.107
to show them - to show us -

12:08.233 --> 12:10.067
what he's capable of doing.

12:13.822 --> 12:15.197
What did l miss?

12:15.865 --> 12:17.491
Relax. You didn't miss anything.

12:17.617 --> 12:21.245
Yeah, but she is - fingertips.

12:21.371 --> 12:24.665
This body belongs to the frozen fingertips
we found in the truck.

12:24.791 --> 12:27.918
Sherry Taylor.
lt's another prostitute.

12:28.044 --> 12:30.045
No blood, no need for me.

12:34.259 --> 12:36.969
Come up to the command center.
We may have a suspect.

12:40.723 --> 12:42.224
ls there really a suspect?

12:43.226 --> 12:47.729
l'll let you know when l get back from
my first official homicide investigation. . .

12:48.398 --> 12:49.731
l know her.

12:49.858 --> 12:53.819
- Sherry?
- Yeah, she called herself Cherry.

12:55.280 --> 12:58.282
We worked the same corner
when l was undercover.

12:59.325 --> 13:01.326
You were, like, friends?

13:03.163 --> 13:04.413
Yes.

13:04.539 --> 13:06.373
Do you want a hug?

13:06.499 --> 13:08.208
Fuck off.

13:09.252 --> 13:11.962
A surveillance tape is missing
from the security office.

13:12.088 --> 13:14.298
Let me guess -
the one covering the ice.

13:14.424 --> 13:16.508
They said you were good.

13:16.634 --> 13:18.844
l got the press knocking
on the door outside.

13:18.970 --> 13:21.847
Somebody who was here last night
saw something.

13:21.973 --> 13:25.976
Rent-a-badge. cleaning crew.
crack whore in the men's room?

13:26.102 --> 13:29.146
- Come on. work with me.
- We can't find the night watchman.

13:29.272 --> 13:30.522
Then he's a suspect.

13:30.648 --> 13:34.401
Unless the ice-truck killer abducted him
to gain entry into the arena.

13:35.153 --> 13:37.029
Your brother help you with that logic?

13:37.155 --> 13:39.490
He could have just been
at the wrong place at the wrong time.

13:39.616 --> 13:41.992
We need to get to his apartment
to see what we can find.

13:42.118 --> 13:44.953
l was hoping l could hit Kiocho,
talk to my old contacts.

13:45.079 --> 13:49.124
l thought you wanted to get out of Vice.
lsn't that why you cried to the captain?

13:49.250 --> 13:52.461
Yeah, l mean. . . l didn't cry.

13:53.505 --> 13:58.300
Listen, my girls know this victim, OK?
Their information could help us.

13:59.135 --> 14:02.095
No, l want you to work with Doakes.

14:02.847 --> 14:04.515
Maria, she has contacts.

14:10.021 --> 14:13.649
- You still got your tube top?
- And my nipple clamps.

14:13.775 --> 14:16.735
Don't come back without any information.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.880
Everyone moves to Miami to die,

14:37.006 --> 14:40.509
which means we have more junk
than any city in America.

14:40.635 --> 14:43.762
A skilled bargain hunter
can find real treasure here,

14:43.888 --> 14:46.098
but that's not my idea of hunting.

14:51.854 --> 14:55.065
l prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

14:55.191 --> 14:58.652
My instincts are impeccable.
but l have to be sure of my prey.

14:59.195 --> 15:02.739
We're all adrenaline rats, you know?
Kill it till it dies.

15:02.865 --> 15:06.201
We all meat hunters,
just out looking for dinner.

15:06.744 --> 15:08.203
What you looking for?

15:10.790 --> 15:13.375
- Can l see that one?
- Good eye.

15:14.210 --> 15:16.753
lt's a fixed-blade skinning knife.
stainless steel.

15:16.879 --> 15:21.758
Real time-saver for the hunter who likes
to do his own butchering in the field.

15:21.884 --> 15:23.969
See the way that blade curves like that?

15:24.095 --> 15:26.221
lt's like the talon of an eagle.

15:26.347 --> 15:28.348
1 5 bucks, and she's yours.

15:30.184 --> 15:33.145
- l'll take it.
- Hell, yeah. Why would you not?

15:33.271 --> 15:35.355
l'll get your change.

15:45.158 --> 15:46.116
Easy, kid.

15:46.242 --> 15:48.076
What the fuck are you doing, boy?

15:48.202 --> 15:49.536
l didn't see him.

15:49.662 --> 15:52.289
- You all right, mister?
- Yeah, l'm fine.

15:52.415 --> 15:54.666
Honest mistake. No harm.

15:56.794 --> 15:58.795
You be careful with that thing, huh?

16:03.426 --> 16:06.511
Sorry about that, boss. l only sell 'em.

16:08.222 --> 16:10.599
So, what you hunt -
trophies or meat?

16:15.938 --> 16:18.357
What do you think today, Dex?
The Winchester?

16:19.609 --> 16:21.151
What about the 9mm?

16:21.277 --> 16:22.736
A handgun?

16:22.862 --> 16:25.322
Not exactly the weapon of choice
for pheasants.

16:25.448 --> 16:27.282
You need a wide spread
to bring them down.

16:33.206 --> 16:36.166
Did you ever shoot anybody, Dad?

16:36.292 --> 16:37.292
Afraid so.

16:38.461 --> 16:41.713
- Any of them die?
- Just one.

16:43.132 --> 16:46.301
How did it feel to kill a guy?

16:47.470 --> 16:48.887
Not so great, Dex.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.562
When you take a man's life,
you're not just killing him.

16:57.689 --> 17:00.440
you're snuffing out
all the things he'll ever become.

17:03.736 --> 17:06.238
As a cop, l only fire my weapon
to save a life.

17:06.364 --> 17:07.989
That's a code l live by.

17:09.826 --> 17:12.869
Killing must serve a purpose.
Otherwise it's murder.

17:14.330 --> 17:18.041
- You understand?
- Yeah.

17:21.129 --> 17:22.504
l changed my mind.

17:27.635 --> 17:28.969
l think we'll take the Ruger.

17:31.013 --> 17:34.307
Rifle? l thought that shotguns
were best for pheasants.

17:35.393 --> 17:37.644
We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

17:43.025 --> 17:45.026
- lt's a big one.
- Yeah.

17:50.032 --> 17:52.534
This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

17:52.660 --> 17:54.327
lt's still alive.

18:02.170 --> 18:05.130
For now, this is how we'll control
the urges you feel.

18:05.256 --> 18:08.592
Channel them.
Why don't you go ahead, son?

18:08.718 --> 18:10.469
Really?

18:20.646 --> 18:22.939
Put the poor animal out of its misery.

19:18.996 --> 19:21.623
l'm very proud of Dexter.
You worked hard for this.

19:21.749 --> 19:23.458
Thank you, Bishop.

19:28.548 --> 19:32.050
Hi, Rose. Congratulations
on your confirmation.

19:32.176 --> 19:34.427
Thank Dexter. Do l know you?

19:34.554 --> 19:37.097
My name's James Doakes.
Miami Metro PD.

19:37.974 --> 19:41.601
l'm investigating the murder
of an undercover cop and his wife.

19:41.727 --> 19:43.353
Oh, that's terrible.

19:43.479 --> 19:46.189
Were they members of the church?

19:46.315 --> 19:48.608
No, Rose, they weren't.

19:48.734 --> 19:50.735
l don't understand.

19:51.195 --> 19:52.988
Have you ever seen this man before?

19:53.114 --> 19:55.574
l don't know.
Why are you asking me?

19:55.700 --> 19:57.868
Get away from my daughter.

19:57.994 --> 19:59.369
lt's OK.

20:01.455 --> 20:03.206
At my church?

20:03.332 --> 20:05.000
ln front of my family?

20:05.126 --> 20:07.544
Ricky and Kara had a family, too.

20:10.548 --> 20:13.216
You just opened a dangerous door.

20:13.342 --> 20:14.885
No, man, you did. . .

20:15.011 --> 20:18.889
When you murdered a cop
and an innocent lady.

20:19.015 --> 20:20.974
What is he talking about, Daddy?

20:21.100 --> 20:24.019
- Come on, honey. Let's go!
- Daddy!

20:24.770 --> 20:27.230
You don't play by the rules.
Why should l?

20:38.951 --> 20:41.912
You've got five minutes, Bizach, OK?

20:44.832 --> 20:46.541
Yo, look who's back.

20:52.715 --> 20:54.716
Who'd you fuck -
Dolce or Gabbana?

20:54.842 --> 20:56.927
l let them both pull a train, OK?

20:57.053 --> 20:59.804
Listen, l got a confession to make.

20:59.931 --> 21:05.018
l'm not who you think l am. l'm a cop.

21:05.144 --> 21:07.437
Bridgett, get back. l'm not gonna bust. . .

21:07.563 --> 21:09.689
You're not a cop. You're a whore.

21:09.815 --> 21:12.734
- l'm not a fucking whore.
- What's wrong with being a whore?

21:12.860 --> 21:14.027
We trusted you, Brandy.

21:14.153 --> 21:16.655
My name's Debra, OK?
And l'm not here to bust Dexter.

21:16.781 --> 21:18.573
He hit again, the ice-truck killer.

21:18.699 --> 21:20.158
He got Cherry.

21:20.284 --> 21:21.910
Cherry?

21:25.081 --> 21:27.082
Shit.

21:27.208 --> 21:29.417
This shit's crazy. l'm out.

21:29.543 --> 21:34.047
l got a sister who lives in Ohio,
runs a fashion-boutique store.

21:34.173 --> 21:35.507
l'm on the bus tomorrow.

21:35.633 --> 21:38.843
l ain't closing my shop
for no sick, psycho bitch.

21:38.970 --> 21:40.679
Fucking woman-hater.

21:40.805 --> 21:43.264
l was on the street before him. Fuck it.

21:43.391 --> 21:46.935
l can get him. you guys.
You just got to give me something.

21:47.061 --> 21:50.647
Did any of you all see Cherry
with anyone the night before last?

21:50.773 --> 21:52.273
Well, l saw her last night,

21:52.400 --> 21:54.901
and then she got into a car
and never came back.

21:55.027 --> 21:56.653
l was working all night, so. . .

21:56.779 --> 21:58.488
- Do you know the driver?
- No.

21:58.614 --> 22:01.783
The car was, like,
one of those old station wagons

22:01.909 --> 22:03.868
that have wood panels on the side.

22:04.954 --> 22:07.914
This is good. This is good. This is a lead.

22:08.040 --> 22:10.959
- l should go get LaGuerta to listen.
- Who's LaGuerta?

22:11.085 --> 22:15.213
My lieutenant. she hates me.
l'm close with the Captain. l'll talk to him.

22:17.133 --> 22:18.133
What?

22:18.259 --> 22:20.051
Never piss off your pimp.

22:20.678 --> 22:22.512
LaGuerta's not my pimp.

22:22.638 --> 22:24.014
ls that right?

22:24.140 --> 22:25.724
Bitch tell you what to do?

22:25.850 --> 22:27.642
ls your pussy taking all the risk?

22:27.768 --> 22:29.561
Does she steal everything you earn?

22:30.396 --> 22:31.938
Yeah, she definitely does that.

22:32.064 --> 22:33.898
She's your pimp, baby,

22:34.650 --> 22:37.569
And she will mess you up
if you play her.

22:37.695 --> 22:39.362
l told you, l'm not a fucking whore.

22:39.488 --> 22:41.698
What's wrong with being a fucking whore?

22:49.415 --> 22:50.457
Hey.

22:50.583 --> 22:55.628
Bought you a present to celebrate
your first official homicide case.

22:55.755 --> 22:57.255
Seriously?

22:58.424 --> 23:00.216
lt's a cactus.

23:00.342 --> 23:02.802
You only have to water it
three times a year.

23:03.721 --> 23:05.847
You didn't have to go out of your way.

23:05.973 --> 23:07.807
l didn't. l was at the swap meet.

23:09.643 --> 23:12.353
So, any news on our frosty friend?

23:13.022 --> 23:17.358
One of my contacts saw Cherry getting
in a station wagon the night she died.

23:17.485 --> 23:20.445
- Did you check the DMV database?
- As we speak.

23:21.197 --> 23:24.616
There are thousands of registered
station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade,

23:24.742 --> 23:27.202
but guess who's not on the list?

23:27.328 --> 23:28.620
The night watchman.

23:28.746 --> 23:32.624
l knew LaGuerta had her head up her ass.
She doesn't have shit on the ice-truck killer.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.460
Good.

23:35.586 --> 23:36.586
Why good?

23:39.048 --> 23:41.091
lt's good for Dexter.

23:41.217 --> 23:46.137
You're gonna be the one to apprehend
that heinous murderer, not her.

23:47.223 --> 23:48.640
Heinous.

23:48.766 --> 23:51.392
All right. Good night, sister.

23:53.729 --> 23:55.271
Don't stay up too late.

23:55.397 --> 23:57.273
OK.

23:57.399 --> 23:59.859
Thanks for stopping by.

24:13.124 --> 24:14.791
- Hello?
- Hi.

24:14.917 --> 24:17.877
Are Dexter. . .?
ls this a bad time? lt's Rita.

24:18.003 --> 24:19.504
No, it's fine. Hi.

24:19.630 --> 24:23.341
l was just reading a sad story.

24:23.467 --> 24:24.759
ls everything OK?

24:24.885 --> 24:27.887
Yes. l'm...
Look, the thing is. . .

24:28.013 --> 24:29.597
You need me to pick up Cody?

24:29.723 --> 24:33.184
No. Colleen's gonna take him
to karate with Hudson.

24:33.602 --> 24:36.479
- What about Astor's piano?
- Jen's got that covered.

24:36.605 --> 24:37.939
lt's Social Services.

24:38.065 --> 24:40.984
There's a caseworker coming by
the house this afternoon.

24:41.110 --> 24:44.070
l should be home by 4:00,
but with the buses...

24:45.865 --> 24:48.449
l'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.

24:49.451 --> 24:51.661
Thank you, Dexter.

24:52.580 --> 24:56.332
As you all know, a night watchman
from the hockey arena is missing.

24:56.458 --> 25:00.211
Till now, we presumed he was abducted
or murdered by the ice-truck killer.

25:00.337 --> 25:03.756
We searched his apartment
and found a stolen surveillance tape

25:03.883 --> 25:05.258
from the night of the murder.

25:05.384 --> 25:08.553
Chief of security at
the hockey arena confirmed it.

25:08.679 --> 25:11.055
The man you're looking at
is Tony Tucci,

25:11.182 --> 25:12.682
the missing night watchman.

25:12.808 --> 25:15.602
And here's the best part -
Tucci has a record.

25:15.728 --> 25:17.854
He pulled a knife at a party in '97.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.440
Ladies and gentlemen,

25:20.566 --> 25:23.318
l give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck killer.

25:23.444 --> 25:24.694
Bullshit.

25:24.820 --> 25:27.363
Captain Matthews is coordinating
with the FDLE

25:27.489 --> 25:29.991
to launch a manhunt
as soon as we get clearances.

25:30.117 --> 25:33.203
- Does he drive a station wagon?
- Excuse me?

25:33.329 --> 25:35.038
What kind of car does he drive?

25:35.164 --> 25:37.790
The last known victim was seen
getting in a station wagon.

25:37.917 --> 25:39.834
l don't recall asking for any questions.

25:39.960 --> 25:43.713
Now, from this moment on,
all our resources go to finding this man.

25:43.839 --> 25:47.759
Your individual assignments
will be coming shortly. That's all for now.

25:55.017 --> 25:56.309
Doesn't make sense.

25:56.435 --> 25:59.687
After being so careful for so long,
why would he leave evidence?

25:59.813 --> 26:01.522
Of course l agree with my sister,

26:01.649 --> 26:03.650
but unlike her, l'm not upset.

26:04.276 --> 26:07.070
He's still out there, and l'm waiting. . .

26:07.196 --> 26:08.738
breathless.

26:09.990 --> 26:12.575
- You sure we can't get you anything?
- l'm fine.

26:12.701 --> 26:17.247
Rita's usually home in time for the kids.
l'm just backup. Her bus must be late.

26:17.373 --> 26:20.416
My files say Ms. Bennett
has personal transportation.

26:20.542 --> 26:24.462
She did and will again very soon,
probably next week.

26:24.588 --> 26:26.714
l just have to make a note of it.

26:27.883 --> 26:30.301
She's doing an exemplary job.

26:31.345 --> 26:33.638
l wish all my home visits were this lovely.

26:34.265 --> 26:36.349
So why do you keep coming around, then?

26:36.475 --> 26:39.435
Routine follow-up for
all domestic-violence cases

26:39.561 --> 26:41.896
to ensure a stable home environment exists.

26:42.022 --> 26:44.983
lt's a good thing.
The system does work from time to time.

26:45.109 --> 26:48.611
l was actually taken in
by a wonderful family.

26:48.737 --> 26:50.488
No abuse.

26:50.614 --> 26:54.575
ln fact, my foster father understood
l had special needs.

26:55.244 --> 26:56.577
Without him. . .

26:56.704 --> 26:58.413
You're lucky.

26:59.498 --> 27:00.665
Lucky.

27:00.791 --> 27:01.958
l'm here!

27:02.084 --> 27:04.294
Hey, everyone, l'm here.

27:04.420 --> 27:05.753
Thank Dexter.

27:06.797 --> 27:08.756
- sorry.
- lt's OK.

27:08.882 --> 27:10.591
l am lucky.

27:10.718 --> 27:12.677
What do l know about abuse?

27:13.554 --> 27:14.721
Without the code of Harry,

27:14.847 --> 27:18.474
l'm sure l would have committed
a senseless murder in my youth

27:18.600 --> 27:20.643
just to watch the blood flow.

27:20.769 --> 27:24.439
Just try and keep him comfortable.
lt's about all we can do for him now.

27:24.565 --> 27:28.192
l don't understand. A week ago.
the doctor said he was getting better.

27:28.319 --> 27:30.236
He is getting better, sweetie.

27:30.362 --> 27:33.531
A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

27:35.409 --> 27:37.535
What does that mean?

27:37.661 --> 27:39.787
What the hell does that mean?

27:39.913 --> 27:42.582
She's weird.

27:43.125 --> 27:46.836
Listen, you two,
l'm not gonna be around much longer.

27:46.962 --> 27:48.838
Dad, don't say that.

27:48.964 --> 27:51.132
You can make it through this if you fight.

27:53.135 --> 27:56.346
When l'm gone,

27:56.472 --> 27:59.140
l won't be able to stop you
from being who you are.

28:01.018 --> 28:02.894
Sooner or later,

28:03.020 --> 28:06.147
you'll need to do it.

28:06.273 --> 28:08.149
Do what?

28:09.485 --> 28:13.780
Just remember our lessons.

28:14.656 --> 28:17.033
What lessons?
What are you talking about?

28:17.159 --> 28:21.704
- l can't make it without Dexter.
- Yes. you can.

28:22.831 --> 28:28.378
lf you feel like you're slipping,
lean on your sister.

28:29.171 --> 28:31.172
She'll keep you connected.

28:33.467 --> 28:35.718
Fucking Forensics report.

28:35.844 --> 28:39.055
- What did they find?
- Tucci's hair and fiber.

28:39.181 --> 28:41.391
Of course Tucci's hair
and fibers are on the body.

28:41.517 --> 28:44.268
He's hauling her around
with his pork hands.

28:44.770 --> 28:46.479
Any word from the chem lab?

28:46.605 --> 28:48.398
Same as the other murders.

28:48.524 --> 28:51.484
The killer used liquid nitrogen
to preserve the tissue.

28:51.610 --> 28:53.569
give it that bleached look.

28:53.695 --> 28:57.532
You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

28:58.409 --> 29:01.494
You'd have to be a lab rat
just to mess around with that shit.

29:02.079 --> 29:05.206
Tucci didn't even pass
high-school chemistry.

29:05.332 --> 29:08.167
Watch carefully.
Right there. See?

29:08.669 --> 29:10.711
Right before he repositioned the torso.

29:10.838 --> 29:13.589
- He turned his head.
- Like someone's giving him directions.

29:13.715 --> 29:17.427
Someone like the ice-truck killer
holding a motherfucking gun to his back.

29:18.137 --> 29:20.721
- The killer's framing Tucci.
- lt looks that way.

29:21.515 --> 29:23.933
LaGuerta's gonna lose her
sheep shit when she finds out.

29:24.059 --> 29:25.726
She'll have to cancel her press conference.

29:25.853 --> 29:29.856
And you know how LaGuerta
loves her press conferences.

29:30.899 --> 29:32.817
Can l borrow this tape?

30:12.524 --> 30:13.649
Bingo.

30:13.775 --> 30:17.320
l know what happens next
in this gruesome little scenario.

30:17.446 --> 30:19.989
Jeremy is trying to recreate his first kill,

30:20.115 --> 30:22.241
ritualize it.

30:24.411 --> 30:26.287
You ready?

30:26.955 --> 30:28.831
l don't know if l want to do this, man.

30:28.957 --> 30:31.250
l thought you wanted to see an alligator.

30:31.376 --> 30:34.420
- l do.
- Come on. lt's in the marsh up here.

30:34.546 --> 30:36.964
Wait. Are you a pussy?

30:37.090 --> 30:38.633
No.

30:39.676 --> 30:40.968
OK.

30:47.267 --> 30:49.185
Let's go.

30:50.229 --> 30:52.605
lt's right up here.

30:52.731 --> 30:54.357
Come on, Jer.

30:54.483 --> 30:56.526
What are you talking about?

30:56.652 --> 30:58.861
Don't be a bitch.

31:01.073 --> 31:02.949
Here we are.

31:03.992 --> 31:05.660
l don't see it.

31:05.786 --> 31:07.286
lt's right there.

31:07.412 --> 31:09.455
See its eyes sticking out?

31:14.795 --> 31:16.462
You have to get closer.

31:19.174 --> 31:21.175
l still don't see it.

31:22.553 --> 31:23.886
Really?

31:26.974 --> 31:28.641
Maybe l was wrong.

31:32.354 --> 31:34.355
There's no gator here, is there?

31:37.901 --> 31:40.194
l don't know, Lucas.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.862
ls there?

31:44.366 --> 31:46.409
Anyone see a Frisbee? lt flew in here.

31:46.535 --> 31:47.577
Oh, shit.

31:47.703 --> 31:49.370
Let's get the fuck out of here.

32:03.885 --> 32:05.720
What am l doing out here?

32:11.685 --> 32:13.519
Fuck! Fuck!

32:16.440 --> 32:17.773
Fuck!

32:27.743 --> 32:32.079
All l had to do was drive home,
have a taco. plan my attack.

32:32.205 --> 32:33.956
lnstead, l tried to act human,

32:34.082 --> 32:36.250
like it's my job to save lives.

32:51.266 --> 32:54.769
The code of Harry never covered this.

32:54.895 --> 32:57.980
At least l know what Jeremy is

32:58.106 --> 32:59.690
and what l need to do.

33:03.570 --> 33:04.695
Don't let her.

33:07.449 --> 33:11.702
OK, my brave little soldier.
Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

33:11.828 --> 33:13.829
No! Wait!

33:13.955 --> 33:17.416
- What is it, honey?
- He doesn't want the shot.

33:17.542 --> 33:21.128
Your father's very sick.
He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

33:21.254 --> 33:23.464
- No, l want pain.
- He wants pain.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.016
l'll have to tell the doctor.

33:34.142 --> 33:37.436
He's not going to be happy
you're refusing your medication.

33:44.861 --> 33:46.362
You can tell.

33:46.488 --> 33:48.072
About the nurse? Yeah.

33:48.198 --> 33:49.865
She's. . .

33:51.660 --> 33:52.868
like me.

33:54.538 --> 33:57.206
How could you tell?

33:57.666 --> 34:02.002
She gives too much morphine.

34:02.671 --> 34:04.380
lt's something else.

34:05.424 --> 34:06.799
lt's making me worse.

34:06.925 --> 34:08.634
She's drugging Dexter.

34:08.760 --> 34:10.845
She's killing you by overdose.

34:10.971 --> 34:13.889
Not just me. Others, too.

34:25.694 --> 34:27.945
Stop her.

34:30.115 --> 34:31.699
What do you mean, stop her?

34:31.825 --> 34:33.826
lt's time.

34:36.037 --> 34:38.748
Before she hurts anyone else.

34:43.378 --> 34:45.629
See the look on his face,
like he's scared?

34:45.756 --> 34:48.215
Like he has a gun pointed at him?

34:49.843 --> 34:52.928
l don't know. Debra.
lt's not much - a look off-camera.

34:53.054 --> 34:56.390
There's more. One of my Vice contacts,
Gabrielle - l trust her -

34:56.516 --> 34:59.894
she saw the victim get in a wood-paneled
wagon the night of her death.

35:00.020 --> 35:02.313
That was the last time anyone saw her.

35:02.439 --> 35:04.356
Did a background report on Tucci.

35:04.483 --> 35:06.525
He doesn't even own a car.

35:06.651 --> 35:10.696
There's no fucking way this guy
can be the ice-truck killer. sir.

35:11.740 --> 35:14.158
What does Lieutenant LaGuerta
say about all this?

35:14.284 --> 35:18.788
- l came straight to you, Captain.
- You went around her back?

35:18.914 --> 35:23.709
- LaGuerta doesn't listen to me.
- You don't violate the chain of command.

35:23.835 --> 35:25.461
You just don't.

35:26.254 --> 35:28.798
Now, listen, Debra,
l gave you a shot in Homicide

35:28.924 --> 35:31.383
because l think you can make
a decent detective.

35:32.135 --> 35:36.680
But if l find you can't swim in these waters,
l'll put you right back on the street.

35:36.807 --> 35:39.183
- You got it?
- Yes. sir.

35:40.811 --> 35:44.021
Your father never would have pulled
the kind of shit you just did.

35:48.443 --> 35:51.153
Did you know that one
of your officers has information

35:51.279 --> 35:53.989
that casts some doubt
on this manhunt of yours?

35:54.783 --> 35:56.408
Who, Morgan?

35:57.369 --> 36:01.372
l realize you're something of
a folk hero around here, Maria,

36:01.498 --> 36:04.500
but it would be a mistake
to ignore the work of a promising officer

36:04.626 --> 36:06.669
just to further your political career.

36:06.795 --> 36:08.045
ls that what you think l'm doing?

36:08.171 --> 36:11.632
You were a middle-of-the-pack detective
before the press got ahold of Dexter.

36:11.758 --> 36:15.553
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- lt's a reality check, and you need it.

36:16.179 --> 36:17.847
And l got it.

36:19.808 --> 36:23.561
Let's cut to the chase.
Are you telling me to call off my manhunt?

36:23.687 --> 36:26.647
l will remind you that Jeb Bush himself
signed off on it.

36:27.274 --> 36:30.860
No, no. You go ahead
and hold your press conference, Maria.

36:30.986 --> 36:34.697
People of this city need to know
we're doing something about this mess.

36:34.823 --> 36:36.699
But don't expect me to bail you out

36:36.825 --> 36:39.493
if that night watchman
turns out to be a dead end.

36:41.037 --> 36:43.956
A state-wide manhunt is under way
right now in Florida.

36:44.082 --> 36:46.709
According to police,
a night watchman is on the run

36:46.835 --> 36:48.627
after the dismembered body parts

36:48.753 --> 36:51.213
of a young South Beach woman
were found Tuesday,

36:51.339 --> 36:53.716
stacked on the home ice
of the Miami Blades.

36:53.842 --> 36:56.218
The woman is believed
to be the latest victim

36:56.344 --> 36:58.220
of the notorious ice-truck killer,

36:58.346 --> 37:02.892
now responsible for five deaths
in the Greater Miami area.

37:03.018 --> 37:07.146
These terrible attacks have to stop.
And we have to stop them.

37:08.106 --> 37:10.274
With Tony Tucci
now linked to the murders,

37:10.400 --> 37:12.318
it's our mission to find him.

37:13.737 --> 37:15.154
Fucking joke.

37:15.280 --> 37:19.074
Hey, going out tonight with the guys,
blow off a little steam. You in?

37:19.200 --> 37:22.244
- Hey, man, sounds good.
- l'll pick you up at 8:00.

37:30.045 --> 37:34.006
Elevator's around the corner and to your left.
Enjoy your stay with us.

37:44.684 --> 37:46.018
Hello?

37:46.144 --> 37:48.103
Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

37:48.229 --> 37:49.730
Are you coming to pick up Astor?

37:49.856 --> 37:53.609
Oh, no, a friend of mine is - Denise.

37:53.735 --> 37:54.860
ls she not there?

37:54.986 --> 37:57.363
l'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

37:57.489 --> 38:01.075
She's the last kid left here at school.

38:01.201 --> 38:04.244
l don't have a car. ls she OK?

38:04.371 --> 38:08.832
Yeah. she's just fine.
but we can't keep her here much longer.

38:10.210 --> 38:11.293
OK.

38:11.419 --> 38:13.504
OK, l'll work something out.

38:24.766 --> 38:25.808
Do it again!

38:25.934 --> 38:27.768
Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

38:28.645 --> 38:30.646
Now, let's see about that splinter.

38:34.776 --> 38:35.985
That's a deep one.

38:36.111 --> 38:38.028
This might sting a bit.

38:38.154 --> 38:42.449
But the magical splinter fairy
will soon make you forget all about it.

38:42.575 --> 38:46.787
- Who's the magical splinter fairy?
- second cousin to the tooth fairy.

38:46.913 --> 38:51.000
She brings candy if you put your splinter
under your pillow at night.

38:51.126 --> 38:54.128
The tooth fairy is make-believe,
just like the bogeyman.

38:55.630 --> 38:57.006
Hi, guys.

38:57.757 --> 38:59.425
Ooh, you're right, Astor.

38:59.551 --> 39:01.343
There's no such thing
as the bogeyman.

39:01.469 --> 39:04.054
But the splinter fairy,
she's the real deal.

39:04.806 --> 39:08.017
Will the splinter fairy come if l cry?

39:11.813 --> 39:13.647
Thanks for picking her up.

39:14.649 --> 39:17.276
lf l had a heart.
it might be breaking right now.

40:26.930 --> 40:28.764
Oh, sorry.

40:49.828 --> 40:52.788
Who we picking up now, man?
He sure ain't sitting on my lap.

40:52.914 --> 40:54.915
We're not picking up anybody, bro.

40:56.417 --> 40:58.210
What we doing in the Gables?

40:58.753 --> 41:02.005
l told Dexter.
We're blowing off some steam.

41:02.132 --> 41:03.590
This is it.

41:04.592 --> 41:06.093
What the hell is this?

41:06.219 --> 41:07.803
lt's a disguise.

41:08.847 --> 41:13.308
One of Guerrero's top lieutenants lives here
and we're gonna fuck him up.

41:13.434 --> 41:17.771
Hold up. Mac. l thought you said
you wanted to go out and get shit-faced.

41:17.897 --> 41:19.773
l am shit-faced.

41:21.067 --> 41:22.734
How do l look?

41:25.864 --> 41:28.991
Man, l'm all for sending the message,
but this ain't the way.

41:29.117 --> 41:30.868
Why the hell not?

41:30.994 --> 41:32.995
The guy's scum.

41:39.961 --> 41:42.212
Mac, listen. l've got to talk to Dexter.

41:42.338 --> 41:44.047
Mac, Mac!

41:44.174 --> 41:45.924
Hey, listen up, man.

41:46.050 --> 41:50.095
l showed my face to Guerrero.
They gonna think l'm behind this shit.

41:50.221 --> 41:52.681
- That's part of the plan.
- What plan?

41:52.807 --> 41:55.350
You fucked my sister.
You fucked a cop's wife.

41:55.476 --> 41:57.769
Now you're just fucked, buddy.

42:04.527 --> 42:06.195
Open the door!

42:11.159 --> 42:12.784
Shit.

42:13.620 --> 42:15.621
Motherfucker!

42:20.585 --> 42:21.919
Fuck.

42:44.984 --> 42:46.902
Quit fucking around. Turn on the lights.

42:48.655 --> 42:51.573
Come on. man.
turn on the fucking lights!

42:56.663 --> 42:57.829
You're mine now.

42:57.956 --> 42:59.498
- What do you want?
- Silence.

42:59.624 --> 43:02.459
You gonna fuck me, faggot?
l killed the last guy who raped me.

43:05.129 --> 43:06.588
What guy?

43:11.219 --> 43:12.928
He raped you?

43:13.721 --> 43:16.181
The guy you killed when you were 1 5?

43:17.225 --> 43:18.976
Why didn't you tell anybody?

43:20.395 --> 43:21.478
Would you?

43:23.898 --> 43:27.276
He fucked me, and l killed him,
and if you try, l'll kill you, too.

43:29.612 --> 43:33.115
l understand now.
Why didn't l see it before?

43:33.241 --> 43:36.118
Jeremy didn't murder that boy
four years ago.

43:36.244 --> 43:38.829
He was taking out the garbage.

43:38.955 --> 43:40.747
Just like l do.

43:45.128 --> 43:48.630
l don't want to cancel all my credit cards,
and l hate waiting in line at the DMV.

43:48.756 --> 43:51.133
so give me back the wallet
you stole from my car.

43:51.259 --> 43:53.260
or l'll break your fucking neck.

43:55.680 --> 43:57.264
lt's in my backpack.

44:15.658 --> 44:16.992
Wait, is that all?

44:20.204 --> 44:21.538
You want more?

44:27.170 --> 44:30.547
That boy who raped you four years ago,
did he deserve to die?

44:32.592 --> 44:34.760
Yeah, he did.

44:35.470 --> 44:37.596
Well, the boy the other day didn't.

44:39.974 --> 44:42.809
Remember that.
lt could save your life one day.

44:49.359 --> 44:56.656
Mr. Tinker?

44:59.660 --> 45:01.912
Mr. Tinker, where are you?

45:03.873 --> 45:05.332
Mr. Tinker?

45:07.835 --> 45:12.214
Are you trapped behind the couch again,
Mr. Tinker-stinker?

45:12.340 --> 45:14.966
The nurse was my first playmate.

45:15.093 --> 45:16.676
l'll always be grateful to her

45:16.803 --> 45:20.347
for opening up so many
magnificent new doors for me.

45:37.740 --> 45:41.118
Things were a little messy in the beginning.

45:41.244 --> 45:44.496
Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

45:44.622 --> 45:46.957
But l was trained well.

45:47.083 --> 45:50.293
Those who witnessed my early stumbles
never had a chance to tell.

46:08.855 --> 46:12.315
l've just been looking
through your photo album.

46:12.442 --> 46:14.359
l hope you don't mind.

46:17.947 --> 46:19.906
Are all your victims in here?

46:39.302 --> 46:42.095
l'm sorry. Let me help you with that.

46:48.644 --> 46:50.687
Scream and lose a tongue.

47:07.038 --> 47:08.580
l helped them. . .

47:10.958 --> 47:12.334
all of them.

47:14.170 --> 47:16.171
l took their pain away.

47:17.715 --> 47:19.466
l understand.

47:21.844 --> 47:24.304
Now it's time to take away your pain.

47:38.653 --> 47:40.820
lt was messier than l anticipated,

47:40.947 --> 47:43.573
but it was still a special day.

47:48.996 --> 47:53.416
But. of course. it was really Harry
who paved the road to my salvation.

47:55.962 --> 47:58.421
With the nurse put down,
Harry lived another year

47:58.548 --> 48:02.217
before hardening arteries
squeezed the last bit of life from him,

48:03.844 --> 48:06.179
but his lessons have never failed me.

48:11.477 --> 48:14.187
Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

48:14.313 --> 48:18.358
lt's the beginning of a chain reaction
that will catch you if you're not careful.

48:28.953 --> 48:32.706
He taught me that none of us
are who we appear to be on the outside. . .

48:35.710 --> 48:39.254
. .but we must maintain
appearances to survive.

48:49.015 --> 48:51.308
But there was something
Harry didn't teach me,

48:51.434 --> 48:55.270
something he didn't know,
couldn't possibly know.

48:55.396 --> 48:59.566
The wilfull taking of life represents
the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

48:59.692 --> 49:02.944
lt leaves you an outsider,
forever looking in,

49:03.070 --> 49:05.071
searching for company to keep.

49:17.168 --> 49:20.295
- Sweet ride!
- ls it yours?

49:20.421 --> 49:23.298
lt's yours, until your mom
can get a new one.

49:23.424 --> 49:25.925
l borrowed it from an impound
right before auction.

49:26.052 --> 49:28.178
- Dexter...
- Can we get in?

49:28.304 --> 49:29.512
You better.

49:34.852 --> 49:37.020
All you can do is play along at life

49:37.146 --> 49:39.689
and hope that sometimes you get it right.

49:45.488 --> 49:47.405
Thank Dexter.

49:58.751 --> 50:01.169
Score one for the little wooden boy.
