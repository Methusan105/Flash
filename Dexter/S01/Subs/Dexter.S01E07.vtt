WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:04.258
Previously on Dexter. . .

00:04.385 --> 00:05.885
lt is my new friend.

00:06.011 --> 00:07.637
When he broke into my apartment,

00:07.763 --> 00:11.724
he took some time
to get to know me - my life,

00:11.850 --> 00:13.017
my secrets.

00:15.396 --> 00:17.438
Same as the others - no blood.

00:17.564 --> 00:19.857
somebody who was here
last night saw something.

00:19.983 --> 00:22.068
They got a night watchman,
but we can't find him.

00:22.528 --> 00:23.986
lt's the guard - Tucci.

00:24.738 --> 00:25.988
l think he's alive.

00:27.199 --> 00:29.409
They're taking Tucci over to County.

00:29.535 --> 00:32.912
Rudy here is gonna put me
back together again.

00:33.038 --> 00:35.415
Yo, pretty boy,
you're stealing my thunder.

00:35.541 --> 00:38.334
l don't know, l just might
have to fight you for this one.

00:39.545 --> 00:43.423
Was he the man you saw
at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?

00:43.549 --> 00:46.092
lt was difficult to tell.
lt was dark.

00:46.677 --> 00:49.762
Florida prisons kick free
25,000 inmates a year.

00:49.888 --> 00:52.640
l search for the ones who think
they beat the system.

00:52.766 --> 00:53.933
like Jeremy Downs.

00:54.059 --> 00:55.518
Jeremy got off easy.

00:56.145 --> 00:58.604
To the coroner, the knife
strokes looked random,

00:58.731 --> 01:00.648
but l saw the work
of a young virtuoso.

01:02.484 --> 01:03.484
Are you gonna fuck me?

01:03.610 --> 01:05.737
'Cause l killed
the last guy who raped me.

01:07.364 --> 01:08.823
l understand now.

01:08.949 --> 01:11.367
Jeremy didn't murder that boy
four years ago.

01:12.244 --> 01:13.661
He was taking out the garbage.

01:13.787 --> 01:14.954
Wait, is that all?

03:17.202 --> 03:20.329
The FBl estimates that there are
less than 50 serial killers

03:20.455 --> 03:22.164
active in the United States today.

03:27.713 --> 03:29.630
We don't get together at conventions,

03:29.756 --> 03:34.093
share trade secrets.
or exchange Christmas cards. . .

03:34.219 --> 03:37.221
but sometimes l wonder
what it's like for the others.

03:40.267 --> 03:42.727
The only sound l hear,

03:42.853 --> 03:46.063
the only sound in the entire world. . .

03:47.733 --> 03:50.067
is my heart beating.

04:05.083 --> 04:06.542
l swear, after this case,

04:06.668 --> 04:09.712
l'm submitting your ass
for psychiatric evaluation.

04:09.838 --> 04:13.883
l'm just retracing castoff patterns,
directionality angles.

04:14.009 --> 04:17.470
- Can you tell us what happened here?
- lt's an execution.

04:17.596 --> 04:19.722
The kid's an honor student,
editor of his yearbook.

04:19.848 --> 04:21.307
lt's all in the knife work.

04:21.433 --> 04:24.936
Skillful, no wasted motion.
The killer had experience.

04:25.062 --> 04:27.772
Every stroke hit a major artery. . .

04:28.982 --> 04:31.275
or at least came close.

04:39.159 --> 04:42.411
Are you getting a goddamn
hard-on there. Morgan?

04:44.206 --> 04:47.124
No, it's truly horrific.
He was yearbook committee, you said?

04:47.960 --> 04:50.294
l want your report on this tomorrow.

04:56.134 --> 05:00.846
l wish l could say Doakes is
my biggest problem, but he's not.

05:02.849 --> 05:05.643
l've seen these wounds before.

05:08.939 --> 05:10.940
You're drooling on LaGuerta's couch.

05:14.277 --> 05:15.528
Pulling a midnight shift?

05:15.654 --> 05:17.029
Lopez has the trots.

05:17.155 --> 05:19.156
- Why are you still here?
- Why not?

05:19.282 --> 05:22.034
Nothing at home except an empty fridge
and an empty bed.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.120
lf l wasn't married
and ten years younger. . .

05:24.246 --> 05:26.247
l'd still be in high school. Keep dreaming.

05:26.373 --> 05:27.999
Wiseass.

05:28.125 --> 05:30.543
l've been chasing leads
on the ice-truck killer.

05:30.669 --> 05:32.294
Pathetic long shots, mostly.

05:32.421 --> 05:34.338
Yeah? What kind of leads?

05:34.464 --> 05:36.590
l looked at the research,
with mass murderers,

05:36.717 --> 05:38.384
it's dumb shit that trips them up.

05:38.510 --> 05:41.721
Son of Sam got a parking ticket
outside his own crime scene.

05:41.847 --> 05:45.057
so you ran parking violations
at the crime scenes of our guy?

05:45.183 --> 05:46.392
Smart.

05:46.518 --> 05:49.770
Yeah, but none of the registered
owners had criminal records.

05:49.896 --> 05:52.356
Try "moving violations."

05:52.482 --> 05:56.986
Timothy McVeigh drove
way too fast on the way out of town.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.659
Neil Perry, l know that name.

06:09.708 --> 06:14.086
He came as a witness two weeks ago when
pieces of Tony Tucci were showing up.

06:14.212 --> 06:17.423
He rode through a stop sign
two blocks from the third crime scene

06:17.549 --> 06:20.051
at the Seven Seas motel.

06:20.177 --> 06:24.597
Why would a voluntary witness
be at two separate crime scenes?

06:24.723 --> 06:27.266
l don't know, maybe he was
chopping up hookers.

06:27.392 --> 06:29.935
Holy mother of fuck, is this him?

06:30.062 --> 06:31.896
Let's find out.

06:35.734 --> 06:37.151
ls this the right address?

06:37.277 --> 06:39.278
According to DMV,
this is where Perry lives.

06:39.404 --> 06:41.947
With his seven inbred cousins,
by the look of it.

06:42.074 --> 06:45.367
something must be wrong with
somebody that can live in a steel box.

06:45.494 --> 06:47.328
Aluminum, actually.

06:47.454 --> 06:49.747
Nina and l had a deluxe multisectional.

06:49.873 --> 06:52.249
- For real?
- lt was our starter home.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.253
This is our car.

06:56.379 --> 06:59.673
One victim was seen getting in
a wood-paneled station wagon.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.426
All right, one step at a time.
Let's find our guy.

07:02.552 --> 07:06.806
According to his files, he works
as a computer analyst for Miami Lake.

07:06.932 --> 07:08.766
Look up. . .slowly.

07:12.145 --> 07:13.813
Take the front door, cover the exits.

07:13.939 --> 07:15.689
- l'm going to the back.
- OK.

07:24.658 --> 07:26.700
Open up, Perry! lt's the police!

07:26.827 --> 07:29.120
Open up, Perry! Police!

07:29.246 --> 07:30.287
Open up, Perry!

07:35.418 --> 07:37.086
Open the door!

07:39.673 --> 07:41.799
Hey, Angel, l got him!

07:41.925 --> 07:44.510
Police! Stop running, Perry!

07:44.636 --> 07:45.886
Get the fuck down!

07:54.771 --> 07:55.938
Fuck!

08:12.455 --> 08:14.957
l knew l recognized
the knife work of the killer.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.709
Jeremy Downs.

08:17.335 --> 08:18.711
l had him.

08:18.837 --> 08:22.715
He was mine. . .until l found out
the boy Jeremy killed raped him.

08:22.841 --> 08:24.884
He fucked me and l killed him.

08:25.010 --> 08:26.802
So l let Jeremy go.

08:26.928 --> 08:28.846
lt seemed fair.

08:30.056 --> 08:32.558
But my random act of kindness
was misguided.

08:32.684 --> 08:34.143
lf l'd followed my instincts,

08:34.269 --> 08:37.855
this boy's high school yearbook
would still have an editor.

08:37.981 --> 08:40.316
Captain Matthews
is coordinating the FDLE. . .

08:40.442 --> 08:42.860
to launch a statewide manhunt. . .

08:44.821 --> 08:47.489
The task force will tear apart
the house for evidence

08:47.616 --> 08:50.618
that links Neil Perry
to the ice-truck murders.

08:50.744 --> 08:53.746
We'll need proof this time, people,
tangible proof.

08:53.872 --> 08:55.372
What is it?

08:56.374 --> 08:58.751
They really found the ice-truck killer?

08:58.877 --> 09:00.377
l did.

09:01.421 --> 09:02.338
Yes, yes.

09:02.464 --> 09:04.840
We will financially guarantee
extradition from anywhere.

09:04.966 --> 09:07.176
- James?
- l'm on it. l'll run the task force.

09:07.302 --> 09:10.346
l need you and Pullman
to stay with the knife victim.

09:10.472 --> 09:12.765
His parents are high-profile.

09:12.891 --> 09:14.308
Whatever you need.

09:15.560 --> 09:19.396
Angel, you found Perry.
You run the task force.

09:19.522 --> 09:21.774
Contact the fugitive's friends, family,

09:21.900 --> 09:24.443
coworkers, coke dealer,
anybody who might hide him.

09:24.569 --> 09:27.112
- You want us to circulate his photo?
- ln neighborhoods only.

09:27.239 --> 09:30.449
Keep it away from the media.
This case stays low-profile.

09:30.575 --> 09:32.660
The last thing l need is another Tony Tucci.

09:32.786 --> 09:34.745
- Anything else, Lieutenant?
- Yes. . .

09:34.871 --> 09:37.581
choose members who can put
their regular duties aside

09:37.707 --> 09:40.292
and bust ass until
Neil Perry's apprehended.

09:40.418 --> 09:42.044
OK. Dominic.

09:42.170 --> 09:43.420
That's all. Thank Dexter.

09:44.965 --> 09:47.633
- You really think this is the guy?
- lt's all lining up.

09:47.759 --> 09:50.594
l saw him, Dex. l chased him.

09:51.137 --> 09:52.596
Debra Morgan.

09:53.390 --> 09:55.641
Get over here. You're on the team.

09:55.767 --> 09:58.644
Do you hear that? l'm on the team.

09:58.770 --> 10:00.562
You think we get hats?

10:00.689 --> 10:03.190
Hardly looks a guy
capable of terrorizing Miami.

10:03.316 --> 10:05.901
A science camp, maybe.

10:08.196 --> 10:10.447
l'm off. l'll keep you in the loop.

10:12.117 --> 10:15.452
- Where's my blood report, Sparky?
- l'm on it. sergeant.

10:27.632 --> 10:30.050
- How you doing, Mrs. Bennett?
- Hey. Charlie.

10:30.176 --> 10:31.218
Where are the kids?

10:31.344 --> 10:33.721
Your husband swung by. He didn't tell you?

10:33.847 --> 10:35.889
l've never seen Cody light up like that.

10:36.016 --> 10:38.559
- Big treat, the old man coming down.
- Wait, wait.

10:39.144 --> 10:41.812
- Paul?
- He just picked up the kids.

10:41.938 --> 10:45.274
You gave my children to Paul?
Are you stupid?

10:46.484 --> 10:48.944
l told the administrative office
that Cody and Astor

10:49.070 --> 10:50.821
are not to be released into his custody!

10:50.947 --> 10:54.825
- Well. nobody told me.
- He just got out of fucking jail!

10:58.913 --> 11:01.749
Everyone, follow strict, sterile protocol.

11:01.875 --> 11:06.170
There will be no contamination
of my crime scene.

11:06.296 --> 11:10.215
Bag anything that could be used to murder
or dispose of a human body.

11:10.342 --> 11:13.302
That's pretty much everything in here, boss.

11:13.428 --> 11:14.803
Except this.

11:14.929 --> 11:18.390
- He's a sick fuck.
- Some might say that.

11:18.516 --> 11:22.144
To others,
crypto-taxidermy is a fine art.

11:23.021 --> 11:24.646
l got a mummified chupacabra at home.

11:24.773 --> 11:27.274
Can l run Masuka's prints
as the ice-truck killer?

11:27.400 --> 11:31.236
No need for that. l'll give you
some warm DNA right now.

11:31.363 --> 11:33.489
God, you're gross. l didn't hear that.

11:34.574 --> 11:36.909
Detective, l found something.

11:37.035 --> 11:39.328
An archive of hidden files.

11:39.454 --> 11:42.081
A lot of how-to documents,
draining blood from cattle,

11:42.207 --> 11:45.459
- wartime amputation techniques.
- "Butchering the human carcass"?

11:45.585 --> 11:48.504
Even an article about countries
that don't extradite to the US.

11:48.630 --> 11:51.799
- We've got this fucker.
- We got jack shit, Morgan.

11:51.925 --> 11:55.427
Everything in here is circumstantial.
We need hard evidence.

11:55.553 --> 11:59.681
Hey, l'm not done looking yet. Are you?

12:01.976 --> 12:04.603
The school had no right
to give my children to Paul.

12:04.729 --> 12:06.980
- No. they didn't.
- He lost his custody rights

12:07.107 --> 12:09.775
right around the time
my head hit the living-room wall.

12:09.901 --> 12:13.320
- l would think so.
- l should be out looking for my kids.

12:13.446 --> 12:16.949
The best thing to do for them
is stay here in case he tries to call.

12:17.075 --> 12:18.784
What if he doesn't?

12:18.910 --> 12:23.622
What if he kidnapped them
to get back at me for putting him in jail?

12:23.748 --> 12:24.915
Dexter, l. . .

12:29.629 --> 12:31.797
- Hi!
- l got ya.

12:35.176 --> 12:37.511
Mom, look, it's Dad. He came home.

12:38.596 --> 12:40.973
What, you think l was
gonna move to the moon?

12:41.099 --> 12:43.600
Stop it. Just stop.

12:43.726 --> 12:45.185
You know l called the police?

12:46.146 --> 12:49.022
- l told you l took them to the carnival.
- No. you didn't.

12:49.149 --> 12:52.151
l called you at the hotel.
They said you were on a break,

12:52.277 --> 12:57.239
so l left a message
with the info and my cell number.

13:01.119 --> 13:03.704
Hi. How are you?

13:03.830 --> 13:07.249
l'm Paul Bennett, father on parole.

13:08.543 --> 13:11.170
Dexter Morgan.

13:11.296 --> 13:14.590
l can't think of anything clever to say.

13:16.259 --> 13:18.802
Paul, this is unacceptable.

13:18.928 --> 13:22.848
l have custody. You can't just take them
without my permission.

13:22.974 --> 13:24.808
l came to see my babies.

13:25.852 --> 13:28.312
l missed them, Rita.

13:28.438 --> 13:29.897
l missed a lot of things.

13:37.822 --> 13:40.908
l should phone the station,
call off the dogs.

13:41.034 --> 13:43.785
Dexter, look, my dad's home.

13:43.912 --> 13:46.455
l see that, buddy.

14:01.429 --> 14:03.222
Hey, Angel.

14:03.348 --> 14:06.892
You're the expert on manufactured living.
This closet look a little small?

14:10.980 --> 14:12.648
A little.

14:26.579 --> 14:28.413
Sweet.

14:38.883 --> 14:41.093
l've got newspaper articles.

14:41.219 --> 14:44.805
"Dismembered body found in a pool."
"lce-truck killer appalls Miami."

14:44.931 --> 14:47.599
- lt's a record of everything he's done.
- l got photos.

14:47.725 --> 14:50.936
- We gave the press crime scene photos?
- No.

14:51.062 --> 14:53.438
- Did he take them himself?
- He had to.

14:53.565 --> 14:56.608
- Did we just hit the mother lode?
- No.

14:56.734 --> 14:59.653
We hit the motherfucking mother lode.

15:00.989 --> 15:03.365
The evidence just keeps piling up
at the mobile home.

15:03.491 --> 15:06.743
l just authorized an excavation
of the back patio.

15:06.869 --> 15:10.622
- l think there's something buried there.
- What are we doing to find Neil Perry?

15:10.748 --> 15:13.417
l put his name in the system
and notified the FBl.

15:13.543 --> 15:16.962
- Airports on alert?
- Airports, train stations, bus lines.

15:17.088 --> 15:19.131
- Track his credit cards.
- Already done.

15:19.257 --> 15:21.091
along with the ATMs and bank accounts.

15:21.217 --> 15:23.760
l also put a tap on his home phone.

15:26.139 --> 15:30.434
- Seems you thought of everything.
- seems that way.

15:36.608 --> 15:38.900
- Look. Maria...
- No need to apologize.

15:39.027 --> 15:41.111
l don't require your approval to do my job.

15:41.237 --> 15:44.823
l know that. l've been kicking your ass
'cause l knew you had this in Dexter.

15:44.949 --> 15:48.619
Well, thank you for making me
the woman l am today.

15:50.121 --> 15:51.622
l love you to everything.

15:54.459 --> 15:57.461
l love you to everything too.

16:02.925 --> 16:05.927
He's not gonna hit you anymore.

16:06.054 --> 16:07.387
He told me at the carnival.

16:07.513 --> 16:09.514
l made him promise.

16:12.810 --> 16:14.811
Thank you, baby.

16:21.444 --> 16:24.863
l haven't had time to process
as much as the kids.

16:24.989 --> 16:28.533
Paul was supposed to be
locked up for another year.

16:28.660 --> 16:31.870
Cody seems to be processing OK.

16:31.996 --> 16:33.538
Cody's too young.

16:33.665 --> 16:37.000
A dad's just a concept to him, not a person.

16:37.126 --> 16:39.211
But Astor. . .

16:39.337 --> 16:42.339
she remembers
what he put us through.

16:45.009 --> 16:47.135
At least you're not married anymore.

16:48.721 --> 16:50.555
That's just it.

16:50.682 --> 16:53.558
Technically, we are.

16:53.685 --> 16:56.144
When Paul went to prison.
l started divorce proceedings,

16:56.270 --> 16:58.939
but he refused to sign the paperwork.

16:59.065 --> 17:01.608
As a power play?

17:01.734 --> 17:02.734
l don't think so.

17:02.860 --> 17:05.654
l think for all the darkness that haunts him,

17:05.780 --> 17:08.573
Paul loves having a family.

17:08.700 --> 17:10.534
l think he's just afraid to let go.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.913
When did you first notice it?

17:16.165 --> 17:20.085
This darkness inside the guy you fell for.

17:21.921 --> 17:23.338
l always knew it was there.

17:23.464 --> 17:26.466
l guess l just didn't think l deserved better. . .

17:27.969 --> 17:29.052
until l met Dexter.

17:38.563 --> 17:40.731
l have a dark side too.

17:43.401 --> 17:45.277
What? l do.

17:45.403 --> 17:48.113
Somehow l doubt that.

17:48.239 --> 17:50.282
You have a good heart, Dexter.

17:50.408 --> 17:54.119
You're not like Paul.
You don't hurt people.

17:58.833 --> 18:00.834
lnnocent people.

18:06.174 --> 18:09.009
l don't hurt innocent people.

18:32.116 --> 18:34.826
Hey, dude, the bowling alley's
around the corner.

18:38.581 --> 18:40.999
Hey, l'm looking for Jeremy Downs.

18:41.125 --> 18:42.167
Jeremy?

18:42.293 --> 18:45.086
He vacated the premises!

18:46.464 --> 18:48.381
Focus.

18:48.508 --> 18:50.133
l'm trying to find Jeremy.

18:50.843 --> 18:52.844
Oh, l get it.

18:55.640 --> 18:59.184
Look, man, l'm not really
into that homo shit,

18:59.310 --> 19:02.395
but l'm kind of short on money for weed,

19:02.522 --> 19:05.816
so l guess l'll do it for less
than Jeremy's charging.

19:05.942 --> 19:07.859
Wait. What does Jeremy charge?

19:07.985 --> 19:09.861
Jeremy's selling himself?

19:09.987 --> 19:13.865
He's always hanging out with the
Brokeback boys down at Flamingo Park.

19:13.991 --> 19:16.326
Comes back with fistfuls of cash.

19:24.877 --> 19:27.379
lt's me. Get your ass over
to Neil Perry's place.

19:27.505 --> 19:28.713
You'll want to see this.

19:28.840 --> 19:31.216
- Deb, it's my day off.
- Just get over here.

19:31.342 --> 19:33.677
We're about to bust the ice-truck killer.

19:48.025 --> 19:50.026
Not what l expected.

20:25.605 --> 20:27.606
So lifelike.

20:39.327 --> 20:41.953
Hey, Dex. Thought you'd want to be here.

20:42.413 --> 20:44.623
Something is buried down there.

20:44.749 --> 20:46.041
l hate to break this to you,

20:46.167 --> 20:48.835
but you know you've got
the wrong guy here, right?

20:48.961 --> 20:51.463
The ice-truck killer drains
the blood from his victims,

20:51.589 --> 20:54.132
freezes their bodies,
and then severs their limbs.

20:54.258 --> 20:57.010
lt's clean and efficient,
his psychological signature.

20:57.136 --> 21:01.389
- Neil Perry stuffs roadkill.
- And turns it into fucked-up fantasy shit.

21:01.515 --> 21:02.891
But the fantasies are wrong.

21:03.017 --> 21:06.561
The guy we're looking for wouldn't turn
dead things into living cartoons.

21:06.687 --> 21:09.731
- He'd find that pathetic.
- How do you know?

21:09.857 --> 21:11.274
Because it is pathetic.

21:12.276 --> 21:14.694
Deb, trust me. Neil Perry is not a killer.

21:14.820 --> 21:16.655
He's a dabbler. He's a waste of time.

21:17.114 --> 21:19.616
lf our guy took his early fantasies
out on animals.

21:19.742 --> 21:21.201
he'd bury them, not display them.

21:21.327 --> 21:24.996
And want about an early human kill?
Would he bury that too?

21:25.122 --> 21:27.916
- Sure. Probably.
- Then turn around.

21:28.042 --> 21:29.668
You were saying?

21:31.128 --> 21:33.672
lt looks like an adult female.

21:33.798 --> 21:36.007
Any idea how long
the body's been down there?

21:36.133 --> 21:37.676
Based on decomposition,

21:37.802 --> 21:40.095
she's been tits up
for two, maybe three years.

21:40.221 --> 21:42.055
We'll know more after the autopsy.

21:42.181 --> 21:45.016
What happened to the limbs?
Did they rot off?

21:45.142 --> 21:46.726
Nope.

21:46.852 --> 21:48.186
They're clean cuts.

21:48.312 --> 21:50.814
But he didn't chop up the whole body.

21:50.940 --> 21:54.818
This could be Perry's first kill,
like he was experimenting.

21:55.611 --> 21:59.614
You're the expert, Dex. What do you think?

21:59.740 --> 22:01.908
Sure. Sounds good.

22:02.034 --> 22:05.453
Actually, it sounds perfectly awful.

22:05.579 --> 22:09.124
For weeks. l've felt like
a student in a master class.

22:09.250 --> 22:13.336
ls it really possible
that the master's on the run?

22:13.462 --> 22:18.008
And even more tragic.
does he live in a double-wide?

22:18.884 --> 22:23.888
The Gravitron goes so fast, Mom.
My dad took me on it three times.

22:24.015 --> 22:26.016
ls that so?

22:27.852 --> 22:29.894
All right, let me cut you up some fruit.

22:30.021 --> 22:33.064
Astor wouldn't go. She was afraid.

22:33.190 --> 22:36.192
So what? l don't like fast rides.

22:41.198 --> 22:42.532
Hello?

22:45.077 --> 22:47.412
- Who wants doughnuts?
- l do.

22:47.538 --> 22:51.374
You can't walk in in whenever you want.
You don't live here anymore.

22:52.168 --> 22:54.836
Sorry about that. Old habits.

22:54.962 --> 22:58.048
l'll ring the doorbell next time.

23:01.343 --> 23:03.344
l got these for Dexter.

23:06.390 --> 23:10.977
All right. l'll just put them in. . .something.

23:11.103 --> 23:12.562
Dad, can l have a doughnut?

23:12.688 --> 23:14.439
You got it, buddy. Coming up.

23:14.565 --> 23:16.608
Now you're making me out
to be the bad guy?

23:16.734 --> 23:18.735
They haven't had breakfast yet.

23:20.112 --> 23:23.031
You know what? Kidlet, my bad.
sorry about that.

23:23.157 --> 23:25.450
These doughnuts are for after school.

23:25.576 --> 23:27.911
But l could whip up
some eggs and pancakes.

23:28.037 --> 23:30.789
- Paul!
- Very little syrup, l promise.

23:30.915 --> 23:33.208
And meat. You into meat?

23:33.334 --> 23:38.880
l like meat on my feet. lt's real squishy.

23:39.006 --> 23:40.673
Paul. . .

23:40.800 --> 23:44.719
- You can't do this anymore.
- What? What?

23:45.221 --> 23:47.514
Help raise my kids?

23:47.640 --> 23:50.975
Yes, l can. That's my job.

23:53.104 --> 23:54.729
All right, look.

23:56.398 --> 23:58.399
l can't even begin to understand

23:58.526 --> 24:02.320
how difficult this has been for you,
being a single mom, OK?

24:03.989 --> 24:08.284
And for that, l'm eternally sorry.

24:09.286 --> 24:11.079
l let you down.

24:12.623 --> 24:14.332
l let everybody down.

24:19.338 --> 24:21.923
But if l could just find that frying pan.

24:22.466 --> 24:26.136
Astor, want to help me
find the frying pan?

24:33.936 --> 24:36.062
We got a profile of Neil Perry.

24:36.188 --> 24:37.730
He's a computer expert.

24:37.857 --> 24:41.067
lQ off the chart. He's a loner, no priors.

24:41.193 --> 24:42.694
Father split when he was six.

24:42.820 --> 24:44.696
Mother was an alcoholic, abusive,

24:44.822 --> 24:47.866
and possibly his first victim.

24:47.992 --> 24:49.200
Roberta Perry.

24:49.743 --> 24:52.245
Dental records say she was
the one under the patio.

24:52.371 --> 24:53.705
Neil kept her death quiet

24:53.831 --> 24:56.875
by cashing her social security
checks for the last two years,

24:57.001 --> 24:59.377
but he did not kill her for the money.

25:00.129 --> 25:01.129
Morgan?

25:01.255 --> 25:02.922
We think he wanted release.

25:03.048 --> 25:06.885
Roberta Perry ran her son's life,
controlled him, beat him as a kid.

25:07.011 --> 25:09.137
He dreamt about killing her for years.

25:09.263 --> 25:12.056
- l spoke with his cellphone provider.
- Can they track his location?

25:12.183 --> 25:14.058
No signal. He probably
turned off his phone.

25:14.185 --> 25:17.478
But. according to records.
he used it on some of the nights

25:17.605 --> 25:20.356
- the victims were taken.
- Who did he call?

25:20.482 --> 25:22.233
Voice mail, checking messages.

25:22.359 --> 25:24.235
Verizon triangulated the location.

25:24.361 --> 25:28.323
All the calls came from the same place.
a six-block area on Southwest 8th Street.

25:28.449 --> 25:31.409
The Tamiami Trail.
That strip's full of no-tell motels.

25:31.535 --> 25:33.620
lt's like a happy hunting ground for hookers.

25:33.746 --> 25:36.581
There's a chance that's
where he's killing his victims.

25:36.707 --> 25:38.583
Let's recanvass the area for leads.

25:38.709 --> 25:40.084
Now that we've got a photo,

25:40.211 --> 25:42.837
maybe we can find somebody
who actually saw him.

25:42.963 --> 25:44.964
Let's go.

25:45.549 --> 25:47.967
You're starting to look like her.

25:48.093 --> 25:51.763
- Want to check in with your family?
- l'd rather check in with your brother.

25:51.889 --> 25:54.265
His instincts are usually good on this stuff.

25:54.391 --> 25:57.936
Not today. He'd just piss on our parade.
He needs his day off.

25:59.897 --> 26:03.149
The first time l saw his work,
l felt like a Spanish explorer

26:03.275 --> 26:05.610
landing of the shores of the new world.

26:06.403 --> 26:07.946
No blood in the victims,

26:08.072 --> 26:10.865
No spatter, no stain.

26:11.867 --> 26:14.369
Deb is wrong about him.

26:14.495 --> 26:17.121
lt's OK. Hell, l've made mistakes.

26:17.248 --> 26:21.251
ln fact, l'm about to correct
a big one right now.

26:22.670 --> 26:24.379
Jeremy Downs.

26:26.674 --> 26:27.840
Hey, you want company?

26:28.425 --> 26:30.843
Just keep walking and looking ahead.

26:32.388 --> 26:34.430
There's some mangroves over by the lake.

26:34.556 --> 26:37.642
lt's too public. My car's in the parking lot.

26:37.768 --> 26:39.018
Are your windows tinted?

26:39.144 --> 26:40.603
l said eyes front.

26:44.358 --> 26:46.109
What's wrong?

26:50.864 --> 26:51.990
Shit. Shit.

26:53.075 --> 26:55.827
Get the fuck out of my way!

26:55.953 --> 26:58.371
Take it easy, Jeremy! Stay right there!

26:58.497 --> 27:00.123
Take him down! Take him down!

27:02.293 --> 27:03.418
Hands behind your back.

27:03.544 --> 27:06.629
Stand up! Stand up!

27:19.310 --> 27:21.519
Miami Metro PD. Can we have a minute?

27:21.645 --> 27:23.563
- Yeah.
- This guy look familiar?

27:23.689 --> 27:25.023
l don't know.

27:25.149 --> 27:27.734
They come. They go. You get it?

27:27.860 --> 27:29.402
They "come."

27:29.528 --> 27:32.488
Look, my feet are aching
from pounding the pavement.

27:32.614 --> 27:34.198
You think you could help us out?

27:34.325 --> 27:36.242
What's your name?

27:42.666 --> 27:44.334
Lalina. . .

27:50.007 --> 27:52.133
So let's try this again.

27:52.259 --> 27:54.469
Have you seen this man?

27:56.680 --> 27:59.390
He's a regular. Rents a room
by the month, cash.

27:59.516 --> 28:01.559
- When was he last here?
- He's here now.

28:01.685 --> 28:03.436
He brought a girl to his room.

28:03.562 --> 28:05.897
- A working girl? A hooker?
- All his guests are hookers.

28:06.023 --> 28:08.733
- What's the room number?
- 20. Here's the master.

28:08.859 --> 28:12.362
Call for backup.
Let's hope this girl is still alive.

28:12.821 --> 28:16.783
- Do we wait for tactical?
- Not with a possible victim in there.

28:31.298 --> 28:32.673
Clear.

28:32.800 --> 28:35.385
lt's OK. We're here now. You're safe.

28:38.931 --> 28:42.100
Please get me out!
Hurry, before he comes back!

28:42.226 --> 28:44.268
- Where is he?
- Please, l want to get out!

28:44.395 --> 28:46.270
- Where was he going?
- Liquor store.

28:46.397 --> 28:48.564
He said he's coming right back.

28:52.236 --> 28:53.236
What?

28:57.449 --> 28:58.950
Where's Doakes? He paged me.

28:59.076 --> 29:01.285
We need your report
from that kid in the alley.

29:01.412 --> 29:05.164
lt's my day off. l was at
Don Shula's famous golf course.

29:05.290 --> 29:06.958
Did you finish your report or not?

29:07.084 --> 29:08.543
Yeah, it's in my lab.

29:08.669 --> 29:11.796
Wait. l'm onto Dexter.

29:15.092 --> 29:15.967
Excuse me?

29:16.093 --> 29:20.138
Your crazy-ass, knife-slashing
two-step in the alley. You were right.

29:20.264 --> 29:23.808
You said the killer
had previous experience, he did.

29:23.934 --> 29:25.893
Oh. Really?

29:26.019 --> 29:29.522
Masuka lifted a print from the alley
that matched a kid from juvie.

29:29.648 --> 29:33.192
Cut up a victim five years ago.
same knife technique.

29:33.318 --> 29:35.611
We just grabbed him at Flamingo Park.

29:36.405 --> 29:37.905
Great work, Sergeant.

29:38.031 --> 29:40.158
Your instincts were dead-on.

29:40.284 --> 29:43.286
They always are when it
comes to killers, why is that?

29:44.955 --> 29:47.081
l'll just go get that report.

29:47.207 --> 29:48.583
l'm watching Dexter.

30:03.307 --> 30:04.223
Miss me?

30:04.349 --> 30:06.058
Police. On the ground.

30:06.185 --> 30:07.727
Get down slowly.

30:17.488 --> 30:18.571
Get down!

30:23.952 --> 30:26.162
l said get the fuck down!

30:28.582 --> 30:30.333
Facedown, let's go!

30:40.344 --> 30:42.595
QS, we got one in custody.

30:43.347 --> 30:46.182
What else do you want to put
in the concoction?

30:46.308 --> 30:48.017
Gummy bears.

30:48.143 --> 30:51.229
How do you two plan to eat that,
spread it on toast?

30:51.355 --> 30:53.981
lt already has toast in it.

30:54.107 --> 30:55.942
So it does.

30:57.361 --> 31:00.488
Keep mashing. l'll get the door.

31:04.284 --> 31:05.952
Hey there, big guy.

31:07.037 --> 31:08.496
Dexter, right?

31:08.622 --> 31:10.581
Paul, hi. Rita's not here.

31:10.707 --> 31:13.417
That's OK. l'm actually here for the kids.

31:13.544 --> 31:15.378
l came to dazzle them with my booty.

31:16.713 --> 31:19.257
This booty.

31:20.634 --> 31:21.717
This is awkward.

31:21.843 --> 31:25.429
l'm afraid l'm not comfortable
letting you inside without Rita here.

31:27.724 --> 31:30.142
Who are you, anyway,
like, the baby-sitter?

31:30.269 --> 31:31.811
l'm watching the kids right now,

31:31.937 --> 31:35.231
so l suppose that makes me the baby-sitter.

31:39.236 --> 31:41.487
Are you fucking my wife?

31:41.613 --> 31:43.656
l'll let Rita know you stopped by.

31:43.782 --> 31:46.867
Or l could just walk in. lt's my house.

31:46.994 --> 31:49.662
l own this place.
l bet she didn't tell you that.

31:49.788 --> 31:52.373
Homeowner issues
are way over my head.

31:52.499 --> 31:55.251
l should probably call the police,
let them sort this out.

32:07.431 --> 32:08.848
ls that it?

32:09.850 --> 32:11.726
Yeah.

32:11.852 --> 32:16.480
Why don't you give those presents
to my little buckets of sunshine.

32:16.607 --> 32:19.317
tell Rita she can reach me
at the motor court?

32:19.443 --> 32:20.443
OK.

32:22.404 --> 32:24.989
He might be a crack-addled,
wife-abusing yahoo.

32:25.115 --> 32:28.159
but he refuses to abandon his kids.

32:29.786 --> 32:32.622
l'm not sure that's a good thing.

32:39.838 --> 32:42.089
- Take him in, l'll be right there.
- You got it.

32:43.592 --> 32:44.508
Congratulations.

32:44.635 --> 32:47.887
You brought down the most notorious
serial killer in Florida history.

32:48.013 --> 32:51.474
Fuckin'-A.
He's in booking right now.

32:53.268 --> 32:55.019
lt sucks you weren't a part of this.

32:55.145 --> 32:57.521
You and me, we paved
the way for this, right?

32:57.648 --> 33:00.274
l'm cool. l've got my own bad guy.

33:02.319 --> 33:04.362
l just picked up a message from Tony Tucci.

33:04.488 --> 33:07.615
Our favorite fun-loving amputee's
getting out of the hospital.

33:07.741 --> 33:09.033
There's a party tonight.

33:09.159 --> 33:11.202
- No, thanks.
- l don't want to go either,

33:11.328 --> 33:14.372
but he lost body parts, and we
can tell him we caught the guy.

33:14.498 --> 33:18.209
- What else you got going on?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

33:18.335 --> 33:20.878
There'll be hookers there.

33:21.004 --> 33:21.921
All right.

33:22.047 --> 33:25.383
Fine, Mr. Grumpyhead. Have it your way.

33:26.885 --> 33:29.345
Did he threaten you?

33:29.471 --> 33:31.263
No. Nothing like that.

33:31.390 --> 33:34.100
He was just marking his territory.

33:34.226 --> 33:35.851
Fucking bastard.

33:36.770 --> 33:39.772
Only you could make those words cute.

33:39.898 --> 33:41.857
Stop it.

33:44.861 --> 33:47.905
Paul said he owns this house. ls that true?

33:48.031 --> 33:49.865
Yeah. Yeah.

33:49.991 --> 33:53.202
He had it before we met.
l think he got it in a drug trade.

33:57.165 --> 34:00.376
- Dex. what am l gonna do?
- l'd start by getting a divorce.

34:01.378 --> 34:05.005
God. this is such a mess.
and l've dragged you into it.

34:07.050 --> 34:09.885
There, there.

34:10.011 --> 34:12.722
l just wish he'd go away.

34:12.848 --> 34:15.725
Why can't he just go away
and disappear forever?

34:16.893 --> 34:19.061
He can do that. . .

34:20.105 --> 34:21.772
very easily.

34:57.017 --> 34:58.434
Fuck.

35:01.605 --> 35:04.607
- We need to talk.
- Yeah.

35:04.733 --> 35:08.068
Just let me grab my heart up
off the fucking floor.

35:08.195 --> 35:10.029
Holy fuck, Rita.

35:11.156 --> 35:12.948
Come on in.

35:13.074 --> 35:14.158
No.

35:14.284 --> 35:15.618
No, l'm good right here.

35:16.578 --> 35:18.245
Oh, come on.

35:18.371 --> 35:19.830
Don't be that way.
Come on in.

35:19.956 --> 35:21.707
l got a six-pack in the cooler.

35:21.833 --> 35:23.334
No.

35:24.461 --> 35:26.462
No more.

35:27.547 --> 35:28.547
What?

35:28.673 --> 35:31.634
No more surprise visits to the house,

35:31.760 --> 35:33.427
no more intimidating my friends,

35:33.553 --> 35:35.596
and especially no more Disney-dad.

35:35.722 --> 35:37.807
You lost your right to be a father

35:37.933 --> 35:40.851
when you beat your children's mother.

35:40.977 --> 35:45.147
lf you want to get to know Astor and Cody,
you'll have to work for that privilege.

35:45.273 --> 35:47.983
- Can l get a word in here, please?
- No.

35:50.111 --> 35:51.445
Divorce papers.

35:51.571 --> 35:54.114
They're the ones you refused
to sign in prison.

35:54.241 --> 35:57.535
sign them now. and l'll agree
to supervised visits twice a week.

35:57.828 --> 36:00.788
show me you can do that for
six months, and then maybe -

36:00.914 --> 36:03.874
maybe - l'll think about
a non-supervised schedule.

36:04.543 --> 36:06.669
ls this some kind of joke, Rita?

36:09.297 --> 36:11.507
You think you can really
make me back down?

36:12.592 --> 36:14.301
No, l don't.

36:14.427 --> 36:16.679
But what else am l gonna do, Paul?

36:16.805 --> 36:19.223
A judge put me in control.

36:19.349 --> 36:22.101
l'm in control now, and l have the power

36:22.227 --> 36:24.436
to make sure you never see
your children again

36:24.563 --> 36:26.814
unless you do exactly as l tell Dexter.

36:29.442 --> 36:31.902
Goddamn, you are fine when you're mad.

36:32.028 --> 36:34.238
l love the new Dexter.

36:34.364 --> 36:37.741
l do. My ass is yours to kick.

36:37.868 --> 36:40.077
l deserve it. Here, look.

36:40.203 --> 36:42.913
Rita, l am a changed man,

36:43.039 --> 36:47.376
and l swear to God,
l am going to prove it to Dexter.

36:50.547 --> 36:52.047
All right. There she is.

36:55.135 --> 36:56.552
Anybody bring any popcorn?

37:01.600 --> 37:02.808
You got him.

37:06.354 --> 37:08.272
Both of them.

37:09.733 --> 37:12.026
- Where's Perry's lawyer?
- He waived the right.

37:12.152 --> 37:15.946
l can't hear a thing.
Who's got the remote?

37:17.073 --> 37:20.659
There they are, my two colleagues. . .

37:22.746 --> 37:24.747
technically speaking.

37:25.790 --> 37:27.958
Thankfully, one of them's a fraud.

37:28.084 --> 37:29.835
. .because you assume that.

37:29.961 --> 37:33.923
so you can assume l killed them.
You can assume anything you want.

37:34.049 --> 37:36.800
The doer is merely a fiction

37:36.927 --> 37:41.847
that's added to the deed - the deed.

37:41.973 --> 37:43.974
The deed is everything.

37:47.103 --> 37:49.188
At least l hope he's a fraud.

37:53.026 --> 37:55.110
Here's to my new hand.

37:55.236 --> 37:56.946
Some say bravery

37:57.072 --> 37:59.448
is being the only one
who knows you're afraid.

37:59.950 --> 38:02.159
But l've worked with
a lot of amputees.

38:02.285 --> 38:05.287
and l got to say, l don't think
Tony knew he was afraid.

38:06.081 --> 38:08.958
Here's to one crazy bastard.

38:09.084 --> 38:12.252
Kiss my atrophied ass.

38:12.796 --> 38:15.214
- Now for the main event.
- Medical marijuana?

38:17.050 --> 38:19.009
You wish.

38:19.135 --> 38:21.804
Can you help me out here, Rudy?

38:24.891 --> 38:28.352
Look at that shit.
Half-human, half-machine.

38:28.478 --> 38:30.145
But all man, baby.

38:35.151 --> 38:36.151
l got it.

38:40.031 --> 38:41.573
Yeah.

38:43.243 --> 38:44.326
May l have this dance?

38:44.452 --> 38:46.412
You might have
a chance with me, after all.

38:46.538 --> 38:49.665
Don't worry, there's still
plenty of me to go around.

38:53.545 --> 38:56.380
So, you made that hand and foot?

38:57.132 --> 38:59.049
You did a good thing.

38:59.175 --> 39:03.554
Tony lost a piece of himself,
and l helped him find it.

39:03.680 --> 39:08.392
How often in life do you
get to make someone whole?

39:08.518 --> 39:09.935
l wouldn't know.

39:10.061 --> 39:12.396
lt's like living art, what you do.

39:12.522 --> 39:16.358
lt's funny you should say that.
because before l turned to prosthetics,

39:16.484 --> 39:20.904
l studied the human form
at the university of Paris - Sorbonne.

39:21.031 --> 39:22.781
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:25.869 --> 39:28.370
- Have you had dinner yet?
- l would love to.

39:30.665 --> 39:33.042
l thought l'd come and show my support.

39:33.460 --> 39:34.626
Bad timing?

39:34.753 --> 39:36.712
No. No.

39:36.838 --> 39:38.630
Have some champagne, Sergeant.

39:43.928 --> 39:45.929
See, we got blogs.

39:46.056 --> 39:47.556
We got podcasts.

39:47.682 --> 39:49.433
The information won't stop.

39:49.559 --> 39:51.935
lt comes into your head
and bleeds out your eyes,

39:52.062 --> 39:55.147
and it's all crap, you know?

39:55.273 --> 39:59.109
See, you got to dare
for greatness these days

39:59.235 --> 40:00.736
to get people's attention.

40:04.741 --> 40:06.325
Did l get yours?

40:14.084 --> 40:17.628
This is worse than foreplay.
Why doesn't she ask him questions?

40:17.754 --> 40:21.298
l have no idea what she's doing,
but my patience is wearing thin.

40:24.511 --> 40:27.387
l gave Jeremy a chance, and he blew it.

40:29.432 --> 40:31.934
ls this one going to disappoint me too?

40:34.270 --> 40:37.397
That's an interesting interview technique.

40:37.524 --> 40:41.485
l'm tired of asking questions.
You're getting off on this too fucking much.

40:42.737 --> 40:45.197
- Getting off on what?
- The game.

40:45.323 --> 40:47.866
l guess that's why
you didn't request a lawyer.

40:47.992 --> 40:50.828
so you can sit here and say
whatever comes into your head.

40:50.954 --> 40:52.871
While my ass is spreading like Cheez Whiz,

40:52.997 --> 40:56.375
waiting for you to figure out
this isn't the fun part.

40:56.501 --> 40:58.210
What are you talking about?

41:00.922 --> 41:03.132
We got you dead to rights.

41:04.217 --> 41:08.011
But the good times won't start rolling
till you're in a courtroom

41:08.138 --> 41:10.514
with your own personal Judge lto,

41:10.640 --> 41:14.560
and Court TV
carrying your scary-ass scowls

41:14.686 --> 41:17.563
and crazy shit live.

41:17.689 --> 41:20.566
Fascination with serial killers
is an American pastime.

41:20.692 --> 41:22.192
You got groupie housewives,

41:22.318 --> 41:25.028
magazine profiles,

41:25.155 --> 41:28.198
maybe even a summer
blockbuster movie. . .

41:28.324 --> 41:29.867
all waiting for Dexter.

41:31.161 --> 41:35.164
But the feeding frenzy won't start
till you throw out the chum.

41:36.332 --> 41:38.375
So now l'm just gonna chill.

41:42.172 --> 41:43.839
You're right.

41:45.758 --> 41:47.092
This isn't the fun part.

41:52.849 --> 41:55.434
The fun part. . .

41:55.560 --> 41:58.812
- was hanging them like cattle.
- Hanging who?

42:02.358 --> 42:03.817
The hookers. . .

42:03.943 --> 42:05.611
right before l cut their throats.

42:05.737 --> 42:07.738
Son of a bitch.

42:07.864 --> 42:10.115
l used gravity boots
to hang them upside down

42:10.241 --> 42:11.783
to drain the blood.

42:11.910 --> 42:12.826
Then. . .

42:12.952 --> 42:14.077
That shit is privileged.

42:14.204 --> 42:17.206
- The press never got ahold of that.
- l dipped them in liquid nitrogen

42:17.332 --> 42:22.502
to freeze the blood before l cut them
into nice, clean pieces.

42:22.629 --> 42:23.921
Yes.

42:24.047 --> 42:26.882
See, you got to understand. . .
l hate blood.

42:27.842 --> 42:30.260
And there it is.

42:30.386 --> 42:32.930
All the expectations l had,

42:33.056 --> 42:37.100
all the promises of greatness wiped out.

42:37.227 --> 42:40.896
My circle of friends is down to one.

42:48.821 --> 42:51.782
How. . . What are you doing here?
Are you a cop?

42:51.908 --> 42:54.409
The cameras are off.
l have one minute.

42:54.827 --> 42:56.495
Tell me why. l need to know.

42:56.621 --> 42:59.790
- Why what?
- Don't!

43:01.251 --> 43:04.086
You killed again.
l told you, l warned Dexter. . .

43:04.212 --> 43:07.923
Don't kill anyone
who doesn't deserve to die.

43:08.049 --> 43:10.050
Why did you do it?

43:13.096 --> 43:14.972
To feel something different.

43:17.350 --> 43:18.767
Different than what?

43:20.895 --> 43:23.397
What do you normally feel?

43:31.489 --> 43:32.948
Nothing.

43:33.074 --> 43:34.324
Fucking nothing at all.

43:34.450 --> 43:37.035
l hate every fucking goddamn second of it.

43:37.161 --> 43:40.247
l can't stand it, living my life in my head.

43:56.014 --> 43:58.140
Does killing make it better?

44:00.810 --> 44:02.311
No.

44:03.146 --> 44:04.730
Worse.

44:05.273 --> 44:07.149
Fucking worse than ever.

44:09.819 --> 44:11.862
Put your hands on the table.

44:13.656 --> 44:14.698
Do it.

44:20.997 --> 44:22.622
l'm a lot like you, you know?

44:22.749 --> 44:25.542
Yeah, right. You're a killer?

44:30.089 --> 44:32.090
l'm empty. . .

44:35.553 --> 44:39.681
but l found a way to make it feel
less bottomless.

44:44.270 --> 44:45.354
How?

44:45.480 --> 44:47.147
Pretend.

44:47.815 --> 44:50.359
You pretend the feelings
are there for the world,

44:51.110 --> 44:53.403
and for the people around Dexter.

44:55.656 --> 44:58.408
Who knows?
Maybe one day they will be.

44:58.534 --> 44:59.910
What the hell are you doing?

45:00.036 --> 45:01.828
Scraping under the nails for blood.

45:01.954 --> 45:03.080
Get out.

45:03.206 --> 45:07.709
l want ten more minutes with this piece
of shit before his lawyer shows.

45:10.129 --> 45:12.047
Stand up!

45:12.882 --> 45:14.758
Living my life in my head. . .

45:14.884 --> 45:17.427
l know exactly what Jeremy means.

45:17.553 --> 45:22.140
At least l had someone to talk to -
Harry. my foster father.

45:22.266 --> 45:25.727
He spent endless hours
teaching me how to survive.

45:25.853 --> 45:27.896
Excuse me. are you
Jeremy Downs' lawyer?

45:28.022 --> 45:30.023
Yes. l'm just heading over to see him.

45:30.149 --> 45:31.608
Sooner would be better.

45:33.403 --> 45:35.570
- seriously.
- Thank Dexter.

45:43.830 --> 45:47.374
My mom died when l was 1 6, cancer,

45:47.500 --> 45:50.752
and then it was just me,
my brother, my dad.

45:51.504 --> 45:53.755
- You have a brother?
- Yeah. Dexter.

45:54.590 --> 45:56.550
He and my dad were really tight.

45:56.676 --> 46:00.971
They were always spending time together.
l guess l was jealous.

46:01.764 --> 46:03.849
You mean you weren't daddy's little girl?

46:03.975 --> 46:06.393
No, l was, kind of.

46:06.519 --> 46:09.479
He just took a special interest
in Dex, you know?

46:09.605 --> 46:12.941
l think that's why l became a cop.
That's what he was.

46:13.067 --> 46:15.652
l thought maybe he would give me
more attention.

46:15.778 --> 46:17.612
And did he?

46:17.738 --> 46:19.614
Not really. . .

46:20.199 --> 46:23.493
but we had our moments.

46:23.619 --> 46:27.330
What about you?
How'd you become. . .

46:27.457 --> 46:29.416
Captain Hook?

46:30.501 --> 46:33.670
Well. when l was little.
my mom got in a car accident,

46:33.796 --> 46:35.797
and she lost both her legs.

46:37.133 --> 46:38.133
That's terrible.

46:39.594 --> 46:41.720
l remember when it happened,

46:41.846 --> 46:45.098
l just wanted to put her back together,

46:45.224 --> 46:47.476
you know, like Humpty Dumpty.

46:47.602 --> 46:51.229
Just the pieces weren't around.

47:17.507 --> 47:19.382
l'm going to miss my playmate.

47:23.554 --> 47:27.182
Sure, there's Rita and the kids,
but they don't know the real me. . .

47:28.434 --> 47:30.560
can never know the real me.

47:32.605 --> 47:34.606
And now the father is back.

47:37.026 --> 47:39.194
Things have changed.

47:41.489 --> 47:43.490
Everything has changed.

47:46.619 --> 47:49.579
l always prided myself on being an outsider,

47:49.705 --> 47:51.706
but now. . .

47:54.210 --> 47:57.212
l feel the need to connect with someone.

48:02.385 --> 48:04.427
l saw myself in Jeremy. . .

48:05.638 --> 48:07.722
but instead of helping him
like Harry helped me.

48:07.848 --> 48:12.143
l gave him a piece of fortune-cookie advice
that he never even heard.

48:12.270 --> 48:13.937
l failed him.

48:15.439 --> 48:18.108
He deserves better. . .

48:18.234 --> 48:20.569
and he'll get it from now on.

48:43.801 --> 48:45.802
l guess l was wrong.

48:47.638 --> 48:49.681
Jeremy did hear my advice.

48:51.601 --> 48:54.769
He killed someone who deserved to die.

48:56.439 --> 48:59.482
- What's the status on Perry?
- l'm having him transferred right now.

48:59.609 --> 49:03.612
The DA wants to keep him at County,
pending arraignment.

49:04.905 --> 49:07.657
Maria, it was your decision making

49:07.783 --> 49:11.369
that led to his capture and arrest,

49:11.495 --> 49:14.998
and you made all our lives easier
by getting the bastard to confess.

49:15.124 --> 49:17.292
l'm just doing my job.

49:17.418 --> 49:22.339
lt feels good to be praising your police work
instead of your politics for a change.

49:24.842 --> 49:28.595
We need to make an official comment. Don't
worry. l'll keep it short.

49:28.721 --> 49:31.014
l'm heading downstairs
for the press conference.

49:31.140 --> 49:33.308
The press conference is over.

49:33.434 --> 49:35.602
Oh, and don't worry.

49:35.728 --> 49:37.937
l kept it short.

49:38.481 --> 49:40.106
You got to be fucking kidding me.

49:40.232 --> 49:41.983
That was my bust.

49:42.109 --> 49:43.485
This is my department.

49:46.781 --> 49:49.699
Did you at least give me credit?

49:49.825 --> 49:53.787
Yes. l just gave it to Dexter.
Haven't you been listening?

50:01.253 --> 50:04.589
Ever since Harry's death, l've been alone. . .

50:07.551 --> 50:10.595
but now, for the first time. . .

50:12.264 --> 50:13.890
l feel alone.

50:14.016 --> 50:16.893
How long you need
with the prisoner?

50:21.190 --> 50:23.066
As long as l can get.

50:23.192 --> 50:24.401
Jeremy is gone,

50:24.527 --> 50:28.571
and Neil Perry will soon vanish
into the catacombs of the system.

50:29.615 --> 50:32.951
l have so many questions for him.

50:33.077 --> 50:36.079
How did he discover my secrets?

50:36.205 --> 50:37.997
What was his message to me?

50:40.626 --> 50:42.544
He's been in my home,

50:42.670 --> 50:46.548
my photos. . .my life.

50:47.633 --> 50:49.884
He knows me.

50:50.636 --> 50:53.555
Now l need to know him. . .

50:59.061 --> 51:02.605
. .to connect face-to-face

51:02.732 --> 51:05.567
before he's beyond my reach forever.

51:18.164 --> 51:19.581
Hi.

51:22.501 --> 51:24.502
Who the fuck are you?
