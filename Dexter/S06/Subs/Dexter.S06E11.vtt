WEBVTT

00:09.806 --> 00:10.848
Previously on Dexter...

00:10.932 --> 00:12.057
Travis,

00:12.726 --> 00:13.809
you killed Gellar?

00:14.436 --> 00:17.312
If the cops find Gellar,
they'll focus the hunt on Travis.

00:17.397 --> 00:19.606
This way, they'll find
Gellar's fingerprints, too.

00:20.066 --> 00:22.526
He recently delivered
flowers to a Jessica Morris.

00:22.777 --> 00:24.820
- Who sent them?
- Thomas Matthews.

00:25.321 --> 00:26.405
Jesus Christ.

00:26.948 --> 00:29.116
Every time the shit hits the fan,
I go to him.

00:29.242 --> 00:30.451
- Dexter?
- Yeah.

00:30.827 --> 00:31.869
He's your safe place.

00:34.039 --> 00:36.040
- "Wormwood."
- What the fuck's a wormwood?

00:36.332 --> 00:39.209
This is wormwood.

00:39.377 --> 00:41.378
I think I found a new lead.

00:41.463 --> 00:44.506
My wife Beth and I have been chosen
to be soldiers in the final battle.

00:44.758 --> 00:46.341
I'll call Quinn, go check it out.

00:48.553 --> 00:51.138
You're too late.
Wormwood can't be stopped.

00:51.389 --> 00:53.348
Dexter, you have to call the police.

00:53.808 --> 00:55.601
Hurry. They have poison gas.

00:57.937 --> 00:59.605
"Miami Metro Homicide."

00:59.898 --> 01:02.566
That's where
God wants us to stage wormwood.

03:02.395 --> 03:03.562
What are we waiting for?

03:03.813 --> 03:04.855
Those guys.

03:06.733 --> 03:08.317
That doesn't look good.

03:08.401 --> 03:11.612
We got an anonymous tip
that DDK is using this boat.

03:11.696 --> 03:14.656
- Plus, there's poison gas.
- Poison gas?

03:14.741 --> 03:17.034
I know, right? That's all we need.

03:17.118 --> 03:18.911
Part of me was hoping that
this tip was bogus,

03:18.995 --> 03:21.663
but the uni that we sent down found
a body floating near the boat,

03:21.748 --> 03:23.165
so here we are.

03:23.917 --> 03:24.958
All clear!

03:26.961 --> 03:28.003
What do you got?

03:28.713 --> 03:30.839
Chemical traces
of two toxic substances.

03:31.382 --> 03:33.467
Put 'em together,
you got something a lot worse.

03:33.551 --> 03:34.635
Poison gas?

03:34.719 --> 03:35.928
Release it in the right place,

03:36.012 --> 03:38.972
say, a closed environment,
like a bus or a building,

03:39.098 --> 03:40.682
you could kill a lot of people.

03:40.850 --> 03:42.100
Fuck me.

03:46.272 --> 03:48.273
That's Holly Benson.

03:48.358 --> 03:51.109
That's the girl DDK kidnapped
and let go.

03:51.778 --> 03:55.572
Multiple stab wounds...
Looks like they weren't done with her.

03:55.907 --> 03:57.032
There's more inside.

04:00.286 --> 04:02.037
This is where
they were handling the stuff.

04:02.121 --> 04:03.997
From the looks of it,
they knew what they were doing.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.750
Wormwood, the next tableau,

04:06.834 --> 04:08.919
is supposed to represent
a meteor falling to Earth.

04:09.003 --> 04:10.254
And poisoning mankind.

04:10.672 --> 04:13.382
- Could this be wormwood, right here?
- I doubt it.

04:13.967 --> 04:15.926
These people weren't killed by gas.

04:16.594 --> 04:18.971
This looks like where
wormwood is being prepared.

04:19.222 --> 04:22.224
So what's DDK planning to do?
Release poison gas on people?

04:23.893 --> 04:26.144
We can't just sit on this.
We have to alert Homeland Security.

04:26.854 --> 04:28.814
- Should I notify LaGuerta?
- Do it.

04:30.483 --> 04:31.692
What's his story?

04:32.777 --> 04:34.361
Upper abdominal stab wound.

04:36.322 --> 04:37.614
Looks like it happened right here...

04:40.076 --> 04:41.868
Bled out, fell to this position.

04:43.079 --> 04:46.331
Expired.
There are fingerprints on the knife.

04:46.958 --> 04:48.417
Travis' fingerprints,

04:48.751 --> 04:50.877
since it's the knife Travis used
to kill Holly.

04:52.964 --> 04:55.882
Holy shit, Steve Dorsey.
It's Doomsday Adam.

04:56.175 --> 04:58.051
- Oh, wow.
- What?

04:58.636 --> 05:00.804
I found a video blog post
by him yesterday.

05:00.930 --> 05:02.723
He was going on about how he'd been

05:02.807 --> 05:04.850
chosen to be a soldier
in the final battle.

05:04.934 --> 05:07.602
- Why didn't you tell anyone?
- I did. I told Sergeant Batista.

05:07.687 --> 05:09.980
He was going to Dorsey's apartment
to check it out.

05:11.691 --> 05:12.816
Where is Angel?

05:18.990 --> 05:20.866
You don't understand, but you will.

05:21.534 --> 05:24.453
When this is over
and the new world begins,

05:24.537 --> 05:25.787
you will wish you had faith.

05:26.164 --> 05:29.082
I do have faith. I believe in God.

05:29.375 --> 05:32.502
Well, then you better start
praying to him and fast.

05:49.187 --> 05:50.228
Look at me.

05:52.106 --> 05:54.399
There must be something
very special about you, Beth,

05:54.484 --> 05:57.235
because it is no accident
that you are here.

05:58.529 --> 06:00.614
Out of all the people in the world,

06:00.698 --> 06:04.576
God chose you to carry out his will.

06:05.661 --> 06:08.830
God reserves a place for those
that sacrifice themselves

06:08.915 --> 06:11.375
in his name, and it is a place

06:13.753 --> 06:15.837
too beautiful to describe.

06:17.507 --> 06:19.341
And I envy you,

06:19.926 --> 06:21.802
because you get to see it
before I can.

06:23.471 --> 06:26.848
- Now, did you pray?
- Oh, yes.

06:29.519 --> 06:30.769
Then we're ready.

06:36.317 --> 06:37.984
Everything is in place.

06:38.861 --> 06:41.446
After I do the switch,
how long before it goes off?

06:41.531 --> 06:43.990
A couple of seconds
to let the chemicals mix.

06:44.075 --> 06:46.993
Now, remember,
when you enter the building,

06:47.078 --> 06:50.122
you'll see a door with a card reader.

06:50.206 --> 06:52.833
You will take the sergeant's keycard
and buzz open the door.

06:52.917 --> 06:55.335
It's the only way
to bypass the metal detector.

06:56.587 --> 06:58.839
All right, OK. I understand.

07:01.175 --> 07:02.801
This is a great day.

07:05.138 --> 07:07.264
It's the beginning of the end.

07:14.605 --> 07:15.647
Yeah?

07:15.731 --> 07:17.149
It's me. I've been calling you
for five minutes.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.733
Yeah, I just heard it ring.

07:18.818 --> 07:20.277
- Is Batista with you?
- No.

07:21.028 --> 07:22.154
Why the fuck not?

07:22.572 --> 07:24.197
I figured I'd meet him
at the crime scene, OK?

07:24.282 --> 07:26.116
- What, he isn't there?
- No.

07:26.534 --> 07:28.076
Louis said that
he went to Steve Dorsey's

07:28.161 --> 07:30.454
to check out a Doomsday suspect.

07:30.913 --> 07:32.831
You're his partner,
you should know that.

07:33.249 --> 07:35.167
Yeah, I missed a few calls
from him this morning.

07:35.543 --> 07:36.835
Jesus Christ, Quinn!

07:37.086 --> 07:38.712
What the fuck's going on, Deb?

07:40.298 --> 07:42.507
Doomsday Adam, the guy
that he was going to check out,

07:42.592 --> 07:43.675
just turned up dead.

07:45.136 --> 07:47.304
OK, I got the address.
I'm turning around.

07:47.430 --> 07:48.722
Send backup.

07:50.641 --> 07:52.642
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

07:53.769 --> 07:55.145
Fuck!

07:56.105 --> 07:57.981
Dispatch,
this is Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

07:58.065 --> 07:59.232
I need all available units

07:59.317 --> 08:02.944
at 1203 North Gordon
for a probable Code 40.

08:04.197 --> 08:05.322
Copy that.

08:07.033 --> 08:09.284
You think Angel ran into Travis?

08:10.119 --> 08:12.496
Well, it sure as fuck
wasn't Steve Dorsey.

08:13.748 --> 08:15.123
I'm sure he's OK.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.167
If Travis is there,
we've gotta catch him

08:17.251 --> 08:19.461
before he does God knows what
to how many people.

09:02.964 --> 09:04.214
- Hello?
- It's me.

09:04.298 --> 09:05.340
I made it.

09:05.424 --> 09:09.302
- Are you in Homicide yet?
- I'm on my way right now.

09:09.637 --> 09:11.846
Remember, it's Lieutenant Morgan

09:11.931 --> 09:13.682
that is leading
this attack against us.

09:13.766 --> 09:15.767
You must get to her.

09:15.935 --> 09:17.102
I will.

09:17.395 --> 09:18.436
God bless you, Beth.

09:20.147 --> 09:21.856
I'll see you on the other side.

09:31.242 --> 09:32.284
Can I help you?

09:32.535 --> 09:35.370
I have information regarding
the Doomsday Killer case.

09:35.830 --> 09:37.998
Fill this out, and we'll send
an officer out to interview you...

09:38.082 --> 09:41.459
No! I have to speak
to Lieutenant Morgan in person.

09:41.544 --> 09:44.004
Tell her it's wormwood,
the next tableau.

09:45.381 --> 09:47.424
- "Wormwood"?
- Tell Lieutenant Morgan that.

09:48.342 --> 09:49.551
Lieutenant Morgan's
out in the field right now,

09:49.635 --> 09:51.678
- I'm not sure when she'll be...
- I'll wait.

09:54.140 --> 09:55.181
Take a seat.

10:19.915 --> 10:23.251
I've kept you alive
in case we ran into problems.

10:24.337 --> 10:26.254
Everything's going perfectly.

10:27.965 --> 10:29.424
So you don't need me any more.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.009
No.

10:33.262 --> 10:35.347
I'd still like to get that prayer.

10:37.099 --> 10:39.142
Go ahead. Pray.

10:49.111 --> 10:50.403
Your time is up.

11:29.402 --> 11:31.861
I'm all right. It's Travis Marshall.
He went out the window.

11:31.946 --> 11:33.196
All units, we got Travis Marshall

11:33.280 --> 11:35.573
heading west on foot on McNulty,
he's armed.

11:35.741 --> 11:38.034
- I'm OK, go after him.
- Fuck you.

11:39.912 --> 11:42.330
We have a tentative match
on the knife fingerprints.

11:42.415 --> 11:43.748
- They're Travis'.
- I don't get it.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.875
If Doomsday Adam was working
with Travis and Gellar,

11:45.960 --> 11:47.043
then why kill him?

11:47.503 --> 11:49.129
Maybe he was done with him,

11:49.213 --> 11:51.214
and the knife was
his severance package.

11:52.508 --> 11:53.925
Tough gig.

11:56.512 --> 11:59.389
Homeland is putting
their regional teams on alert,

11:59.473 --> 12:00.890
and they're sending
agents to the station.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.726
Sounds like
they want to take over the case.

12:02.810 --> 12:05.353
Well, it wouldn't fucking surprise me.
It's what the Feds do best.

12:09.692 --> 12:10.734
Morgan.

12:10.860 --> 12:11.985
Angel's OK.

12:12.611 --> 12:15.405
- Thank God. What happened?
- Travis Marshall had him.

12:15.906 --> 12:17.907
He took off on foot.

12:17.992 --> 12:20.285
Got a head start,
but I got unis setting up a perimeter.

12:20.619 --> 12:22.036
Order up as many men as you need.

12:23.289 --> 12:25.957
- Angel?
- He's fine.

12:27.793 --> 12:28.835
Did we find Travis?

12:28.961 --> 12:32.005
No, he got away, but there's
still a chance we might catch him.

12:33.007 --> 12:34.758
At least Angel's OK.

12:35.634 --> 12:37.343
Thank God we got that anonymous tip.

12:37.428 --> 12:38.470
She's right.

12:38.512 --> 12:41.848
If I hadn't brought in the police,
Angel would most likely be dead.

12:44.685 --> 12:46.686
You know that dead call girl,
Jessica Morris?

12:47.521 --> 12:48.646
What about her?

12:48.981 --> 12:50.857
I think I know who the john was.

12:51.358 --> 12:53.359
- Who?
- Matthews.

12:53.527 --> 12:55.945
- Matthews?
- The fucking Deputy Chief.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.198
I don't know what the fuck to do.

12:58.324 --> 13:02.535
He was one of Dad's best friends,
he was practically my mentor.

13:02.620 --> 13:04.537
I can't just bust him.
I owe him more than that.

13:04.622 --> 13:07.123
- You want to know my opinion?
- Yes! That's why I'm talking to you.

13:07.374 --> 13:09.876
Put this on the backburner
until Travis is in custody.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.503
You need to focus on DDK.

13:11.545 --> 13:13.546
I'm having dinner
with Matthews tonight.

13:14.048 --> 13:16.007
I can't just sit there
and talk about the salad.

13:16.175 --> 13:17.717
OK, so bring it up,

13:17.802 --> 13:20.637
but maybe Matthews has a reason
for what he did.

13:20.888 --> 13:22.222
Yeah, ass.

13:22.723 --> 13:25.058
No, I mean about leaving the scene.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.020
There are worse secrets
you can have, Deb.

13:30.898 --> 13:33.316
I'm just saying, maybe
you should keep an open mind.

13:33.901 --> 13:35.568
Yes, I get what you're saying.

13:40.074 --> 13:43.910
The hunt for Travis has hit a wall,
but maybe there's a way around it.

13:48.916 --> 13:54.671
Steve Dorsey, a.k.a. Doomsday Adam,
Travis' recently deceased acolyte.

13:55.422 --> 13:56.840
There might be something
in your history

13:56.924 --> 13:58.675
that can lead me to Travis.

13:58.759 --> 14:00.343
Or lead us to Travis,

14:00.427 --> 14:02.720
since anything I find,
I'll report to Deb.

14:04.056 --> 14:06.599
Unfortunately, Dorsey has led
a squeaky clean life.

14:10.437 --> 14:11.437
Mostly.

14:11.564 --> 14:14.858
He's a potential mass murderer with
eight outstanding parking tickets.

14:22.283 --> 14:24.284
Hey, any update?

14:24.451 --> 14:25.785
No, nothing yet,

14:25.911 --> 14:28.246
but search teams
are expanding the perimeter.

14:28.289 --> 14:31.958
Which means Travis Marshall
most likely got away.

14:32.084 --> 14:34.794
- We don't know that.
- I'm not trying to be critical,

14:34.879 --> 14:36.462
I'm just trying to get
a lay of the land.

14:36.547 --> 14:39.299
Homeland Security
will be here within the hour.

14:39.550 --> 14:40.633
They'll need an update,

14:40.759 --> 14:43.928
and they've requested
all relevant materials on DDK.

14:43.971 --> 14:46.556
Which means Travis probably isn't
the only thing I've lost today.

14:48.434 --> 14:51.561
However it shakes out,
we'll handle it.

14:57.776 --> 15:00.153
- Excuse me, Lieutenant?
- What is it?

15:00.279 --> 15:03.489
There's a woman here who says she has
important information about DDK.

15:04.241 --> 15:05.283
Which is?

15:05.326 --> 15:06.743
She insists on speaking
to you personally.

15:06.827 --> 15:09.078
She says it has to do
with something called wormwood.

15:10.831 --> 15:12.749
- Wormwood?
- Yeah.

15:14.251 --> 15:16.002
How the fuck
would she know about that?

15:16.170 --> 15:18.004
- Send her in.
- Yes, ma'am.

15:28.015 --> 15:30.016
What did stalkers do
before the Internet?

15:58.045 --> 15:59.045
Is this wormwood?

16:01.048 --> 16:02.548
Thank you, again, for coming.

16:06.053 --> 16:07.136
Get everyone out of here!

16:11.725 --> 16:14.352
Evacuate the building! Go! Now!

16:35.749 --> 16:37.542
Dex, she's gone. Let's go.

16:40.004 --> 16:41.337
I'll give you everything you need.

16:41.422 --> 16:44.590
I just need to go check on my brother.
I'll be right back, OK?

16:49.930 --> 16:51.472
Homeland Security?

16:51.724 --> 16:54.600
Yeah, you were right.
They want everything we have on DDK.

16:54.643 --> 16:56.769
It'll slow us down to a crawl.
Is he all right?

16:56.979 --> 16:58.062
I'm fine.

16:58.105 --> 16:59.439
I love you,
but I wasn't talking to you.

16:59.898 --> 17:02.650
I mean, he was lucky.
The exposure was very mild.

17:02.776 --> 17:05.486
But this gas attacks
the upper respiratory tract.

17:05.612 --> 17:08.614
You could get nosebleeds
followed by extreme dizziness,

17:08.741 --> 17:10.616
especially after physical exertion.

17:10.659 --> 17:12.910
- You need to get to the hospital.
- Got it.

17:14.413 --> 17:16.497
- You gonna go to the ER?
- On my honour.

17:16.915 --> 17:18.666
Stop with the sarcastic bullshit,
all right?

17:18.792 --> 17:21.294
No bullshit, I will. Really.

17:22.004 --> 17:23.129
OK.

17:24.923 --> 17:27.633
How did you know
that crazy bitch was a threat?

17:29.011 --> 17:30.303
Just luck, I guess.

17:31.263 --> 17:32.680
Fuck luck, I'll take you.

17:34.641 --> 17:39.437
Dex, you saved a lot of lives today.
You saved my life.

17:41.982 --> 17:43.983
I'd never let anything happen to you.

17:46.945 --> 17:47.987
Come here.

18:04.171 --> 18:06.631
It's just for a little while, OK?

18:06.673 --> 18:10.009
Daddy's gonna miss you
every second of those 48 hours.

18:12.721 --> 18:16.349
If Travis can attack Miami Metro,
he can find his way to me.

18:16.475 --> 18:17.683
I can't take that risk.

18:18.477 --> 18:20.311
I've always known
something could happen to me,

18:20.354 --> 18:23.022
but now it's more than my life
I have to worry about.

18:25.025 --> 18:26.859
Hey, thanks for coming back.

18:29.029 --> 18:30.655
I knew I shouldn't have left.

18:31.198 --> 18:34.909
Sorry to ruin your date
and your weekend.

18:35.035 --> 18:36.536
It's OK.

18:36.662 --> 18:39.205
It's not every day
your boss becomes a bona fide hero.

18:39.540 --> 18:42.083
Yeah, well,
I'm not feeling too heroic right now.

18:42.209 --> 18:45.378
I'm starting to feel the side effects
that that doctor was talking about.

18:46.213 --> 18:48.005
I realised
I'm probably not best person

18:48.048 --> 18:49.841
to be in charge of this little guy.

18:49.883 --> 18:52.385
Well, it's no problem.
You just get some rest.

18:52.594 --> 18:54.387
I'll keep him out of your hair.

18:54.429 --> 18:58.182
Better idea, I booked you guys a room
at The Ritz, in Coconut Grove.

18:58.225 --> 18:59.392
Sweet!

19:00.227 --> 19:01.352
Have you picked your animal yet?

19:03.355 --> 19:04.689
Must've slipped my mind.

19:04.731 --> 19:07.275
At the pageant,
every child is paired with a parent

19:07.401 --> 19:09.068
to bring
the story of Noah's Ark to life.

19:10.237 --> 19:12.738
I think Harrison's a little scared
of the whole thing.

19:14.449 --> 19:18.119
Don't worry, buddy.
Daddy will be there. I promise.

19:18.245 --> 19:20.121
And you should pick
one of the good animals soon,

19:20.247 --> 19:22.915
or you'll end up being
rats or turtles or something.

19:26.420 --> 19:27.545
King of the beasts.

19:28.088 --> 19:29.922
Something feels right about that.

19:37.264 --> 19:39.765
Travis has one tableau left,

19:39.892 --> 19:42.435
who knows how many people
he'll try to kill next.

19:43.395 --> 19:47.231
And he might go after Debra again,
just like he did with Holly.

19:47.983 --> 19:50.943
So you're changing your plan
about working with Miami Metro?

19:51.445 --> 19:54.280
Miami Metro has been sidelined
by Homeland Security.

19:54.406 --> 19:57.950
It's time for my dark passenger
to take the wheel again.

20:00.287 --> 20:01.954
According to the seven keys,

20:02.080 --> 20:04.790
the next tableau will be
the lake of fire.

20:06.835 --> 20:09.670
"And Satan, who is the beast,

20:10.464 --> 20:15.134
"was thrown into the lake of fire,
which is the second death."

20:15.177 --> 20:20.348
It says, the beast gathers the kings
of the Earth and their armies,

20:20.474 --> 20:22.975
to prepare for war against God.

20:23.644 --> 20:26.479
And he's responsible
for killing the two witnesses.

20:34.696 --> 20:35.780
Gosh...

20:43.997 --> 20:46.040
You really should have
gone to the ER, Dex.

20:46.833 --> 20:48.960
I don't have time.
I have to find Travis.

20:49.044 --> 20:52.004
You have no leads.
He could be anywhere.

20:56.635 --> 21:01.555
It's time for a Hail Mary.
I'm gonna make Travis come to me.

21:03.850 --> 21:07.520
Maybe it takes a beast
to catch a beast.

21:11.191 --> 21:12.400
That's for you.

21:15.696 --> 21:17.697
Pick up an OpenX today, and never...

21:17.739 --> 21:18.948
You don't need help operating...

21:19.366 --> 21:21.909
I'm standing outside
the Miami Metro headquarters,

21:22.035 --> 21:24.954
where earlier today,
a local woman, Beth Dorsey,

21:25.038 --> 21:28.582
attempted a poison gas assault
on the station's Homicide Department.

21:28.709 --> 21:31.919
Channel 9 has learnt no officers
were hurt in the brazen attack.

21:32.045 --> 21:34.088
The only casualty was Miss Dorsey.

21:42.055 --> 21:45.308
It's OK. It's... It's OK.

21:45.392 --> 21:47.393
It's gonna be OK.

21:50.564 --> 21:52.315
Her sacrifice will be enough.

21:54.568 --> 21:56.235
It must be what God wanted.

22:01.742 --> 22:03.242
It's up to me now.

22:05.912 --> 22:08.581
My time has come.
I must pass the test.

22:35.609 --> 22:37.943
Half the stuff on here
costs more than my rent.

22:39.279 --> 22:40.321
My treat.

22:40.947 --> 22:44.617
For a job well done
despite some enormous challenges.

22:45.327 --> 22:46.535
Yeah, it would be a lot easier

22:46.620 --> 22:48.537
if Homeland Security
wasn't breathing down my neck.

22:48.622 --> 22:50.456
Well, just don't let them
become a distraction.

22:50.540 --> 22:53.709
I know only too well how easy it is
to get bogged down in your job.

22:58.673 --> 23:01.300
That call girl from the hotel

23:01.343 --> 23:03.636
is a perfect example
of what I'm talking about.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.223
I think I'm gonna have the duck.

23:08.809 --> 23:11.644
I have to admit, I was a bit puzzled

23:11.728 --> 23:13.354
when I heard
you were still looking into that.

23:13.647 --> 23:15.231
What kind of wine goes with that?

23:16.817 --> 23:18.734
You know,
some cases are better left alone...

23:18.819 --> 23:19.860
Fuck.

23:21.029 --> 23:22.405
I can't do this.

23:24.324 --> 23:27.201
- I know you were one of her clients.
- Excuse me?

23:27.411 --> 23:28.828
Jessica Morris.

23:29.830 --> 23:31.330
I found a card for flowers

23:31.373 --> 23:35.167
sent to her the morning that she died,
from Thomas Matthews.

23:37.879 --> 23:40.423
Were you the one in her hotel room
the night she died?

23:43.844 --> 23:47.680
White.
You should order the white wine.

23:47.889 --> 23:49.056
Sir...

23:52.060 --> 23:53.436
You can talk to me.

23:58.066 --> 24:00.192
You don't know what it's like, Debra.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.613
Since Maggie died...

24:07.617 --> 24:09.535
I've been alone for a very long time.

24:15.459 --> 24:18.210
I went to the hotel. We...

24:20.380 --> 24:23.048
And when I came back into the bedroom,

24:24.050 --> 24:26.093
I found her lying on the floor.

24:28.597 --> 24:30.473
I saw the drugs.

24:32.893 --> 24:34.477
I tried to revive her,

24:36.229 --> 24:37.563
but...

24:40.442 --> 24:45.404
she just wouldn't breathe.

24:46.656 --> 24:48.449
911 wouldn't have helped.

24:48.909 --> 24:50.409
She was dead.

24:52.913 --> 24:55.080
And I couldn't change what happened.

25:01.421 --> 25:02.922
So...

25:04.758 --> 25:06.425
What do you intend to do?

25:11.264 --> 25:12.598
I don't know.

25:14.768 --> 25:17.478
Debra, I've known you
since the day you were born.

25:19.147 --> 25:21.607
You cried in my arms
the night your father died.

25:21.858 --> 25:26.612
I've always looked out for you,
and I made you lieutenant,

25:26.655 --> 25:28.656
and now I'm the one
who needs a favour.

25:31.117 --> 25:32.701
I want to help you,

25:34.538 --> 25:36.038
but what do I tell that girl's father?

25:36.623 --> 25:38.541
You tell him you found nothing.

25:39.793 --> 25:43.504
She overdosed.
No one needs to know any more.

25:45.549 --> 25:46.840
It's not gonna help anyone.

25:48.969 --> 25:50.803
It'll only hurt me.

25:55.976 --> 25:58.477
I'll call Mr Morris in the morning.

26:02.566 --> 26:03.732
Good.

26:10.907 --> 26:11.991
Jeez.

26:12.158 --> 26:13.826
You sure it's safe to be here?

26:13.868 --> 26:16.662
Relax, sidekick.
Hazmat gave brass the all-clear.

26:16.746 --> 26:18.330
I think I prefer "intern".

26:18.999 --> 26:20.541
Bukkakee, bukkake.

26:20.709 --> 26:23.919
The point is, me as boss needs you
in Evidence for the next few days.

26:24.337 --> 26:26.589
We're suffering
from a serious case of backlog.

26:26.673 --> 26:28.007
I'm on it.

26:28.174 --> 26:30.175
Whoa, Amazon, 9 o'clock.

26:30.927 --> 26:33.178
OK, everyone, listen up.

26:33.221 --> 26:36.015
This is agent Hubbard
from Homeland Security.

26:36.099 --> 26:38.183
They'll be taking over
our DDK investigation.

26:38.852 --> 26:39.852
Temporarily.

26:39.936 --> 26:43.355
Until my team and I can assess
all known associates of the Dorseys.

26:43.398 --> 26:44.857
So what,
we're just supposed to sit on our ass

26:44.941 --> 26:46.692
for the next four days
until the world ends?

26:46.735 --> 26:47.860
You want to take that one?

26:48.862 --> 26:50.738
I understand your frustration,

26:50.864 --> 26:53.073
but this police station
came under a gas attack yesterday.

26:53.199 --> 26:56.243
In the government's eyes, that poses
a potential on-going terrorist threat.

26:56.369 --> 26:59.204
Steve and Beth Dorsey
weren't terrorists.

26:59.539 --> 27:01.749
They were nut-jobs
following a bigger nut-job.

27:02.042 --> 27:04.209
Let me and my team
be the judge of that.

27:04.252 --> 27:07.421
I promise, this will go faster
if everyone cooperates.

27:07.547 --> 27:09.757
They all hate this.
Can't say that I blame them.

27:09.883 --> 27:12.217
Please make yourself available
for interviews.

27:12.260 --> 27:13.594
I'd like to start
with Sergeant Batista,

27:13.720 --> 27:16.138
since he was the last one
in contact with the suspects.

27:16.222 --> 27:17.264
Can I set up in your office?

27:19.100 --> 27:20.142
Right this way.

27:24.064 --> 27:25.648
This whole thing's fucking bullshit.

27:26.733 --> 27:30.903
They have one hand tied behind
their backs, but I don't.

27:30.945 --> 27:32.571
Not when I have Gellar's.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.120
- Hey.
- Not a good time, Quinn.

27:40.246 --> 27:43.415
Yeah, I know you got that interview,
but this'll just take a sec.

27:44.918 --> 27:46.085
Not now.

27:46.628 --> 27:49.546
Look, I'm so, so sorry.

27:50.423 --> 27:53.217
Look, you saved my life,

27:53.259 --> 27:54.760
and for that
I will always be grateful.

27:55.929 --> 27:57.888
But this is a job of trust.

28:00.100 --> 28:02.434
And I can't have
a partner I can't trust.

28:08.233 --> 28:11.443
You've been talking a lot
about your department this morning,

28:11.486 --> 28:13.112
but how are you doing
since the attack?

28:15.156 --> 28:16.281
I'm fine.

28:17.617 --> 28:19.576
Pretty much, I mean...

28:21.663 --> 28:24.123
I'm worried about Dexter.
He wouldn't go to the hospital.

28:24.165 --> 28:25.791
He keeps saying he's OK.

28:26.126 --> 28:28.127
You must be very proud of him.

28:28.837 --> 28:30.796
He saved everyone's life.

28:32.090 --> 28:33.632
Including mine.

28:37.595 --> 28:39.263
It all happened so fast, you know?

28:39.305 --> 28:41.306
If that canister
had gone off any sooner...

28:44.477 --> 28:47.354
Your brother holds a very
important place in your life.

28:48.940 --> 28:50.649
He's really all I have.

28:53.486 --> 28:55.779
You think I'm crazy now,

28:56.448 --> 28:57.489
I can't even imagine

28:57.532 --> 28:59.658
what a fucking mess my life would be
without him.

28:59.993 --> 29:01.326
I don't think you're crazy.

29:01.995 --> 29:03.495
Can I get that in writing?

29:04.706 --> 29:09.168
From what I do know about you,
you feel things very deeply.

29:09.961 --> 29:11.170
Like your bond with Dexter.

29:11.713 --> 29:13.213
Where do you think that stems from?

29:15.175 --> 29:18.719
Maybe because
he's the only guy in my life

29:18.845 --> 29:22.347
that I haven't dumped, or cheated on,
or...

29:23.516 --> 29:24.558
...isn't dead.

29:24.684 --> 29:26.977
Is it possible
that your feelings for Dexter

29:27.020 --> 29:29.146
are the reason that
you've chosen men in the past

29:29.189 --> 29:33.859
who have been
either inappropriate or unavailable?

29:34.652 --> 29:37.654
Because they're what? Not Dexter?

29:41.534 --> 29:42.701
That's insane.

29:43.036 --> 29:44.077
Is it?

29:47.874 --> 29:48.874
He's my brother.

29:49.042 --> 29:51.043
Yet you're not biologically related.

29:55.381 --> 29:58.550
- So?
- It would be understandable,

29:58.676 --> 30:01.720
given the past traumas
the two of you have shared,

30:01.763 --> 30:05.349
for you to develop
complex feelings for him.

30:06.893 --> 30:09.394
Why the fuck are we
even talking about this?

30:10.438 --> 30:11.730
You mentioned Dexter.

30:12.565 --> 30:15.776
He comes up in these sessions a lot.
Aren't you curious as to why that is?

30:15.902 --> 30:18.403
He's a huge part of my life.

30:18.696 --> 30:19.863
That's it.

30:20.740 --> 30:21.949
End of story.

30:22.075 --> 30:23.075
You getting upset?

30:23.201 --> 30:24.868
Fuck, yes, I'm becoming upset,

30:24.911 --> 30:27.079
because you're making it sound like
I want to...

30:29.415 --> 30:31.416
...be with him or something.

30:32.418 --> 30:33.627
Well, do you?

30:45.431 --> 30:46.932
Look...

30:48.810 --> 30:50.435
I love my brother,

30:52.480 --> 30:55.065
but I am sure as shit
not in love with my brother,

30:55.108 --> 30:56.608
if that's what you're getting at.

30:59.821 --> 31:01.113
We're done here.

31:02.740 --> 31:06.118
Travis got everyone's attention
by staging his tableaus.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.787
It's time I got his
by staging one of my own.

31:10.915 --> 31:15.168
I stashed Gellar's hand in the morgue,
now I need it back.

31:16.170 --> 31:17.254
Hey, Dexter!

31:17.922 --> 31:19.631
I was looking for you in your lab.

31:20.008 --> 31:21.091
Heading home.

31:23.928 --> 31:25.345
Looks like you got a minute.

31:26.472 --> 31:28.265
Haven't we done this before?

31:29.267 --> 31:32.019
I just wanted to thank you

31:32.145 --> 31:35.355
for being so honest with me
the other day about my video game.

31:35.982 --> 31:37.107
Glad I could help.

31:37.150 --> 31:39.526
You just made me realise that
I have spent my whole life

31:39.652 --> 31:41.945
on the sidelines,
playing make-believe games,

31:41.988 --> 31:45.824
and now I want to get out there
and make my life count for something.

31:45.950 --> 31:48.035
- OK, I really should...
- Yeah, go. Go.

31:49.329 --> 31:52.039
All right.
I hope you're feeling better.

33:01.150 --> 33:04.987
I have no idea where Travis is hiding
or what he's up to.

33:18.501 --> 33:21.003
The lake of fire is his next tableau,

33:21.087 --> 33:25.257
but mine doesn't require a name,
just the right message.

33:38.563 --> 33:41.732
And the best way to get Travis
to pay attention to that message

33:41.774 --> 33:43.525
is if it comes from me.

33:44.193 --> 33:45.610
Sorry about this.

34:03.546 --> 34:05.380
The hand is bad.

34:05.882 --> 34:08.633
I've had my tongue in places
that smelled better.

34:08.718 --> 34:11.762
It was on ice for three years
along with the rest of Gellar.

34:11.804 --> 34:15.599
Decomposition will accelerate faster
the longer it's in the sun.

34:15.641 --> 34:18.894
Looks like the cut was made just above
the palmar carpal ligament.

34:19.562 --> 34:22.606
666, the sign of the beast.
What's up with that?

34:22.982 --> 34:24.316
Travis will know.

34:24.400 --> 34:28.278
- What do we know?
- Street cleaner called it in.

34:28.321 --> 34:29.988
I checked security footage.

34:30.114 --> 34:32.324
If Travis and Gellar did this,
they were out of view.

34:32.408 --> 34:33.909
Well, Travis worked in the museum,

34:33.993 --> 34:35.660
so he would know
every inch of the square.

34:36.245 --> 34:38.163
- Hey, guys.
- What is it?

34:40.625 --> 34:42.334
All right, cue the music,
hold the applause.

34:42.418 --> 34:43.794
Shoot him.

34:43.836 --> 34:45.295
The hand belongs to Gellar.

34:45.630 --> 34:46.922
What?

34:47.507 --> 34:49.174
It's a positive match.

34:49.300 --> 34:51.343
Why the fuck would Gellar
cut off his own hand?

34:51.469 --> 34:53.512
Well, the cut looks
to have been made post-mortem.

34:53.596 --> 34:55.263
Gellar's most likely dead.

34:55.848 --> 34:58.600
So student offs professor? Why?

34:58.684 --> 35:00.644
Good way to get rid of an accomplice.

35:00.853 --> 35:04.439
- I mean, look at Steve Dorsey.
- Travis is a psycho.

35:04.524 --> 35:07.526
He may not even be sticking
to the Enesserette game plan,

35:09.112 --> 35:12.697
cos if this is supposed to be
the lake of fire, I don't get it.

35:14.033 --> 35:17.035
Let's have the unis sweep the area,
maybe we can turn up Gellar's body.

35:17.870 --> 35:19.496
It might lead us to Travis.

35:20.123 --> 35:23.041
Not likely.
I left Gellar in pieces in the swamp.

35:29.507 --> 35:30.549
Right on time.

35:30.716 --> 35:32.884
My tableau should send Travis
right to me.

35:37.682 --> 35:39.724
Now he just needs to know where to go.

35:39.892 --> 35:41.143
...if they have any leads at all.

35:41.227 --> 35:43.562
And now we go to Museum Square
for this breaking news.

35:43.646 --> 35:45.063
Authorities are still baffled

35:45.189 --> 35:48.733
by what appears to be yet another
bizarre end of days tableau

35:48.860 --> 35:50.152
plaguing the city of Miami.

35:50.653 --> 35:53.155
We warn you,
these images are very graphic.

35:53.239 --> 35:55.407
Investigators made
a gruesome discovery

35:55.491 --> 35:57.409
early this morning in Museum Square.

35:57.660 --> 36:00.745
Blood covered the angel statue
in the square's fountain,

36:00.830 --> 36:03.498
and also contaminated
the fountain's water.

36:03.583 --> 36:06.209
A human hand was found
nailed to the angel's chest.

36:06.502 --> 36:08.712
On the forehead, the numbers 666...

36:08.754 --> 36:10.755
- The beast.
...were also written in blood.

36:10.840 --> 36:14.092
Channel 9 has learnt that the hand
depicted in these startling images

36:14.218 --> 36:17.262
may in fact belong to
one of the suspected Doomsday Killers,

36:17.388 --> 36:18.555
Professor James Gellar.

36:19.098 --> 36:22.392
No. No. No!

36:27.106 --> 36:30.066
Mark this day, witness.

36:30.109 --> 36:32.527
The end is not upon the world,
it's upon you.

36:33.446 --> 36:36.281
You know who I am. You know what I am.

36:37.575 --> 36:40.911
The beast is coming for you.

36:45.041 --> 36:46.791
"Slice of Life."

37:34.257 --> 37:35.298
Close the door.

37:37.927 --> 37:41.346
- Everything...
- God damn it, Debra.

37:41.430 --> 37:43.974
I thought we had an understanding.

37:44.058 --> 37:46.810
- I'm a little confused here.
- Don't get cute.

37:46.894 --> 37:50.313
Chief Lane has somehow come
to learn about my indiscretions.

37:51.023 --> 37:52.440
He's asking me to retire!

37:53.859 --> 37:57.320
Is this how you repay me
after all I've done for you?

37:57.405 --> 37:59.364
I was at a crime scene all day.
I haven't talked to anyone.

37:59.448 --> 38:00.824
It doesn't matter.

38:00.866 --> 38:02.993
You just wouldn't let this thing go!

38:08.958 --> 38:11.209
Your father would be so disappointed.

38:14.880 --> 38:15.880
So would your late wife.

38:19.010 --> 38:21.553
All due respect,
I didn't do anything wrong here.

38:21.637 --> 38:23.179
No?

38:24.056 --> 38:27.058
What you did was screw over
the only person that can protect you

38:27.143 --> 38:30.145
from a job
that you are clearly not ready for.

38:33.399 --> 38:34.691
Good luck.

38:36.193 --> 38:37.527
You're gonna need it.

38:46.579 --> 38:48.163
You wanted to see us?

38:51.042 --> 38:54.753
- Is everything OK?
- Agent Hubbard just called.

38:55.588 --> 38:57.005
Homeland Security has concluded

38:57.089 --> 38:59.090
that the Dorseys
have no ties to terrorists.

38:59.425 --> 39:00.759
No shit.

39:01.260 --> 39:03.261
They want to be kept in the loop,
as does the FBI,

39:03.346 --> 39:05.597
- but we're back in control.
- That's good news.

39:05.765 --> 39:07.599
It would be
if I hadn't just read your reports

39:07.683 --> 39:09.601
on what happened
at Steve Dorsey's apartment.

39:11.604 --> 39:13.271
What the fuck?

39:14.023 --> 39:15.774
Seriously, I should
write both of you up.

39:15.858 --> 39:17.067
That was all my fault, Deb.

39:17.610 --> 39:18.860
It's Lieutenant.

39:19.445 --> 39:20.779
And I got that.

39:24.033 --> 39:27.118
You guys, we have two fucking days
to catch Travis Marshall

39:27.203 --> 39:30.205
before he does God knows what
in something called the lake of fire.

39:31.082 --> 39:33.083
We just got this case back.

39:33.125 --> 39:34.918
I cannot afford
to have this department

39:34.960 --> 39:37.295
falling down around me right now, OK?

39:38.130 --> 39:39.464
No more fuck-ups.

39:40.966 --> 39:43.301
We get Travis Marshall, you got it?

39:48.307 --> 39:51.309
I made sure the Slice of Life
was in the video I sent Travis.

39:51.435 --> 39:53.812
He'll be expecting
to find me on my boat.

39:55.398 --> 39:56.648
Not this one.

39:57.316 --> 40:01.486
The owners use it twice a year,
but I only need it once.

40:02.571 --> 40:04.572
For Travis' final tableau.

40:11.330 --> 40:12.497
Captain!

40:14.333 --> 40:15.667
Morgan.

40:15.751 --> 40:18.336
You going to pick out blinds
for Matthews' office?

40:18.421 --> 40:21.589
- You heard the news.
- From Matthews.

40:21.674 --> 40:22.966
Because he thought
that I ratted him out,

40:23.008 --> 40:24.592
but we both know that
it was you, right?

40:24.677 --> 40:27.137
Rumours do have a way of spreading.

40:27.596 --> 40:29.264
So Matthews comes to you
and asks for help,

40:29.348 --> 40:30.515
and you go along with it,

40:30.599 --> 40:32.684
until Jessica Morris' father shows up.

40:33.185 --> 40:34.352
Now, is that about the time
that you realised

40:34.478 --> 40:35.770
you could stab him in the back?

40:36.522 --> 40:37.605
Interesting theory,

40:37.690 --> 40:40.942
but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

40:41.026 --> 40:44.863
Fucking used me to take him out
and help yourself.

40:44.989 --> 40:47.282
Don't be so naive, Morgan.

40:48.451 --> 40:49.951
This is how the game is played.

40:50.035 --> 40:53.037
Did you really think that
Matthews made you lieutenant

40:53.122 --> 40:54.164
because you were ready?

40:54.373 --> 40:56.541
It was all politics to get back at me.

40:57.710 --> 40:59.377
And that was his last mistake.

41:00.963 --> 41:02.380
How do you sleep?

41:03.799 --> 41:08.678
Very well, knowing that from now on,
you'll do what I say when I say it,

41:08.721 --> 41:10.555
or I'll find a lieutenant who will.

41:17.229 --> 41:19.898
So LaGuerta's going on and on, and...

41:21.192 --> 41:23.234
I'm dying inside.

41:23.861 --> 41:26.404
And all of the sudden,
I have one of those...

41:27.490 --> 41:29.824
those moments where
everything sort of comes together.

41:29.909 --> 41:32.911
- An epiphany.
- Exactly.

41:34.747 --> 41:39.709
And I realise that I have completely
fucked myself into a corner.

41:41.045 --> 41:42.837
What would you have done differently?

41:43.547 --> 41:45.381
Ignored a grieving father?

41:46.050 --> 41:48.259
Kept a case closed
that didn't sit right with you?

41:49.386 --> 41:52.430
No. And fuck no.

42:02.191 --> 42:04.275
And I was trying
to give you a compliment.

42:04.944 --> 42:06.277
You've grown so much.

42:06.403 --> 42:08.029
You made the best
out of a bad situation,

42:08.113 --> 42:09.113
because now you see...

42:11.283 --> 42:13.284
Everything isn't always
so black and white.

42:18.374 --> 42:19.791
Did you try the noodles?

42:27.132 --> 42:30.093
You have always blown at that.

42:33.973 --> 42:35.807
And you're so good? Show me.

42:38.310 --> 42:40.144
It's this finger, dumbass.

42:43.566 --> 42:45.567
- Like this?
- Yeah.

42:46.402 --> 42:47.819
Your hand's shaking, what is it?

42:51.782 --> 42:52.949
This.

42:57.746 --> 43:00.123
One minute, everything's perfect.

43:03.168 --> 43:05.003
And the next minute...

43:07.798 --> 43:09.340
The next minute what?

43:09.925 --> 43:11.467
You're rushing off.

43:13.178 --> 43:14.512
Deb...

43:16.932 --> 43:19.017
I am always with you.

43:27.693 --> 43:28.943
Right here.

43:34.199 --> 43:35.658
Oh, fuck.

43:54.553 --> 43:55.678
It worked.

44:04.980 --> 44:06.898
Oh, no. Not now.

45:02.621 --> 45:05.415
You didn't really think
you could foil God's plan, did you?

45:10.129 --> 45:12.213
This was how
it was always meant to be.

45:13.090 --> 45:16.551
I will wait on a pillar of light
for God's return.

45:18.721 --> 45:20.972
And you'll burn in eternal hellfire.

45:24.893 --> 45:26.310
It is finished.

46:23.202 --> 46:25.828
I thought
I was headed in the right direction.

46:25.871 --> 46:28.539
My dark passenger
back behind the wheel.

46:28.665 --> 46:31.667
But if I was so sure
I knew where I was going,

46:33.045 --> 46:35.213
how did I get so lost?
