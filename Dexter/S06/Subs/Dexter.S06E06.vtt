WEBVTT

00:09.305 --> 00:10.556
Previously on Dexter...

00:10.849 --> 00:12.766
Is this Doomsday number two?

00:13.059 --> 00:15.019
Travis Marshall.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.480
Professor Porter, you wouldn't
happen to know of any good spots

00:18.565 --> 00:20.315
where we could get a drink
this evening, would you?

00:20.400 --> 00:21.483
Maybe I do.

00:24.529 --> 00:27.156
These drawings, they were Gellar's?

00:28.950 --> 00:30.034
No!

00:31.036 --> 00:33.662
Seems Brother Sam's not a changed man
after all.

00:33.955 --> 00:35.414
Please get off the property.

00:35.498 --> 00:37.499
Not without our boy Nick.

00:37.584 --> 00:38.959
You deaf, pendejo?

00:45.091 --> 00:46.967
See how easy it is?

00:51.806 --> 00:53.474
Get out and start walking away.

00:55.643 --> 00:57.269
One way or another,
Travis will lead me

00:57.353 --> 00:59.480
to the one
who really deserves my table.

02:56.681 --> 03:00.100
Most people believe we have free will,

03:01.186 --> 03:04.104
that we all choose our path.

03:06.399 --> 03:08.650
Sometimes the path is clear.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.197
Sometimes, not so much.

03:17.410 --> 03:19.328
Every twist, every turn

03:19.412 --> 03:22.206
can challenge our sense of direction.

03:25.293 --> 03:28.045
But it's the choices we make
when we reach a fork in the road

03:28.129 --> 03:30.005
that define who we are.

03:35.595 --> 03:36.970
Deb, I'm kind of busy. Can...

03:37.055 --> 03:39.348
Dex, I'm sorry, I have bad news.

03:39.432 --> 03:40.891
It's Brother Sam. He's been shot,

03:40.975 --> 03:42.476
- at his garage.
- What?

03:42.852 --> 03:45.312
EMTs are working on him now.
I'm on my way there.

03:46.022 --> 03:47.773
- I'll meet you there.
- No, wait...

03:50.109 --> 03:51.526
Shit.

03:55.240 --> 03:59.034
I think this will be
sufficiently tawdry for our purposes.

03:59.118 --> 04:00.619
Pay the woman.

04:01.246 --> 04:02.329
Ma'am.

04:13.508 --> 04:15.968
- We're almost ready.
- About the woman...

04:16.052 --> 04:17.219
She didn't die, did she?

04:17.303 --> 04:21.014
No, but her arm is badly broken.
I'd like to get her some painkillers.

04:21.099 --> 04:23.141
- No, Travis.
- But she's in agony.

04:23.268 --> 04:24.768
She's a whore.

04:24.852 --> 04:28.146
She's an unrepentant sinner.
She deserves what she's gonna get.

04:29.232 --> 04:31.024
Have you given her
her mark?

04:31.109 --> 04:32.526
No, not yet.

04:33.903 --> 04:35.779
What's wrong with you, Travis?

04:36.948 --> 04:39.074
- What do you mean?
- You're hesitating.

04:40.201 --> 04:43.328
You're slacking off.
You better get yourself together.

04:43.413 --> 04:46.290
You know what's at stake here.
We're the chosen ones.

04:46.374 --> 04:47.833
We're the two witnesses.

04:47.917 --> 04:49.710
But what if it's wrong?

04:49.794 --> 04:51.420
What we're doing,
hurting these people...

04:51.504 --> 04:53.213
God can be wrong?

04:53.965 --> 04:55.966
I don't think so.

04:58.011 --> 04:59.428
Do what you're told to do, Travis,

04:59.512 --> 05:02.931
or you're gonna be destroyed
along with the rest of the scum.

05:15.695 --> 05:17.696
It's bad.
There are three entrance wounds,

05:17.780 --> 05:19.114
two in the chest, one in the back.

05:19.198 --> 05:20.741
No exit wounds.

05:21.034 --> 05:23.327
Bullets bounced around,
really tore him up.

05:24.912 --> 05:28.040
Whoever did this to Brother Sam
doesn't deserve to live.

05:28.875 --> 05:30.125
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

05:30.209 --> 05:31.293
My job.

05:31.377 --> 05:32.627
I'm sorry, Dex,
I can't let you do that.

05:32.712 --> 05:34.046
You and Sam are friends.

05:34.130 --> 05:36.465
Deb, I'm fine. Really.

05:36.549 --> 05:38.425
The last thing you need
is another unsolved case.

05:38.509 --> 05:39.551
You need my help.

05:39.635 --> 05:40.844
I need to do this.

05:46.684 --> 05:48.268
Hey, hey!

05:48.353 --> 05:51.021
Somebody get this dog out of here.

05:51.564 --> 05:53.482
- I got him.
- What do we have?

05:53.566 --> 05:55.192
Register's clean.

05:55.276 --> 05:56.651
Looks like a robbery gone bad.

05:56.736 --> 05:59.321
Or Julio's gang finally
got even with Brother Sam

05:59.405 --> 06:00.989
for stealing Nick away.

06:01.074 --> 06:03.408
- I suppose it's too much to hope...
- It is.

06:03.493 --> 06:04.910
DVD's missing.

06:04.994 --> 06:06.995
Whatever happened to stupid criminals?

06:07.080 --> 06:08.830
They're still stupid.

06:08.915 --> 06:10.415
We'll catch this piece of shit.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.626
The likely shooter
is Julio's replacement.

06:12.710 --> 06:14.461
Taking out Brother Sam
would be a good way

06:14.545 --> 06:16.129
to boost his cred as shot caller.

06:16.297 --> 06:19.174
See, Louis, the art of dusting

06:19.258 --> 06:22.844
lies in the caressing
of the powder over the print,

06:22.929 --> 06:24.971
so as not to corrupt it,

06:25.056 --> 06:28.141
as if one was trying to
get a nipple erect.

06:28.559 --> 06:30.060
Like this.

06:30.603 --> 06:31.937
What's the blood telling you?

06:33.231 --> 06:36.149
The spray pattern suggests
the shooter stood here.

06:36.234 --> 06:38.193
Bang, bang.

06:40.238 --> 06:45.075
Victim stumbled to the car
and fell here.

06:45.243 --> 06:48.161
Frothy blood suggests
a tracheal haemorrhage

06:48.246 --> 06:51.873
and that the victim fell to his knees,

06:52.625 --> 06:56.211
but the drainage
from the interior wounds

06:56.295 --> 06:59.840
is pooled, not smeared,
so he must have rolled to his side,

06:59.924 --> 07:04.344
and the shooter steps forward
for the kill shot.

07:04.637 --> 07:06.263
Bang.

07:06.347 --> 07:07.639
Victim rolls to his back.

07:07.890 --> 07:09.057
That's how we found him.

07:11.227 --> 07:14.354
The awkward position of the body
causes the bullet to miss the heart.

07:14.439 --> 07:16.898
It's probably the only reason
he's still alive.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.443
Guy's a fucking rock star.

07:19.527 --> 07:22.446
Hey, this is Miami fucking Metro.
We're all fucking rock stars.

07:25.616 --> 07:27.200
Harrison seemed
a little off this morning.

07:27.285 --> 07:28.827
Is it all right
if I check in with Jamie?

07:28.911 --> 07:30.120
Sure.

07:31.831 --> 07:33.832
The night Julio and his crew
came for Nick,

07:33.916 --> 07:36.251
I hit one of them with a baseball bat.

07:36.335 --> 07:38.879
He seemed like Julio's number two,

07:38.963 --> 07:41.047
which could mean he's now number one.

07:44.677 --> 07:46.136
Blood.

07:46.220 --> 07:48.305
If he's in the system,
I'll have a name.

08:05.865 --> 08:07.365
We have a match.

08:07.450 --> 08:09.034
Leo Hernandez.

08:14.207 --> 08:15.373
Two felony arrests,

08:15.458 --> 08:18.293
as well as one for
failure to pay child support.

08:18.377 --> 08:21.087
What are the odds
you're at your last known address?

08:30.515 --> 08:31.556
Hello?

08:31.641 --> 08:33.725
Yes, hello, I'm calling
for Leo Hernandez.

08:33.809 --> 08:34.976
Who is this?

08:35.061 --> 08:36.728
The Department of Social Services.

08:41.484 --> 08:43.652
Lieutenant, I ran the prints
from the garage.

08:43.736 --> 08:45.195
I got 12 hits on AFIS.

08:45.279 --> 08:46.780
All of them work for Brother Sam.

08:46.864 --> 08:49.074
Well, that really
fucking narrows it down.

08:49.158 --> 08:51.910
Maybe one of his ex-cons
got tired of working for a living.

08:52.328 --> 08:54.663
Yale, Soderquist,
I want statements and alibis

08:54.747 --> 08:55.997
from everyone on the garage payroll.

08:56.082 --> 08:59.000
Yeah, I'm sorry.
He sounds like a horrible baby daddy.

08:59.377 --> 09:01.378
You and your children deserve better.

09:01.462 --> 09:03.588
She hasn't seen Leo in over a year.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.006
Now what?

09:10.137 --> 09:12.514
Any news on Brother Sam's condition?

09:12.765 --> 09:14.599
Last I heard, he was still in surgery.

09:15.184 --> 09:16.643
Hey, I got something.

09:17.645 --> 09:20.021
Eighth Street Locos blame Brother Sam
for the disappearance

09:20.106 --> 09:21.898
of their shot caller, Julio Benes.

09:21.983 --> 09:23.149
I killed Julio.

09:23.234 --> 09:24.985
Is it possible this is my fault?

09:25.069 --> 09:27.445
And according to this report
filed two days ago,

09:27.530 --> 09:29.864
Brother Sam suspected the Locos
of shooting up his garage.

09:29.949 --> 09:32.367
So maybe his motive
was revenge and not robbery.

09:32.451 --> 09:34.369
Or revenge, then robbery.

09:34.453 --> 09:36.663
Hit the street. See if you can't
narrow it down to a triggerman.

09:36.747 --> 09:37.831
Got it.

09:38.291 --> 09:39.374
Deb, if it's OK,

09:39.458 --> 09:41.668
I'm gonna swing by the hospital
and check in on Brother Sam.

09:41.752 --> 09:42.836
Sure.

09:51.554 --> 09:53.013
Hey, what's up?

09:53.556 --> 09:57.350
Just getting some rocket fuel,
keep the engines burning.

09:57.435 --> 09:58.685
Me, too.

09:58.769 --> 10:00.103
Better get back to it.

10:01.689 --> 10:03.648
Relax, I didn't come over here
to crack the whip.

10:03.899 --> 10:07.027
I've just been going so hard lately,
I haven't had a chance to catch up.

10:07.236 --> 10:08.695
What's going on?

10:09.947 --> 10:11.448
- I'm good.
- Me, too.

10:14.994 --> 10:17.871
- Can we get back to work now?
- Yeah, fucking go.

10:27.465 --> 10:29.924
I'm taking a lot of heat on Doomsday.

10:30.009 --> 10:33.845
The commissioner, the mayor's office,
the media are all over me.

10:35.473 --> 10:36.931
Are we making any headway?

10:37.016 --> 10:40.769
Quinn and Batista are going through
our suspect Professor Gellar's boxes.

10:40.853 --> 10:42.020
I was about to get an update.

10:42.104 --> 10:44.064
Good, do that.

10:44.148 --> 10:46.483
And remember, you're lieutenant now,
not one of the gang.

10:46.734 --> 10:48.234
I'm realising that.

10:48.319 --> 10:50.111
OK, well, I'd like
a briefing later today.

10:51.322 --> 10:52.489
OK.

11:00.998 --> 11:03.583
If you're lying there
because of my dark passenger,

11:03.668 --> 11:07.712
I promise you,
my dark passenger will make amends.

11:17.348 --> 11:19.557
The Lord is my light and my salvation.

11:20.518 --> 11:21.851
Hey, Nick, how are you?

11:22.019 --> 11:23.687
Whom should I fear?

11:24.730 --> 11:26.773
The Lord is my life's refuge.

11:26.857 --> 11:28.775
Been trying to do good.

11:28.859 --> 11:30.985
How could this happen to Brother Sam?

11:32.113 --> 11:35.782
It's a hard question to answer.
I'd rather focus on who did it.

11:35.866 --> 11:39.994
One thing I ask of the Lord.
This I seek.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.999
Is Leo Hernandez
the new shot caller for the Locos?

11:47.294 --> 11:48.712
You here as a friend or a cop?

11:48.796 --> 11:52.674
I'm not a cop.
I'm a forensic analyst and a friend.

11:53.342 --> 11:56.386
And you and I both know
the Locos wanted Brother Sam dead.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.513
Where can I find him?

11:59.223 --> 12:00.348
I ain't no rat.

12:00.433 --> 12:03.685
If Leo shot Brother Sam,
he doesn't deserve your loyalty.

12:07.773 --> 12:11.609
Come on, Nick, if you don't tell me,
the cops are gonna drag it out of you.

12:11.694 --> 12:13.570
I'll keep your name out of it.
They won't.

12:17.658 --> 12:19.784
He stays over on St Andrews.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.077
The white house near Romaine.

12:21.162 --> 12:22.787
Brothers and sisters,
let us pray together

12:22.872 --> 12:24.622
for our friend Brother Sam.

12:24.707 --> 12:26.291
Please join hands.

12:27.460 --> 12:29.627
Please hear our prayer, Lord,

12:30.296 --> 12:32.213
as we gather in your name.

12:34.133 --> 12:36.092
Lord, we ask you
to heal our Brother Sam

12:36.177 --> 12:38.303
and bring him back to us,
because we need him.

12:38.637 --> 12:40.972
He's your shining light among us.

12:41.056 --> 12:43.016
He helps us see the way.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.642
- Amen.
- Amen.

12:45.728 --> 12:48.354
And now in the name of forgiveness,
let us say a silent prayer

12:48.439 --> 12:51.191
for the misguided sinner
who shot Brother Sam.

12:51.358 --> 12:52.609
Forget it.

12:55.446 --> 12:57.447
Anger won't bring him back.

12:57.531 --> 12:59.282
I'd rather prey on him.

13:01.494 --> 13:03.036
Here's where we are.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.997
Professor Gellar's former TA,
Carissa Porter...

13:06.081 --> 13:07.832
- The one you got the boxes from.
- Right.

13:07.917 --> 13:10.251
She told us that
Gellar was working on a theory

13:10.336 --> 13:12.712
about an early AD cult,
the Enesserette,

13:12.797 --> 13:14.714
who believed that
the Book of Revelations

13:14.799 --> 13:18.343
was not only a biblical prophecy,
but some kind of code

13:18.427 --> 13:20.011
to bring about the end of the world.

13:20.387 --> 13:21.554
I have no idea what that means.

13:21.639 --> 13:24.641
According to Gellar's papers,
he thought he had deciphered the code.

13:24.725 --> 13:27.936
Seven steps or keys,
each requiring a human sacrifice.

13:28.020 --> 13:32.232
We think that the Doomsday tableaus
are an enactment of these keys.

13:33.317 --> 13:34.359
Jesus.

13:35.402 --> 13:38.279
I thought this crazy fuck was trying
to warn us about the end of the world.

13:38.364 --> 13:39.739
You're telling me
he's trying to cause it?

13:39.824 --> 13:41.699
There's more. We found a clipping

13:41.784 --> 13:44.869
from a college newspaper
from a little over three years ago,

13:44.954 --> 13:48.498
and it says that Gellar did
an artistic installation on campus

13:48.582 --> 13:51.292
drawing attention to his work
on the Enesserette cult.

13:51.377 --> 13:53.294
It got him in hot water
with the university.

13:54.088 --> 13:55.880
The dead lamb represents sacrifice,

13:55.965 --> 13:58.633
the naked chick
represents sinfulness...

13:58.717 --> 14:00.802
It looks like a practise run
for his current work.

14:00.886 --> 14:02.011
If we could find that girl
in the photo,

14:02.096 --> 14:03.596
who knows what she could tell us?

14:04.181 --> 14:06.266
Is that marking on her lower back
part of the tableau?

14:06.350 --> 14:08.226
Not sure. We just found this
before you walked in.

14:08.269 --> 14:10.019
We haven't had a chance
to go over it in detail.

14:10.104 --> 14:12.105
- You got a magnifying glass?
- Yeah.

14:16.193 --> 14:17.735
Looks like a tattoo.

14:17.778 --> 14:19.946
One of those Hindu Om dealios.

14:21.282 --> 14:22.782
Wrong religion, sweetie.

14:25.786 --> 14:27.787
Good find, Deb.

14:28.205 --> 14:29.956
We'll take it from here.

14:30.082 --> 14:32.876
- Oh, I can help, if you want.
- No, no, no.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.752
You've got a lot on your plate, so...

14:34.795 --> 14:37.922
It's OK, Deb, we got this.
We'll get back to you.

14:48.475 --> 14:50.101
What?

14:50.644 --> 14:52.478
The chick in the photo
is Carissa Porter.

14:52.563 --> 14:54.772
What? Are you sure?

14:54.815 --> 14:56.900
The tat above her ass?

14:57.776 --> 14:59.986
- I was in the vicinity.
- Shit.

15:01.071 --> 15:02.655
She just became our key witness.

15:02.781 --> 15:04.616
I told you not to go home with her.
Didn't I tell you?

15:04.658 --> 15:05.909
Yes, you told me, Mom.

15:05.993 --> 15:07.619
The question is, what are
we gonna do about it now?

15:07.661 --> 15:09.662
Well, we gotta find out
what else Carissa Porter knows.

15:09.788 --> 15:11.748
That... That's fine.
But we can't let Deb know about this,

15:11.832 --> 15:13.625
cos that could make things
a lot harder for me.

15:13.667 --> 15:15.001
Lie to Deb? No way.

15:15.085 --> 15:16.836
Oh, so you're just gonna
turn your back on your partner?

15:16.921 --> 15:19.172
Oh, no, no, no.
Do not play the partner card.

15:19.256 --> 15:20.465
Of course I'm gonna play
the partner card.

15:20.507 --> 15:21.925
Why wouldn't I play the partner card?

15:22.009 --> 15:23.343
Situations like this are exactly why

15:23.427 --> 15:25.178
the partner card
is in the fucking deck!

15:26.180 --> 15:28.348
I'm really not liking you right now.

16:24.321 --> 16:25.863
Deb, you got a sec?

16:25.906 --> 16:27.240
What's up?

16:27.366 --> 16:29.409
Quinn and I have to go
to Tallahassee tomorrow

16:29.493 --> 16:31.327
to question Carissa Porter.

16:31.412 --> 16:32.495
I thought you already interviewed her.

16:32.579 --> 16:33.663
We did.

16:33.747 --> 16:35.581
We have reason to believe
that she's the naked woman

16:35.666 --> 16:36.833
in the newspaper photo.

16:36.917 --> 16:39.210
No shit. How'd you figure that out?

16:39.253 --> 16:40.753
Just meticulous police work.

16:42.089 --> 16:43.589
Fucking A.

16:43.674 --> 16:46.592
She's gotta be able to
help us get closer to Gellar.

16:46.677 --> 16:49.220
But I can't spare you guys
for a whole day. Have her come here.

16:49.930 --> 16:50.930
What?

16:52.057 --> 16:53.891
Bring her into the station.

16:55.394 --> 16:57.854
I don't know if she's gonna
go for that. She's a professor.

16:57.938 --> 17:01.065
- She's got classes to teach.
- Fuck her classes.

17:01.108 --> 17:04.569
She's a material witness
in a serial murder investigation.

17:04.611 --> 17:06.904
Tell her to get her Om-tattooed ass
into this station

17:06.947 --> 17:10.408
by tomorrow afternoon, or I'll have
her hauled in here in handcuffs.

17:12.786 --> 17:14.412
- Try it nicely first.
- Yeah.

17:20.961 --> 17:22.128
Fuck.

17:22.212 --> 17:24.297
What if Carissa says something
about our night together?

17:24.381 --> 17:27.216
I'll handle it.
You just stay the hell away from her.

18:02.836 --> 18:05.004
- Hi, Jamie.
- Hi.

18:09.593 --> 18:11.969
- Harrison go down easy?
- Totally.

18:12.012 --> 18:13.805
We went to the park this afternoon.

18:13.847 --> 18:16.349
So it was like one page
of Goodnight Moon,

18:16.433 --> 18:18.434
and then the sandman
dropped the whole bag on him.

18:19.311 --> 18:20.770
You know, you don't have to do that.

18:20.854 --> 18:23.523
Deb said she'd be by this weekend
to get the rest of her stuff.

18:23.649 --> 18:25.483
Oh, no, I'm happy to do it.

18:26.777 --> 18:28.194
There we go.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.988
All folded and packed
with very little hostility.

18:31.698 --> 18:33.533
Guess I'll hit the road.

18:47.548 --> 18:50.716
I heard about your friend,
Brother Sam.

18:51.135 --> 18:52.343
How's he doing?

18:52.803 --> 18:55.555
He's in a coma. It doesn't look good.

18:57.015 --> 18:58.808
I'm really sorry.

19:00.227 --> 19:01.519
He seemed like a really nice guy.

19:02.020 --> 19:04.647
Yeah, I didn't know him

19:04.731 --> 19:06.899
that well. It definitely sucks.

19:11.989 --> 19:13.906
Well, I'll see you in the morning.

19:14.867 --> 19:16.367
Good night. Thanks.

19:46.023 --> 19:48.608
Why is it so hard for you to admit?

19:48.734 --> 19:50.568
You care about Brother Sam.

19:51.945 --> 19:54.780
It doesn't make sense.
Who is he to me?

19:54.907 --> 19:57.116
A fellow traveller.

19:57.201 --> 19:59.785
He was a killer at one time.

20:00.204 --> 20:03.414
But he found a new path,
a path I could never take.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.751
It's because he's travelled both roads

20:06.793 --> 20:09.587
that he understands
the darkness in you

20:09.630 --> 20:11.297
and he sees the light.

20:12.424 --> 20:14.091
I wish I did.

20:15.552 --> 20:17.553
Maybe things
could have been different.

20:18.639 --> 20:21.057
What-ifs are a waste of time.

20:21.141 --> 20:23.142
I've accepted my dark passenger.

20:23.560 --> 20:25.603
But there's more to you than that.

20:25.979 --> 20:28.314
Brother Sam sees it,

20:28.398 --> 20:30.233
and he's helped you see it.

20:31.276 --> 20:33.277
That's what he is to you.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.121
So is there anything else
you want to talk about?

20:45.123 --> 20:46.332
Nope.

20:46.833 --> 20:48.292
You sure?

20:48.794 --> 20:50.002
Yep.

20:51.129 --> 20:52.338
OK.

20:53.173 --> 20:56.259
Well, as far as the shooting
at Don Aldo's, you're good to go.

20:56.343 --> 20:58.469
There's no need for us to meet again.

20:59.513 --> 21:02.306
- There's one more thing.
- Yes?

21:05.519 --> 21:08.646
I feel like my whole world
has been turned upside down.

21:11.483 --> 21:13.859
That's kind of
more than an afterthought.

21:15.279 --> 21:16.487
Go on.

21:20.534 --> 21:23.536
For the first time, I feel lost in
a place that's always felt like home.

21:25.372 --> 21:27.707
I look at my co-workers
and I see the doubt in their eyes,

21:27.791 --> 21:29.375
and it makes me doubt myself.

21:30.669 --> 21:32.545
I mean, they used to be my friends.

21:32.671 --> 21:34.380
Now they're my subordinates.

21:36.008 --> 21:37.383
It used to be simple.

21:40.470 --> 21:42.138
I feel like shit about Quinn.

21:43.181 --> 21:45.224
I think he thinks that

21:45.309 --> 21:48.352
I dumped him because I think
I'm better than him now.

21:49.896 --> 21:51.397
And I used to be able
to talk to Batista,

21:51.523 --> 21:54.400
but that's awkward because
I made lieutenant over him.

21:57.404 --> 21:59.030
I still have Dexter.

22:01.366 --> 22:03.826
We've always been close,
since we were kids.

22:05.329 --> 22:07.413
But that's different, too, because...

22:07.998 --> 22:10.041
It's weird to be
my big brother's boss.

22:12.419 --> 22:14.670
I just don't know how to act
around anyone any more.

22:14.755 --> 22:16.547
- So don't.
- What?

22:16.757 --> 22:17.840
Don't act.

22:18.925 --> 22:20.217
Just be, Debra.

22:20.844 --> 22:23.596
You're too much in your head.
You're... You're thinking too much.

22:24.056 --> 22:25.848
Just do the job, live your life,

22:25.932 --> 22:27.933
and give it all a chance
to sort itself out.

22:29.353 --> 22:31.771
I don't know if I know
how to do that any more.

22:33.732 --> 22:36.692
What would you be doing right now
if you hadn't gotten this promotion?

22:36.777 --> 22:38.110
If I wasn't lieutenant?

22:38.403 --> 22:41.947
If I didn't have briefings and reports
and meetings coming out of my ass?

22:42.032 --> 22:43.282
Yeah.

22:45.619 --> 22:48.079
I would probably throw
a housewarming party

22:48.121 --> 22:49.747
at my new beach house.

22:51.124 --> 22:52.625
Well, that sounds like a lot more fun

22:52.751 --> 22:54.126
than worrying about
all this other stuff.

22:55.087 --> 22:57.463
For a shrink,
you're not that annoying.

22:59.132 --> 23:00.216
Thanks.

23:01.968 --> 23:04.053
Not that you'd ever need
a shrink, but...

23:04.137 --> 23:05.304
You might need a bookmark.

23:23.323 --> 23:25.825
I would guess it's obvious
that people who party all night

23:25.909 --> 23:27.993
also don't get up in the morning,

23:28.120 --> 23:30.413
but I'm finding it very inconvenient.

23:30.997 --> 23:33.332
Come on, Leo. Wake up.

23:52.352 --> 23:54.854
- Cops, man.
- Oh, fuck.

23:54.980 --> 23:56.021
Oh, fuck.

23:59.025 --> 24:00.443
- Fuck you, man.
- Hey, behave.

24:01.695 --> 24:03.320
That's my little gentleman.

24:04.030 --> 24:07.700
Now, I know the Locos are
the supplier for this neighbourhood.

24:07.784 --> 24:10.536
And I'm guessing that you,
being a savvy consumer,

24:10.662 --> 24:13.205
have kept abreast on
who's running their operation now.

24:13.290 --> 24:15.666
- I don't know shit.
- I just don't believe you.

24:16.209 --> 24:18.961
I'm afraid you leave me
no choice but to flamingo your ass.

24:19.045 --> 24:21.380
- Ass... What?
- It's a Chicago thing.

24:22.048 --> 24:23.215
It's ironic,

24:23.550 --> 24:26.886
because we don't actually
have flamingos in Chicago.

24:27.721 --> 24:29.388
You actually have them here in Miami,

24:29.473 --> 24:31.682
and yet you don't flamingo people.

24:32.392 --> 24:34.143
I'll catch you later.

24:34.227 --> 24:35.478
Wait!

24:38.899 --> 24:40.065
Yeah.

24:40.150 --> 24:42.693
The new Locos shot caller
is Leo Hernandez.

24:43.236 --> 24:44.403
Drives a black muscle car,

24:44.529 --> 24:47.072
similar to the vehicle ID'd
at the garage drive-by.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.324
Operates out of a house

24:48.408 --> 24:50.367
at the intersection
of St Andrews and Romaine.

24:50.410 --> 24:51.535
I'll send backup.

24:54.748 --> 24:56.332
About time, Leo.

25:02.839 --> 25:05.007
Police officer! Hold it right there.

25:11.389 --> 25:12.431
Hold it!

25:12.599 --> 25:14.183
- He's coming out!
- Hands up.

25:14.601 --> 25:15.935
Come on. Go, go!

25:22.776 --> 25:25.277
He's down. Hold your fire.

25:26.947 --> 25:28.447
Get in to secure the weapon! Clear!

25:28.573 --> 25:29.907
Pull it in!

25:40.252 --> 25:42.127
Is this the Locos' shot caller?

25:42.254 --> 25:43.796
Yeah, recently retired.

25:44.297 --> 25:46.423
Hey, Dexter, can I watch you
do the blood work?

25:46.466 --> 25:49.760
Louis, we're learning fingerprints.
You're not ready for blood.

25:50.637 --> 25:51.929
Come on.

25:59.312 --> 26:01.981
Leo, you're not going in my slide box,

26:02.065 --> 26:04.441
but justice has been done.

26:04.484 --> 26:06.235
So why doesn't it feel better?

26:14.327 --> 26:15.828
Think you got the right guy?

26:16.746 --> 26:19.665
In the sense that he was trying to
blow my head off?

26:19.749 --> 26:20.916
Definitely.

26:22.502 --> 26:25.004
As to Brother Sam, I'll know
when I find the 9mm

26:25.088 --> 26:26.505
that put the holes in him.

26:32.846 --> 26:34.263
DVD player's on.

26:39.352 --> 26:40.936
Security disc.

26:41.438 --> 26:42.938
From the garage.

27:08.340 --> 27:09.548
OK.

27:09.674 --> 27:12.635
It's not a slam dunk.
That looks like Leo.

27:12.719 --> 27:15.137
He had on the same sweatshirt
when he was shot,

27:15.221 --> 27:16.680
he had the disc in his possession,

27:16.723 --> 27:19.642
and Yale has two witnesses
who say Leo was bragging

27:19.726 --> 27:22.728
he was gonna "smoke that
negro pendejo, Brother Sam."

27:22.896 --> 27:24.730
That sounds like it should hold.

27:24.814 --> 27:26.482
Good work, Mike, everyone.

27:27.067 --> 27:30.402
Oh, if you haven't heard,
there's a party at my place tonight.

27:30.487 --> 27:31.570
BYOB.

27:31.655 --> 27:33.530
Not because I'm cheap. It's just cos

27:33.573 --> 27:35.741
I don't have time to buy booze.

27:38.244 --> 27:41.914
This doesn't make up for Brother Sam,
but at least we got the bad guy.

27:42.165 --> 27:43.332
Yeah.

27:47.671 --> 27:49.088
Something's not right.

27:55.053 --> 27:56.345
Eli isn't barking.

27:57.097 --> 28:00.391
If Leo were the man in the hood,
the dog would be going crazy.

28:00.767 --> 28:05.020
The only person other than Brother Sam
Eli doesn't bark at

28:05.105 --> 28:06.438
is Nick.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.794
I'm sorry,
but the professor said no painkillers.

29:10.837 --> 29:13.005
Please, just let me go.

29:14.090 --> 29:15.466
I can't do that.

29:15.508 --> 29:17.301
I have a son.

29:17.343 --> 29:19.136
A little boy.

29:19.179 --> 29:20.429
He needs his mother.

29:27.270 --> 29:28.312
Please.

29:29.522 --> 29:32.858
I can tell you're a good person.
Please, help me.

29:46.664 --> 29:49.666
- Well, look who's here!
- Hey, Lisa.

29:50.335 --> 29:53.462
Class, this is my brother Travis.

29:54.047 --> 29:55.172
Can you say hello?

29:55.215 --> 29:57.132
Hi!

29:57.634 --> 29:59.009
This is such a surprise.

29:59.052 --> 30:00.469
I mean, I'm... I'm thrilled.

30:00.553 --> 30:03.388
But you've... You've never
visited me at school before.

30:03.723 --> 30:05.140
Just needed to see you.

30:06.017 --> 30:07.893
That's music to my ears.

30:07.977 --> 30:09.228
You wanna paint with us?

30:09.354 --> 30:12.815
Oh, no. I... I have to get going.

30:12.899 --> 30:14.316
Come on.

30:14.400 --> 30:19.530
Class! Travis is
a very talented artist.

30:19.906 --> 30:21.323
Don't you think he should join us?

30:21.407 --> 30:22.866
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:24.244 --> 30:25.994
OK, OK, just a little bit.

30:26.079 --> 30:27.871
- Yay!
- Yes!

30:33.086 --> 30:34.336
So what are we painting?

30:34.921 --> 30:37.172
We're painting what we're gonna be
when we grow up.

30:37.799 --> 30:39.842
I'm gonna be a nurse like my mom.

30:40.343 --> 30:42.636
That's a great thing to be.

30:43.096 --> 30:45.681
- What about you?
- I'm gonna be a Transformer.

30:47.517 --> 30:49.309
Oh, scary.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.022
Don't you envy them?

30:54.566 --> 30:56.316
So full of dreams.

30:57.277 --> 31:00.362
And all the time in the world
to make them come true.

31:33.104 --> 31:35.522
The night Brother Sam
carried Nick from his apartment,

31:35.607 --> 31:36.773
Nick fired a shot at him.

31:36.858 --> 31:39.443
From the couch, I'm guessing,
since he was stoned.

31:39.861 --> 31:42.195
So the bullet should be...

31:46.659 --> 31:47.743
here.

32:12.185 --> 32:13.352
9mm.

32:13.436 --> 32:16.396
Did it come from the same gun
that shot Brother Sam?

32:34.999 --> 32:37.793
The striations match
the bullet taken from Brother Sam.

32:40.254 --> 32:42.297
Nick shot Sam,

32:42.382 --> 32:44.549
the man who tried to save him.

32:45.134 --> 32:46.802
He's the ultimate Judas.

32:50.974 --> 32:53.892
Thank you for coming down on
such short notice, Professor Porter.

32:55.019 --> 32:56.269
You didn't give me much choice.

32:56.896 --> 32:58.313
I hope you understand that

32:58.398 --> 33:00.565
we're trying to solve
a series of brutal murders,

33:00.733 --> 33:02.609
and your cooperation
is very important.

33:02.986 --> 33:04.069
I don't see how.

33:04.278 --> 33:07.239
I already told you everything I know
and I gave you Gellar's boxes.

33:07.323 --> 33:10.409
Professor Porter,
are you the woman in that photo?

33:14.247 --> 33:15.288
Yes.

33:15.707 --> 33:17.374
Why didn't you tell us about this?

33:17.583 --> 33:19.501
To tell you the truth,
I'd forgotten about it.

33:20.336 --> 33:23.672
Ma'am, you are lying naked
in the middle of campus

33:24.632 --> 33:26.800
with a dead sheep on your head.

33:28.928 --> 33:32.139
That's not the kind of thing
that just slips your mind.

33:35.476 --> 33:38.854
Look, if that photo got out,

33:38.938 --> 33:42.774
I would look like a total flake
to my... The faculty.

33:45.862 --> 33:47.154
Quinn.

33:47.238 --> 33:48.822
Why aren't you in there
with your witness?

33:49.073 --> 33:52.492
I had paperwork backing up,
so Angel took this one.

33:52.577 --> 33:53.952
Paperwork?

33:54.037 --> 33:57.080
She's a material witness
in the fucking Doomsday murders.

33:57.206 --> 33:58.540
Come on, get in there.

34:03.046 --> 34:05.756
Professor Porter, did you...

34:05.840 --> 34:09.217
Do you share any of
Professor Gellar's religious beliefs?

34:09.302 --> 34:11.762
I didn't know he had
any religious beliefs.

34:11.846 --> 34:13.597
He was an academic.

34:16.851 --> 34:17.893
Professor Porter.

34:19.395 --> 34:20.562
Detective?

34:24.108 --> 34:25.358
So that would be a no.

34:26.319 --> 34:29.613
You're not a believer
in apocalyptic prophecies.

34:29.697 --> 34:31.114
Of course not. Look...

34:32.492 --> 34:33.992
I was just a prop.

34:34.368 --> 34:37.621
I was young. I was trying to
win favour with my professor.

34:37.705 --> 34:40.290
Well, kind of an unorthodox way
to go about it.

34:44.504 --> 34:46.671
He was an unorthodox man.

34:46.756 --> 34:49.132
- Has Gellar contacted you?
- No.

34:49.217 --> 34:52.719
I told you. I haven't seen or
talked to him in over three years.

34:52.804 --> 34:54.179
Well, you didn't tell us
about the photo,

34:54.263 --> 34:56.640
so you could see how
we might be a little sceptical.

34:56.724 --> 34:58.683
What the hell is going on here?

34:59.352 --> 35:01.978
You think because
I posed for a photo once,

35:02.063 --> 35:03.647
that I'm somehow involved
in all of this?

35:03.731 --> 35:05.690
No one said anything
about you being involved.

35:05.775 --> 35:07.526
But you're acting like
I'm guilty of something.

35:07.610 --> 35:08.777
Not at all, Miss Porter.

35:08.861 --> 35:10.445
We're just trying to
ascertain the full nature

35:10.530 --> 35:12.114
of your relationship
with Professor Gellar.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.158
I told you the full nature
of the relationship.

35:15.243 --> 35:16.701
I was his TA,

35:16.786 --> 35:20.163
and for a brief time, we were lovers,
but that's over.

35:20.248 --> 35:21.373
Are you sure about that?

35:22.500 --> 35:23.750
Jesus.

35:24.252 --> 35:25.502
If we were still involved,

35:25.586 --> 35:28.088
would I have slept
with Mr Warmth over here?

35:29.799 --> 35:31.716
Or are you implying that I'm a whore

35:31.801 --> 35:33.426
as well as an accomplice to murder?

35:33.511 --> 35:35.804
Professor Porter,
can we just stay on the subject here?

35:35.888 --> 35:37.013
No.

35:37.098 --> 35:38.265
I've had enough of this.

35:40.351 --> 35:41.434
I'm leaving now.

35:42.103 --> 35:44.354
You bother me again,
I'll get a lawyer.

35:44.814 --> 35:46.439
Goodbye, Joey.

35:54.657 --> 35:55.907
Leave us.

36:07.086 --> 36:08.670
Are you out of your mind?

36:09.881 --> 36:11.798
You fucked a person of interest?

36:13.551 --> 36:16.178
Who fucks a person of non-interest?

36:19.182 --> 36:21.725
This is no time to be a smartass.

36:21.809 --> 36:23.310
I could have you fired.

36:24.770 --> 36:29.107
That woman was the key to interpreting
all of the Gellar evidence.

36:29.192 --> 36:31.610
She's never gonna
fucking cooperate with us now.

36:31.694 --> 36:32.861
Is that really what's bothering you?

36:32.945 --> 36:34.863
What? What... What the fuck else?

36:35.198 --> 36:36.907
Maybe you're jealous.

36:42.914 --> 36:44.122
Are you kidding?

36:46.125 --> 36:47.918
I could give a fuck who you fuck.

36:49.545 --> 36:52.130
Just don't fuck with my investigation,
you fuck.

37:07.730 --> 37:09.856
Well, I guess we're off.

37:11.525 --> 37:13.485
You sure Deb invited me?

37:13.527 --> 37:15.820
I really do not want to
crash a party with your son.

37:15.863 --> 37:17.239
Yes, I'm sure, have fun.

37:17.323 --> 37:19.908
I'll be there later,
after I take care of my business.

37:20.993 --> 37:23.578
Sending Nick in pieces
to the bottom of the bay.

37:32.922 --> 37:34.005
Hello?

37:35.591 --> 37:36.675
Of course, right away.

37:37.927 --> 37:39.761
Thank you for coming.

37:39.845 --> 37:42.389
It was really important to Sam
that he talk to you.

37:42.515 --> 37:44.266
This is good news, right?

37:44.684 --> 37:46.518
He's regained consciousness.

37:46.769 --> 37:47.852
Probably not.

37:49.021 --> 37:51.773
Doctor says sometimes people
come out of comas before...

37:55.736 --> 37:57.112
He doesn't have long.

38:06.247 --> 38:07.455
Sam.

38:08.040 --> 38:09.374
I'm here.

38:16.132 --> 38:17.590
Don't worry.

38:18.467 --> 38:20.468
I know it was Nick who shot you.

38:22.972 --> 38:25.223
I'm gonna make sure he pays.

38:27.310 --> 38:28.476
No.

38:29.812 --> 38:31.730
Don't do that.

38:31.814 --> 38:33.565
I don't understand.

38:34.483 --> 38:36.234
I want you to...

38:38.946 --> 38:40.739
to give Nick a message from me.

38:41.282 --> 38:42.490
Yes.

38:44.410 --> 38:45.785
Tell him

38:46.579 --> 38:48.330
that I forgive him.

38:48.956 --> 38:50.248
What?

38:51.083 --> 38:55.253
You're the only one
that I trust to do it.

38:57.757 --> 38:59.632
I didn't tell anybody.

39:00.676 --> 39:02.761
The boys from the shop,

39:04.847 --> 39:06.431
they wouldn't...

39:09.643 --> 39:11.644
They... They're not ready.

39:11.771 --> 39:14.272
You're wrong, I can't do this.

39:16.609 --> 39:17.692
You can.

39:21.447 --> 39:22.530
You don't know me.

39:22.615 --> 39:23.782
Yes, I do.

39:26.994 --> 39:29.371
I know about your darkness.

39:31.874 --> 39:34.501
But I also see your light.

39:36.170 --> 39:38.296
If there's light in me,
I don't feel it.

39:39.632 --> 39:41.633
I just wanna hurt Nick.

39:42.176 --> 39:44.010
You don't know
how much I wanna hurt him.

39:44.136 --> 39:47.514
You need to forgive him.

39:49.850 --> 39:51.351
I don't know how.

39:52.144 --> 39:53.812
Just let it go.

39:57.733 --> 40:00.527
Can't live with the hate
in your heart.

40:01.987 --> 40:03.696
Eat you up inside.

40:06.700 --> 40:09.202
We gotta find some peace in life.

40:11.705 --> 40:13.331
Nick doesn't deserve it.

40:13.374 --> 40:15.875
It ain't about him.

40:17.503 --> 40:21.381
Dexter, if you don't
let that darkness go,

40:21.507 --> 40:23.466
it won't let go of you.

40:25.136 --> 40:33.351
Let it go.

40:44.405 --> 40:45.697
For you.

40:45.823 --> 40:47.866
You can just put it
on the liquor table.

40:47.908 --> 40:53.037
No, no... This is a special bottle.
It's a housewarming/apology gift.

40:55.166 --> 40:57.250
I should have told you
about Quinn and Carissa Porter.

40:57.376 --> 40:58.710
Yeah, you should've.

40:58.752 --> 41:00.879
I hope it doesn't hurt us
with Doomsday.

41:00.921 --> 41:02.255
Me, too.

41:03.757 --> 41:06.176
Why couldn't you trust me, Angel?

41:06.218 --> 41:09.554
I do trust you. Of course I do.

41:10.389 --> 41:12.056
It's just that...

41:12.892 --> 41:16.227
Quinn's my partner,
and you're the boss.

41:16.437 --> 41:18.354
I guess I haven't adjusted yet.

41:20.107 --> 41:22.442
Well, that makes two of us.

41:22.568 --> 41:24.569
It was the wrong way to go.

41:24.695 --> 41:26.571
It won't happen again. Here.

41:27.573 --> 41:29.032
It better not.

41:31.202 --> 41:33.578
And this bottle
better cost at least $50.

41:35.915 --> 41:37.624
Not even close.

41:43.464 --> 41:45.757
Harrison's out like a light
on your bed.

41:47.134 --> 41:49.761
But if that's inconvenient,
I can totally move him.

41:49.803 --> 41:51.054
It's fine.

41:53.224 --> 41:57.310
Oh, and Dexter said to tell you that
he'll be late, but he'll be here.

41:57.436 --> 41:59.103
- OK, thanks.
- Sure.

42:01.815 --> 42:04.567
Jamie, I feel like
we got off on the wrong foot.

42:05.152 --> 42:07.779
- What do you say we start over?
- I'd like that.

42:09.949 --> 42:12.325
Then how about we have
some of this fancy-ass tequila?

42:12.952 --> 42:15.161
I never say no to fancy-ass anything.

42:23.462 --> 42:24.963
Let me ask you a question.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.801
Is Dexter as cool at home
as he is at work?

42:30.678 --> 42:34.138
Why? Is he, like,
your hero or something?

42:35.683 --> 42:36.975
Yeah, right.

42:37.101 --> 42:40.436
That... That would make me a nerd,
which clearly I'm not.

42:42.940 --> 42:45.650
Hey, you fucks.
Let's get the party started.

42:45.776 --> 42:46.818
Oh, God.

42:47.611 --> 42:49.153
Please tell me he didn't drive.

42:49.196 --> 42:51.114
No, my lovely assistant did.

42:51.156 --> 42:54.826
Debra, chick from bar.
Chick from bar, Debra.

42:54.868 --> 42:56.452
I'm sorry, Lieutenant Debra,

42:56.495 --> 43:00.498
her royal fucking majesty,
5th earl of Suffolk.

43:01.500 --> 43:02.542
Cindy.

43:02.960 --> 43:04.669
Feel free to hang all over me, babe,

43:04.795 --> 43:07.380
because Debra here
is completely over my shit.

43:08.340 --> 43:10.300
Wait a minute. This is your ex?

43:11.677 --> 43:13.511
You brought me
to your ex-girlfriend's house?

43:13.554 --> 43:15.179
No, actually, you brought me.

43:15.973 --> 43:17.223
Have a nice life.

43:19.351 --> 43:21.686
Damn, I just keep getting dumped.

43:29.528 --> 43:31.863
Let go of the darkness.

43:34.325 --> 43:36.200
How is that even possible?

43:41.540 --> 43:44.459
Has Satan brought you here, Travis,
or has God?

43:47.212 --> 43:48.296
God.

43:49.465 --> 43:50.965
I'm glad to hear that.

43:52.301 --> 43:54.385
Everything's ready to mark the whore.

43:55.721 --> 43:57.847
I have to go out
and do further preparation.

43:59.308 --> 44:00.558
When I come back,

44:01.894 --> 44:03.728
I expect it to be done.

44:43.769 --> 44:45.019
Who's there?

44:47.231 --> 44:48.606
What's happening?

44:50.275 --> 44:54.570
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

45:16.760 --> 45:18.636
- What's happening?
- Get out.

45:18.721 --> 45:20.263
Where are you taking me?

45:28.731 --> 45:29.939
No, please.

45:32.067 --> 45:33.276
You're free.

45:33.444 --> 45:37.155
So were you hoping to become
a forensic analyst or whatever?

45:38.157 --> 45:40.658
Actually, I already have a career.

45:41.410 --> 45:42.910
I create video games.

45:43.120 --> 45:45.621
Wow, that's so cool.

45:46.790 --> 45:48.499
So why are you a lab intern then?

45:48.792 --> 45:51.502
Oh, I'm... I'm developing
a new game about homicide.

45:51.628 --> 45:54.672
I just figured it was
a great way to do research.

45:55.758 --> 45:58.634
I'm sorry, but you must be,
like, a model, right?

45:58.677 --> 46:01.179
Because there's just
no other explanation.

46:01.513 --> 46:04.640
Hey, excuse me,
we were kind of talking.

46:04.683 --> 46:06.642
Exactly. Were.

46:06.685 --> 46:08.352
Run along back to the lab, Igor.

46:08.479 --> 46:09.687
I think I better go check on Harrison.

46:09.813 --> 46:11.022
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

46:11.148 --> 46:12.940
- Okay.
- Sorry.

46:13.025 --> 46:14.108
Move!

46:14.359 --> 46:16.360
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey!

46:16.487 --> 46:18.196
Why don't you give my sister
a little space?

46:18.322 --> 46:21.032
I can't help it.
She has an outrageous ass.

46:21.158 --> 46:22.200
That's enough.

46:22.326 --> 46:24.702
I wanna have a relationship
with that ass.

46:24.787 --> 46:26.454
I wanna have babies...

46:27.372 --> 46:30.541
OK, Quinn, I think
it's time we call you a cab.

46:36.048 --> 46:37.673
You ever love me?

46:40.344 --> 46:41.636
Now is not the time.

46:41.720 --> 46:43.054
Come on, Deb.

46:43.138 --> 46:45.473
It's not that hard of a question.

46:45.557 --> 46:47.391
Did you ever love me?

46:56.068 --> 46:57.735
That's what I thought.

47:06.912 --> 47:09.413
I'm sorry. He's gone.

47:11.667 --> 47:14.043
That's it. Brother Sam is gone.

47:22.761 --> 47:24.512
Will you honour his dying wish?

47:24.596 --> 47:26.180
Forgive Nick?

47:27.224 --> 47:28.683
I want to.

47:29.268 --> 47:31.018
What did Brother Sam say?

47:32.271 --> 47:33.855
Just let it go.

47:34.356 --> 47:37.024
Let go of the darkness this one time,

47:37.109 --> 47:38.860
and show Nick the light.

47:49.913 --> 47:52.039
I've accepted the path I'm on.

47:55.460 --> 47:59.463
But can I take a detour with Nick
for Brother Sam?

48:00.299 --> 48:01.424
One thing is certain.

48:01.466 --> 48:04.051
There's no way to get around
the fork in the road.

48:04.428 --> 48:05.970
- Hey, Dexter.
- Hey.

48:06.972 --> 48:10.224
I'm glad I ran into you,
I was hoping we could talk.

48:11.059 --> 48:12.476
Let's go for a ride.

48:28.660 --> 48:29.744
Dexter Morgan.

48:29.828 --> 48:31.829
Please leave a message at the tone.

48:32.456 --> 48:33.956
Where are you, bro?

48:53.352 --> 48:55.686
You gonna tell me
what this is about now?

48:56.146 --> 48:58.022
Don't you recognise this place?

48:58.815 --> 49:00.524
It's a beach.

49:00.651 --> 49:02.818
It's the beach
where you were baptised.

49:02.861 --> 49:04.028
So?

49:05.697 --> 49:08.324
So I thought it would be
a good place for you to

49:09.201 --> 49:10.701
explain yourself.

49:12.287 --> 49:13.871
What are you talking about?

49:13.956 --> 49:16.290
Brother Sam regained consciousness.

49:18.001 --> 49:19.877
I know you shot him, Nick.

49:24.883 --> 49:26.175
You gonna arrest me?

49:26.301 --> 49:28.135
I keep telling you, I'm not a cop.

49:29.554 --> 49:30.846
What do you want?

49:33.058 --> 49:34.725
I want to know why.

49:35.811 --> 49:37.478
Why'd you do it?

49:39.189 --> 49:40.731
I don't know.

49:41.566 --> 49:43.067
You don't know?

49:43.235 --> 49:45.403
You don't know why
you put three bullets in a man

49:45.487 --> 49:46.988
who only wanted to help you?

49:47.072 --> 49:49.031
Who believed in you?

49:49.074 --> 49:51.409
Who sacrificed for you?

49:51.493 --> 49:53.577
A man who gave you a home.

49:55.747 --> 49:58.165
A man who baptised you.

49:58.250 --> 49:59.667
Because he's full of shit!

50:03.171 --> 50:04.338
He gave me hope,

50:05.090 --> 50:07.091
but nothing changed.

50:07.217 --> 50:09.010
My life was shit before
he dunked me under those waves,

50:09.094 --> 50:10.094
and it's still shit.

50:11.013 --> 50:12.555
He lied to me.

50:13.515 --> 50:15.599
My homies never did that.

50:17.394 --> 50:18.894
So you went back to them.

50:20.605 --> 50:22.273
They wouldn't take me.

50:22.774 --> 50:24.942
Not unless I proved myself.

50:27.237 --> 50:28.779
Leo wanted Sam dead.

50:30.198 --> 50:32.700
That's why you gave him
the security disc.

50:35.912 --> 50:38.622
Here I am. The fork in the road.

50:44.296 --> 50:46.380
Brother Sam loved you, Nick.

50:46.798 --> 50:48.549
Then why'd he rat me out to you?

50:48.759 --> 50:50.051
He didn't.

50:51.636 --> 50:53.804
He sent me to forgive you.

50:55.140 --> 50:57.308
Brother Sam forgives you

50:57.392 --> 50:59.602
for gunning him down like a dog.

51:00.812 --> 51:03.147
Your life might not have changed,
but his did.

51:07.486 --> 51:09.320
Hey, look, I've gotta talk to him,
all right?

51:09.446 --> 51:11.781
We can work this out.
I can't go back to jail.

51:11.823 --> 51:13.157
He's dead.

51:13.992 --> 51:15.159
What?

51:15.243 --> 51:17.161
He died about an hour ago,

51:17.287 --> 51:19.080
which makes you a murderer.

51:26.129 --> 51:27.838
Turn yourself in to the police.

51:28.757 --> 51:30.341
They'll find you anyway.

51:34.262 --> 51:35.513
No, they won't.

51:37.516 --> 51:39.433
The only witness is dead.

51:42.395 --> 51:44.188
There ain't nothing on that disc.

51:45.899 --> 51:47.650
It's my word against yours.

51:52.531 --> 51:54.323
They got no proof.

51:59.079 --> 52:01.163
Nobody can do anything!

52:05.919 --> 52:07.503
Sweet Jesus!

52:10.966 --> 52:12.800
I can't believe this worked out, man.

52:38.910 --> 52:40.953
There's no light in you.

52:43.874 --> 52:46.125
There's no light in me.

53:00.473 --> 53:01.765
Hey, little brother.

53:04.186 --> 53:05.769
Miss me?
