00:08.430 --> 00:09.930
Previously on Dexter...

00:09.973 --> 00:11.390
You're saying Gellar does the killing?

00:11.641 --> 00:13.142
He's so much stronger than me.

00:13.268 --> 00:14.309
I can protect you.

00:14.436 --> 00:16.645
It's not me that I'm worried about.
It's my sister.

00:16.771 --> 00:19.148
Your sister talked to the police.

00:19.607 --> 00:20.816
She betrayed you.

00:20.942 --> 00:22.651
Just like the whore of Babylon.

00:22.777 --> 00:24.111
No!

00:24.154 --> 00:25.279
Ice Truck Killer?

00:25.321 --> 00:26.780
It was stolen from our evidence room.

00:26.906 --> 00:28.741
I erased any trace of the sale
from the internet.

00:28.783 --> 00:31.452
However, I wasn't able
to get the hand back.

00:31.494 --> 00:32.786
So when Jessica Morris OD'd,

00:32.912 --> 00:34.788
there was definitely someone
in that hotel room with her.

00:34.831 --> 00:36.165
No doubt.

00:36.291 --> 00:38.292
Then why is LaGuerta on my ass
to close this thing?

00:39.127 --> 00:40.836
My sister's a really nice girl.

00:41.337 --> 00:43.130
You seem like a nice guy.

00:45.425 --> 00:47.259
I just wouldn't want
to see you get hurt.

00:51.598 --> 00:53.140
Travis, is he here?

00:56.352 --> 00:57.644
Gellar has seen me now.

00:57.771 --> 00:59.021
This just got much harder.

00:59.147 --> 01:00.522
I'll help you.

01:01.775 --> 01:03.692
I'll help you kill him.

03:02.854 --> 03:04.771
I've had my dark passenger for so long

03:04.814 --> 03:06.940
that I can't really recall
life without it.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.613
Like someone who's grown up
with a club foot,

03:12.697 --> 03:15.490
or a stutter, or a lazy eye,

03:15.825 --> 03:19.453
it's simply been my own affliction
that I accept as part of who I am.

03:23.291 --> 03:24.625
But for Travis,

03:24.709 --> 03:27.294
his dark passenger
is a more recent acquisition,

03:28.630 --> 03:30.631
and he's not adjusting so well.

03:40.141 --> 03:42.226
So I'm going to help separate them.

03:57.242 --> 03:58.867
You saved my life.

03:59.577 --> 04:00.911
Gellar would have killed me.

04:01.329 --> 04:03.664
You said you'd help me find him.
Where is he?

04:07.502 --> 04:08.543
Travis.

04:08.670 --> 04:10.212
I don't know.

04:10.546 --> 04:12.547
Where else does he stay?

04:12.674 --> 04:15.884
Nowhere. This place was his home.

04:16.010 --> 04:19.596
The only time he left was
when we were doing the work.

04:20.056 --> 04:22.516
You mean hunting your victims.

04:31.859 --> 04:33.360
This one.

04:33.403 --> 04:35.862
The bowls of wrath. The next tableau.

04:35.905 --> 04:37.698
- Where will Gellar stage it?
- I don't know.

04:37.782 --> 04:39.199
Then who will Gellar's next victim be?

04:39.284 --> 04:40.367
I don't know.

04:40.451 --> 04:42.953
He murdered
your sister, Travis. Think.

04:43.037 --> 04:45.414
Gellar was the one
who made all the decisions.

04:46.457 --> 04:49.209
Come on, Travis.
You must know something.

04:54.716 --> 04:55.799
"2LOT."

04:56.801 --> 04:58.552
Is that from the bible?

05:01.723 --> 05:04.057
I've never seen that before.

05:06.644 --> 05:09.563
Look for anything
that'll help us find Gellar.

05:35.506 --> 05:37.257
I feel dizzy.

05:40.928 --> 05:42.929
We need to take care of that arm,

05:43.014 --> 05:46.266
and find you a place to stay
where Gellar can't find you.

06:04.369 --> 06:06.078
What's this about, Dexter?

06:06.871 --> 06:08.455
It's what Brother Sam would want.

06:08.539 --> 06:10.582
Are you sure
this is about Brother Sam?

06:11.709 --> 06:13.460
I know what I'm doing.

06:30.269 --> 06:32.270
My cell phone's on the speed dial.

06:33.314 --> 06:35.273
Sit down. Hold out your arm.

06:39.195 --> 06:40.987
So what am I supposed to do here?

06:41.781 --> 06:42.864
Nothing.

06:43.616 --> 06:45.617
There's nothing you can do right now.

06:45.701 --> 06:48.870
Not to mention you're wanted
for multiple murders.

06:48.955 --> 06:50.914
You can't help me if you're in jail.

06:53.126 --> 06:54.626
I'll be back later with some food.

06:54.710 --> 06:57.421
In the meantime,
do not leave this room.

06:59.424 --> 07:01.258
And try to think of anything
that might help me figure out

07:01.342 --> 07:02.634
where Gellar is.

07:08.349 --> 07:09.975
2LOT.

07:14.605 --> 07:18.400
"2LoT: The Second Law of
Thermodynamics.

07:18.484 --> 07:23.155
"Tendency for order
to become disorder or chaos."

07:23.239 --> 07:25.532
What does it have to do
with the bowls of wrath?

07:30.663 --> 07:32.581
A parking pass.

07:32.665 --> 07:35.333
You visited the Miami South Campus.

07:35.793 --> 07:38.253
Were you stalking your next victim?

07:48.890 --> 07:52.684
"Professor Casey's
controversial book 2LOT's Tales

07:52.768 --> 07:55.145
"claims to demolish
every argument offered

07:55.229 --> 07:57.397
"for a God-centred universe."

07:57.482 --> 08:01.234
If Gellar wants to pour out his wrath,
who better to receive it than...

08:01.360 --> 08:04.571
"Tireless crusader
for the virtues of atheism."

08:09.577 --> 08:11.161
Dexter's allowed
to have a private life,

08:11.245 --> 08:13.955
but is it too much to ask
for a little give and take?

08:15.291 --> 08:18.043
Would you say that your brother
has always been guarded?

08:19.128 --> 08:21.713
Well, yeah, that's the problem.

08:21.797 --> 08:24.132
But if he's always been this way,

08:24.217 --> 08:27.177
why would you
suddenly expect him to change?

08:29.180 --> 08:30.305
I don't know.

08:30.389 --> 08:33.892
Would you expect a chair
to suddenly become a table?

08:34.435 --> 08:35.560
No, but...

08:35.645 --> 08:37.604
- No, because a chair...
- Is a chair.

08:40.525 --> 08:41.858
Dexter is who he is.

08:45.196 --> 08:46.780
You're good.

08:48.157 --> 08:50.116
How does it make you feel
when he shuts you out?

08:51.577 --> 08:52.869
Alone.

08:54.747 --> 08:57.290
Where do you think this comes from?

08:57.375 --> 08:59.626
This feeling of being alone?

09:00.545 --> 09:02.254
I don't know.

09:06.133 --> 09:08.510
My mom died when I was a teenager.

09:09.971 --> 09:11.471
That must have been hard.

09:13.307 --> 09:16.268
Becoming a woman with...
with no mother figure.

09:20.439 --> 09:23.984
It would have helped if my dad
had paid me any attention.

09:26.404 --> 09:30.073
That's probably why I fell in love
with someone twice my age.

09:30.241 --> 09:32.867
He was shot in front of me.
Did I mention that?

09:33.202 --> 09:34.411
No.

09:35.580 --> 09:38.456
I was probably looking
for someone safer

09:39.500 --> 09:42.043
after being engaged
to this really great guy

09:42.128 --> 09:45.088
that also turned out
to be a serial killer.

09:49.135 --> 09:50.552
Would you like it
if we started seeing each other

09:50.636 --> 09:52.470
more than once a week?

10:01.814 --> 10:02.981
Deb.

10:03.065 --> 10:05.400
Listen, I'm sorry about last night.

10:05.568 --> 10:06.901
You don't have to apologise.

10:07.361 --> 10:08.737
- I don't?
- Nope.

10:09.030 --> 10:10.113
I get it.

10:10.197 --> 10:11.281
You're a chair.

10:12.575 --> 10:13.617
I'm a... what?

10:13.701 --> 10:16.786
I don't have time to explain it.
I'm late for the briefing.

10:23.377 --> 10:25.211
You look confused.

10:26.589 --> 10:28.340
Your sister ever say anything

10:28.424 --> 10:30.592
that makes
absolutely no sense whatsoever?

10:30.676 --> 10:32.552
- All the time.
- She ever call you a chair?

10:32.803 --> 10:33.845
I don't think so.

10:38.267 --> 10:40.560
Hey, have either one of you
seen Quinn?

10:42.563 --> 10:43.897
I hope he's OK.

10:43.981 --> 10:45.190
Why wouldn't he be?

10:46.025 --> 10:49.194
He got shit-faced last night
and started proposing to strippers.

10:49.278 --> 10:50.570
OK, let's get started.

10:51.322 --> 10:53.239
- Where's Quinn?
- He's on his way.

10:55.034 --> 10:57.619
Lisa Marshall is DDK's latest victim.

10:57.703 --> 10:59.162
The whore of Babylon.

10:59.246 --> 11:01.373
Where are we on finding
her brother Travis?

11:01.457 --> 11:03.625
He's gone missing.
Hasn't reported to work in days.

11:03.709 --> 11:07.212
We got unis at his apartment
and at Lisa's house. So far, nothing.

11:07.296 --> 11:09.714
So he and Gellar either
got the fuck out of Dodge

11:09.799 --> 11:12.092
or they're holed up somewhere
planning their next instalment

11:12.176 --> 11:13.218
of what the fuck.

11:13.302 --> 11:15.470
Travis is holed up waiting for me.

11:15.554 --> 11:17.681
They have three tableaus to complete.

11:18.224 --> 11:21.518
Now, according to Gellar's notebooks,
the bowls of wrath are next.

11:22.144 --> 11:24.229
Now religious experts
that I've consulted

11:24.313 --> 11:27.774
say that it's punishment
poured on the people.

11:28.150 --> 11:31.069
Each bowl is a plague.
Disease, darkness...

11:31.987 --> 11:33.321
The ocean turns to blood.

11:33.406 --> 11:34.447
You know this shit?

11:35.866 --> 11:37.367
I've been studying.

11:37.451 --> 11:39.285
Gellar updated his blog.

11:39.578 --> 11:40.954
It's the first post
since the killings began.

11:41.038 --> 11:43.206
- Which is huge, right?
- Let me see it.

11:44.583 --> 11:47.877
"In six days, the end will be
marked with a solar eclipse.

11:47.962 --> 11:51.423
"All those following
false prophets are doomed."

11:51.507 --> 11:53.091
Could be Professor Casey.

11:54.427 --> 11:55.635
Or me.

11:56.429 --> 11:58.346
I'm the one Gellar saw in the church.

12:00.182 --> 12:02.142
Look at all the comments.

12:02.226 --> 12:03.852
People are taking this shit seriously.

12:04.812 --> 12:08.523
Professor Gellar,
I support your quest.

12:08.607 --> 12:12.694
I'm inspired by your courage
and faithfully follow you to the end.

12:12.778 --> 12:14.112
"Doomsday_Adam."

12:15.072 --> 12:18.074
Well, a blog update's
not gonna help us find their location.

12:18.159 --> 12:20.410
Well, I could take a stab
at tracking down

12:20.494 --> 12:21.995
the blog's Internet Protocol address.

12:22.788 --> 12:24.539
I hope you're not as good
as you think.

12:24.623 --> 12:28.209
Do it, Louis. I don't want to know
how you do it, but do it.

12:28.294 --> 12:29.669
We're running on fumes here.

12:29.754 --> 12:31.379
I need people following all leads,

12:31.464 --> 12:33.715
whatever it takes
to catch these assholes, OK?

12:33.841 --> 12:35.049
Let's do it.

12:35.134 --> 12:36.968
I hate to root against my own team,

12:37.052 --> 12:39.429
but I want a shot at Gellar first.

12:48.898 --> 12:51.608
All right! Jesus Christ.

12:53.694 --> 12:55.195
You missed the morning briefing.

12:55.279 --> 12:56.821
Hey, I overslept. It happens.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.407
Yeah, well, it's happening a lot.
Get dressed.

13:02.578 --> 13:04.162
Your gun, where is it?

13:07.958 --> 13:10.418
- Oh, fuck me.
- You got to be kidding me.

13:10.503 --> 13:13.129
The whole city is looking to us
to fix this DDK shit,

13:13.214 --> 13:14.672
and you lose your gun?

13:14.757 --> 13:18.343
I went to the strip club with Masuka,
he bailed on me...

13:19.970 --> 13:24.516
And then me and this stripper
went to her car, and she...

13:24.600 --> 13:26.601
You banged a stripper in her car?

13:26.977 --> 13:28.603
Maybe my gun fell out
in her back seat.

13:28.687 --> 13:30.897
You better pray that it did
and that it's still there.

13:30.981 --> 13:33.441
Please, tell me
you at least got her number.

13:35.194 --> 13:37.695
- Oh, fuck me.
- Dios mío.

13:38.113 --> 13:40.240
I got enough to babysit
with my kid sister.

13:40.324 --> 13:42.659
Your phone's got GPS. Track it.

13:52.837 --> 13:55.255
That address is halfway across town.

13:55.339 --> 13:57.966
We just lost a whole morning
because of your dumb ass.

13:58.092 --> 13:59.592
I'll make it up to you.

14:00.719 --> 14:02.303
Mr Morris.

14:02.388 --> 14:04.931
Yes. I'm Jessica Morris' father.

14:06.058 --> 14:07.225
Thank you for seeing me.

14:07.309 --> 14:08.768
I am sorry for your loss.

14:09.937 --> 14:11.604
How can I help you?

14:11.689 --> 14:13.857
I'd like you to reopen Jessica's case.

14:15.901 --> 14:17.610
Mr Morris, I know
this must be very difficult,

14:17.736 --> 14:19.612
but the medical examiner ruled
that your daughter's death

14:19.738 --> 14:22.907
was an accidental overdose,
not a homicide.

14:22.950 --> 14:24.117
Yes, I know.

14:24.285 --> 14:26.035
But her sternum was cracked.

14:26.871 --> 14:28.621
And the paramedics said
they never performed CPR

14:28.747 --> 14:30.957
because she was already dead
when they arrived.

14:31.709 --> 14:33.710
- How do you know that?
- Does it matter?

14:33.961 --> 14:35.753
If someone was with her when she died,

14:35.796 --> 14:36.921
why aren't you looking into that?

14:36.964 --> 14:38.756
I'm sorry, but the case is closed.

14:38.799 --> 14:40.383
Well, then reopen it.

14:40.467 --> 14:42.719
What if that person killed her
and then tried to cover it up?

14:42.803 --> 14:44.637
I am sorry, but my hands are tied.

14:44.722 --> 14:46.639
Please, just listen.

14:49.101 --> 14:50.894
I don't know if you have kids,

14:51.228 --> 14:54.147
but I hope you never have to see them
turning tricks on Collins Avenue.

14:56.150 --> 14:58.651
I will run it upstairs.
I'll see what I can do.

14:59.445 --> 15:01.321
Thank you. Thank you.

15:03.449 --> 15:05.158
How is your magic working?

15:05.284 --> 15:08.244
This is a tough nut, but I want to
prove Sergeant Batista wrong.

15:08.329 --> 15:09.829
I can do this. I can do this.

15:09.955 --> 15:11.748
What's his problem with you?

15:11.832 --> 15:15.335
He doesn't think I'm good enough
to date his sister, so I backed off.

15:16.086 --> 15:18.838
OK. Stop with the fingers.
We gotta talk.

15:24.136 --> 15:25.511
Look, I...

15:25.596 --> 15:28.848
I understand the whole
cowardly geek response.

15:28.974 --> 15:31.184
- I'm not a geek.
- One bridge at a time, Louis.

15:31.769 --> 15:33.436
You're into Jamie, right?

15:33.520 --> 15:34.604
Yeah, she's amazing.

15:34.688 --> 15:36.522
Well, you have to tell her that.

15:37.650 --> 15:40.360
When it comes to matters of the heart,

15:40.486 --> 15:42.195
always follow your dick.

15:45.032 --> 15:47.784
Yeah, but how am I
ever gonna win over Batista?

15:47.868 --> 15:48.993
You don't.

15:49.036 --> 15:51.829
If Jamie's into you
as much as you're into her,

15:51.872 --> 15:54.290
she's gonna
take care of Batista for you.

15:55.334 --> 15:57.126
Just don't tell him I told you so.

15:57.503 --> 16:00.546
Yeah, I wanted to talk to Dr Casey
about this D he gave me.

16:02.341 --> 16:03.716
When's his class again?

16:06.512 --> 16:09.722
Brunner Hall of Science. Got it.

16:10.057 --> 16:11.808
I'll catch him after class.

16:21.527 --> 16:23.403
I brought you a sandwich.

16:23.529 --> 16:25.071
Did you find Gellar?

16:25.364 --> 16:26.656
No.

16:26.740 --> 16:28.408
But he updated his blog.

16:29.368 --> 16:30.702
He did?

16:41.964 --> 16:44.007
You have any idea what this means?

16:45.092 --> 16:48.094
"All those following
false prophets are doomed."

16:49.555 --> 16:51.597
It's a message for me.

16:51.724 --> 16:53.725
He's offering me a way back in.

16:55.185 --> 16:57.270
And I'm the false prophet.

17:00.941 --> 17:02.567
You ever heard of this guy?

17:03.110 --> 17:04.360
Trent Casey?

17:04.778 --> 17:07.613
Yes. Gellar hates him.
He's an atheist.

17:08.115 --> 17:10.366
Does he hate him enough
to want to kill him?

17:11.618 --> 17:14.620
The painting of the bowls of wrath
in the church

17:14.705 --> 17:16.247
had "2LOT" written on it.

17:17.791 --> 17:20.460
- You think he's the next victim.
- Yes.

17:24.798 --> 17:26.382
How do we find him?

17:26.467 --> 17:27.800
I'll let you know.

17:29.470 --> 17:30.595
Oh, man!

17:30.637 --> 17:32.889
All right, boys and girls,
time for a snack.

17:32.973 --> 17:35.600
- I want one.
- Good job. Time for a snack.

17:35.642 --> 17:37.810
Is this your penance, too?

17:38.103 --> 17:39.312
What?

17:39.730 --> 17:41.814
Catering for the toddler horde.

17:43.817 --> 17:46.402
My wife's in a meeting.
What's your excuse?

17:47.488 --> 17:49.489
I'm here for my son.

17:49.573 --> 17:50.907
Harrison.

17:50.991 --> 17:52.658
- Cookie.
- Cookie.

17:54.828 --> 17:56.162
Thank you, Harrison.

18:02.169 --> 18:03.586
That one's mine.

18:13.138 --> 18:14.972
Hey. How are you?

18:16.517 --> 18:18.518
OK. How are you?

18:20.354 --> 18:24.148
This is a little awkward, but I think
I left something in your car.

18:24.525 --> 18:26.818
Sorry. I don't have a car.

18:28.195 --> 18:31.364
Didn't I meet you last night
out at Virginia Gardens?

18:32.491 --> 18:34.700
Oh, you're looking for my mom.

18:37.162 --> 18:38.204
Mom.

18:39.206 --> 18:41.207
Hotness like that's got to
run in the family, right?

18:41.333 --> 18:42.416
I mean, she must be like...

18:43.710 --> 18:46.003
Holy shit. Hi. We got the wrong house.

18:46.046 --> 18:47.505
- Joey.
- Hey.

18:47.548 --> 18:49.006
OK.

18:49.341 --> 18:52.885
So you two met at the club?

18:53.595 --> 18:54.679
Oh, no, no.

18:54.721 --> 18:56.222
We met across the street
at the Waffle House.

18:56.348 --> 18:57.682
I work the late shift,

18:57.724 --> 19:00.226
and this one was all hands.

19:01.937 --> 19:03.396
I'd love to hear more,

19:03.438 --> 19:06.232
but Joey and I have to
get back to the station,

19:06.358 --> 19:09.777
and we think he may have left
some things in your car.

19:10.529 --> 19:13.072
It wasn't his innocence,
if you know what I mean.

19:15.075 --> 19:16.576
It's unlocked.

19:17.536 --> 19:18.911
Thank you, ma'am.

19:22.207 --> 19:23.875
You can't tell anybody about this.

19:23.917 --> 19:25.459
I can say anything I want.

19:27.087 --> 19:28.546
Got it.

19:31.425 --> 19:33.426
Oh, my God. We took pictures.

19:37.097 --> 19:39.223
I hope you at least wore...

19:39.308 --> 19:41.225
Oh, no, no, no.

19:41.268 --> 19:42.935
Oh, great. Fucking great.

19:46.106 --> 19:47.148
Shit.

19:47.274 --> 19:49.400
Just call the station.
Have them send a tow.

19:49.484 --> 19:51.611
The station doesn't know
that we're down here

19:51.653 --> 19:54.113
getting your gun back,
and we got to keep it that way.

19:54.239 --> 19:56.240
Or that you're driving a car
the '70s wants back.

19:56.283 --> 19:59.118
Stow it, will you? I wouldn't have to
be racing back if it weren't for you.

19:59.161 --> 20:00.286
I could have handled this on my own.

20:00.329 --> 20:03.331
You can't handle your balls right now.
When are you gonna grow up?

20:03.457 --> 20:04.790
Like you're one to talk.

20:05.334 --> 20:06.584
Come again?

20:06.627 --> 20:10.755
All you want to do is try and control
everything and everyone around you

20:10.797 --> 20:13.299
in order to feel better
about your own fucked-up life.

20:13.425 --> 20:14.800
You're so full of shit.

20:14.843 --> 20:15.927
Yeah, really?

20:15.969 --> 20:18.012
Cos your first wife up and left you.

20:18.138 --> 20:21.807
Your second wife, she was
your wife for what? Six months?

20:21.934 --> 20:24.268
You got a daughter
that wants nothing to do with you.

20:24.311 --> 20:25.478
I think you need to shut up.

20:25.604 --> 20:27.813
And now your panties
are in a big wet wad.

20:27.940 --> 20:30.483
Why? Because your little sister's
dating someone you don't like.

20:30.525 --> 20:31.692
Am I right, Lieutenant?

20:31.818 --> 20:34.028
Oh, wait, no, my bad.
I'm sorry. You're still sergeant,

20:34.154 --> 20:35.655
cos you fucked that up, too.

20:46.541 --> 20:48.709
Come on, is that all you got,
you motherfucker?

20:48.835 --> 20:50.002
Little motherfucker.

20:50.045 --> 20:53.339
Hey! Leave him alone
or I'll call the police.

21:05.060 --> 21:07.687
Now, creationists say

21:07.729 --> 21:10.022
the second law of thermodynamics

21:10.148 --> 21:15.027
doesn't allow order
to arise from disorder.

21:15.529 --> 21:17.029
So...

21:17.197 --> 21:22.743
Why does this idea make
their bible-clutching fingers twitch

21:22.869 --> 21:24.704
with excitement?

21:26.915 --> 21:30.918
Because for creationists,

21:31.044 --> 21:35.923
it means that the idea of evolution,
life arising from chaos,

21:36.049 --> 21:37.883
contradicts the second law.

21:37.926 --> 21:39.385
It can't happen.

21:39.428 --> 21:41.929
Can I look at your syllabus?
I forgot mine.

21:42.723 --> 21:45.683
And you need

21:45.726 --> 21:46.892
God...

21:48.729 --> 21:51.731
...to explain everything, right?

21:51.857 --> 21:52.940
Wrong.

21:53.108 --> 21:55.735
He's kind of a self-important asshole,

21:55.777 --> 21:57.903
but I like him.

21:57.946 --> 22:00.906
Casey's office is in Scarnes Hall

22:00.949 --> 22:03.075
and he has late office hours tonight.

22:03.118 --> 22:05.911
In case Gellar decides to show up,
I'll be here as well.

22:05.954 --> 22:08.748
This coming from people
who think there are no unicorns

22:08.874 --> 22:12.084
because they were late
getting to Noah's Ark.

22:13.337 --> 22:15.546
All right, that's all for today.

22:16.089 --> 22:20.051
Read chapters 9 through 10
for next week.

22:21.053 --> 22:22.428
Thank you.

22:28.769 --> 22:30.561
- Professor Casey.
- Yes?

22:32.522 --> 22:34.523
I believe you're in danger.

22:36.777 --> 22:40.404
What variety of lunatic might you be?

22:41.198 --> 22:42.782
I'm only trying to warn you.

22:43.283 --> 22:45.534
Well, then you're
one of the good ones.

22:45.619 --> 22:48.537
Do you have any idea
how many threats I get each week?

22:49.790 --> 22:51.290
- This one is real.
- Please.

22:52.292 --> 22:53.959
Unless you have some proof...

23:08.725 --> 23:12.144
One elevator and one set of stairs
equals two exits.

23:12.229 --> 23:14.313
Finally, some use for Travis.

23:23.156 --> 23:24.156
Nice place.

23:24.741 --> 23:26.992
Thank Gellar. He found it.

23:27.077 --> 23:28.786
So this is where it all started.

23:30.247 --> 23:31.872
And where it's going to end.

23:32.582 --> 23:37.002
This has become very important to you,
killing Travis's dark passenger.

23:37.087 --> 23:38.129
Yes.

23:40.507 --> 23:43.509
I would have done anything
for a chance to get rid of yours.

23:45.137 --> 23:47.096
I'm not sure you even tried.

23:49.433 --> 23:51.225
You just refocused it.

23:51.309 --> 23:53.894
So what will you do with him
once Gellar's gone?

23:54.396 --> 23:56.188
Allow him to start over.

23:57.023 --> 23:59.900
I know of a few people
who aren't using their identities.

24:00.819 --> 24:02.361
Your slides.

24:02.779 --> 24:06.073
I kill Gellar,
and Travis gets a second chance.

24:08.118 --> 24:10.202
The one I'll never have.

24:12.956 --> 24:14.623
What is Gellar like?

24:15.083 --> 24:17.418
First year of college,

24:17.502 --> 24:19.211
I took his class,

24:21.006 --> 24:22.381
and he took me under his wing.

24:23.633 --> 24:27.261
Made me feel like
I was part of something important.

24:28.805 --> 24:31.432
And I know it sounds crazy,

24:33.810 --> 24:37.396
but he convinced me
that God had chosen us

24:37.481 --> 24:39.732
to become the two witnesses.

24:42.027 --> 24:44.987
And what do the two witnesses do?

24:45.530 --> 24:49.116
They enact the Book of Revelation
and bring about the new world.

24:50.285 --> 24:51.869
By ending this one?

24:54.456 --> 24:56.290
Why would you want to do that?

24:59.503 --> 25:01.629
Have you ever wanted
to wipe everything clean

25:01.713 --> 25:04.381
and start your whole life
all over again?

25:16.436 --> 25:18.020
Once Gellar's gone,
you can start again.

25:25.028 --> 25:26.320
There's Gellar.

25:26.821 --> 25:28.239
Let's go.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.501
I'm gonna take the elevator.

25:40.585 --> 25:43.629
If Gellar took the stairs,
maybe I can head him off.

25:44.214 --> 25:47.258
Watch the stairs, make sure
he doesn't double back on me.

25:47.342 --> 25:48.717
Stay here.

25:52.138 --> 25:54.515
Gellar doesn't have
much of a head start.

26:02.857 --> 26:04.650
He knows I'm here.

27:08.256 --> 27:09.381
Come on.

27:12.135 --> 27:13.385
Gellar.

27:24.439 --> 27:26.732
Sorry. You told me not to move.

27:26.816 --> 27:28.734
- Did you see Gellar?
- No.

27:36.242 --> 27:37.826
Stay behind me.

27:49.756 --> 27:51.757
This is all my fault.

27:51.925 --> 27:54.176
Travis is proving to be my penance.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.597
There's not that much blood.

27:59.641 --> 28:01.433
Casey could still be alive.

28:03.770 --> 28:05.104
Let's go.

28:16.616 --> 28:18.325
I can't believe we lost him.

28:19.160 --> 28:21.453
And Casey, he's gonna kill him.

28:23.123 --> 28:24.289
We can still stop him.

28:25.875 --> 28:26.959
How?

28:28.461 --> 28:30.003
Through you.

28:30.630 --> 28:33.507
This blog that Gellar writes,
it's important to him.

28:35.135 --> 28:36.468
Send a message to him.

28:38.304 --> 28:41.390
Tell him you've changed your mind
and you need to see him.

28:42.225 --> 28:43.642
I'll do it right now.

28:50.191 --> 28:53.485
Just keep sending messages.
Call me as soon as he responds.

28:57.991 --> 28:59.992
Travis posted as the prodigal son,

29:00.076 --> 29:03.162
asking if it's OK for him
to make his way back home.

29:03.246 --> 29:05.330
No response from Gellar.

29:06.416 --> 29:08.000
Hey, good morning.

29:08.042 --> 29:10.419
Someone helping you fight crime?

29:10.503 --> 29:13.213
All wiggles present and accounted for.

29:13.339 --> 29:14.423
Excellent.

29:18.386 --> 29:19.511
Morgan.

29:19.554 --> 29:21.889
DDK struck again
at Miami South Campus.

29:22.015 --> 29:23.348
Casey.

29:23.433 --> 29:24.725
I'm on my way.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.895
Casey's lecture hall. Of course.

29:28.021 --> 29:30.689
Gellar laid him out where
he preaches his godless doctrine

29:30.774 --> 29:33.442
to the young and impressionable.

29:43.203 --> 29:44.787
This is Professor Trent Casey.

29:44.871 --> 29:48.123
He's an evolutionary biologist
and a noted atheist.

29:48.249 --> 29:49.291
Check it out.

29:49.375 --> 29:52.044
The abdomen's got
an alpha-omega carved into it.

29:52.128 --> 29:54.588
- Similar to the fruit vendor.
- Only this guy's missing stitches.

29:55.215 --> 29:56.381
And a hand.

29:56.466 --> 29:58.050
That's new.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.260
The puckering on the wrist tissue

30:00.386 --> 30:02.387
indicates the hand
was removed post-mortem.

30:02.472 --> 30:05.599
And judging from his pallor,
all his blood's been drained.

30:05.725 --> 30:07.935
Looks like he was strung up
and bled out.

30:08.061 --> 30:11.563
Gellar took another page
from my brother Brian's playbook.

30:15.276 --> 30:17.820
The stomach cavity's
been hollowed out.

30:19.155 --> 30:21.740
Any bets on the prize
that DDK left inside?

30:22.784 --> 30:24.243
Unis swept the room.

30:24.327 --> 30:26.328
They didn't find
any tripwires or blood.

30:26.746 --> 30:29.623
So if this is the bowls of wrath,
then what,

30:29.749 --> 30:31.458
is it gonna show up
in a bowl somewhere?

30:32.001 --> 30:33.168
Open him up.

30:34.754 --> 30:36.672
Brace yourselves for awful.

30:44.180 --> 30:45.264
He's empty.

30:45.348 --> 30:47.766
So, then, where are
the bowls of wrath?

30:49.143 --> 30:51.478
Let's get him to the ME's office.
Somebody get a gurney.

30:51.604 --> 30:52.771
I got it.

30:53.773 --> 30:54.773
Quinn's right.

30:54.858 --> 30:57.860
If each bowl is a plague
that God poured...

31:01.948 --> 31:03.115
No, don't!

31:04.951 --> 31:07.035
Oh, my God!

31:08.955 --> 31:10.038
What the fuck?

31:14.377 --> 31:17.838
Gellar hasn't seen wrath
until he's seen mine.

32:11.059 --> 32:13.518
Are you serious?
Bowls of blood dropped on my head?

32:13.561 --> 32:16.688
It's like a perfect fucking metaphor
for my entire fucking life.

32:16.773 --> 32:20.442
I'm not even sure I believe in God,
but I'm pretty sure he hates me.

32:22.028 --> 32:23.862
Losing your parents is difficult.

32:24.572 --> 32:27.908
Having a loved one shot
in front of you is unthinkable.

32:29.369 --> 32:31.453
Finding out that your fiancé
is a serial killer...

32:31.537 --> 32:35.415
Did I mention that
he was Dexter's biological brother?

32:36.209 --> 32:37.918
No, you did not.

32:38.753 --> 32:40.045
So wait a minute.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.588
The Ice Truck Killer was your brother?

32:41.714 --> 32:46.051
No. Dexter was adopted,
so we're not blood-related.

32:50.390 --> 32:52.265
What? What does that "oh" mean?

32:52.892 --> 32:56.561
You mentioned that your father
didn't pay much attention to you.

32:56.604 --> 32:58.563
What was his relationship
with Dexter like?

32:59.399 --> 33:01.108
They did everything together.

33:03.152 --> 33:05.070
And without your mother...

33:07.573 --> 33:08.615
I was left behind.

33:11.577 --> 33:13.245
You can move forward, Debra.

33:14.414 --> 33:16.331
But it's gonna mean
taking responsibility

33:16.416 --> 33:18.000
for your feelings and your choices.

33:18.501 --> 33:19.584
What does that mean?

33:22.588 --> 33:24.673
Please don't misunderstand me.

33:24.757 --> 33:27.467
I am very sensitive to the trauma
and the tragedy

33:27.593 --> 33:29.428
that you've experienced.

33:29.512 --> 33:33.098
But as far as your failed
relationships are concerned...

33:36.310 --> 33:37.352
What?

33:37.687 --> 33:39.813
We are responsible
for the partners we choose.

33:40.273 --> 33:41.273
Bullshit.

33:43.443 --> 33:47.112
How the fuck was I supposed to know
that Rudy was the Ice Truck Killer?

33:49.949 --> 33:53.201
Are you saying that I chose
to be with a serial killer on purpose?

33:53.286 --> 33:56.663
I think you have a history of choosing
inappropriate or unavailable men.

33:57.206 --> 33:59.332
Well, what the fuck
do you want me to say?

34:00.960 --> 34:03.295
That my life is a train wreck
of a disaster?

34:03.337 --> 34:05.464
That my life is a shithole?
Well, I already know this.

34:05.548 --> 34:08.383
This isn't news to me, OK?
I know that I am broken.

34:08.468 --> 34:09.801
Do you know that you don't have to be?

34:11.220 --> 34:13.388
You can pick up the pieces.

34:14.640 --> 34:16.850
- How?
- By making different choices.

34:17.518 --> 34:19.144
By breaking your patterns.

34:20.688 --> 34:22.481
Debra, it's gonna be hard.

34:22.565 --> 34:24.483
But you can make yourself whole again.

34:26.402 --> 34:27.569
You can.

34:37.705 --> 34:40.165
I heard about the bloodbath
at the crime scene.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
You OK?

34:43.002 --> 34:44.377
I'm fine.

34:44.712 --> 34:47.172
I was actually coming down
to talk to you about your request

34:47.215 --> 34:49.841
- to open the dead call girl's case.
- And?

34:49.926 --> 34:53.178
You can't afford to put
an unsolved back on your plate.

34:53.221 --> 34:55.263
Jesus fuck.
Are we really gonna do this again?

34:55.431 --> 34:56.723
Careful, Lieutenant.

34:56.849 --> 34:58.850
I'm just gonna
stop you right here, OK?

34:58.893 --> 35:01.186
- Excuse me?
- We've been through this.

35:01.854 --> 35:04.231
You're gonna say it's not happening

35:04.357 --> 35:05.398
and that I better do what you say

35:05.525 --> 35:07.943
cos you're gonna give me
some scary, squinty-eyed look,

35:08.027 --> 35:12.364
but I am so fucking sick
of having this conversation.

35:14.575 --> 35:16.952
So I'm just gonna
break the pattern right now.

35:18.121 --> 35:22.624
If you have a problem with me
investigating a potential homicide,

35:22.708 --> 35:24.960
which is my job,

35:25.044 --> 35:26.086
then fire me.

35:26.587 --> 35:29.047
Otherwise, I am reopening the case.

35:53.114 --> 35:55.574
Morgan won't let
the call girl's death go.

35:55.658 --> 35:56.741
God damn it.

35:56.784 --> 35:59.911
I could have pressed harder,
but she'd only be more suspicious.

36:02.748 --> 36:04.583
You know, it wasn't until I did CPR

36:04.625 --> 36:06.835
that I saw the drugs
and realised she OD'd.

36:07.587 --> 36:09.963
Maria, I swear to God,
I did all I could.

36:10.256 --> 36:12.841
Your career would have been over
if you'd stayed.

36:14.594 --> 36:18.263
What the fuck is Morgan thinking?
Doesn't she know when to back off?

36:18.306 --> 36:21.975
Well, isn't that tenacity the reason
you promoted her in the first place?

36:22.101 --> 36:24.352
Against my advice, of course.

36:30.443 --> 36:32.485
- We have to stop her.
- Don't worry.

36:44.624 --> 36:45.665
Hello?

36:45.791 --> 36:47.459
The police found Casey's body.

36:49.670 --> 36:51.713
The bowls of wrath. He's done it.

36:51.839 --> 36:54.716
The body was missing a hand.
Any idea why Gellar took it?

36:55.635 --> 36:57.302
The writing is on the wall.

36:58.638 --> 36:59.638
What?

36:59.722 --> 37:01.973
The expression. It's from the bible.

37:03.059 --> 37:07.854
The fingers of a human hand
appeared and wrote out,

37:08.981 --> 37:10.732
"Your days are numbered."

37:11.817 --> 37:13.235
Gellar's sending another message.

37:13.527 --> 37:14.903
What's the message?

37:17.573 --> 37:18.907
I don't know.

37:18.991 --> 37:20.325
But it doesn't matter.

37:20.409 --> 37:21.993
Gellar contacted me through his blog.

37:22.036 --> 37:23.578
He wants me to meet him
at the church tonight.

37:23.704 --> 37:25.538
Stay in the motel.
I'll pick you up later.

37:30.002 --> 37:31.962
You have the bowls of wrath
blood work?

37:32.004 --> 37:34.214
Yeah, just finished.

37:34.340 --> 37:37.300
Good news.
The blood was pathogen-free.

37:37.343 --> 37:39.010
So the shot I got was just for fun?

37:41.347 --> 37:42.514
Are you OK?

37:43.516 --> 37:45.016
Yeah, I just threw away
a pair of shoes

37:45.059 --> 37:47.352
because they're full of blood,
but I'm great.

37:49.522 --> 37:53.566
Cos I'm here if you need a chair.

37:54.360 --> 37:55.485
What?

37:55.528 --> 37:58.029
What you said before. I'm a chair.

37:58.489 --> 38:00.532
Yeah, but I don't want a chair.
I want a table.

38:02.660 --> 38:05.161
- What are you even saying?
- Never mind.

38:07.415 --> 38:08.498
Are we OK?

38:11.002 --> 38:13.044
I have no idea if you are.

38:13.170 --> 38:15.046
I'm sure not, but I'm working on it.

38:22.888 --> 38:25.223
Louis Greene is the man.

38:25.349 --> 38:27.767
Easy with the bromance.
You're gonna pitch a tent.

38:27.893 --> 38:29.227
Well, just remember that
I discovered him

38:29.353 --> 38:30.562
when I'm up for review.

38:30.604 --> 38:31.771
What'd he do?

38:31.897 --> 38:34.524
Unscrambled the IPA of Gellar's blogs

38:34.567 --> 38:37.527
and tracked it to an address.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.739
Anderson, grab your gear.

38:40.865 --> 38:42.282
Right behind you.

38:45.244 --> 38:47.912
Yeah, that's my IP address,
but it's unsecured,

38:47.955 --> 38:50.373
so I couldn't tell you
who all uses the signal.

38:50.416 --> 38:51.916
What's the signal's range?

38:51.959 --> 38:53.752
Give or take 500 feet.

38:53.794 --> 38:55.086
Well, you're putting out
1,000 milliwatts.

38:55.129 --> 38:57.464
I'm guessing
it's probably closer to 900 feet.

38:58.466 --> 38:59.966
These guys ever come in here?

39:00.801 --> 39:02.218
I wouldn't know,

39:02.261 --> 39:03.803
but I can keep an eye out if you want.

39:03.929 --> 39:05.764
- Yeah, we'd appreciate that.
- You bet.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.726
You know, your guys could
drive up anytime, use their laptop,

39:09.769 --> 39:11.770
and never even get out of the car.

39:11.896 --> 39:14.606
- Up to 900 feet?
- Give or take.

39:14.732 --> 39:16.316
Further if there's an antenna
within range.

39:16.442 --> 39:17.776
What would that do?

39:17.818 --> 39:19.611
Boost the signal by a couple of miles.

39:21.989 --> 39:23.907
What are you thinking?

39:23.949 --> 39:26.076
I want to bring in some unis,
have them fan out,

39:26.118 --> 39:28.953
canvass the surrounding area,
see what they come up with.

39:29.789 --> 39:32.457
Louis, I'd buy you a beer,
but it has been a long day.

39:33.459 --> 39:35.752
Well, thanks. I have plans anyway.

39:47.598 --> 39:48.640
Wow!

39:51.310 --> 39:53.186
People love their games.

39:53.813 --> 39:55.647
- There's a lot of money in it.
- Yeah.

39:55.856 --> 39:57.148
I guess.

39:59.985 --> 40:04.489
You have quite the collection

40:05.658 --> 40:07.367
of collections.

40:10.204 --> 40:11.287
Yeah, I don't...

40:11.330 --> 40:13.540
I don't let a lot of people in here.

40:13.666 --> 40:15.542
It's kind of obvious

40:15.668 --> 40:17.502
I'm overcompensating for something.

40:19.672 --> 40:21.506
I've been known to collect.

40:21.841 --> 40:23.049
Yeah?

40:23.676 --> 40:26.803
I went through an '80s phase
in high school.

40:26.846 --> 40:30.890
I had a zillion
of those black rubber bracelets.

40:31.892 --> 40:33.351
Wore them like body armour.

40:35.187 --> 40:37.230
- So...
- So...

40:37.356 --> 40:39.482
weird, I understand.

40:41.735 --> 40:42.861
But why did you blow me off?

40:44.738 --> 40:46.239
I was...

40:47.199 --> 40:50.827
I was trying to be respectful
of Sergeant Batista,

40:50.870 --> 40:54.706
AKA your brother, who happens to
carry a very large gun, by the way.

40:56.834 --> 41:00.670
He sort of gently suggested
that I back off.

41:01.255 --> 41:02.922
He scared you.

41:03.757 --> 41:05.383
Does it make me a pussy if I say yes?

41:05.426 --> 41:07.760
It makes you

41:07.887 --> 41:08.887
honest.

41:57.394 --> 42:00.396
There's another door along that side
at the west narthex,

42:00.439 --> 42:03.775
and a door at the very end,
just off the sacristy.

42:05.277 --> 42:06.945
But you always go
in the main entrance?

42:06.987 --> 42:08.947
- We both do.
- Then go in that way.

42:09.990 --> 42:11.741
And then what?

42:12.493 --> 42:16.079
Just talk to him,
tell him you made a mistake,

42:16.121 --> 42:17.163
that you're sorry.

42:17.289 --> 42:18.623
Keep him engaged.

42:19.124 --> 42:21.668
- And what will you do?
- I'll go in the back way.

42:24.296 --> 42:25.296
And then?

42:26.757 --> 42:28.424
It's better you don't know.

42:31.303 --> 42:32.845
You don't trust me.

42:32.972 --> 42:35.640
- Oh, it's not that.
- No, I understand.

42:36.684 --> 42:38.101
Gellar's too smart.

42:38.352 --> 42:39.978
I'd just give it away.

42:40.813 --> 42:43.106
Just do what you have to do.

42:45.985 --> 42:47.318
I will.

43:21.061 --> 43:22.729
Hello, Travis.

43:23.689 --> 43:25.523
Professor Gellar.

43:26.859 --> 43:29.819
I'm kind of surprised
you haven't burst into flames.

43:32.031 --> 43:33.740
God is very kind.

43:35.409 --> 43:37.201
God doesn't want to hurt me.

43:38.829 --> 43:42.206
Don't fucking tell me
what God wants or doesn't want.

43:43.417 --> 43:45.501
You have no idea.

43:46.837 --> 43:48.046
You're wrong.

43:48.922 --> 43:51.341
I don't believe
in a God of violence...

43:51.383 --> 43:53.217
Then go read your bible.

43:53.552 --> 43:57.847
Because God promises that
the devious tongue will be cut out,

43:57.890 --> 43:59.849
and he will tear you limb from limb

44:00.517 --> 44:03.436
and destroy thee forever.

44:03.729 --> 44:06.272
Repent your sins, Travis,

44:06.398 --> 44:10.568
or you will burn for all eternity.

44:11.028 --> 44:14.572
I have only tried to do what I thought
was right, what I thought...

44:14.698 --> 44:15.740
No!

44:17.910 --> 44:20.787
God has given you so many chances,

44:20.913 --> 44:24.082
and you disappoint him
time after time.

44:24.917 --> 44:26.584
But he loves you.

44:28.253 --> 44:30.797
He truly loves you.

44:32.299 --> 44:34.759
He's gonna give you one more chance.

44:36.762 --> 44:39.722
And all you have to do
is listen to me.

44:42.601 --> 44:44.102
Come to me.

45:04.998 --> 45:08.584
You've got a lot riding on
this second chance for Travis.

45:09.628 --> 45:11.087
It's up to him
what he does with his life

45:11.130 --> 45:12.630
once I'm done with Gellar.

45:12.673 --> 45:14.132
What about your life?

45:15.134 --> 45:16.259
My life?

45:16.301 --> 45:18.261
Dexter, the police
are closing in on Gellar.

45:18.303 --> 45:19.804
You're taking a risk here.

45:19.930 --> 45:22.640
This isn't just about Travis.
You're not that unselfish.

45:23.183 --> 45:25.184
I'm more than you ever thought I'd be.

45:25.978 --> 45:27.979
So if you remove
Travis's dark passenger,

45:28.105 --> 45:29.939
what are you getting out of this?

45:31.275 --> 45:32.650
Maybe

45:32.693 --> 45:35.319
I can learn to control my own.

45:35.446 --> 45:38.030
Maybe I can be

45:38.157 --> 45:39.323
better.

45:39.366 --> 45:41.784
A better what? A better person?

45:41.827 --> 45:43.661
I don't care about
being a better person.

45:43.787 --> 45:44.954
It's too late for that.

45:44.997 --> 45:46.664
Then what do you care about?

45:51.003 --> 45:52.712
A better father to my son.

45:55.549 --> 45:57.508
Is that so surprising to you?

46:02.306 --> 46:05.391
I want to be a better father

46:05.517 --> 46:07.226
for Harrison.

46:14.193 --> 46:15.902
I have work to do.

47:12.417 --> 47:13.709
Travis.

47:15.754 --> 47:17.380
He's still breathing.

47:17.422 --> 47:18.714
Travis.

47:19.925 --> 47:21.759
Where is Gellar?

48:55.395 --> 48:56.729
Gellar.

49:02.861 --> 49:05.196
He's been dead all along.

49:08.867 --> 49:10.701
Did Travis act alone?

49:14.206 --> 49:16.707
Did Travis

49:16.750 --> 49:19.085
kill all those people?
