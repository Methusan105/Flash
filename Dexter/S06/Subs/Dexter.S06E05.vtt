00:09.347 --> 00:10.764
Previously on Dexter...

00:10.807 --> 00:13.017
So far, our killer
has given us three tableaus.

00:13.518 --> 00:14.768
The intestines on the scale,

00:14.978 --> 00:17.271
the snakes victim,
and the four horsemen.

00:17.439 --> 00:20.149
What about the numbers
we found on the body? 1237 and 1242.

00:20.275 --> 00:21.775
He's counting up to something.

00:22.444 --> 00:24.278
Maybe it's to the end of the world.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.031
- Dexter.
- Sam, what are you doing here?

00:27.115 --> 00:28.157
Brother Sam?

00:28.283 --> 00:30.159
Are you guys, like, friends now?

00:30.618 --> 00:32.036
We have a lead.

00:32.120 --> 00:34.204
This Revelation expert, James Gellar.

00:34.289 --> 00:36.790
The professor,
from the University of Tallahassee?

00:36.958 --> 00:39.460
Looks like we just found
our number one person of interest.

00:39.961 --> 00:41.712
You're going out with that woman,
aren't you?

00:41.838 --> 00:43.297
You knew this was gonna happen.

00:43.631 --> 00:45.132
She's part of God's plan now.

00:46.009 --> 00:48.385
Is this Doomsday number two?

02:48.089 --> 02:49.173
During the Middle Ages,

02:49.257 --> 02:52.259
it was believed that the outcome
of nearly all earthly events

02:52.302 --> 02:54.428
was decided by angels,

02:54.512 --> 02:56.430
either light or dark.

02:58.808 --> 03:00.767
I'm quite certain
that face I saw in the crowd

03:00.852 --> 03:02.936
was of the dark variety.

03:09.861 --> 03:12.613
Unfortunately, he's chosen
to remain anonymous.

03:12.697 --> 03:14.156
He left no trace DNA,

03:14.282 --> 03:17.367
no sweat, no saliva, no prints.

03:41.643 --> 03:43.310
A small repair.

03:47.315 --> 03:49.524
Something skin-like.

03:55.531 --> 03:57.407
Not your normal glue.

03:58.660 --> 04:00.327
Despite his wish to remain hidden,

04:00.370 --> 04:04.164
I may find a way to yank him
out of the shadows after all.

04:24.519 --> 04:26.353
Eyes on God, not me.

04:30.733 --> 04:33.694
- And all God's people said, "Amen".
- Amen.

04:33.736 --> 04:35.195
Help me up.

04:39.367 --> 04:41.535
It's time to do a little hunting.

04:42.578 --> 04:44.371
I thought that we had some time.

04:45.206 --> 04:46.873
You still don't hear him.

04:49.711 --> 04:52.212
I've been fasting and praying
for days,

04:52.255 --> 04:55.257
and all I can hear
is the sound of my own voice

04:55.383 --> 04:56.717
banging around my head.

04:56.884 --> 04:59.052
God remains silent to me.

04:59.095 --> 05:01.388
It's a good thing I'm around,

05:02.056 --> 05:05.892
cos we have to find
the whore of Babylon.

05:14.402 --> 05:15.777
I was right about the glue,

05:15.903 --> 05:19.781
a polyvinyl acetate polymer
dissolved in toluene.

05:29.167 --> 05:30.917
And the backing is calfskin.

05:32.003 --> 05:35.130
Together they're used
in ancient manuscript restoration.

05:36.424 --> 05:39.009
Dude, your sister, briefing room, now.

05:39.093 --> 05:41.928
OK, thanks. I'll be there in a minute.

05:42.847 --> 05:44.639
This is no amateur.

05:47.518 --> 05:49.644
Thank you for joining us, Dexter.

05:49.771 --> 05:51.271
OK, everyone, let's get started.

05:51.314 --> 05:54.107
Our victim is Erin Baer, 29.

05:54.150 --> 05:57.194
She worked at the Glass House CafÃ©
at the Miami Cultural Centre.

05:57.445 --> 05:58.779
Miami Cultural Centre,

05:58.863 --> 06:01.323
full of ancient artefacts
in need of repair.

06:01.449 --> 06:03.492
I want unis
plastering Gellar's picture

06:03.618 --> 06:04.618
all over the area.

06:04.702 --> 06:06.119
Maybe someone got eyes on him there.

06:06.204 --> 06:07.829
- I'll take lead on that.
- Great.

06:08.039 --> 06:09.790
Where are we on
the Revelation aspect of this?

06:10.291 --> 06:12.459
Between the trumpet flowers
placed around her,

06:12.502 --> 06:14.961
the locusts,
and the iconography of an angel,

06:15.004 --> 06:16.963
our Doomsday Killer
was most likely referencing

06:17.006 --> 06:19.007
Revelation, chapters 8 through 10.

06:19.133 --> 06:20.550
Any idea why he changed it up?

06:20.635 --> 06:23.470
Why our entrance triggered her death?

06:23.513 --> 06:26.139
Normally a serial killer
wants to do the kill themselves.

06:26.224 --> 06:27.307
It's the whole point, right?

06:29.644 --> 06:32.813
There's a passage which reads,

06:32.897 --> 06:34.648
"You must go back
and report your message

06:34.732 --> 06:38.568
"to many peoples and nations
and languages and kings."

06:38.820 --> 06:40.153
So I'm guessing we're those people.

06:40.988 --> 06:43.990
It seems his message is more important
than the thrill.

06:44.033 --> 06:45.826
Tell me you got something
from the ME's office.

06:45.910 --> 06:48.829
She found traces of spermicide
in Erin Baer.

06:48.913 --> 06:51.206
The ME's take
is that the victim had sex

06:51.332 --> 06:52.833
with someone
who used a spermicidal condom.

06:52.917 --> 06:54.751
So what are we thinking,
that she just happened to have sex

06:54.836 --> 06:56.169
before she was kidnapped?

06:56.212 --> 06:58.839
Or maybe she met Gellar,
had sex with him,

06:58.923 --> 07:01.174
and things got ugly for her.

07:01.217 --> 07:02.759
Or maybe it was Gellar's accomplice.

07:02.844 --> 07:04.219
Can't say for sure either way.

07:04.345 --> 07:07.222
As far as we know,
she didn't know Gellar.

07:07.682 --> 07:09.099
What did we get on Gellar's last gig?

07:09.183 --> 07:10.350
I've been trying to contact

07:10.435 --> 07:14.104
his last teacher assistant,
Carissa Porter.

07:14.188 --> 07:17.732
But so far University of Tallahassee
has given us shit-all.

07:17.859 --> 07:21.111
University's not exactly thrilled
to be linked to Professor Nutbag.

07:21.237 --> 07:22.529
Let's go up there
and make it clear to them

07:22.613 --> 07:24.364
that we don't give a shit
whether they're thrilled or not.

07:24.449 --> 07:25.740
I'm on it.

07:25.867 --> 07:27.200
Lab boys, what do we have?

07:28.911 --> 07:30.537
I've got locusts.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.914
But the necropsy on them
turned up jack and shit.

07:33.207 --> 07:34.624
All they ate was local greenery.

07:34.876 --> 07:37.043
What about the dead fish
outside the angel crime scene?

07:37.086 --> 07:39.463
All local.
You can catch them off any pier,

07:39.547 --> 07:42.382
buy them at any fish market.

07:42.467 --> 07:44.968
But we did find...

07:47.889 --> 07:48.930
...another number.

07:49.056 --> 07:51.391
This one lodged in Erin's oesophagus.

07:51.476 --> 07:53.393
1244.

07:53.478 --> 07:55.270
Same paper and ink as the other two.

07:56.272 --> 07:58.899
1237, 1242, 1244.

07:58.941 --> 08:01.735
I did a check into that number's usage
in the Book of Revelation...

08:01.777 --> 08:03.069
Excuse me.

08:03.446 --> 08:04.571
Who's this?

08:06.741 --> 08:08.783
Louis Greene,
the latest and greatest intern

08:08.910 --> 08:09.951
from my forensics class.

08:10.077 --> 08:11.745
He's up to speed
on the whole Doomsday case.

08:11.829 --> 08:13.413
- What happened to the blonde?
- She's gone.

08:16.417 --> 08:17.792
Go on, Louis.

08:19.253 --> 08:23.256
Yeah, well,
numerology is all over Revelation,

08:23.299 --> 08:24.925
but the only number
that's repeatedly referenced

08:25.009 --> 08:28.178
that's in the thousands is 1,260.

08:28.262 --> 08:30.180
1260. You think
that's what he's counting up to?

08:30.264 --> 08:33.016
If so, we've only got 15 days left.

08:33.351 --> 08:34.434
And then what?

08:34.519 --> 08:35.769
I don't know.

08:35.853 --> 08:37.854
End of the world,
the rapture, Armageddon.

08:38.105 --> 08:40.190
More apocalyptic bullshit.

08:40.441 --> 08:42.442
Dex, please tell me
you have something we can use.

08:42.527 --> 08:44.319
I hate lying to my sister, but...

08:44.779 --> 08:46.863
Sorry, nothing on the wings.

08:48.491 --> 08:50.116
OK, let's keep at it.

08:50.201 --> 08:52.702
Let's find this jizzbucket Gellar.

08:55.122 --> 08:56.706
Class dismissed.

09:01.128 --> 09:05.048
Hey. All that tippity-tappy stuff
you do on the laptop,

09:05.132 --> 09:07.717
you're kind of a whizz
with computers, aren't you?

09:07.969 --> 09:10.470
I tool around.
I've done some consulting.

09:10.513 --> 09:11.888
I've made a couple RPGs.

09:12.056 --> 09:14.724
Role-playing games. Nice.

09:14.809 --> 09:19.354
Any of them feature Amazon women
of immense strength, by any chance?

09:22.066 --> 09:23.984
- No.
- That's OK.

09:24.485 --> 09:26.695
Anyway, you mind?

09:26.821 --> 09:28.196
Yeah, yeah.

09:35.663 --> 09:36.830
Ice Truck Killer?

09:38.165 --> 09:40.500
Let's keep it down, all right?

09:42.003 --> 09:43.336
It was stolen from our evidence room,

09:43.421 --> 09:45.171
and if word gets out
we're losing evidence,

09:45.214 --> 09:47.674
this department's street cred
goes straight down the shitter.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.259
Why don't you just get it back
from the seller?

09:49.343 --> 09:51.845
I tried. You have to give the site
what you're selling

09:51.887 --> 09:53.555
before they agree to auction it.

09:53.681 --> 09:55.849
- Fuckers.
- I see.

09:55.933 --> 09:58.393
So, my question to you is...

09:58.519 --> 10:01.104
Can I make this problem go away?

10:02.273 --> 10:03.690
I'll look into it.

10:14.702 --> 10:17.245
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- A minute.

10:20.708 --> 10:22.542
- This is awkward.
- What?

10:24.128 --> 10:25.295
The engagement ring.

10:28.382 --> 10:30.383
Fuck me in the ear,
I never gave it back to you.

10:30.718 --> 10:33.928
Yeah, it's just that
I got 30 days to return it,

10:34.055 --> 10:35.555
and since we're not gonna use...

10:35.598 --> 10:37.557
I'll get it back to you. I'm so sorry.

10:37.642 --> 10:40.143
It's OK. I mean, you've had
a lot on your plate lately.

10:46.025 --> 10:47.192
I better go.

10:47.735 --> 10:50.403
Got some professors to harass.

11:00.331 --> 11:01.665
- Hello?
- Jamie, it's Debra.

11:01.749 --> 11:03.083
I need a little favour from you.

11:03.167 --> 11:06.252
About two weeks ago,
I brought a ring box home

11:06.337 --> 11:07.462
with an engagement ring in it.

11:07.546 --> 11:09.172
You lost an engagement ring?

11:10.675 --> 11:13.343
I left it on Harrison's side
of the apartment. Have you seen it?

11:14.220 --> 11:15.637
No.

11:16.138 --> 11:17.889
Do you think you could look for it?

11:17.973 --> 11:22.394
I'd really appreciate all the help
I can get right now. Thank you. Bye.

11:26.982 --> 11:29.567
- Hey, Dex.
- Sam.

11:29.735 --> 11:31.736
Hey. Hey, how your little man doing?

11:31.821 --> 11:34.447
He's doing great.
You should come by and see him.

11:34.532 --> 11:36.908
Yeah, OK. I'd love to. Yeah.

11:38.285 --> 11:40.036
How about tonight?

11:41.580 --> 11:42.956
Great, great.

11:43.249 --> 11:44.708
Well, say 8:00?

11:45.084 --> 11:47.836
- Perfect.
- Cool. Good.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.547
You didn't come all the way out here
just to ask about Harrison, did you?

11:50.631 --> 11:52.132
Yeah, I wish.

11:53.175 --> 11:56.886
Some of Nick's old crew,
they came by and shot up the shop.

11:57.930 --> 12:00.724
- Anybody hurt?
- No, it was an after-hours thing.

12:00.808 --> 12:04.185
It's just bullet holes
in the garage door. That's about it.

12:04.270 --> 12:06.438
I called the cops,
but nobody showed up,

12:06.522 --> 12:09.315
so without the cop report,
the insurance don't do shit.

12:09.483 --> 12:11.901
- You ever think of moving?
- No.

12:13.404 --> 12:15.613
God put me there
to do what I'm doing, man.

12:15.698 --> 12:17.157
I don't scare off.

12:17.241 --> 12:18.491
You're a brave man, Sam.

12:18.576 --> 12:20.368
O.G. For G-O-D, know what I'm saying?

12:20.578 --> 12:21.703
Yep.

12:21.787 --> 12:23.121
Nope.

12:23.205 --> 12:25.540
- See you tonight.
- All right.

12:34.592 --> 12:36.134
Excuse me, do you work here?

12:36.218 --> 12:38.178
Read my tag. I'm a docent.

12:38.262 --> 12:39.888
How may I help you?

12:39.972 --> 12:42.265
I accidentally poked a hole

12:42.349 --> 12:44.100
in a painting that belongs to my boss.

12:44.185 --> 12:46.102
I put my elbow right through it.

12:46.479 --> 12:47.812
I know. I'm such an idiot.

12:47.897 --> 12:51.441
- Is there someone I can talk to...
- Follow me.

12:51.525 --> 12:52.692
OK.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.154
- Here at the museum...
- Right in here.

12:56.238 --> 12:57.614
- Thank you.
...a lot of the action

12:57.698 --> 12:59.574
is behind the scenes.

12:59.658 --> 13:01.034
For nearly 35 years...

13:01.118 --> 13:02.869
I'm sorry. This isn't exactly...

13:02.953 --> 13:04.496
Have you seen this before?

13:05.706 --> 13:08.124
- No.
- Well, sit down and watch it.

13:08.209 --> 13:10.543
It's very informative.
That's why we made it.

13:10.669 --> 13:13.213
...staining, colourations.

13:13.297 --> 13:15.465
They can make the art look

13:15.549 --> 13:18.468
almost exactly the way
the artist intended it,

13:18.552 --> 13:21.012
all while using the same materials

13:21.096 --> 13:23.389
that the artist used
during his or her own lifetime.

13:23.474 --> 13:25.350
You wouldn't believe
how people end up treating

13:25.434 --> 13:28.812
what can end up
being priceless works of art,

13:28.896 --> 13:31.439
especially in
our paper conservation laboratory,

13:31.941 --> 13:33.483
where we're equipped with...

13:35.820 --> 13:37.028
It's him.

13:38.197 --> 13:40.657
The face I'm looking for.
He works here.

13:40.741 --> 13:43.034
That's how he knew
how to create those wings.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.123
Morgan.

13:49.542 --> 13:51.668
This is Detective Anderson.

13:51.752 --> 13:53.545
Dispatch gave me your number.

13:53.629 --> 13:56.172
We need a blood guy on the double.
We're out at Miami Shores.

13:56.257 --> 13:59.050
1588, northeast end of 2nd Street.

13:59.218 --> 14:00.301
Got it.

14:00.386 --> 14:04.472
Using radiograms
and infrared imaging...

14:05.891 --> 14:09.102
Do you happen to know the name of...

14:09.186 --> 14:10.937
Worst docent ever.

14:34.086 --> 14:35.837
What do we got?

14:35.921 --> 14:37.046
Male and female.

14:37.381 --> 14:38.548
Forties.

14:38.632 --> 14:40.466
Pictures on the walls
and rings on their fingers

14:40.551 --> 14:42.594
make them man and wife.

14:44.471 --> 14:47.640
Three gunshots.
One to the chest, two to the stomach.

14:47.725 --> 14:49.642
A fresh cut on the face
not from a gunshot.

14:49.977 --> 14:52.687
- Maybe the fall.
- No, he fell back.

14:52.771 --> 14:55.356
It looks more like a glancing blow.

15:03.490 --> 15:04.908
Cell phone.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.912
Maybe she threw it at him.

15:09.413 --> 15:10.705
That's not the wife.

15:15.669 --> 15:17.378
Single gunshot to the chest,

15:17.463 --> 15:19.839
through and through,
shot at close range.

15:20.549 --> 15:22.050
No gun in sight.

15:22.134 --> 15:23.718
Give me a hand.

15:29.558 --> 15:30.725
We have our shooter.

15:33.896 --> 15:37.482
The husband leaves, forgets his phone,
the wife finds the pictures...

15:37.566 --> 15:39.233
Wife throws phone
at two-timing bastard.

15:39.318 --> 15:40.944
And shoots him.

15:41.028 --> 15:42.111
Three times.

15:42.196 --> 15:44.530
She realises what she did.
She's distraught.

15:44.615 --> 15:47.408
She turns the gun to her chest
and blam.

15:48.035 --> 15:49.661
Murder-suicide.

15:49.745 --> 15:51.496
Took you all of 15 seconds
to solve that.

15:51.789 --> 15:53.081
It was a pretty easy one.

15:54.249 --> 15:56.084
Hey, how the hell does
a pro like you stand working

15:56.168 --> 15:58.920
with the rest of
these Miami Homicide chuckleheads?

15:59.254 --> 16:03.091
No, they're actually pretty good,
especially my sister Deb.

16:03.884 --> 16:05.510
You probably know her
as Lieutenant Morgan.

16:07.054 --> 16:09.931
- Excuse me, Detective?
- Hey, you can't be in here.

16:10.057 --> 16:13.559
No, no, no. It's OK.
I own the place. They just...

16:13.644 --> 16:15.103
Oh, my God.

16:16.063 --> 16:17.188
Can I help you?

16:17.272 --> 16:19.774
I don't mean to sound crass,

16:19.858 --> 16:21.109
but how long will they stay here?

16:21.193 --> 16:22.235
Till we finish.

16:22.319 --> 16:24.028
Then the ME will remove the bodies.

16:24.321 --> 16:27.532
And then how long will it take
for you to clean it up?

16:27.616 --> 16:29.534
Do I look like your maid?

16:53.726 --> 16:55.393
It's hard not to look.

16:56.645 --> 16:58.229
What? I'm sorry.

16:58.313 --> 16:59.689
It's OK.

17:00.816 --> 17:03.443
God gave man the desire
to look at women.

17:03.527 --> 17:06.738
It's the devil
who made them dress like that.

17:06.822 --> 17:09.824
- That's not it.
- What?

17:10.743 --> 17:13.494
It's sad.
All of these people are doomed,

17:13.579 --> 17:14.996
and they don't even know it.

17:15.080 --> 17:16.414
It is sad.

17:19.251 --> 17:21.419
You're very sensitive, Travis.

17:21.503 --> 17:23.212
That's why you've been chosen.

17:28.469 --> 17:29.635
Is that you?

17:40.939 --> 17:42.190
It's not bad, huh?

17:42.274 --> 17:44.233
They're calling you
"The Doomsday Killer".

17:44.318 --> 17:46.152
It's kind of catchy.

17:48.113 --> 17:50.490
I probably should stay out of sight.

17:51.825 --> 17:55.703
You may have to find our whore
without me.

17:55.788 --> 17:58.831
- By myself? I can't.
- Yes, you can.

17:59.541 --> 18:01.084
I believe in you.

18:01.168 --> 18:03.002
God believes in you.

18:28.112 --> 18:30.822
I have a face. Now I just need a name.

18:43.085 --> 18:46.379
"Ancient manuscript restoration
and conservation."

18:54.596 --> 18:56.556
No arrests, no warrants.

19:00.644 --> 19:03.813
No moving violations,
not even a parking ticket.

19:03.897 --> 19:06.357
Appears you live a quiet little life

19:06.525 --> 19:08.901
on 1742 Vanderan Street.

19:11.655 --> 19:13.739
Ready to see Brother Sam?

19:16.869 --> 19:19.245
- Hey.
- Hey, Sam. Come on in.

19:20.122 --> 19:22.456
Let me take those for you.

19:22.541 --> 19:23.749
Nice.

19:24.793 --> 19:26.878
Nice place you got here, man.

19:26.962 --> 19:28.212
Thanks.

19:29.423 --> 19:31.340
Hey, little man. How you doing?

19:31.675 --> 19:34.468
He's sleepy. It's about his bedtime.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.679
I'm right on time then, cos...

19:38.473 --> 19:39.599
it's his bedtime, too.

19:40.475 --> 19:42.435
Maybe you could put him
to sleep for me?

19:42.561 --> 19:43.811
Yeah?

19:43.896 --> 19:46.022
Can you say "thank you", Harrison?

19:47.691 --> 19:50.276
Thank you, Harrison, for helping me
put my little man to sleep.

19:50.360 --> 19:53.321
- Either way, it's very nice of you.
- Not a problem.

19:53.405 --> 19:55.156
How's he doing after the surgery?

19:55.240 --> 19:57.408
- He's doing great.
- That's good.

19:57.993 --> 20:00.077
I'm gonna put him to bed.
I'll just be a few minutes.

20:00.162 --> 20:02.538
All right. Good night, little man.

20:02.664 --> 20:05.124
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

20:05.209 --> 20:08.711
And now, I guess,
Sam and I are gonna hang out.

20:11.256 --> 20:13.507
That's a cute boy you got there, man.

20:13.592 --> 20:15.009
Yeah, he's a keeper.

20:17.304 --> 20:19.847
It must be kind of hard for you, man.

20:19.932 --> 20:25.019
Just get up every day, leave,
and go do what you do.

20:27.231 --> 20:28.564
Do what I do?

20:28.732 --> 20:30.233
Homicide every day.

20:32.110 --> 20:34.028
How you end up in that, man?

20:34.112 --> 20:36.739
My dad was a cop.
I just sort of fell into it.

20:36.865 --> 20:40.826
Doesn't sound like the kind of thing
somebody just fall into.

20:42.621 --> 20:44.121
What really happened?

20:46.083 --> 20:49.418
I guess in a weird way
I was sort of drawn to it,

20:49.503 --> 20:51.963
- the blood work.
- Why?

20:56.635 --> 21:00.137
When I was three,
I watched my own mother get killed.

21:03.141 --> 21:04.767
Something like that stays with you.

21:05.352 --> 21:06.852
That's rough, man. I'm sorry.

21:06.937 --> 21:11.023
Seeing that so young,
the darkness got in deep.

21:12.651 --> 21:14.777
Never left me. Never will.

21:15.320 --> 21:18.406
You remember anything before she died?

21:18.532 --> 21:20.324
I don't know.

21:22.452 --> 21:25.997
I remember at night
she would wrap me in a quilt

21:26.081 --> 21:27.957
and sing songs to me.

21:29.751 --> 21:32.878
Sometimes she'd trace her finger
along my ear.

21:35.257 --> 21:36.465
Tickling me.

21:36.591 --> 21:38.342
Must have made you feel good.

21:38.468 --> 21:39.719
It did.

21:40.137 --> 21:41.595
She was sharing that light with you.

21:42.389 --> 21:43.639
It's with you now.

21:44.224 --> 21:45.558
It's inside you.

21:45.976 --> 21:47.810
Think you got the wrong guy.

21:51.898 --> 21:54.984
You know, the good book tells us

21:55.068 --> 21:58.112
that there's no darkness
that the light can't overcome.

21:58.196 --> 22:01.657
So all the darkness that
you think you got inside you...

22:01.742 --> 22:03.909
- Yeah?
- All it takes is just

22:04.953 --> 22:07.079
a little bit of light
to keep it at bay.

22:07.956 --> 22:09.248
Believe me. I know.

22:12.252 --> 22:13.669
It's like with your son, man.

22:14.421 --> 22:15.463
And see?

22:15.547 --> 22:18.007
I just mention him,
and you just light right up.

22:18.967 --> 22:20.509
I guess I do.

22:20.594 --> 22:24.263
And you're sharing that light with him
every day, all the time.

22:25.599 --> 22:27.224
You really think so?

22:27.392 --> 22:28.559
I see it.

22:30.354 --> 22:32.271
You just got to let it out.

22:40.822 --> 22:42.990
This is really nice, man.

22:45.118 --> 22:47.286
We got to do this again sometime.

23:45.887 --> 23:48.097
Hey! Hey, hey!

23:48.181 --> 23:50.266
Put her down!

23:51.351 --> 23:52.435
Get the fuck out of here!

23:52.561 --> 23:54.145
Help me! Help!

23:56.898 --> 23:58.315
Travis.

23:58.775 --> 24:00.818
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry.

24:02.237 --> 24:05.239
- I couldn't do it. I... I tried.
- It's OK.

24:06.741 --> 24:09.493
Many heroes of the faith
have endured their failures.

24:10.704 --> 24:12.830
God's grace prevailed then, too.

24:13.248 --> 24:14.748
I thought I could do it.

24:17.711 --> 24:19.211
It's my fault really.

24:19.296 --> 24:21.046
I shouldn't have let you
go do this alone.

24:21.715 --> 24:23.299
Tomorrow night,
I'll be there with you.

24:24.134 --> 24:25.634
What about the police?

24:26.553 --> 24:29.722
Do you think God's gonna allow
anything to slow us down now?

24:31.475 --> 24:32.933
You go home,

24:33.977 --> 24:35.394
get some rest.

24:35.479 --> 24:37.396
Tomorrow night, we'll start again.

24:49.075 --> 24:50.659
Tomorrow night.

24:55.290 --> 24:58.083
Brother Sam says
we all have a light inside us.

24:59.753 --> 25:02.254
If I find Travis Marshall
to be guilty,

25:06.760 --> 25:09.220
then I will snuff out his light.

25:27.656 --> 25:28.989
He's neat.

25:29.074 --> 25:31.408
Everything in its right place.

25:39.376 --> 25:42.836
Masters degree in art history
from the University of Tallahassee,

25:42.921 --> 25:45.714
the same place Gellar taught at
before he disappeared.

26:05.902 --> 26:08.237
I understand the urge
to end someone's life,

26:08.321 --> 26:11.824
but what is this fascination
with ending the world?

26:34.264 --> 26:37.558
Looks like the same numbers
we found in the Doomsday victims.

27:02.709 --> 27:05.377
Defacing a Bible.
I'm probably breaking a rule.

27:57.013 --> 27:59.098
Hello, Doomsday Killer.

27:59.265 --> 28:01.684
I swear to God, you're the only cop
I know that drives the speed limit.

28:01.768 --> 28:02.935
That car's not a toy.

28:02.977 --> 28:05.020
In the right conditions,
it'll top 110 easy.

28:05.105 --> 28:06.188
And these weren't
the right conditions?

28:06.272 --> 28:07.439
No.

28:11.361 --> 28:13.445
Is that our professor?

28:13.488 --> 28:14.863
Professor Porter?

28:14.948 --> 28:17.449
- Yes.
- Hi, I'm Detective Quinn.

28:17.492 --> 28:19.827
This is Sergeant Batista.
Miami Metro Homicide.

28:19.953 --> 28:22.538
Doctor Knudson, the department head,
said we'd find you here.

28:22.622 --> 28:23.956
Right.

28:24.124 --> 28:25.541
He told me you were coming.

28:25.875 --> 28:28.293
So you knew Professor Gellar?

28:28.378 --> 28:30.838
I did. But I want to state upfront

28:30.964 --> 28:33.132
that Professor Gellar
didn't have anything to do

28:33.174 --> 28:35.175
with those crazy Revelation killings.

28:35.301 --> 28:36.635
And you know this how?

28:36.803 --> 28:39.304
I was his teacher's assistant
for a year.

28:39.347 --> 28:40.806
He even helped me get my job.

28:40.890 --> 28:42.474
Have you seen him recently?

28:42.517 --> 28:43.809
No, not since he left.

28:44.144 --> 28:46.645
- When was that?
- Three years ago, about.

28:47.313 --> 28:48.897
What about his blog,
The Beginning of the End?

28:48.982 --> 28:50.065
I mean, you have to admit,

28:50.150 --> 28:51.817
there's some pretty crazy stuff
on there,

28:51.901 --> 28:53.360
and a lot of it
is in line with the killings.

28:53.486 --> 28:55.195
He likes to stir up trouble,

28:56.990 --> 28:58.532
make people think.

28:59.325 --> 29:01.368
That's what made everyone love him.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.370
So you loved him?

29:04.831 --> 29:06.039
Was he eccentric?

29:06.166 --> 29:07.249
Yeah.

29:07.333 --> 29:09.042
But he was also smart,

29:09.169 --> 29:10.669
charismatic,

29:10.754 --> 29:12.171
brilliant even.

29:12.255 --> 29:15.340
He saw things between lines of text
that nobody else could.

29:15.717 --> 29:18.385
Being with him
was an incredible adventure.

29:18.511 --> 29:20.179
So you did love him?

29:21.723 --> 29:23.348
- We were close.
- Close?

29:23.391 --> 29:25.434
Smart woman like you, with your looks,

29:25.518 --> 29:27.186
I bet he was hitting on you
all the time.

29:27.228 --> 29:28.437
I mean, fuck, if we worked together,

29:28.521 --> 29:31.356
I'd have a hard time
not wanting to get close to you.

29:31.900 --> 29:34.401
It was more than just a flirtation.

29:35.361 --> 29:36.695
We lived together.

29:37.197 --> 29:38.238
For a while.

29:38.573 --> 29:39.698
You're not together any more.

29:39.783 --> 29:42.034
My year as his TA ended,

29:42.076 --> 29:45.037
he found another cute brunette,
did the same thing with her.

29:45.371 --> 29:47.706
Gellar had a thing
for brunette students?

29:47.791 --> 29:51.084
I found out I was one
in a long line of girls,

29:51.211 --> 29:54.463
but, you know what?
It was no big deal.

29:54.547 --> 29:57.424
I'm glad I got the chance to know him.
He was good to me.

29:57.634 --> 29:59.802
Erin, our angel, was a brunette.

30:01.596 --> 30:06.141
Well...
if by some miracle he contacts you...

30:06.267 --> 30:07.976
You'll be the first one I call,

30:08.061 --> 30:10.729
if only to prove
you have the wrong guy.

30:12.273 --> 30:14.566
Hey... Professor Porter,

30:14.609 --> 30:16.902
we're gonna be
stuck here for the night.

30:16.945 --> 30:19.071
You wouldn't happen to
know of any good spots

30:19.155 --> 30:21.114
where we could get a drink
this evening, would you?

30:21.241 --> 30:22.574
Like some place kind of quiet?

30:22.784 --> 30:24.618
Maybe I do.

30:28.957 --> 30:30.415
Jesus Christ.

30:40.969 --> 30:43.011
Do you always bring your work
home with you?

30:43.096 --> 30:45.347
I can't work for fuck
in my new office.

30:46.015 --> 30:48.767
It's like LaGuerta's perfume
seeped into the walls.

30:48.810 --> 30:50.769
If she ever had a soul,
it's still in there.

30:52.188 --> 30:55.107
Life was so much simpler when
all I had to do was solve murders.

30:55.149 --> 30:56.859
Red to black. What it's all about.

30:56.943 --> 30:58.610
Who did it?

30:58.653 --> 31:00.654
Wife. Murder-suicide.

31:01.948 --> 31:03.031
That brother of yours

31:03.116 --> 31:05.158
solved it like he was
getting a message from the dead.

31:05.285 --> 31:06.702
Yeah, he's something special.

31:07.871 --> 31:09.329
Nice place.

31:10.456 --> 31:12.124
Right by the beach, too.

31:12.292 --> 31:14.835
Nothing like a murder-suicide
to fuck up a great house.

31:14.961 --> 31:16.295
I've seen worse.

31:16.796 --> 31:18.380
Male, 70s,

31:18.464 --> 31:20.632
self-inflicted shotgun
in the brainpan,

31:20.717 --> 31:22.384
which is bad enough,

31:23.136 --> 31:24.469
but he had cats

31:24.804 --> 31:26.638
- and they got hungry.
- Enough said.

31:26.848 --> 31:28.223
Chicago.

31:29.183 --> 31:30.225
Miss it?

31:31.477 --> 31:32.853
Miss the food.

31:33.021 --> 31:35.480
You can't get
a decent hotdog anywhere.

31:36.190 --> 31:38.859
But homicide is homicide.

31:39.360 --> 31:42.362
Yeah. I see the way
you look at people around here.

31:42.655 --> 31:46.158
You got the world's youngest LT,
Batista and his hot rod,

31:46.200 --> 31:47.367
Masuka with...

31:47.493 --> 31:50.370
I made the mistake of going
in his lab unannounced. He was...

31:50.496 --> 31:51.663
Enough said.

31:52.874 --> 31:55.584
He's got some fucked-up shit going on,
but he gets it done.

31:55.668 --> 31:57.336
The same could be said for you.

31:59.672 --> 32:01.006
Good night, Anderson.

32:05.178 --> 32:09.181
I'm grading this paper,
when all of a sudden I realise

32:09.265 --> 32:10.933
I've read this before.

32:11.017 --> 32:12.100
No way.

32:12.185 --> 32:14.770
This dumbass student
changed some words around,

32:14.854 --> 32:17.022
but he plagiarised C.S. Lewis.

32:18.608 --> 32:20.025
C.S. Lewis.

32:21.069 --> 32:23.236
I should arrest this guy right now.
I've got my cuffs on me.

32:23.363 --> 32:24.738
We can go. I mean...

32:24.864 --> 32:28.200
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah? You want another round?

32:29.535 --> 32:31.036
You're not married, are you?

32:31.537 --> 32:32.871
Definitely not.

32:33.247 --> 32:34.539
Then I want another drink.

32:34.874 --> 32:36.208
Another round, please.

32:36.250 --> 32:37.542
Thank you.

32:37.585 --> 32:39.920
Look who shows up
when I'm buying drinks.

32:40.046 --> 32:43.548
Listen, we got a long ride
down to Miami tomorrow.

32:43.633 --> 32:44.925
You want to call it?

32:46.094 --> 32:47.260
One second.

32:52.392 --> 32:54.768
You can call it if you want,
but I'm about to cross

32:54.894 --> 32:57.729
a fucking college professor
off my bucket list.

32:57.814 --> 33:00.399
Be careful, partner.
She's part of our investigation.

33:00.441 --> 33:02.567
No, she's not.
She's just like a nice person

33:02.652 --> 33:03.902
we talked to, you know what I mean?

33:05.071 --> 33:08.073
There's like 20 other women here
you could fuck.

33:08.116 --> 33:11.326
I've already spent like
80 bucks on her, though, you know,

33:11.411 --> 33:14.746
so it's like, I don't want to
have to start all over again.

33:14.789 --> 33:15.998
Get out of here. Come on.

33:16.082 --> 33:18.417
We'll see each other
in the morning, all right?

33:18.918 --> 33:21.586
- You're unbelievable.
- Yeah, go on, baby.

33:24.132 --> 33:25.590
And there they are.

33:27.927 --> 33:29.136
Thank you.

33:29.262 --> 33:30.595
Here's to you.

34:05.798 --> 34:07.215
Hi, buddy.

34:08.134 --> 34:09.968
Are you going to sleep?

34:10.970 --> 34:13.472
Are you going to bed? Are you tired?

34:15.058 --> 34:17.809
- Found your ring.
- Oh, jeez, you're a lifesaver.

34:18.519 --> 34:20.312
Deb, really?

34:24.192 --> 34:25.525
Shit.

34:28.071 --> 34:29.654
He came in here
to give you a good night kiss,

34:29.739 --> 34:31.198
not look at pictures of dead bodies.

34:31.324 --> 34:33.658
Yeah, well, maybe
if you gave me a little warning.

34:33.743 --> 34:35.660
Isn't there anywhere else
you can do this, Deb?

34:36.204 --> 34:37.662
Right now? No. Nowhere.

34:37.872 --> 34:39.748
Really? The lieutenant
doesn't get an office?

34:40.500 --> 34:43.001
I don't like my office.
I like to work here.

34:43.503 --> 34:46.004
Harrison's got an entire
goddamn apartment over there.

34:46.089 --> 34:47.172
I've got jack shit.

34:47.215 --> 34:49.091
He just wanted to say good night.

34:49.175 --> 34:51.885
I know that. Next time,
why don't you call me over there?

34:52.011 --> 34:53.512
I will. From now on.

34:54.055 --> 34:58.225
And maybe you could keep
the photos on Dexter's desk,

34:58.351 --> 34:59.684
so Harrison won't see them.

34:59.769 --> 35:01.561
Again, if you were doing your job,

35:01.687 --> 35:03.188
this wouldn't have happened
in the first place.

35:03.689 --> 35:04.731
My job?

35:04.857 --> 35:06.024
- Yes.
- Really?

35:06.109 --> 35:09.236
You mean my job isn't to be
your fucking maid?

35:10.071 --> 35:12.614
- I found it in Harrison's toy box.
- Thank you. Thanks.

35:12.698 --> 35:14.074
You're really lucky he didn't eat it.

35:14.200 --> 35:15.200
Please.

35:15.284 --> 35:16.701
- Thank God you're home.
- Hello.

35:16.744 --> 35:18.370
She needs to do a better job
of watching Harrison.

35:18.454 --> 35:20.247
She is bringing home
all of these horrible pictures.

35:20.373 --> 35:22.124
Would it be weird if I just left?

35:22.208 --> 35:23.708
- Please, Deb.
...take care of this?

35:24.794 --> 35:26.211
Hey, Jamie,

35:26.254 --> 35:28.547
if Harrison's down for the night,
maybe you should just go on home.

35:29.966 --> 35:31.716
- See you tomorrow.
- OK.

35:36.389 --> 35:37.639
Are you taking her side on this?

35:37.723 --> 35:41.434
No, I'll talk to her, too, tomorrow,
but, Deb...

35:43.146 --> 35:45.605
you gotta admit,
this isn't good for Harrison.

35:46.566 --> 35:48.108
Yeah. I'm a mess.

35:50.236 --> 35:51.903
Maybe I do need to go to therapy.

35:53.072 --> 35:54.239
No more than me.

35:55.324 --> 35:56.741
Am I that fucked up?

36:06.502 --> 36:08.920
Bet you they don't even know
each other's names.

36:11.424 --> 36:13.466
No wonder he wants us to end it all.

36:17.430 --> 36:18.763
These two.

36:19.015 --> 36:20.682
Follow them.

36:20.766 --> 36:22.851
Are you sure? He looks pretty big.

36:27.857 --> 36:30.275
He's not as big as God.

36:35.198 --> 36:36.448
Go on.

36:36.616 --> 36:40.327
Get the girl before somebody comes.
Put her in the trunk.

36:47.293 --> 36:48.501
Help me.

36:49.670 --> 36:50.837
I'm sorry.

37:01.807 --> 37:03.308
See how easy it is?

37:08.522 --> 37:09.648
Come on.

37:15.988 --> 37:18.323
Hey, come on in.

37:19.492 --> 37:21.660
- Where's Quinn?
- Bathroom.

37:21.702 --> 37:23.161
I'll get him.

37:31.420 --> 37:33.380
Joey, your friend's here.

38:24.223 --> 38:26.599
"The Alpha and Omega
of the Enesserette."

38:56.672 --> 38:59.257
Professor Porter,
could you come out here?

39:03.596 --> 39:04.763
Excuse me, what are you doing?

39:04.847 --> 39:07.515
These drawings, they were Gellar's?

39:07.808 --> 39:08.850
You can't just start
picking through...

39:08.934 --> 39:10.268
Did Gellar do this?

39:11.604 --> 39:13.521
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God.

39:13.856 --> 39:16.316
- Did he?
- Well, yeah. Let me see.

39:22.114 --> 39:23.448
Holy shit.

39:35.294 --> 39:38.797
- Can I help you?
- Michelle Ross.

39:39.715 --> 39:41.674
The therapist you've been dodging
for weeks.

39:41.801 --> 39:43.551
Fuck. I'm sorry.

39:43.636 --> 39:45.387
Happens more than you'd think.

39:46.013 --> 39:47.639
I figured since you weren't
coming to my office...

39:47.723 --> 39:49.641
That you would come to mine.

39:50.851 --> 39:52.519
Believe me, I understand.

39:54.980 --> 39:56.981
So we should probably
get down to business, right?

39:57.858 --> 39:59.067
Right here, right now?

40:00.152 --> 40:01.236
Is that OK?

40:03.656 --> 40:04.864
Let's do this.

40:08.160 --> 40:10.495
OK, just to clarify,

40:10.579 --> 40:13.206
this is in reference to
the shooting at Don Aldo's?

40:14.500 --> 40:16.668
Have you been experiencing
any lack of sleep

40:16.752 --> 40:19.754
- from the shooting in question?
- From the shooting, no.

40:20.423 --> 40:22.215
Have you found yourself
dwelling on that day?

40:22.341 --> 40:24.634
No. Who has time?

40:25.845 --> 40:28.012
Have you found it hard to
concentrate on day-to-day tasks

40:28.139 --> 40:30.473
- because of the incident?
- No.

40:32.017 --> 40:34.727
Find yourself drinking
more than you did before the shooting?

40:34.854 --> 40:36.729
Fuck, I don't drink enough.

40:39.692 --> 40:40.984
That was a joke.

40:43.028 --> 40:45.196
Have you been experiencing
any guilt since the shooting?

40:45.906 --> 40:48.867
No. If he walked through that door,
I'd shoot him right now.

40:53.456 --> 40:54.581
Great.

40:55.374 --> 40:57.208
So it sounds like everything's fine.

40:57.251 --> 41:00.795
Yeah. Everything's great
with the shooting.

41:00.880 --> 41:03.882
It's just everything that's happened
since then that's fucking me up.

41:06.135 --> 41:07.218
Like what?

41:10.389 --> 41:11.723
Like being lieutenant.

41:13.767 --> 41:16.728
And all the day-to-day bullshit
that comes with it.

41:16.812 --> 41:20.899
Got the Doomsday Killer
doing his shit in my city and...

41:20.941 --> 41:24.235
I try to do any work in here,
and I can't, and...

41:24.904 --> 41:26.571
Did I mention
I just broke up with my boyfriend

41:26.655 --> 41:27.906
and I don't have a place
to live any more,

41:27.948 --> 41:29.491
so, at the end of the day,
I can't even go home?

41:29.575 --> 41:32.076
I'm living with my brother
and his son, and...

41:34.079 --> 41:36.498
Don't get me wrong,
I love them, it's just...

41:37.249 --> 41:39.918
There's a reason I'm an aunt
and not a parent and...

41:43.255 --> 41:46.424
I just feel like I don't have a space
to call my own right now.

41:50.804 --> 41:53.765
So maybe you should get
some place that's your own.

42:03.609 --> 42:06.819
Detective Anderson and girlfriend.

42:06.946 --> 42:08.488
Her? No way.

42:08.614 --> 42:10.448
I'm married. She's my boss.

42:11.534 --> 42:13.868
Lieutenant Debra Morgan,
Miami Metro Homicide.

42:13.953 --> 42:15.495
I'm so sorry.
I thought that you two...

42:15.621 --> 42:16.788
- Don't worry about it.
- My bad.

42:16.872 --> 42:18.790
Can we get this crime scene tape down?

42:18.832 --> 42:20.959
Wow, it takes a lieutenant to tell me

42:21.043 --> 42:22.460
it's OK to rent this place.

42:22.545 --> 42:24.462
- Can we go inside?
- By all means.

42:29.301 --> 42:30.510
Thank you.

42:33.973 --> 42:37.225
I wanted to come by and see
if I could possibly rent the place.

42:40.062 --> 42:41.521
The floors are a mess.

42:42.856 --> 42:45.525
- Yeah, they are, aren't they?
- Yes, they are.

42:47.152 --> 42:48.653
Might have to replace them.

42:49.572 --> 42:52.407
- I mean, the toxic damage.
- Toxic?

42:52.491 --> 42:54.200
Blood-borne antigens.

42:54.326 --> 42:56.703
Can live for two weeks easy.

42:59.331 --> 43:01.499
Of course, hep C is always a risk.

43:02.167 --> 43:03.501
I didn't know that.

43:03.544 --> 43:05.503
Oh, God, just what I needed.

43:06.714 --> 43:08.423
Look,

43:08.507 --> 43:12.051
it's no secret you're gonna have
a hell of a time renting this place.

43:12.177 --> 43:15.221
Legally, you're required to
disclose the murder-suicide.

43:15.347 --> 43:18.016
- But I already know about it.
- And?

43:20.102 --> 43:22.729
What if I was to give you

43:22.855 --> 43:25.523
two-thirds of the current rent
right now, today?

43:27.693 --> 43:32.363
Make that three-quarters, two-year
lease, and you clean up the place.

43:32.865 --> 43:35.408
Looks like you got yourself
a new tenant.

44:10.110 --> 44:12.612
What's the...
What's the progress on the...

44:12.738 --> 44:15.740
Yeah, all right,
I did everything I know how,

44:15.783 --> 44:18.284
but I wasn't able
to get the hand back.

44:18.410 --> 44:20.244
The buyer bought it using
an E-sniper programme

44:20.329 --> 44:23.331
that firewalls the buyer,
so whoever's got it's got it for good.

44:24.416 --> 44:26.751
- Fuck.
- However...

44:26.835 --> 44:28.753
I do like the sound of your however.

44:28.837 --> 44:31.422
...I erased any trace of the sale
from the Internet.

44:31.465 --> 44:33.966
So I'm sorry,
that's the best I can do.

44:34.093 --> 44:36.928
So if one were to look online...

44:37.429 --> 44:39.013
It's like it never happened.

44:39.264 --> 44:41.349
And I never checked it
out of evidence.

44:41.433 --> 44:44.185
There's no trail coming back to here.

44:44.269 --> 44:46.771
At the worst, the evidence room
fucked up, not us.

44:48.273 --> 44:49.524
Our department's safe.

44:50.609 --> 44:52.276
And while I was on your computer,

44:52.319 --> 44:54.779
I improved your credit rating,
installed a modded-up Intel chip

44:54.822 --> 44:56.948
to over-clock your CPU
and, most importantly,

44:57.032 --> 44:59.158
I added a porn scrubber to that thing.

45:03.122 --> 45:05.623
My man. Give it up, Lou.

45:09.002 --> 45:10.128
Thank you.

45:29.815 --> 45:31.315
Drive out of the parking structure,

45:31.400 --> 45:32.817
turn right on Flagler

45:32.860 --> 45:35.528
and then drive on
past the Miami River.

45:36.321 --> 45:37.822
Nod if you understand.

45:44.079 --> 45:45.496
You can take the car.

45:46.165 --> 45:48.666
It's yours, my wallet,
whatever you want.

45:48.751 --> 45:50.877
I want none of those things, Travis.

45:54.256 --> 45:57.592
- What do you want?
- I want your life.

45:59.011 --> 46:00.928
Just like the ones you took.

46:01.346 --> 46:02.847
Doomsday Killer.

46:02.931 --> 46:04.891
God. God!

46:05.017 --> 46:07.018
Yeah, let's start with him.
I suppose it was God

46:07.102 --> 46:09.687
who told you to
kill all those innocent people.

46:09.730 --> 46:11.522
God doesn't talk to me.

46:12.191 --> 46:13.441
Then how do you know?

46:15.569 --> 46:17.862
He talks to Professor Gellar.

46:17.946 --> 46:19.363
And how do you know he talks to God?

46:19.448 --> 46:20.907
Cos I've seen it.

46:22.367 --> 46:28.122
God speaks to the professor.
He speaks through the professor.

46:30.083 --> 46:31.626
Keep going.

46:31.710 --> 46:33.711
Before I met him, I was lost.

46:34.546 --> 46:37.715
But then the professor,
he showed me the truth.

46:38.050 --> 46:39.550
He showed me the way.

46:40.886 --> 46:43.721
He's a prophet
filled with truth and light.

46:43.806 --> 46:45.097
Bullshit!

46:48.560 --> 46:50.895
You killed those people
because you like it.

46:50.979 --> 46:52.146
Answer me!

46:53.816 --> 46:55.316
I couldn't do it.

46:57.986 --> 47:01.322
I'm a failure. I'm failing God.

47:01.406 --> 47:03.574
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

47:04.743 --> 47:08.079
Yes, yes, I wanted
to kill those people,

47:08.121 --> 47:09.455
but I couldn't.

47:11.750 --> 47:13.751
You're saying Gellar does the killing?

47:15.629 --> 47:17.588
He's so much stronger than me.

47:20.092 --> 47:22.802
With him, there's...
there's no fear,

47:22.928 --> 47:25.096
there's no regret. But with me it's...

47:26.431 --> 47:27.682
it's pathetic.

47:33.355 --> 47:35.982
Gellar is pulling you
toward the darkness, Travis,

47:36.108 --> 47:37.191
not the light.

47:40.195 --> 47:41.988
No, you don't know.

47:42.114 --> 47:45.825
Trust me, I know more
about darkness than most,

47:45.951 --> 47:47.952
and Gellar is pure darkness.

47:50.122 --> 47:52.290
You need to find
someone else to follow.

47:52.374 --> 47:53.666
Pull over.

47:59.631 --> 48:01.799
- Get out of the car.
- What?

48:01.842 --> 48:03.217
Get out and start walking away.

48:03.302 --> 48:05.386
You'll find your car
back at the museum.

48:20.903 --> 48:22.695
One way or another,
Travis will lead me

48:22.821 --> 48:25.156
to the one
who really deserves my table.

48:32.831 --> 48:34.165
Where are you?

48:35.500 --> 48:36.667
I'm on my way home.

48:39.087 --> 48:43.424
- What's going on?
- I don't feel good.

48:43.508 --> 48:48.512
I've got... I just feel sick.
I should get some sleep.

48:49.389 --> 48:51.265
Travis, what are you not telling me?

48:51.350 --> 48:54.018
Nothing. Nothing.
I just... I feel sick.

48:55.020 --> 48:57.355
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Hey!

48:57.689 --> 49:00.524
You remember the story
about Jonah and the great fish?

49:02.694 --> 49:07.406
Jonah tried to run from God.
He didn't get too far.

49:08.533 --> 49:11.035
Hope you're not trying
to run from God, too.

49:12.913 --> 49:14.246
Think about it.

49:26.718 --> 49:28.386
I don't believe in angels,

49:28.428 --> 49:30.137
but I do believe
there's a constant struggle

49:30.222 --> 49:32.223
between light and dark in the world.

49:42.985 --> 49:45.820
Who knows? Maybe Brother Sam is right.

49:45.904 --> 49:48.114
Maybe sometimes the light can win out.

49:58.417 --> 50:01.627
But in my experience,
darkness usually prevails.
