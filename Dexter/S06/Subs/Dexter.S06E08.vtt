WEBVTT

00:08.972 --> 00:10.139
Previously on Dexter...

00:10.265 --> 00:12.725
Gellar is pulling you
toward the darkness, Travis,

00:12.767 --> 00:13.809
not the light.

00:13.935 --> 00:15.728
What's happening?

00:17.939 --> 00:19.565
No, please.

00:19.607 --> 00:20.649
You're free.

00:21.234 --> 00:22.276
- I'm done.
- Done?

00:22.318 --> 00:23.736
With you. With everything.

00:23.987 --> 00:25.446
Oh, please.

00:26.990 --> 00:28.615
God's will doesn't stop

00:28.742 --> 00:30.576
just because you want to play house
with your sister.

00:30.952 --> 00:32.953
You could have asked me
before you just took off.

00:33.496 --> 00:35.122
You offered me some time off.

00:35.165 --> 00:37.791
I meant the afternoon,
not five fucking days

00:37.834 --> 00:40.294
to go wherever it is that you are.

02:35.118 --> 02:37.035
Kids trust everybody.

02:42.584 --> 02:45.627
- For the little one.
- Here you go.

02:45.753 --> 02:48.589
They trust the food you're giving them
is safe to eat.

02:48.631 --> 02:50.299
This way, buddy.

02:51.050 --> 02:53.427
They trust you to lead the way.

02:54.262 --> 02:56.722
Not the usual today.
Two coffees and...

02:56.764 --> 02:58.265
What's good for an apology?

02:58.433 --> 02:59.600
Male or female?

02:59.767 --> 03:01.935
- My sister.
- I'd go with a cruller.

03:02.061 --> 03:03.145
OK.

03:03.271 --> 03:04.771
They don't question your motives.

03:04.814 --> 03:07.107
Give a kid a mouthful of sugar
and trans fat,

03:07.233 --> 03:08.275
and he's your friend for life.

03:09.277 --> 03:11.069
Thanks, Francisco.

03:19.746 --> 03:21.622
Grown-ups are a lot harder.

03:21.748 --> 03:24.791
My sister gave me a day off,
and I took five.

03:24.918 --> 03:26.793
She has every right to be angry,

03:26.920 --> 03:29.630
but I can't tell her
that I was in Nebraska.

03:30.298 --> 03:31.798
Or why I was there.

03:37.013 --> 03:38.847
Well, look what
the fucking cat dragged in.

03:38.973 --> 03:41.350
The cat also brought
coffee and doughnuts.

03:41.851 --> 03:43.101
You have five minutes.

03:43.645 --> 03:45.812
Some of us actually
have to show up for work.

03:52.487 --> 03:54.279
I see you're all moved in.

03:54.322 --> 03:56.323
Now it's four minutes.

03:56.449 --> 03:57.658
Right.

03:59.994 --> 04:01.495
I'm sorry...

04:02.330 --> 04:04.164
I took off like that, I...

04:05.375 --> 04:07.501
really needed to get away.

04:08.878 --> 04:11.838
I'm sorry about what happened
with Brother Sam.

04:11.965 --> 04:14.633
And this whole Trinity thing sucks,
I get it.

04:14.676 --> 04:16.885
And you want to blow me off?
That's fine, too.

04:17.011 --> 04:19.388
But you put me in
a really shitty position at work.

04:19.514 --> 04:20.514
- I know.
- Everybody thinks

04:20.640 --> 04:23.392
I gave you a week off in the middle
of this DDK shit-storm,

04:23.518 --> 04:25.352
which is only slightly better

04:25.395 --> 04:28.313
than them knowing
that I didn't give you a week off!

04:28.731 --> 04:30.065
I know.

04:31.317 --> 04:34.987
- I took advantage of you.
- Yeah, you did.

04:35.446 --> 04:37.281
I really am sorry.

04:40.535 --> 04:41.785
OK.

04:42.537 --> 04:44.204
You're forgiven.

04:44.831 --> 04:47.207
But it's only because
I need you in on this DDK shit.

04:47.292 --> 04:48.375
What's going on?

04:48.501 --> 04:50.627
Looks like this chick, Holly Benson,

04:50.712 --> 04:52.879
was taken by DDK.

04:53.006 --> 04:55.382
She got chained up,
was held hostage...

04:56.801 --> 04:58.385
but she got away.

04:58.553 --> 04:59.553
How?

04:59.679 --> 05:00.971
They dumped her in some parking lot.

05:02.140 --> 05:03.390
What, "they"?

05:03.474 --> 05:06.560
That's the best part.
Turns out there are two of these

05:06.644 --> 05:08.562
end-of-the-world motherfuckers
out there.

05:08.646 --> 05:10.063
Gellar and some younger guy.

05:10.148 --> 05:11.565
He's the one that let our vic go.

05:11.649 --> 05:13.066
I think he might be a former student.

05:13.151 --> 05:15.986
Seems like Travis Marshall
isn't my secret any more.

05:16.070 --> 05:18.488
Wow. Two of them.

05:20.408 --> 05:21.575
Why did they let her go?

05:21.909 --> 05:24.411
Why did they tie body parts
to mannequins?

05:24.495 --> 05:28.040
Why did they hang a waitress
from a spiked collar in a greenhouse?

05:28.249 --> 05:29.583
They're bat-shit. That's why.

05:30.043 --> 05:33.253
But it sounds like Travis
is having second thoughts.

05:33.379 --> 05:35.255
OK, I have to go.

05:35.757 --> 05:38.592
I'll fill you in on the rest
when we get to the station.

05:38.676 --> 05:40.427
Yeah, I'm going to be a little late.

05:41.429 --> 05:43.263
You have got to be fucking kidding me.

05:43.723 --> 05:46.516
Brother Sam's funeral is this morning.
I feel like I should...

05:48.936 --> 05:52.105
OK. Fine, go.

05:52.607 --> 05:54.691
Fucking funerals and doughnuts,
you're really good.

05:55.401 --> 05:56.943
Sorry.

06:01.783 --> 06:02.866
Travis?

06:02.950 --> 06:04.785
Hey, just in time.

06:04.869 --> 06:08.288
I got an egg white omelette,
your favourite kind of veggie bacon

06:08.414 --> 06:09.956
and scones in the oven.

06:10.083 --> 06:11.625
I can't believe you did all this.

06:11.751 --> 06:13.293
Yeah, well,
you're always doing everything for me.

06:13.419 --> 06:14.711
It's definitely my turn.

06:14.796 --> 06:16.088
Go, sit down.

06:16.130 --> 06:17.297
Just let me get dressed first.

06:17.382 --> 06:18.799
All right, hurry up.

06:41.906 --> 06:43.824
I remember that day.

06:44.534 --> 06:45.951
What are you doing here?

06:45.993 --> 06:47.327
You said I was free.

06:47.370 --> 06:48.829
And you are.

06:48.871 --> 06:50.038
But I can't say I'm impressed

06:50.164 --> 06:51.665
with what you've done
with your freedom.

06:51.874 --> 06:54.000
You traded your place in God's plan

06:54.502 --> 06:56.169
for the pathetically mundane.

06:57.004 --> 06:58.380
- I like mundane.
- Really?

06:59.298 --> 07:01.967
Because when we met,
you had plenty of it.

07:02.343 --> 07:04.261
Your sister treated you like a child.

07:04.345 --> 07:06.680
You had no friends. No faith.

07:07.515 --> 07:10.517
Your life was of no consequence,
and were you happy?

07:10.852 --> 07:12.853
- It's not like that now.
- No.

07:13.062 --> 07:15.021
Now you have garden gnomes and...

07:16.983 --> 07:18.942
Someone's made you breakfast.

07:19.318 --> 07:20.527
Want to see what I've made?

07:23.823 --> 07:26.700
It's beautiful, isn't it?
All it needs is the right whore.

07:27.660 --> 07:28.827
Travis?

07:34.208 --> 07:36.168
I bet she'd look lovely in red.

07:38.796 --> 07:40.672
You stay the fuck away!

07:48.306 --> 07:49.473
Are you taking that out?

07:50.391 --> 07:53.226
Yeah, I'll just... I'll do it later.

07:56.856 --> 07:58.190
Travis, you all right?

07:59.567 --> 08:01.318
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:01.402 --> 08:03.320
Hey, do you want to get out of here
for a couple of days?

08:03.404 --> 08:05.489
We... We could go to Disney World.

08:06.073 --> 08:07.365
- You mean now?
- Yeah.

08:07.533 --> 08:09.743
Right now, let's just... go.

08:10.411 --> 08:13.038
Travis, you know I... I can't leave.
I have school.

08:14.582 --> 08:17.417
But maybe in a...
in a couple of weeks on my break.

08:17.543 --> 08:19.252
That would be fun.

08:25.426 --> 08:28.386
How many people here can say
that Brother Sam changed my life?

08:34.769 --> 08:36.728
Let us always keep him in our hearts.

08:37.939 --> 08:41.441
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not be in want.

08:41.943 --> 08:44.277
"He makes me lie down
in green pastures,

08:44.946 --> 08:47.280
"he leads me beside quiet waters,

08:47.949 --> 08:49.783
"he restores my soul.

08:50.201 --> 08:51.910
"He guides me
in the paths of righteousness

08:51.953 --> 08:53.745
"for his name's sake.

08:53.788 --> 08:56.540
"Even though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

08:56.624 --> 08:58.124
"I will fear no evil,

08:58.459 --> 09:00.460
"for you are with me.

09:00.586 --> 09:03.129
"Your rod and your staff,
they comfort me.

09:04.632 --> 09:07.801
"You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.

09:07.885 --> 09:11.721
"You anoint my head with oil,
my cup overflows.

09:13.224 --> 09:14.975
"Surely, goodness and love
will follow me

09:15.059 --> 09:16.893
"all the days of my life,

09:16.978 --> 09:19.813
"and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever."

09:40.793 --> 09:42.794
- Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.

09:47.174 --> 09:48.675
Hey, Dexter.

09:49.802 --> 09:50.969
OK.

09:51.012 --> 09:53.138
I have something for you.

09:58.436 --> 10:00.186
Sorry about the blood.

10:00.313 --> 10:02.439
He always had it close by,

10:02.523 --> 10:04.316
so when he was shot...

10:06.193 --> 10:09.362
Last time I saw him,
he said he wanted you to have this.

10:13.034 --> 10:15.118
There's probably someone else
who would get more use out of it,

10:15.202 --> 10:16.661
someone more religious.

10:17.622 --> 10:19.623
I don't know.

10:19.707 --> 10:22.709
Brother Sam used to always say
that no matter what the problem is,

10:23.044 --> 10:24.377
the answer's in here.

10:24.462 --> 10:26.630
You just have to
figure out the question.

10:29.383 --> 10:30.717
Oh, hey.

10:31.177 --> 10:32.510
Have you seen Nick lately?

10:33.471 --> 10:34.554
Nick?

10:34.680 --> 10:37.349
Yeah, disappeared
after Sam passed away.

10:37.391 --> 10:38.558
None of us have seen him.

10:38.893 --> 10:40.727
Maybe he wanted some time alone.

10:41.562 --> 10:43.396
Or maybe I drowned him,

10:43.481 --> 10:45.732
right where Brother Sam's
ashes are floating.

10:48.903 --> 10:51.655
Is it possible
that Brother Sam changed me?

10:54.575 --> 10:56.910
I didn't kill Jonah
when I had the chance.

10:57.036 --> 11:00.163
Did Sam somehow bring out
a little bit of light in me?

11:15.513 --> 11:18.014
And did I pass that light on
to Travis as well?

11:18.265 --> 11:20.558
Is that why he let Holly go?

11:22.770 --> 11:24.854
You did the right thing.

11:27.274 --> 11:29.234
I know who you are.
I remember your voice.

11:29.276 --> 11:30.527
I'm not here to hurt you.

11:30.611 --> 11:32.445
You were in my car.
You tried to kill me.

11:32.571 --> 11:34.364
And I let you go.

11:34.448 --> 11:36.950
Just like you let Holly Benson go.

11:37.243 --> 11:38.284
I want to know why.

11:39.870 --> 11:41.204
I didn't want to see her suffer.

11:41.455 --> 11:43.623
You've seen people suffer before?

11:43.749 --> 11:46.376
What you said to me

11:46.460 --> 11:48.128
made me think.

11:48.462 --> 11:49.587
Think what?

11:49.630 --> 11:52.465
That I don't have to do what he says.

11:54.260 --> 11:56.886
I told him I'm done.
I'm not working with him any more.

11:56.971 --> 11:58.888
How did Gellar take it?

11:59.306 --> 12:01.099
Not very well.

12:02.143 --> 12:03.476
He's angry.

12:04.311 --> 12:05.979
He won't leave me alone.

12:06.647 --> 12:08.398
Why not just tell the police?

12:10.609 --> 12:13.820
I helped him do horrible things.
They'd... They'd arrest me.

12:13.946 --> 12:15.739
They'd...

12:16.323 --> 12:17.782
I am a good person.

12:17.825 --> 12:20.827
I thought we were doing
the right thing. I just...

12:23.748 --> 12:27.500
I made a mistake
getting involved with all of this.

12:27.585 --> 12:28.752
I can help you, Travis.

12:28.836 --> 12:30.587
I can get him out of your life
for good.

12:30.671 --> 12:32.630
The police will never know about you.

12:33.340 --> 12:34.841
You just have to help me find him.

12:35.342 --> 12:37.927
Just because I'm not working with him

12:38.012 --> 12:40.013
does not mean
that I will work with you.

12:40.181 --> 12:42.182
All you have to do
is tell me where he is.

12:42.308 --> 12:44.017
I'll take care of the rest.

12:44.101 --> 12:46.186
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

12:47.146 --> 12:49.981
Do you have any idea
how dangerous he is?

12:50.065 --> 12:52.317
He is crazy, I know that now.

12:52.443 --> 12:54.277
He will finish his mission,

12:54.361 --> 12:57.238
and he will kill anyone
who tries to stop him.

12:57.323 --> 12:59.824
And then what?
Assuming the world doesn't end?

13:14.632 --> 13:17.550
I don't want to talk
about this any more.

13:17.802 --> 13:21.596
Both of you need
to just leave me alone.

13:23.682 --> 13:26.351
Travis has a dark passenger
all his own,

13:26.435 --> 13:29.562
but unlike mine,
his walks and talks and breathes

13:29.647 --> 13:32.273
and goes by the name Professor Gellar.

13:32.358 --> 13:34.150
And most significantly,

13:34.235 --> 13:36.402
his dark passenger can be killed.

13:38.447 --> 13:39.614
Later.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.624
What have we got?

13:49.708 --> 13:52.293
Call girl, of the high-end variety.

13:52.711 --> 13:54.629
ID says Jessica Morris.

13:54.713 --> 13:57.590
The lobby bar downstairs
is a known hangout for working girls.

13:58.926 --> 14:00.927
Not that I would know that
for any reason.

14:01.345 --> 14:02.929
Rings and a track mark
say it's heroin.

14:05.850 --> 14:09.018
Maid must have wiped everything down
before she found her.

14:09.186 --> 14:11.646
No prints anywhere,
except hers on the tub.

14:12.064 --> 14:14.315
Looks like she OD'd,
then hit her head.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.985
If the drugs didn't kill her,
the blow to her skull sure did.

14:17.903 --> 14:21.573
Probably an accidental death,
but the ME'll tell us more.

14:22.783 --> 14:23.867
What do you think?

14:24.243 --> 14:26.119
Blood coming from her nose...

14:26.245 --> 14:27.453
Consistent with an overdose.

14:27.580 --> 14:31.583
Yeah, but look at the pattern,
sort of a zigzag.

14:31.625 --> 14:33.418
It starts this way,

14:33.460 --> 14:36.462
suggesting that
she fell in this position.

14:36.714 --> 14:39.299
The blood dries,
and then it changes direction,

14:39.633 --> 14:44.137
as though her head were turned
and then moved back,

14:44.263 --> 14:47.056
suggesting the body was lifted
and then repositioned.

14:50.978 --> 14:53.313
Heroin overdose
kills almost instantly.

14:53.397 --> 14:55.481
Once her heart stopped beating,

14:55.566 --> 14:57.400
there should have been
hardly any blood flow

14:57.484 --> 14:59.110
from the head wound.

15:00.070 --> 15:01.112
Unless...

15:01.155 --> 15:03.990
Unless someone did
chest compressions post-mortem.

15:09.330 --> 15:10.496
Broken rib.

15:10.623 --> 15:11.664
Could have been the EMTs.

15:11.749 --> 15:13.666
She was long gone
when the maid found her.

15:13.792 --> 15:16.085
The EMTs didn't attempt CPR.

15:17.254 --> 15:18.338
What do you think?

15:18.422 --> 15:20.798
I think it happened
pretty much like Vince said.

15:22.343 --> 15:25.845
She OD's, hits her head, she dies.

15:25.971 --> 15:29.307
Someone comes in, sees her.

15:29.433 --> 15:31.351
He flips her over,

15:31.477 --> 15:33.770
causing more blood
to come out of her nose.

15:34.188 --> 15:35.939
Tries CPR,

15:36.023 --> 15:38.358
but he cracks her rib
cos he's panicked.

15:38.484 --> 15:41.319
And he realises that
he's just causing more blood

15:41.362 --> 15:43.655
to flow from the head wound,
so he stops.

15:44.865 --> 15:46.199
Puts the body back where he found her,

15:46.283 --> 15:48.117
then wipes everything clean.

15:49.703 --> 15:51.204
Someone call the Captain over here?

15:51.956 --> 15:53.206
No, why?

15:53.332 --> 15:55.208
Because she's here.

15:59.672 --> 16:01.673
- Captain.
- Where's Sergeant Batista?

16:01.966 --> 16:03.174
Downstairs.

16:03.634 --> 16:06.135
- What do we have here?
- Looks like an overdose.

16:07.179 --> 16:08.513
OK, good.

16:08.555 --> 16:11.391
Make sure to copy me
on the ME's report.

16:11.475 --> 16:14.060
- I'm going downstairs.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:20.693 --> 16:23.403
Hey, Dexter. You're back.

16:23.737 --> 16:25.530
- Louis.
- Hey.

16:26.156 --> 16:27.907
I heard what you did
at that crime scene.

16:27.992 --> 16:30.410
You know, the body was moved
and then repositioned.

16:30.494 --> 16:31.536
So cool.

16:31.578 --> 16:33.329
You... You gotta show me
how you figure that stuff out.

16:33.414 --> 16:35.873
Yeah, sure, we'll do that sometime,
but right now, I gotta...

16:39.253 --> 16:41.337
OK, I'm going to make this quick.

16:41.547 --> 16:43.423
The whole city is freaking out
over DDK.

16:43.757 --> 16:45.591
We're getting over 100 calls a day.

16:45.676 --> 16:47.260
People saying
that they've seen Gellar,

16:47.386 --> 16:49.762
people asking if it's safe
to go out at night.

16:49.888 --> 16:51.723
I need everyone's asses
on the fucking ball.

16:52.182 --> 16:54.726
I'm going to keep rearranging
that sentence to make it hotter.

16:54.768 --> 16:57.103
- Holly's experience with DDK...
- And that's still my sister.

16:57.187 --> 17:00.189
...suggests that Gellar
is working with an accomplice.

17:00.274 --> 17:01.274
Now, thanks to Louis,

17:01.400 --> 17:04.193
we have a list
of male Tallahassee graduates

17:04.278 --> 17:08.031
living in the Miami area
that have taken classes with him.

17:08.115 --> 17:10.533
We have over 200 names to investigate,

17:10.617 --> 17:12.910
so I'm going to take some myself.

17:13.078 --> 17:14.120
Batista, Quinn, Mike,

17:14.246 --> 17:15.872
you guys can divide up the rest.

17:16.123 --> 17:18.291
And let's not let on that
we know Gellar has an accomplice.

17:18.917 --> 17:20.793
This fucker thinks
we don't know who he is?

17:20.878 --> 17:22.712
Let's keep it that way.

17:22.796 --> 17:24.255
How do I get Travis to trust me

17:24.298 --> 17:27.800
before the cops
get to his name on the list?

17:28.093 --> 17:30.428
I'm sorry I wasn't
at the crime scene this morning.

17:30.471 --> 17:31.971
It's fine. Mike was there.

17:33.098 --> 17:34.640
I got a way to make it up to you.

17:34.767 --> 17:36.309
There's a new place
opening on Washington.

17:36.393 --> 17:38.227
Opening night's invitation only.

17:38.312 --> 17:39.979
Guess who's got two of these?

17:40.647 --> 17:43.149
I'll pass.
I've got Auri on Friday night.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.651
- Auri always cancels on you.
- Take Masuka.

17:46.487 --> 17:48.237
Your loss.

17:49.448 --> 17:51.074
- Hey, sis.
- Hey.

17:51.158 --> 17:52.283
What brings you here?

17:52.326 --> 17:56.662
We were just
at Harrison's music class,

17:56.747 --> 17:58.790
and he wanted to see his daddy.

17:59.124 --> 18:00.458
Come on, admit it.

18:00.501 --> 18:02.335
You wanted to say hi
to your big brother.

18:03.170 --> 18:05.004
Hey, I got your text.

18:05.130 --> 18:07.924
Yeah, we were just
in the neighbourhood.

18:08.008 --> 18:09.509
Want to maybe go for a walk with us?

18:09.968 --> 18:11.677
Yeah, sure.
Let me just tell Mr. Masuka.

18:11.762 --> 18:13.012
OK.

18:15.140 --> 18:16.808
You're still seeing that guy, huh?

18:17.017 --> 18:20.103
- You don't like him?
- I don't really know him.

18:20.187 --> 18:21.854
You know what?

18:21.980 --> 18:23.648
- You should come to dinner with us.
- I don't know...

18:23.690 --> 18:26.859
If you're going to judge him,

18:26.944 --> 18:30.488
then maybe you should have some idea
who you're talking about first.

18:31.281 --> 18:33.366
OK, sure. Why not?

18:33.826 --> 18:35.701
- It'll be fun.
- Yeah.

18:38.205 --> 18:40.540
Children trust
that when we put them to bed at night,

18:40.624 --> 18:42.375
they'll live to see another day.

18:49.049 --> 18:51.134
Adults are not always so fortunate.

18:53.887 --> 18:55.805
Travis is my only way to Gellar.

18:55.889 --> 18:57.723
I have to convince him to help me.

19:01.311 --> 19:03.563
Maybe I need to learn
to speak his language.

19:21.373 --> 19:23.916
Brother Sam did say
all the answers were in here.

19:25.335 --> 19:29.380
I'm not sure he meant
the answers to my kind of questions.

20:06.376 --> 20:08.002
What are you doing here? I told you...

20:08.086 --> 20:09.879
I know,
you don't want to get involved.

20:09.963 --> 20:12.673
I understand that,
but you are responsible

20:12.758 --> 20:15.051
for hurting a lot of people, Travis.

20:17.012 --> 20:19.138
I'm sure
you don't feel good about that.

20:23.936 --> 20:25.811
You've wandered from God's path.

20:25.896 --> 20:27.021
I was led astray.

20:33.153 --> 20:34.862
I know, the blood.

20:34.988 --> 20:36.739
Long story.

20:36.823 --> 20:38.991
But what's more important
are the words underneath the blood.

20:39.076 --> 20:43.246
It says here, "Anyone then
who knows the good he ought to do..."

20:43.330 --> 20:45.414
"...and doesn't do, sins."

20:46.500 --> 20:50.127
The sin of omission. James 4:17. So?

20:50.170 --> 20:53.172
So it sounds to me
like you're in some trouble, Travis.

20:54.258 --> 20:57.176
If you allow Professor Gellar
to continue doing what he's doing,

20:57.261 --> 20:58.469
according to James here,

20:58.512 --> 21:01.180
it's just as much of a sin
as doing the killings yourself.

21:01.265 --> 21:02.515
I know.

21:03.684 --> 21:05.685
I wish that I could take it all back.

21:06.687 --> 21:09.647
But now I can't risk
antagonising him.

21:10.107 --> 21:11.190
I can protect you.

21:11.275 --> 21:13.609
It's not me that I'm worried about.
It's my sister.

21:14.528 --> 21:15.653
Gellar's threatened her before,

21:15.696 --> 21:18.197
and I can't let
anything happen to her.

21:21.159 --> 21:22.868
Can I blame him?

21:23.161 --> 21:25.705
As long as Gellar's out there,
she's still in danger.

21:25.789 --> 21:28.708
- I can protect her.
- What if you can't?

21:38.385 --> 21:39.552
OK.

21:40.554 --> 21:43.973
I'll try to convince Lisa
to go to her friend's

21:44.057 --> 21:47.351
up in Pensacola for the weekend.
Gellar won't leave Miami.

21:49.229 --> 21:51.063
Let me get her safe,

21:51.982 --> 21:53.733
and then I promise,

21:54.568 --> 21:56.652
I'll do whatever you say.

22:06.913 --> 22:09.707
Sam was right about this book.

22:13.587 --> 22:14.670
Hi, can I help you?

22:14.755 --> 22:17.048
I'm Lieutenant Debra Morgan,
Miami Metro Homicide.

22:17.090 --> 22:19.258
I'm looking for Travis Marshall.

22:19.343 --> 22:21.093
His building manager said
that they were forwarding

22:21.178 --> 22:22.511
his mail here.

22:22.888 --> 22:25.264
Travis is my brother,
but he's not here right now.

22:25.932 --> 22:27.433
Can I...
Can I help you with something?

22:27.601 --> 22:29.685
We're investigating
a college professor,

22:29.770 --> 22:32.104
James Gellar,
in connection with three homicides.

22:32.731 --> 22:34.607
The Doomsday Killer.

22:35.609 --> 22:37.943
Oh, my God. Travis.
Has something happened?

22:38.070 --> 22:40.613
No, we're just looking into
former associates of his.

22:41.114 --> 22:42.198
And according to our records,

22:42.282 --> 22:45.117
Travis took some classes with him
up in Tallahassee.

22:45.410 --> 22:47.620
We just want to ask him
a few questions.

22:47.954 --> 22:51.290
I... I doubt that Travis
would be able to help you much.

22:51.375 --> 22:54.418
I don't think he stays in touch
with anyone from school.

22:54.586 --> 22:56.212
He must have been pretty shaken up
when he found out

22:56.296 --> 22:58.798
an old professor was a murder suspect.

23:00.258 --> 23:01.801
I guess so.

23:02.094 --> 23:03.552
He didn't mention it?

23:03.637 --> 23:05.596
Well, Travis isn't really
the type to talk

23:05.680 --> 23:07.890
about how he feels about things.

23:07.974 --> 23:10.142
Not even to his sister.

23:10.227 --> 23:11.268
So you aren't close?

23:13.814 --> 23:16.315
Our parents died
when Travis was still a teenager,

23:16.358 --> 23:18.526
so I pretty much raised him
the rest of the way, so...

23:19.403 --> 23:21.570
Tragedy makes you tight, you know?

23:21.655 --> 23:24.156
But, with Travis,
I think it also made him...

23:25.325 --> 23:27.952
closed off, I guess you would call it.

23:29.371 --> 23:30.913
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

23:32.457 --> 23:34.792
So you haven't noticed
any unusual behaviour?

23:35.168 --> 23:37.586
- Nothing out of the ordinary?
- No.

23:38.630 --> 23:39.672
Same old Travis.

23:42.592 --> 23:44.135
I actually have to get back to work.

23:44.177 --> 23:46.137
OK, if you could just have him
give me a call

23:46.179 --> 23:48.347
the next time you see him,
so we can check him off our list?

23:48.473 --> 23:51.892
OK. I'm sorry I couldn't
have been more help.

23:52.018 --> 23:53.978
No, thank you for your time.

24:23.884 --> 24:25.050
Hey.

24:26.678 --> 24:29.847
So, any luck finding DDK's accomplice?

24:30.891 --> 24:34.101
No, not yet, but I crossed five names
off the list.

24:34.186 --> 24:35.478
And I'm going to go back out there

24:35.562 --> 24:37.146
as soon as I make
a couple of phone calls. Thank you.

24:37.230 --> 24:39.690
Sounds like detective work,
Lieutenant.

24:39.774 --> 24:42.193
Well, it's a team effort.

24:42.277 --> 24:44.195
One of these names
is going to pan out.

24:44.279 --> 24:46.405
Well, until it does,
I've got good news for you.

24:46.490 --> 24:50.451
The ME report came back in
on Jessica Morris, the prostitute.

24:50.702 --> 24:53.162
Cause of death was the overdose.

24:54.831 --> 24:56.874
Why is that good news?

24:56.958 --> 24:59.251
Because the case
can be closed as an accident,

24:59.336 --> 25:01.629
which means you have
one less homicide to worry about.

25:02.881 --> 25:05.591
Wait, why were you looking
at the ME's report on that?

25:07.260 --> 25:09.595
Your plate is so full with DDK.

25:09.721 --> 25:12.097
Came across my desk,
and I took a look at it.

25:15.268 --> 25:17.811
- Team effort, right?
- Right.

25:18.605 --> 25:21.148
OK, so...
you can close the case now.

25:21.441 --> 25:24.109
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

25:38.124 --> 25:40.000
- Hey.
- Hey, where are you?

25:40.627 --> 25:41.919
I'm on my way back from lunch.

25:42.128 --> 25:43.462
Look, will you do me a favour

25:43.505 --> 25:46.632
and put a rush on
Jessica Morris' blood report?

25:47.092 --> 25:49.510
- LaGuerta's acting weird.
- Weird how?

25:49.803 --> 25:52.513
She's being helpful.
I just want to see what she's up to.

25:53.306 --> 25:55.182
- I'm on it.
- Thank you.

25:57.602 --> 26:00.271
Lisa. Come on. Hurry up, Lisa.

26:10.115 --> 26:11.657
Stop following me!

26:11.950 --> 26:13.158
Sorry, Travis.

26:13.285 --> 26:16.662
We don't have time for
your little journey to find yourself.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.038
We have work to do.

26:26.881 --> 26:30.301
You know, when Jamie told me
you got the Trans-Am, I was jealous.

26:30.343 --> 26:33.053
That is one awesome car.

26:33.471 --> 26:34.972
You drive a VW, right?

26:35.307 --> 26:38.017
Yeah, it's a limited edition.
Actually, it's very rare.

26:38.810 --> 26:40.686
I'm going to go to the restroom.

26:41.062 --> 26:44.523
You guys keep talking
about car things.

26:56.703 --> 26:58.203
She's amazing.

26:58.246 --> 27:02.207
I can't believe that a girl like that
could be interested in a guy like me.

27:02.375 --> 27:03.876
She's interested in a lot of people.

27:06.087 --> 27:08.172
My sister's a really nice girl.

27:09.007 --> 27:10.549
She has a hard time saying no.

27:10.925 --> 27:12.426
So she dates a lot of guys?

27:12.552 --> 27:13.719
She's young.

27:13.762 --> 27:15.095
She's in school.

27:15.847 --> 27:19.850
She's not in a place in her life
to be taking anybody too seriously.

27:21.394 --> 27:22.561
OK.

27:22.604 --> 27:24.229
I know you seem like a nice guy.

27:30.862 --> 27:32.946
I just wouldn't want
to see you get hurt.

27:40.538 --> 27:41.747
So when Jessica Morris OD'd,

27:41.790 --> 27:44.249
there was definitely someone
in that hotel room with her.

27:44.376 --> 27:45.751
No doubt.

27:46.586 --> 27:48.879
Then why is LaGuerta on my ass
to close this thing?

27:50.048 --> 27:52.257
Maybe she wants to
keep it low-profile?

27:52.425 --> 27:54.718
So what am I supposed to do?

27:54.761 --> 27:59.098
If I do my job and I investigate
a possible homicide, then...

28:00.266 --> 28:02.726
I piss off Captain Close-it.

28:02.769 --> 28:04.895
And if I close it, this guy walks.

28:05.438 --> 28:07.439
Maybe you should talk to LaGuerta.

28:08.775 --> 28:10.442
Yeah. Maybe I should.

28:11.319 --> 28:12.945
Either way, I have to sign
this fucking blood report.

28:12.987 --> 28:14.780
Do you have a pen?

28:19.994 --> 28:21.328
Here.

28:28.086 --> 28:30.170
Why do you have a pen
from the Shady Lane Motel

28:30.255 --> 28:32.005
at Kearney, Nebraska?

28:33.258 --> 28:34.800
Must have picked it up somewhere.

28:34.968 --> 28:37.302
Yeah, at the Shady Lane Motel
in Kearney, Nebraska.

28:37.804 --> 28:39.263
- I can explain.
- Kearney, Nebraska,

28:39.305 --> 28:41.598
is where Trinity's family
was murdered.

28:42.809 --> 28:44.810
Which you found out about
the day you took your little joyride.

28:44.936 --> 28:47.688
So that is either
one motherfucker of a coincidence,

28:47.814 --> 28:50.482
or you were "just driving"
to fucking Nebraska.

28:50.525 --> 28:53.110
- OK, yes, I went to Nebraska.
- Why?

28:54.612 --> 28:56.697
Guess I just felt drawn there.

28:57.490 --> 28:58.991
Did you talk to Jonah?

29:00.452 --> 29:01.660
Yes.

29:03.830 --> 29:04.955
Why?

29:07.959 --> 29:11.670
I don't know, Deb. We both lost
people we love to the same killer.

29:12.797 --> 29:14.381
I just felt a connection with him,

29:14.507 --> 29:16.341
and I needed someone to talk to.

29:17.552 --> 29:19.219
And you couldn't talk to me?

29:19.345 --> 29:21.555
I didn't want to burden you.

29:23.349 --> 29:25.142
Burden me, my ass.

29:26.352 --> 29:28.520
I burden you all the time.

29:30.398 --> 29:32.900
It's not a burden for me
to be there for you.

29:33.151 --> 29:34.818
It was a mistake.
I shouldn't have gone.

29:37.864 --> 29:39.364
That's not the point.

29:41.159 --> 29:43.368
The point is
that you lied to me about it.

29:44.537 --> 29:45.746
The point is that
you thought you had to go

29:45.872 --> 29:48.916
to buttfuck-ville
to talk to somebody about Trinity.

29:49.751 --> 29:52.377
Dexter, don't you think I get it?

29:58.092 --> 30:00.260
I lost Lundy because of Trinity, too.

30:05.099 --> 30:07.392
Hey, guys,
looks like DDK struck again.

30:26.913 --> 30:28.664
Janitor found this early this morning.

30:31.876 --> 30:33.752
The whore of Babylon.

30:37.841 --> 30:39.216
The next tableau.

30:49.227 --> 30:50.561
Shit!

30:50.687 --> 30:52.396
I interviewed her yesterday.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.898
Her brother was a...
a student of Gellar's.

30:54.983 --> 30:57.025
Travis. Travis Marshall.

30:57.402 --> 30:58.986
Find Travis Marshall
right the fuck now,

30:59.070 --> 31:01.488
and if you can't find him,
put a BOLO out on him.

31:01.573 --> 31:03.240
I think he's Gellar's accomplice.

31:03.366 --> 31:04.575
Travis just shot to the top

31:04.659 --> 31:07.202
of Miami Metro Homicide's
most-wanted list.

31:07.579 --> 31:09.705
Did Travis go back to Gellar,

31:09.789 --> 31:12.791
or was this the price Travis paid
for defying him?

31:18.798 --> 31:20.465
A ripped seam.

31:23.219 --> 31:24.887
"F.N. Galway."

31:26.764 --> 31:29.474
This used to be some kind of vestment.

31:29.642 --> 31:31.643
A robe, maybe.

31:39.944 --> 31:41.987
What do you think the letters
on her forehead mean?

31:43.406 --> 31:45.073
We'll find out.

31:45.158 --> 31:47.159
Hey, I got something.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.626
It's your card.

31:57.503 --> 31:58.587
What the fuck?

32:01.925 --> 32:03.008
What the fuck do you think that means?

32:03.092 --> 32:04.259
Maybe it doesn't mean anything.

32:04.344 --> 32:05.969
These assholes are all about messages.

32:06.054 --> 32:08.263
You think it's because
I talked to her?

32:08.348 --> 32:10.933
- You think it's to keep her quiet?
- This isn't your fault, Deb.

32:13.645 --> 32:16.104
But it could be mine.

32:43.007 --> 32:45.050
Sorry for the chain.

32:46.344 --> 32:48.553
I couldn't risk
you disappearing on me.

32:49.514 --> 32:51.515
You know you're far too important.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.895
What do you want?

32:58.982 --> 33:02.234
Penance, to cleanse your soul.

33:05.029 --> 33:06.905
It's not your fault, Travis.

33:07.657 --> 33:09.992
The devil comes in many forms.

33:10.576 --> 33:13.161
Sometimes he tempts you with an apple,

33:14.789 --> 33:16.623
or fame, or riches,

33:18.001 --> 33:20.544
or a mundane life with your family.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.965
Do not talk about my sister.

33:25.216 --> 33:28.385
Your sister whom you hold
in such high esteem

33:29.262 --> 33:30.887
talked to the police.

33:32.015 --> 33:33.932
She betrayed you.

33:35.018 --> 33:37.519
Just like the whore of Babylon.

33:38.563 --> 33:40.063
What did you do to my sister?

33:44.068 --> 33:45.152
No.

33:49.532 --> 33:51.074
No!

33:51.659 --> 33:53.744
She's part of it now.

33:55.747 --> 33:57.539
Don't you get it, Travis?

33:58.624 --> 34:00.751
She was doomed to hell on Earth.

34:02.003 --> 34:03.503
Tribulations.

34:04.005 --> 34:06.298
But now her soul is pure.

34:07.467 --> 34:09.259
She can go to God.

34:09.761 --> 34:11.636
Just like you wanted.

34:12.805 --> 34:15.474
And you can come back to our mission.

34:16.559 --> 34:18.435
I didn't want this!

34:19.812 --> 34:22.689
I understand. It'll take time.

34:23.232 --> 34:26.693
Pray for your sister.
Do whatever it is you need to do.

34:27.028 --> 34:29.071
And when I come back,

34:31.032 --> 34:33.992
I sincerely hope you have
a change of heart.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.000
I was just on my way up to see you.

34:42.085 --> 34:43.919
I hear DDK has struck again.

34:44.003 --> 34:46.088
We have a BOLO out on Travis Marshall.

34:46.172 --> 34:48.465
Everyone in the city is going
to know what he looks like.

34:48.549 --> 34:51.093
Meanwhile, you now have two suspects
and no arrests.

34:52.762 --> 34:54.304
Yes, I know.

34:55.056 --> 34:57.349
Actually, I was coming
to talk to you about Jessica Morris.

34:59.060 --> 35:00.227
The dead prostitute.

35:01.854 --> 35:03.355
Why hasn't that case been closed?

35:03.731 --> 35:05.357
Because I saw Dexter's report.

35:05.441 --> 35:06.691
Someone else was in the room.

35:07.401 --> 35:08.610
The woman overdosed, Debra.

35:08.694 --> 35:10.695
What does it matter
who else was in the room?

35:11.489 --> 35:14.407
Because some dickhead
left a dead woman in a bathroom.

35:14.742 --> 35:16.326
Aren't we talking
involuntary manslaughter,

35:16.410 --> 35:19.079
not to mention solicitation,
obstruction?

35:19.163 --> 35:20.831
- Hell, we could get murder two.
- Stop.

35:24.127 --> 35:25.418
Debra.

35:28.381 --> 35:30.340
I'm going to level with you.

35:30.424 --> 35:32.551
That COMPSTAT hearing
did not go very well

35:32.635 --> 35:33.718
for either one of us.

35:34.387 --> 35:36.847
Another open case will put
our clearance rate at 19%.

35:36.931 --> 35:40.016
- But if we let a guilty man...
- 19%, Debra!

35:40.101 --> 35:41.810
Do you understand what's happening?

35:42.895 --> 35:45.605
We have a city in an all-out panic.

35:46.065 --> 35:47.566
Last night,
a woman tried to drive her car

35:47.650 --> 35:50.777
into Biscayne Bay
with her infant son inside,

35:50.862 --> 35:52.445
because she thinks
it's the end of the world

35:52.530 --> 35:55.073
and she didn't want him
to go through the tribulations.

35:55.825 --> 35:57.033
Now...

35:57.410 --> 36:01.705
Don't take this the wrong way,
but being young and personable

36:01.789 --> 36:04.916
and saying bad words on TV
just is not going to cut it right now.

36:05.001 --> 36:06.168
Trust me.

36:06.252 --> 36:08.461
Find the men
who killed four innocent people,

36:08.546 --> 36:12.215
not some john who bailed
on a fucking junkie prostitute

36:12.300 --> 36:13.842
who overdosed.

36:14.594 --> 36:16.553
And that's an order, Lieutenant.

36:18.848 --> 36:20.098
OK.

36:21.392 --> 36:24.352
- Fine. I'll close it.
- Good.

36:34.488 --> 36:36.615
Yeah, it's me. It's taken care of.

36:38.451 --> 36:42.287
Yes, I'm sure you have
nothing more to worry about.

36:52.757 --> 36:56.092
My search for F.N. Galway
has turned up nothing.

36:56.594 --> 36:57.928
This is the last of them.

36:58.012 --> 37:00.764
And there's not much I can do
with intern puppy dog

37:00.848 --> 37:02.224
watching my every move.

37:02.308 --> 37:04.851
You know, Google's kind of
five minutes ago, right?

37:05.561 --> 37:07.562
Try Eliot.

37:10.816 --> 37:14.319
Yeah, it uses a targeted algorithm
to aggregate content

37:14.362 --> 37:16.821
without getting tripped up
by all that sneaky SEO bullshit.

37:16.948 --> 37:19.324
Intern puppy dog has skills.

37:26.624 --> 37:28.458
I'll let you do your thing.

37:31.379 --> 37:32.712
Got the ME's report.

37:32.797 --> 37:34.464
Looks like Lisa Marshall
was killed the same way

37:34.548 --> 37:36.299
as our fruit vendor and our jogger.

37:36.384 --> 37:38.426
But get this,
the ME didn't find any of

37:38.511 --> 37:41.137
those paper 1,000-whatever-the-fuck
number things

37:41.222 --> 37:42.305
anywhere on the body.

37:42.390 --> 37:44.516
That's because it was Travis
who put the numbers there.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.309
That means this kill was all Gellar.

37:46.394 --> 37:47.686
Weird.

37:47.770 --> 37:49.229
Any luck finding Travis Marshall?

37:50.022 --> 37:51.398
Not yet.

37:51.524 --> 37:53.775
But I found out
he works at the museum,

37:53.859 --> 37:55.860
restoring old bibles.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.029
I'll fuck Masuka
if this isn't our guy.

37:58.906 --> 38:00.407
Sounds like you're getting close.

38:00.533 --> 38:03.743
Too close. I'm going to have
to work fast if I want to save Travis.

38:03.828 --> 38:05.996
Hey, listen.

38:06.038 --> 38:08.331
You want to grab dinner
after work tonight?

38:09.709 --> 38:11.376
You know, chat?

38:11.961 --> 38:13.044
Talk?

38:13.587 --> 38:15.630
Can we do another night?
I'm pretty tired,

38:15.715 --> 38:19.884
and I just want to spend
some downtime at home with Harrison.

38:21.429 --> 38:24.681
OK. Sure, another night.

38:24.807 --> 38:26.308
Definitely.

38:34.734 --> 38:36.026
I'm sorry I'm late.

38:36.110 --> 38:37.902
I saw the news.

38:37.987 --> 38:40.822
I wasn't sure you'd be able to
make our session anyway today.

38:40.906 --> 38:42.115
Yeah, I almost cancelled.

38:42.825 --> 38:44.075
But I don't know.

38:44.785 --> 38:46.077
I could use the break.

38:46.662 --> 38:48.913
That must have been
a difficult thing to see.

38:49.415 --> 38:51.291
You could say that.

38:53.753 --> 38:55.920
I mean, I show up, right, to...

38:57.131 --> 38:59.174
question her about her brother and...

39:01.344 --> 39:03.053
twenty-four hours later...

39:07.850 --> 39:09.309
I can't help but feel responsible.

39:09.393 --> 39:12.896
You know, I knew that there was
something that she wasn't telling me.

39:15.107 --> 39:17.150
Do you think she knew
that her brother was involved?

39:17.234 --> 39:19.486
I think she knew
something was up with him.

39:21.155 --> 39:23.281
And I think she was trying to
protect him,

39:23.366 --> 39:25.950
which is what a good sister does.

39:26.494 --> 39:28.620
And then he ends up killing her.

39:30.873 --> 39:32.248
Oh, Jesus.

39:33.417 --> 39:35.543
Are all brothers assholes?

39:35.669 --> 39:37.587
Who are we talking about now?

39:38.005 --> 39:39.381
Who else? Dexter.

39:40.549 --> 39:43.968
So you think he might kill you?

39:46.347 --> 39:48.932
No, I don't think
he's going to kill me, I just...

39:52.603 --> 39:54.437
I think he treats me like shit.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.405
He shuts me out.

40:03.489 --> 40:05.156
He won't tell me things,

40:06.826 --> 40:08.868
like really important things.

40:10.246 --> 40:14.499
Sounds like you two are having
a little trouble communicating lately.

40:14.959 --> 40:17.877
We aren't having
trouble communicating.

40:17.962 --> 40:20.588
He's the one
that's keeping all the secrets.

40:20.673 --> 40:23.716
But normally,
you're pretty open with each other.

40:23.843 --> 40:24.926
Yes.

40:25.594 --> 40:29.514
I tell him everything.
I tell him about boyfriends, work.

40:30.224 --> 40:32.767
I tell him about everything.

40:32.852 --> 40:35.728
Sounds like
a lot of talking about yourself.

40:38.023 --> 40:39.399
Aren't you supposed to be on my side?

40:39.942 --> 40:41.609
I'm just telling you what I'm hearing.

40:41.694 --> 40:43.695
OK, yeah. We talk about me.

40:44.780 --> 40:45.864
A lot.

40:46.907 --> 40:48.283
But that's what I'm saying.

40:48.367 --> 40:51.035
I can't get him
to tell me shit-all about jackshit.

40:51.537 --> 40:55.206
Or maybe he doesn't think
there's any room

40:55.249 --> 40:58.042
in the relationship for his needs.

41:00.546 --> 41:05.049
Maybe next time you get together
you could just make some effort

41:05.092 --> 41:07.886
to focus on him and his issues.

41:33.245 --> 41:35.330
Need another round? Next one's on me.

41:35.414 --> 41:37.081
I'm pacing myself.

41:37.124 --> 41:38.833
I need to retain my ability...

41:39.084 --> 41:40.251
Oh, yeah!

41:40.336 --> 41:42.629
...to...

41:42.755 --> 41:43.963
focus.

41:44.924 --> 41:46.716
Sure, I get that.

41:47.593 --> 41:49.636
- All right.
- Thanks, cutie.

41:49.762 --> 41:51.763
Hey, be honest with me.

41:51.847 --> 41:53.973
I wasn't your first choice
to bring here tonight, was I?

41:54.767 --> 41:56.309
Not really, but does it matter?

41:57.019 --> 41:58.520
Not really.

41:59.688 --> 42:02.482
Hey, excuse me.
Can I get a refill, please?

42:02.566 --> 42:04.108
Wait, no, no, no. Don't go anywhere.

42:04.777 --> 42:08.238
If I said you had a beautiful body,
would you hold it against me?

42:08.322 --> 42:10.240
- Please.
- Come on, it's a song.

42:10.324 --> 42:11.741
I can sing it to you.

42:11.909 --> 42:13.284
Yo, man. Come on, relax.

42:13.452 --> 42:16.329
Look, just look around,
enjoy the scenery.

42:16.664 --> 42:18.248
Look at that right there.

42:22.962 --> 42:24.337
In the green thong.

42:27.758 --> 42:29.884
That's a thing of beauty.

42:30.928 --> 42:34.389
I'm going to marry her.
I'm going to marry Green Thong.

42:35.474 --> 42:37.433
Come on, Quinn. Sit down.

42:39.228 --> 42:40.603
Will you marry me?

42:40.688 --> 42:42.438
No, I mean, of course
no one wants to marry me,

42:42.523 --> 42:43.898
but can I at least
get a kiss from you?

42:43.983 --> 42:45.984
Hey, back off, buddy. All right?

42:46.652 --> 42:48.903
We got to cut you off, man, OK?

42:48.988 --> 42:51.447
But wait, she's not
finished breaking my heart yet.

42:51.532 --> 42:53.283
If you don't take him outta here,
I gotta take him out.

42:53.367 --> 42:56.244
OK, no, no, no. We don't need that.
No problem, we out. We out, let's go.

42:56.328 --> 42:58.413
Green Thong! I love you, Green Thong.

42:58.497 --> 42:59.998
All right.
Let's get you home, come on.

43:00.082 --> 43:02.000
Nah, man. I ain't going anywhere.

43:02.084 --> 43:04.168
I'm just getting started.

43:09.883 --> 43:12.093
Louis' search engine
turned out to be useful.

43:12.177 --> 43:15.513
Father Nicholas Galway,
retired Catholic priest.

43:15.598 --> 43:18.224
You understand that
Father Galway's dementia

43:18.309 --> 43:20.226
has progressed extensively?

43:20.311 --> 43:22.270
It isn't likely he'll remember you.

43:22.354 --> 43:24.397
I'm not sure if that's good or bad.

43:29.111 --> 43:31.571
- Father?
- Yes?

43:33.907 --> 43:35.033
You have a visitor.

43:36.994 --> 43:38.286
Thank you.

43:41.540 --> 43:43.291
Father Galway?

43:43.375 --> 43:45.960
Yes, that... That's me.

43:46.045 --> 43:48.796
I'm... I'm having trouble
remembering your name.

43:48.881 --> 43:50.840
Actually, we've never met.

43:50.924 --> 43:52.759
- My name is...
- Francis Connolly!

43:53.427 --> 43:55.720
You've come to apologise
for breaking the window

43:55.804 --> 43:57.930
in the narthex, I take it.

44:01.143 --> 44:02.935
I'm sorry, Father.
I'm in the wrong place.

44:03.020 --> 44:05.438
You're not going anywhere, young man.

44:06.065 --> 44:08.066
You must confess your sins.

44:08.525 --> 44:10.318
Actually, I'm OK. If I could just...

44:10.402 --> 44:12.236
"Bless me, Father,

44:13.113 --> 44:14.614
"for I have sinned."

44:16.450 --> 44:17.992
My sins? OK.

44:22.039 --> 44:25.041
I've exceeded the speed limit
a few times.

44:25.918 --> 44:27.627
Who hasn't done that?

44:27.711 --> 44:30.296
What other sins must you confess?

44:34.385 --> 44:35.968
I lied to my sister.

44:36.178 --> 44:39.138
The freckle-faced one,
Mary Grace, isn't that it?

44:39.223 --> 44:42.308
She always had a cookie in her hand,
that one.

44:42.393 --> 44:43.643
What else?

44:43.727 --> 44:45.520
He's too far gone.

44:45.604 --> 44:47.397
- I really should get going, Father.
- Son!

44:48.524 --> 44:50.441
How do you expect to get into heaven,

44:50.526 --> 44:53.236
unless you let me
absolve you of your sins?

44:53.696 --> 44:56.948
- You can do that?
- Anything you confess,

44:57.449 --> 44:58.574
God will forgive.

45:08.836 --> 45:10.420
I'm waiting, Francis.

45:11.463 --> 45:13.798
I've killed people.

45:17.720 --> 45:19.804
Continue.

45:21.306 --> 45:22.974
A lot of people.

45:25.978 --> 45:28.062
Murder is a mortal sin.

45:30.274 --> 45:33.651
You must...

45:37.281 --> 45:38.823
Where were we?

45:41.076 --> 45:42.869
Confession.

45:43.871 --> 45:45.246
Oh, yes. Of course.

45:48.584 --> 45:51.461
I absolve you of all of your sins.

45:51.795 --> 45:55.757
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

45:56.592 --> 45:57.717
Amen.

46:04.808 --> 46:06.267
Thank you.

46:21.784 --> 46:23.576
It's sad, isn't it?

46:24.578 --> 46:27.497
He was a wonderful priest
back in the day.

46:28.040 --> 46:29.582
Yes, he was.

46:29.708 --> 46:32.752
Now half the time,
he doesn't know where he is.

46:33.879 --> 46:35.880
Some Sunday mornings
he asks to be driven

46:35.964 --> 46:39.217
to his church because he thinks
he's supposed to lead Mass.

46:40.052 --> 46:41.302
His church?

46:42.221 --> 46:45.097
- Santa Maria De Loreto.
- Right.

46:46.391 --> 46:49.227
- And that's in...
- It's out in Davie.

46:50.020 --> 46:51.479
But... But don't waste your time.

46:51.563 --> 46:53.731
It's been abandoned
for over 20 years now.

46:53.816 --> 46:54.982
Not much left of it.

46:55.526 --> 46:57.401
An abandoned church.

46:57.486 --> 46:59.362
Very sad, huh?

46:59.863 --> 47:01.030
If Gellar's at that church,

47:01.114 --> 47:03.741
his hideout
will make an even better kill room.

47:03.867 --> 47:06.911
I'll say good night to Harrison,
and then I'll be on my way.

47:08.747 --> 47:11.499
Hey, Dex. Deb said I could take off
since she's here.

47:12.167 --> 47:15.169
- I told you tonight wasn't good.
- I know.

47:15.879 --> 47:17.713
But you got to eat, right?

47:17.798 --> 47:19.882
So you can just relax and kick back.

47:19.967 --> 47:21.050
I'm making steaks.

47:21.134 --> 47:22.677
Which is a big deal,
because I can't remember

47:22.761 --> 47:23.845
the last time I cooked something

47:23.929 --> 47:26.681
that didn't involve
pierce film with fork.

47:27.099 --> 47:28.558
Something came up. I have to go out.

47:28.642 --> 47:30.977
I just came
to say good night to Harrison.

47:31.061 --> 47:32.603
I'm sorry for the mix-up, Jamie.

47:32.688 --> 47:34.438
Oh, that's OK. I can stay.

47:35.983 --> 47:38.818
- Daddy.
- Something came up?

47:39.444 --> 47:40.778
What the fuck do you mean,
something came up?

47:40.863 --> 47:42.738
Would you please watch
your language in front of him?

47:43.115 --> 47:44.949
I'll go give him his bath.

47:45.742 --> 47:47.285
- Night, buddy.
- Night-night.

47:50.789 --> 47:52.623
So when you said you wanted
a quiet night at home,

47:52.749 --> 47:53.875
you were just blowing me off.

47:53.959 --> 47:55.209
I told you, something came up.

47:55.460 --> 47:56.794
You're not going
to tell me what it is?

47:58.130 --> 47:59.630
I can't talk about it right now.

47:59.756 --> 48:03.634
You can't talk about it,
or you can't talk about it with me?

48:05.137 --> 48:07.263
Deb, this isn't the time.

48:07.723 --> 48:09.265
I gotta go.

48:12.144 --> 48:14.478
Do you know why
I came over here tonight?

48:15.105 --> 48:16.647
It was for you, asshole.

48:17.649 --> 48:19.817
- So you could talk to me.
- Talk about what?

48:20.652 --> 48:23.779
About whatever stuff you drove
to Nebraska to talk about.

48:23.822 --> 48:24.989
Deb, please just let this go.

48:25.073 --> 48:28.492
I am just trying
to have a conversation with you.

48:29.494 --> 48:30.953
Is that so fucking hard?

48:33.415 --> 48:34.624
Deb...

48:38.337 --> 48:39.503
Fine.

48:48.513 --> 48:50.681
I don't want to hurt you, Travis.

48:52.851 --> 48:54.602
I think you do.

48:55.520 --> 48:58.189
I think you like
watching people suffer.

48:59.024 --> 49:02.443
There's only one way to get
the demons out of your head.

49:25.175 --> 49:26.801
Who's out there?

49:27.886 --> 49:29.971
Don't you say a word.

50:11.054 --> 50:13.097
Did Gellar do this to you?

50:15.600 --> 50:17.893
He killed my sister.

50:18.228 --> 50:19.770
Where is he?

50:21.898 --> 50:23.357
Travis, is he here?

50:52.596 --> 50:54.055
Damn it.

51:04.900 --> 51:06.984
Gellar has seen me now.

51:07.069 --> 51:09.153
This just got much harder.

51:16.953 --> 51:18.162
I'll help you.

51:19.164 --> 51:21.207
I'll help you kill him.

51:21.500 --> 51:23.501
I've gotten Travis to trust me.

51:23.585 --> 51:27.254
In my own way, I'm going to eliminate
a small bit of darkness

51:27.339 --> 51:29.298
and let some light in.
