00:09.305 --> 00:10.389
Previously on Dexter...

00:10.432 --> 00:11.598
James Gellar.

00:11.725 --> 00:13.392
The professor,
from the University of Tallahassee?

00:13.435 --> 00:15.936
Gellar disappeared
three years ago after he got fired.

00:16.104 --> 00:19.106
You can't get in touch with him,
because he went underground.

00:19.232 --> 00:20.566
You're saying Gellar does the killing?

00:21.067 --> 00:22.276
He's so much stronger than me.

00:22.610 --> 00:24.486
Gellar is pulling you
toward the darkness, Travis,

00:24.612 --> 00:25.654
not the light.

00:25.780 --> 00:26.905
What you said to me

00:26.948 --> 00:28.782
- made me think.
- Think what?

00:28.908 --> 00:30.659
That I don't have to do what he says.

00:30.785 --> 00:31.785
You're free.

00:32.454 --> 00:33.495
So when Jessica Morris OD'd,

00:33.621 --> 00:35.664
there was definitely someone
in that hotel room with her.

00:35.790 --> 00:36.790
No doubt.

00:36.916 --> 00:39.084
Then why is LaGuerta on my ass
to close this thing?

00:41.463 --> 00:42.963
Oh, my God!

00:43.465 --> 00:44.923
What the fuck?

00:44.966 --> 00:47.968
Gellar hasn't seen wrath
until he's seen mine.

00:49.137 --> 00:50.262
Travis.

00:58.021 --> 00:59.271
Gellar.

00:59.314 --> 01:01.148
He's been dead all along.

01:01.649 --> 01:03.650
Travis acted alone.

01:03.943 --> 01:05.986
He killed all those people.

03:04.397 --> 03:06.607
Travis is the only Doomsday Killer,

03:07.775 --> 03:10.068
and I've made a terrible mistake.

03:36.846 --> 03:38.972
Same kill wound as the other victims,

03:39.349 --> 03:40.474
which means...

03:43.603 --> 03:44.770
Travis,

03:45.480 --> 03:46.647
you killed Gellar?

04:16.844 --> 04:17.844
Professor Gellar.

04:19.722 --> 04:20.847
It is not true.

04:22.141 --> 04:23.684
I did not kill you.

04:25.728 --> 04:27.646
No! No.

04:28.314 --> 04:29.982
You did, Travis.

04:31.025 --> 04:33.360
It's time you faced
the truth about yourself.

04:34.237 --> 04:35.988
He thinks Gellar is still alive.

04:36.322 --> 04:38.740
Talking to someone
who isn't there, huh?

04:40.743 --> 04:43.370
I remember, I came to your office.

04:44.205 --> 04:46.373
I brought you
the John the Revelator sword.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.542
Yeah, you'd stolen it.

04:48.584 --> 04:51.378
University blamed me,
and they fired me.

04:51.504 --> 04:53.588
I told you we needed it

04:54.882 --> 04:59.219
because we are the two witnesses
from Revelation 11.

04:59.929 --> 05:03.432
And I told you,
you were delusional and needed help.

05:03.725 --> 05:06.393
I convinced you, I made you see

05:08.104 --> 05:10.731
that we are the chosen ones.

05:12.942 --> 05:15.444
I proved it to you
that you couldn't be hurt.

05:15.570 --> 05:19.031
You stabbed me with the sword
three years ago.

05:19.574 --> 05:21.700
And it couldn't pierce your flesh.

05:27.623 --> 05:29.041
No.

05:32.378 --> 05:33.628
I didn't do that.

05:35.381 --> 05:41.094
You killed me, Travis,
and then you stuck me in the freezer.

05:43.598 --> 05:45.474
That didn't happen.

05:51.272 --> 05:55.484
It was him, the false prophet.
He killed you.

05:56.611 --> 06:00.614
He's trying to stop
what God has commanded us to do!

06:01.783 --> 06:04.451
And I will carry on without you.

06:05.953 --> 06:07.579
I will finish what we started.

06:10.124 --> 06:12.167
You were wrong, old man.

06:13.086 --> 06:14.836
I'm in control now.

06:17.298 --> 06:21.426
I will make new disciples
that will help me.

06:25.515 --> 06:27.641
I don't need you any more.

06:30.853 --> 06:32.479
Travis!

06:37.485 --> 06:38.985
I have to stop him.

06:42.490 --> 06:44.491
What happened to saving him?

06:45.451 --> 06:47.536
Travis' dark passenger
is a part of him.

06:47.662 --> 06:50.372
He can't be saved from it
any more than I can from mine.

06:54.043 --> 06:56.378
I should've never listened
to Brother Sam.

06:56.504 --> 06:57.879
He was right about one thing.

06:58.297 --> 06:59.965
If you put your faith
in the wrong thing...

07:03.052 --> 07:04.845
It can really fuck you up.

07:05.721 --> 07:08.223
It was a mistake
to put my faith in Travis.

07:10.351 --> 07:12.519
From now on,
I'm only putting my faith in myself.

07:18.860 --> 07:20.527
It's Deb.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.988
The cops are canvassing
a one-mile radius

07:23.030 --> 07:25.198
around the IP address
from Gellar's blog.

07:25.324 --> 07:26.366
They're closing in.

07:26.826 --> 07:28.368
Maybe it's time to let this one go.

07:28.411 --> 07:29.911
No.

07:30.037 --> 07:33.331
The only way to kill a dark passenger
is to take out the driver.

07:33.374 --> 07:37.252
After everything Travis
put me through, he's mine.

07:44.093 --> 07:45.886
What are you doing?

07:46.012 --> 07:48.346
If the cops find Gellar,
they'll focus the hunt on Travis,

07:48.389 --> 07:50.432
it'll make it that much harder
for me to get to him.

07:52.727 --> 07:54.936
I have to keep Gellar alive.

07:58.107 --> 08:00.525
This is ghoulish, even for you.

08:01.235 --> 08:04.237
Well, if the cops found
only Travis' prints,

08:04.363 --> 08:05.947
they'd get suspicious.

08:06.073 --> 08:09.367
This way, they'll find
Gellar's fingerprints, too.

08:15.541 --> 08:20.045
Once I'm done here,
I just have to strike the kill room,

08:20.087 --> 08:25.258
dump Gellar's body in the swamp
and head to Travis' motel.

08:25.593 --> 08:27.135
You really think he's there?

08:27.261 --> 08:29.971
No, but it might help me
get in touch with him.

08:30.890 --> 08:31.932
What about that?

08:33.726 --> 08:37.270
Well, it's helped me once.
Maybe I could use it again.

08:38.105 --> 08:40.899
I'll stash it in the morgue
for a rainy day.

08:59.627 --> 09:01.294
Gellar's blog.

09:01.420 --> 09:03.296
You mean Travis' blog.

09:04.465 --> 09:08.426
And now that I have Travis' laptop,
I can post as Gellar, too.

09:10.012 --> 09:12.806
Batting the beehive?
You sure that's a good idea?

09:13.140 --> 09:15.934
- Travis is unstable.
- I need him to engage.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.981
This should get his attention.

09:40.334 --> 09:43.503
I'll do anything for you, Dr Gellar.

09:43.838 --> 09:47.424
It's cool what you're doing,
killing all those people.

09:47.508 --> 09:48.592
That's creepy.

09:49.969 --> 09:52.470
Hey, Gellar. It's the end times, huh?

09:52.513 --> 09:55.849
Time for God's wrath?
Well, I got some God's wrath...

09:56.434 --> 09:57.684
Right here!

09:59.437 --> 10:02.439
Oh, yeah! End times! God's wrath.

10:09.196 --> 10:12.198
Dr Gellar, I've read all your stuff.

10:13.367 --> 10:15.201
But I felt like
you were just cracking the surface.

10:16.370 --> 10:19.164
Glad to see you man up,
take the next step.

10:19.540 --> 10:22.042
People are always being killed
in the bible,

10:23.294 --> 10:26.880
but I'm with you till the end of days.

11:10.549 --> 11:13.051
Doomsday Killers
in an abandoned church.

11:13.094 --> 11:15.053
It's too fucking perfect.

11:23.938 --> 11:25.522
Holy fucking shit. Is this it?

11:39.036 --> 11:40.954
Are these Gellar's paintings?

11:41.580 --> 11:43.123
It looks that way.

11:45.251 --> 11:46.292
And this has to be

11:46.377 --> 11:48.461
where Gellar and Travis
prepared their tableaus.

11:51.298 --> 11:52.382
And held their victims.

11:54.635 --> 11:56.636
Holy Christ on a stick.

11:58.305 --> 11:59.431
Sorry.

12:14.321 --> 12:16.406
Deb. You OK?

12:21.746 --> 12:25.165
I'm fine. I just need to...
I gotta get some air.

12:43.184 --> 12:44.434
What? What?

12:45.144 --> 12:47.687
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there.

12:56.363 --> 12:57.447
Fuck!

13:08.709 --> 13:11.628
The cops may have found his hideout,
but that won't stop Travis.

13:12.296 --> 13:13.379
That's up to me.

13:14.173 --> 13:16.633
I can't wait for him to
respond to the blog.

13:16.717 --> 13:19.177
I have to figure out his next kill.

13:19.470 --> 13:20.637
Dex, thank God you're here.

13:22.973 --> 13:25.725
You OK? You look kind of sweaty.

13:26.644 --> 13:28.561
I was fine until
I went into the church,

13:28.646 --> 13:30.313
and all of a sudden

13:30.397 --> 13:32.816
my heart started racing
and I couldn't breathe.

13:33.567 --> 13:35.735
What the fuck?
I've been to a million crime scenes.

13:37.738 --> 13:40.198
You remember that
Ice Truck Killer crime scene,

13:40.241 --> 13:42.367
when he filled the motel room
with blood?

13:42.409 --> 13:43.493
Yeah.

13:44.245 --> 13:45.328
I had a panic attack.

13:45.538 --> 13:47.038
Is that what this is? A panic attack?

13:48.415 --> 13:49.415
I don't know. Maybe.

13:50.835 --> 13:51.876
Well, what was yours about?

13:53.796 --> 13:55.672
Reminded me of when my mom died.

13:57.341 --> 13:59.717
Right. Fuck, obviously. I'm sorry.

14:00.010 --> 14:01.094
It's OK.

14:01.178 --> 14:03.680
But that makes sense,
you freaking out about your mom.

14:03.764 --> 14:05.890
Me, panicking at a crime scene?

14:06.809 --> 14:08.518
I'm the fucking lieutenant,
for Christ's sake.

14:08.602 --> 14:11.396
I can't get all woozy
every time I go to a crime scene.

14:11.689 --> 14:12.856
Maybe you're pregnant.

14:12.940 --> 14:16.359
First of all, fuck you,
and second of all,

14:16.443 --> 14:18.278
that would be
the immaculate fucking conception,

14:18.362 --> 14:20.864
since I haven't been with anyone
since Quinn.

14:22.032 --> 14:23.324
And lastly, fuck you.

14:24.118 --> 14:25.827
Sounds like you're feeling better.

14:27.746 --> 14:29.080
Let's go.

14:33.586 --> 14:36.713
Travis and Gellar were
busy fucking bees, huh?

14:38.799 --> 14:41.384
Makes you wonder where God was
when they were up to all this.

14:41.468 --> 14:44.304
It was a mistake to think
that any of this religious garbage

14:44.388 --> 14:46.347
could be an answer
to my dark passenger.

14:46.432 --> 14:50.435
There's no solution here,
only clues to finding Travis.

14:51.562 --> 14:52.687
The paintings...

14:53.147 --> 14:56.524
We got the seven-headed serpent,
the four horsemen,

14:57.192 --> 14:58.234
the angel.

14:58.652 --> 14:59.986
Quinn, nice of you to join us.

15:01.363 --> 15:04.324
The whore of Babylon,
the bowls of wrath

15:04.408 --> 15:05.950
and the sixth one...

15:09.914 --> 15:10.955
"Wormwood."

15:11.373 --> 15:12.415
What the fuck's a wormwood?

15:12.666 --> 15:14.125
Perhaps how I find Travis.

15:14.668 --> 15:15.960
It's the next sacrifice.

15:17.087 --> 15:19.130
Something about a star
that crashes down to the Earth

15:19.214 --> 15:21.049
and poisons mankind.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.385
Mankind?
Think this one will be bigger?

15:24.470 --> 15:26.804
Well, they used one body
for the four horsemen,

15:26.889 --> 15:28.473
they're not exactly going for literal.

15:28.682 --> 15:32.644
All right, we need to find the who,
the what and the where of this ASAP.

15:35.189 --> 15:36.230
Lieutenant Morgan.

15:36.398 --> 15:38.232
Who are you going to poison, Travis?

15:38.651 --> 15:40.443
Hey, Dex, there's blood.

15:44.990 --> 15:46.950
Think these could be
from the bowls of wrath?

15:47.034 --> 15:49.786
Could be. Let's test it against the
samples we took from the crime scene.

15:49.870 --> 15:50.912
Thank you, sir.

15:58.462 --> 16:00.129
Everything OK?

16:01.382 --> 16:04.634
Matthews wants to set up a dinner
sometime this week.

16:04.718 --> 16:06.386
Some place fancy.

16:08.055 --> 16:11.516
It sounds like he's inviting you
into his inner circle.

16:11.558 --> 16:14.060
Congratulations. You're big-time.

16:16.230 --> 16:17.730
Yeah, right.

16:21.235 --> 16:24.737
Now that I've done my job,
I can get on with my work.

16:26.031 --> 16:27.740
That looks promising.

16:28.575 --> 16:29.867
There's some more jars over there.

16:30.577 --> 16:32.161
I'll get it.

16:41.547 --> 16:42.714
"Travis Marshall."

16:51.515 --> 16:54.017
Dr Benjamin Carlson, from Miami.

16:54.518 --> 16:57.603
- What have you got?
- Just some paint thinner.

16:58.439 --> 17:00.064
What the fuck is chlorpromazine?

17:00.691 --> 17:02.233
Hey, Anderson.

17:02.901 --> 17:04.527
OK, I'll get back at you.

17:04.611 --> 17:06.446
Get a line on Dr Benjamin Carlson.

17:07.531 --> 17:10.616
- I think Travis was a patient of his.
- Got it.

17:12.786 --> 17:15.204
At least I still have Gellar's blog.

17:16.290 --> 17:18.624
The prodigal son has returned.

17:19.293 --> 17:21.711
"False prophet." He's talking to me.

17:22.379 --> 17:25.631
"I listened to you once and
I made a mistake, but never again.

17:25.716 --> 17:26.966
"I'm going to fix it."

17:28.260 --> 17:29.302
What's his mistake?

17:30.637 --> 17:34.307
Was it straying from Gellar
and listening to me?

17:39.313 --> 17:43.066
- I'm psyched you could do breakfast.
- One of the perks of being a nanny.

17:43.150 --> 17:45.818
Two hours off
while Harrison's in preschool.

17:46.236 --> 17:47.278
I need a little advice.

17:48.155 --> 17:49.822
I really want to show Dexter
my video game.

17:49.990 --> 17:52.450
You know, find out what a real
blood spatter analyst thinks of it.

17:52.576 --> 17:53.659
Good idea.

17:54.328 --> 17:56.996
I have never seen
the guy make a mistake, like, ever.

17:57.081 --> 18:00.291
- So you want to impress him.
- Yeah. I mean, he's...

18:01.001 --> 18:02.126
He's kind of intense.

18:02.169 --> 18:04.128
Babe, I don't know
what he's like at work,

18:04.338 --> 18:07.590
but once you've seen him reading
Everybody Poops to Harrison,

18:07.674 --> 18:09.967
you realise he's a big softie.

18:11.595 --> 18:13.304
Just talk to him.

18:16.767 --> 18:17.850
Lieutenant?

18:17.976 --> 18:20.561
I have the personal effects
of Jessica Morris.

18:20.687 --> 18:23.564
- You asked for them.
- Oh, right, fuck. The dead call girl.

18:26.693 --> 18:28.694
Just put them in my office.
I'll look at it later.

18:28.821 --> 18:29.862
OK.

18:31.365 --> 18:33.324
Still looking into that case.

18:33.367 --> 18:35.701
We've been through this.
I'm just doing my job.

18:35.744 --> 18:38.204
You're not. That's the problem.

18:40.374 --> 18:43.501
I need to figure out
what Travis needs to fix,

18:43.710 --> 18:47.839
what exactly is wormwood
and who will his victim be?

18:49.007 --> 18:51.592
OK, people, big day,
so let's get started.

18:51.718 --> 18:52.718
Are you running the briefing?

18:53.554 --> 18:56.013
Doomsday is our most
important investigation,

18:56.056 --> 18:57.515
and the more I help out,

18:57.558 --> 19:00.393
the more time you'll have
to focus on other cases.

19:00.519 --> 19:01.769
You're the boss.

19:04.731 --> 19:06.607
- You OK?
- Peachy fucking keen.

19:06.900 --> 19:10.945
So I understand that we found
Doomsday's hideout. Where was it?

19:11.071 --> 19:13.281
- In an abandoned church.
- Great.

19:13.907 --> 19:15.074
Bring me up to speed.

19:15.450 --> 19:17.410
I found a hidden cellar.

19:17.703 --> 19:19.745
I was sure it was gonna be
filled with body parts,

19:19.872 --> 19:22.707
but there was just some church crap
and an old freezer.

19:22.749 --> 19:24.250
Sorry to disappoint you.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.043
Dexter? Masuka?

19:28.088 --> 19:30.923
The place was covered in prints
from Travis and Gellar.

19:30.966 --> 19:33.134
- What about the blood in the jars?
- What jars?

19:33.260 --> 19:34.969
We found bloody jars
in the trash. Dex?

19:35.387 --> 19:36.929
Same type as Travis',

19:37.055 --> 19:40.308
and it matched some of the samples
we took from the bowls of wrath.

19:40.434 --> 19:43.769
I was thinking Holly Benson,
the girl who escaped.

19:43.812 --> 19:45.229
She thought they made her drink blood.

19:46.273 --> 19:47.440
Maybe it was from those jars.

19:47.566 --> 19:51.110
Holly Benson didn't escape.
Travis let her go because of me.

19:51.236 --> 19:53.821
Anderson, what do you got?
Anything else?

19:54.656 --> 19:57.283
Could she be the mistake
Travis was talking about?

20:00.162 --> 20:02.288
The mistake he needs to fix.

20:04.333 --> 20:07.126
Travis is already
back on Gellar's path.

20:08.462 --> 20:10.671
Will Holly be his victim
in the wormwood tableau?

20:12.174 --> 20:16.260
If I find Holly,
hopefully I'll find Travis.

20:20.098 --> 20:21.474
Dexter. Hey!

20:22.017 --> 20:23.643
Jamie and I went to
your doughnut shop this morning...

20:23.769 --> 20:25.311
Not now, Louis.

20:44.665 --> 20:45.706
It's... It's you.

20:46.208 --> 20:47.333
And you're Doomsday Adam.

20:48.210 --> 20:53.005
It's just I... I never imagined...
Steve Dorsey.

20:53.048 --> 20:54.507
This is such an honour.

20:55.676 --> 20:57.927
It's nice to meet you, too, Steve.

20:58.845 --> 21:00.721
Do you mind if I come in?
I'm kind of being hunted.

21:00.847 --> 21:03.224
Oh, right! Yep, please. Come on in.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.896
Beth, get in here and meet our guest.

21:09.189 --> 21:13.442
Well, I hope he's hungry.
I have snacks.

21:15.112 --> 21:16.195
Oh, my...

21:16.530 --> 21:17.613
How about that?

21:19.366 --> 21:21.867
Travis Marshall.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Beth.

21:22.077 --> 21:25.204
Oh, I know who you are.
I've seen you on the news.

21:26.540 --> 21:28.416
Is Professor Gellar coming, too?

21:28.542 --> 21:30.209
No. Not today.

21:31.044 --> 21:34.130
We were just so confused by...
by his blog.

21:34.214 --> 21:36.132
He said
this was all the devil's errand.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.092
Professor Gellar didn't write that.

21:38.218 --> 21:41.220
It was a false prophet trying to
throw a monkey wrench into God's plan.

21:41.388 --> 21:42.430
I knew it.

21:43.432 --> 21:44.557
Well, please sit down.

21:47.394 --> 21:51.063
Sorry I just have
Velveeta and crackers.

21:51.148 --> 21:53.983
Steve's been out of work lately and...

21:57.070 --> 21:58.070
I know how it is.

21:58.405 --> 22:01.615
Sometimes it feels
as if God has forgotten us.

22:03.118 --> 22:05.161
But I'm here to tell you
that your time has come.

22:07.581 --> 22:11.625
The faithful will be given
untold riches in God's new kingdom,

22:13.253 --> 22:15.963
if you trust and obey.

22:17.341 --> 22:21.260
We're ready, Mr Marshall.
We'll do whatever you say.

22:22.346 --> 22:23.596
Good.

22:25.098 --> 22:27.308
But first, I need to know
that you're fully committed.

22:30.604 --> 22:34.857
Holly Benson's apartment,
the victim who would've been.

22:34.941 --> 22:38.486
I can stake the place out,
wait and see if Travis shows up.

22:43.784 --> 22:46.619
Aren't you putting a lot of eggs
in the Holly basket?

22:46.870 --> 22:49.121
I'm trusting my instincts.

22:49.956 --> 22:52.041
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

22:58.298 --> 23:00.049
Doesn't look like she's here.

23:01.968 --> 23:03.886
What if Travis got to her first?

23:04.429 --> 23:06.972
There's no signs
of a struggle or a break-in.

23:09.601 --> 23:13.145
Not an ounce of makeup.
No hairbrush, no toothbrush.

23:14.272 --> 23:16.524
She could've packed a bag,
gone out of town.

23:16.608 --> 23:17.650
She still won't be safe.

23:17.734 --> 23:20.111
Travis is determined to find her
wherever she is.

23:20.862 --> 23:23.864
Which is why I have to make sure
I find her first.

23:25.158 --> 23:27.326
Come on, Holly.
Give me something I can use.

23:29.996 --> 23:31.038
Something else.

23:31.706 --> 23:34.333
Who would she be with?
Family? Friends?

23:34.793 --> 23:35.876
Boyfriend.

23:38.463 --> 23:40.047
I bet he knows where she is.

23:41.842 --> 23:42.967
Peter Grant.

23:43.969 --> 23:45.261
I'm guessing this is him.

24:09.161 --> 24:11.537
Hi, I'm looking for Peter Grant.

24:11.621 --> 24:12.788
Oh, my dad.

24:13.123 --> 24:14.165
Is he at home?

24:14.708 --> 24:16.542
Does it look like
I have parental supervision?

24:18.795 --> 24:21.255
He's off in Spain. Or Portugal maybe.

24:22.048 --> 24:25.009
Can you tell me if he knows
a woman named Holly Benson?

24:25.677 --> 24:28.262
She's my dad's "sex-retary". Why?

24:30.223 --> 24:33.100
I'm a friend.
Can't seem to get in touch with her.

24:33.185 --> 24:36.395
Yeah, well, no offence,
but your friend is a total slam pig.

24:37.814 --> 24:39.315
Right. Slam pig.

24:40.484 --> 24:41.692
Any idea where I can find her?

24:41.860 --> 24:43.861
- I don't know. The yacht maybe?
- Yacht?

24:43.945 --> 24:46.238
My dad has this boat
that he refuses to get rid of.

24:46.948 --> 24:48.532
Probably some kind of fuck pad.

24:49.618 --> 24:50.868
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

24:50.952 --> 24:52.203
On the water somewhere.

24:53.371 --> 24:54.455
Thanks.

24:54.539 --> 24:57.041
If you do find her, though,
will you give her a message for me?

25:04.216 --> 25:05.591
Nice kid.

25:06.426 --> 25:08.511
But if she's right and
Holly's out on a boat alone,

25:08.595 --> 25:10.638
she's a sitting duck for Travis.

25:11.556 --> 25:13.390
Time to play "find the fuck pad".

25:14.226 --> 25:15.726
He's in Spain with his wife.

25:16.394 --> 25:19.772
If he was lying, would he let me
crash on his boat while he's away?

25:21.900 --> 25:24.109
Who asked you anyway? I got to go.

26:02.816 --> 26:04.024
Hello?

26:11.866 --> 26:13.325
Who's there?

26:14.911 --> 26:16.036
Hello, whore.

26:30.719 --> 26:32.511
We're going for a little cruise.

26:55.452 --> 26:57.077
What the fuck?

26:58.079 --> 27:00.205
- You're a fucking asshole.
- I'm an asshole?

27:01.374 --> 27:03.292
Doomsday's out there
searching for his next victim

27:03.376 --> 27:05.085
and you're asleep on the job.

27:05.837 --> 27:08.922
- What are you, fucking super cop?
- No. I give a shit.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.300
Maybe you should try it for once,

27:11.384 --> 27:13.010
instead of going out drinking
every night

27:13.094 --> 27:14.595
and coming to work while messed up.

27:14.888 --> 27:17.222
- Give it a fucking rest, man.
- So what?

27:17.557 --> 27:19.350
Your girlfriend broke up with you.
Get over it.

27:19.476 --> 27:21.852
Fuck that. I'm just being
a single guy having fun.

27:21.936 --> 27:23.520
- You should try it for once.
- Hey.

27:24.522 --> 27:26.065
Any leads on a wormwood victim?

27:26.149 --> 27:28.359
We're going over Gellar's and Travis'

27:28.443 --> 27:29.985
friends, relatives and acquaintances.

27:30.070 --> 27:32.488
Figure the last two victims
were personal.

27:32.614 --> 27:33.781
Good thinking. Keep at it.

27:34.157 --> 27:35.574
Any luck on the Dr Carlson front?

27:35.867 --> 27:37.451
Turns out he passed away
a couple years ago,

27:37.535 --> 27:40.746
but I got a court order releasing
Travis Marshall's psych eval.

27:40.914 --> 27:42.706
Drugs were anti-psychotics.

27:42.791 --> 27:45.292
Apparently he had
some breaks with reality.

27:45.377 --> 27:49.004
Jesus. Violent tendencies
since childhood, a lack of empathy,

27:49.089 --> 27:51.465
master manipulator,
delusions of grandeur.

27:51.549 --> 27:54.134
It makes sense.
Fucker wants to end the world.

27:54.427 --> 27:56.303
- What's that?
- Travis' psych file.

27:56.388 --> 27:58.222
More like psycho file.

27:58.306 --> 28:00.516
The guy was a complete sociopath.

28:00.600 --> 28:03.102
Shit, it says here the shrink thought
he killed his parents.

28:03.436 --> 28:04.645
I thought it was a car accident.

28:04.896 --> 28:09.066
Or not. Apparently Travis attacked
his father and grabbed the wheel,

28:09.150 --> 28:11.110
turned it right into a tree.

28:12.362 --> 28:13.946
Any signs of parental abuse?

28:16.074 --> 28:18.450
It's so weird, his sister seemed
so convinced he was a good guy.

28:19.035 --> 28:20.577
Maybe she didn't know.

28:21.871 --> 28:23.414
Anything's possible.

28:25.417 --> 28:28.001
He's been a monster from the start.

28:30.255 --> 28:32.965
He's using Gellar
to justify his kills.

28:33.258 --> 28:35.926
A lot of people justify their kills.

28:36.177 --> 28:38.178
You mean me?

28:38.263 --> 28:41.515
You justified my kills.
You taught me the code.

28:41.808 --> 28:44.017
I kept you from becoming your brother.

28:44.519 --> 28:46.770
Making me a killer
was the best you could do.

28:47.147 --> 28:48.647
You were already gonna be a killer.

28:48.815 --> 28:50.566
I guess we'll never know.

28:53.153 --> 28:54.778
There it is.

28:55.780 --> 28:56.947
The fuck pad.

28:57.365 --> 28:58.782
The Ricochet Rabbit.

29:04.414 --> 29:06.665
- Where you going?
- I know this marina.

29:11.796 --> 29:13.797
I had a freak-out
at a crime scene today.

29:14.132 --> 29:15.257
Is that unusual?

29:16.009 --> 29:17.926
Yes, that's unusual.

29:20.054 --> 29:23.015
Seen a lot of fucked-up shit,
and it usually just rolls right off.

29:23.099 --> 29:24.141
But not today.

29:25.727 --> 29:28.020
You know what's even weirder
is the stuff that usually fucks me up

29:28.104 --> 29:30.439
- didn't even faze me today.
- Like what?

29:30.523 --> 29:33.817
Like LaGuerta trying to swing
her dick around in the briefing room.

29:33.902 --> 29:34.985
I handled that like a champ.

29:35.111 --> 29:36.195
Well, that's fantastic.

29:38.448 --> 29:41.033
So why did I lose my shit
when I walked into that church?

29:43.286 --> 29:45.454
Did the church have
some kind of significance for you?

29:45.538 --> 29:47.122
I don't know.
The only time I go to church

29:47.207 --> 29:49.166
is to go to a funeral, you know?

29:50.001 --> 29:54.004
My mom, my dad,
boyfriends, my sister-in-law.

29:55.590 --> 29:57.341
So you associate church with loss.

29:59.969 --> 30:01.053
I guess.

30:03.723 --> 30:05.057
Whatever. Doesn't matter.

30:05.141 --> 30:06.934
My brother showed up,
he calmed me down.

30:07.101 --> 30:08.143
Dexter?

30:09.479 --> 30:10.687
Was it something that he said?

30:13.233 --> 30:14.274
I guess.

30:17.529 --> 30:20.364
Not really.
It was more just him being there.

30:23.535 --> 30:25.369
Come to think of it,

30:26.579 --> 30:29.706
every time the shit hits the fan,
I go to him.

30:31.417 --> 30:32.876
I've even moved in with him
a few times.

30:32.961 --> 30:34.545
- He's your safe place.
- Yeah.

30:35.880 --> 30:36.922
Since we were kids.

30:38.883 --> 30:41.301
I used to have these nightmares,

30:43.012 --> 30:46.890
and I would sneak into his room
and I'd curl up on the floor.

30:48.935 --> 30:51.228
He wouldn't even know I was there.

30:54.858 --> 30:55.899
Is that weird?

30:57.277 --> 30:59.486
I don't know. Do you think it's weird?

31:03.908 --> 31:06.076
Not really. He's my brother.

31:08.371 --> 31:09.955
I think it's sweet.

31:17.589 --> 31:19.464
What are you gonna do?

31:20.800 --> 31:23.093
You mean, what are we going to do?

31:23.386 --> 31:24.553
We're going to kill her, Beth.

31:26.431 --> 31:27.973
He's testing our faith.

31:28.224 --> 31:30.100
Like Abraham.

31:30.184 --> 31:34.104
You've got it easy.
He was asked to sacrifice his son.

31:34.188 --> 31:36.231
You just have to pitch in
and help kill a whore.

31:36.482 --> 31:37.566
I don't think I can do that.

31:42.697 --> 31:44.281
I understand, Beth.

31:45.617 --> 31:48.243
But you'll be purifying her sins.

31:48.786 --> 31:52.873
Her soul will know paradise
because of your strength, your love.

31:54.959 --> 31:58.045
Come on. Let's show her some love.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.579
Hey, Dexter!

32:32.664 --> 32:35.707
Louis got here a little early
to pick me up for our date.

32:36.292 --> 32:38.877
You have a date?
I was hoping you could stay.

32:39.337 --> 32:40.420
Sorry.

32:40.922 --> 32:42.881
I don't supposed
you'd wanna have your date here?

32:44.342 --> 32:45.509
We can't.

32:45.593 --> 32:48.387
Louis bought us tickets
to go see The Avett Brothers.

32:49.681 --> 32:50.806
Can't go another time?

32:51.057 --> 32:52.182
They're only playing tonight.

32:57.105 --> 32:59.189
Hey, Dexter,

33:00.400 --> 33:03.694
I was wondering if maybe you could
take a look at my game before we go.

33:03.903 --> 33:05.195
I mean, if it's not a bad time.

33:05.279 --> 33:09.199
- I should probably put Harrison down.
- I got him. You take it easy.

33:09.701 --> 33:12.119
Looks like you had a long day at work.

33:15.581 --> 33:16.623
Daddy.

33:20.628 --> 33:21.670
So...

33:22.755 --> 33:23.797
Looks like you have a minute.

33:24.007 --> 33:25.048
Looks like I do.

33:26.342 --> 33:27.467
Awesome.

33:27.552 --> 33:30.679
I'll just...
I'll bring the game up on my laptop.

33:33.057 --> 33:36.351
So, the game is about homicide.

33:36.436 --> 33:39.521
And I know there's, like, a million
video games out there about that.

33:39.647 --> 33:41.481
But the secret to this game is,

33:41.566 --> 33:43.150
and I haven't even
told Jamie this yet,

33:43.234 --> 33:44.943
but in my game,

33:45.403 --> 33:48.864
you can be the serial killer.

33:51.034 --> 33:52.075
What?

33:53.202 --> 33:56.580
See, you have these character choices.
You can be

33:57.665 --> 34:01.460
Dahmer, Jack the Ripper,
the Bay Harbour Butcher.

34:02.128 --> 34:04.296
I am the Bay Harbour Butcher.

34:04.464 --> 34:05.505
So,

34:06.924 --> 34:08.633
what do you think?

34:10.720 --> 34:12.554
I think this is offensive.

34:15.475 --> 34:17.976
Who would choose to be
a serial killer?

34:20.813 --> 34:24.357
Well, I mean,
it's like a vicarious thrill.

34:25.359 --> 34:26.902
"Vicarious thrill"?

34:29.572 --> 34:31.948
How could you possibly know
what it's like to take a life?

34:32.033 --> 34:33.742
Why would you even want to?

34:36.746 --> 34:39.664
It's a bad idea. Do something else.

34:47.131 --> 34:48.298
So?

34:51.135 --> 34:56.098
I'm not... I'm not feeling well.
I think I should go home.

34:56.974 --> 34:58.183
And miss the show?

34:58.643 --> 35:00.477
I'm sorry. I'm not...

35:01.687 --> 35:03.063
I'm not up to it.

35:08.486 --> 35:09.694
Still need a sitter?

35:15.827 --> 35:21.289
This is the spot, but no boat.
Which means Holly is probably on it.

35:21.374 --> 35:24.167
Unfortunately, Travis may be with her.

35:26.337 --> 35:30.006
Only one way to know for sure,
check the security camera footage.

36:05.251 --> 36:07.544
I guess we all tell lies
about ourselves.

36:09.130 --> 36:11.256
Security video archives.

36:35.990 --> 36:37.240
Travis.

36:47.627 --> 36:50.003
It's got sea tracker
and the password is...

36:51.088 --> 36:52.255
Neptune.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.257
Thank you, Mr Grant.
How can I help you tonight?

36:54.759 --> 36:56.635
Yeah, I kind of have a problem.

36:56.719 --> 36:58.803
My girlfriend and I got into a fight

36:58.888 --> 37:01.223
and she took off with my boat,
and I don't know where she went.

37:01.766 --> 37:04.017
I have the coordinates right here.
I'll notify the police.

37:04.977 --> 37:06.436
Any way around that?

37:07.104 --> 37:08.480
Sorry, sir, it's protocol.

37:08.731 --> 37:12.192
I know. It's just, I don't think
my wife would be too thrilled

37:12.276 --> 37:13.777
to find out about my girlfriend.

37:16.239 --> 37:17.447
I understand.

37:17.865 --> 37:21.743
She's got a bit of a jump on you.
I've got her location right here.

38:01.784 --> 38:04.286
This is wormwood.

38:07.873 --> 38:09.624
I thought it would be bigger.

38:09.709 --> 38:11.751
- So we're ready?
- Not yet.

38:12.003 --> 38:14.546
We have to cover our tracks.
Police will find this place.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.589
What difference does it make?

38:16.674 --> 38:18.258
The world's ending in four days.
It doesn't...

38:18.342 --> 38:22.304
It will only end
if we complete our work.

38:22.388 --> 38:24.431
That can't happen if we're in jail.

38:24.515 --> 38:26.474
God never said this would be easy.

38:49.415 --> 38:51.041
Jessica Morris.

38:53.294 --> 38:55.128
Guilt trip from beyond the grave.

39:11.729 --> 39:12.854
Sal's flowers. Sal speaking.

39:12.938 --> 39:16.066
Hi, this is Lieutenant Debra Morgan
from Miami Metro Homicide.

39:16.233 --> 39:19.235
I need to know if you recently
delivered flowers to a Jessica Morris,

39:19.528 --> 39:21.571
sent by someone with the initial "T".

39:21.655 --> 39:23.239
Jessica Morris.

39:23.991 --> 39:26.618
Here it is, dozen red,
delivered morning of the 18th.

39:27.328 --> 39:29.204
That was the day she died.
Who sent them?

39:29.288 --> 39:32.457
Oh, my God. It was Thomas Matthews.

39:33.667 --> 39:36.002
I'm sorry,
did you say Thomas Matthews?

39:38.005 --> 39:39.089
What's his phone number?

39:40.883 --> 39:43.927
305-454-8537?

39:46.555 --> 39:48.264
Jesus Christ. Thank you.

40:00.694 --> 40:01.820
Hey, Deb, what's up?

40:02.238 --> 40:03.780
I have a situation. Can we talk?

40:03.906 --> 40:04.948
What is it?

40:05.116 --> 40:06.574
Not on the phone.
When are you coming in?

40:08.786 --> 40:11.996
Not for a while. I have some
personal stuff to take care of.

40:12.081 --> 40:13.748
- Before you get mad...
- It's OK.

40:14.041 --> 40:15.583
- It is?
- Yes.

40:16.210 --> 40:17.627
You have your own life to deal with.

40:17.962 --> 40:21.673
It seems to be filled with a fuck load
of mysterious personal stuff,

40:21.841 --> 40:23.675
but whatever.

40:23.759 --> 40:26.511
Well, thanks for being
so understanding.

40:26.595 --> 40:28.054
Well, I'm sorry I wasn't before.

40:28.431 --> 40:29.931
You've got my back when it counts.
I know that.

40:30.015 --> 40:31.057
OK.

40:31.142 --> 40:34.811
By the way, you were right about
that whole panic attack thing,

40:34.895 --> 40:35.937
so thank you.

40:38.524 --> 40:40.942
I'm gonna get off the phone now
so that I can have another one.

40:41.026 --> 40:42.569
I'll see you when you get in, OK?

40:59.420 --> 41:01.546
Louis. You're here early.

41:02.089 --> 41:05.008
I couldn't sleep.
I got a lot on my mind.

41:06.093 --> 41:07.969
I think I found a new lead.

41:08.387 --> 41:13.099
This guy, Doomsday Adam.
He keeps posting on Gellar's blog.

41:13.517 --> 41:15.935
To all of professor Gellar's
faithful followers,

41:16.353 --> 41:20.148
I can now tell you without a doubt
that his prophecies are real.

41:20.399 --> 41:23.651
My wife Beth and I have been chosen
to be soldiers in the final battle,

41:23.903 --> 41:27.906
and with God's help,
we will prove worthy.

41:27.948 --> 41:29.115
This will be our last post.

41:30.826 --> 41:31.993
See you in paradise.

41:33.287 --> 41:37.081
You think maybe Gellar and Travis
got to this guy and enlisted his help?

41:37.666 --> 41:40.835
- I know it's a long shot, but...
- It's worth checking out.

41:42.588 --> 41:43.630
You think you could track down

41:43.756 --> 41:45.798
Doomsday Adam's
real name and address?

41:46.759 --> 41:48.801
His name is Steve Dorsey.

41:49.470 --> 41:50.929
Here's his address.

41:52.681 --> 41:56.601
Good work.
I'll call Quinn, go check it out.

42:00.814 --> 42:02.941
At least someone around here
appreciates me.

42:06.612 --> 42:08.196
Hey, it's Quinn.

42:08.781 --> 42:11.950
For the fourth fucking time,
answer your phone.

42:13.786 --> 42:15.662
I'm not calling again. Just get here.

42:35.849 --> 42:38.977
Sergeant Batista,
Miami Metro Homicide.

42:39.311 --> 42:41.145
Are you Mrs Beth Dorsey?

42:41.397 --> 42:44.148
- Yes, that's right.
- Is your husband home?

42:44.817 --> 42:46.985
No, he's not.
Is there something wrong?

42:47.152 --> 42:49.237
I'd like to ask you a few questions
if you don't mind.

42:50.406 --> 42:53.408
Are you aware that your husband
has been posting on a blog

42:53.993 --> 42:55.159
by a Professor Gellar?

42:57.496 --> 42:59.581
Gosh, maybe you should talk to him
when he gets back.

42:59.665 --> 43:01.666
How about we start with you
and we take it from there?

43:22.021 --> 43:23.855
Found the fuck pad.

43:25.691 --> 43:26.941
Travis.

43:28.861 --> 43:30.361
Why is he in a hazmat suit?

44:10.569 --> 44:11.611
You're too late.

44:12.988 --> 44:14.656
Wormwood can't be stopped.

44:15.282 --> 44:16.449
No!

44:20.663 --> 44:23.414
This was supposed to set things right.

44:27.252 --> 44:29.420
So you're telling me
that this was all a joke?

44:29.755 --> 44:32.131
The videos your husband posted
as Doomsday Adam,

44:32.257 --> 44:34.258
the whole "chosen" thing?

44:34.426 --> 44:36.803
My husband has kind of
a strange sense of humour.

44:36.929 --> 44:38.346
Yeah, I would say so.

44:38.430 --> 44:40.139
Steve's been out of work lately.

44:40.265 --> 44:43.309
He was hoping
the videos might go viral

44:43.435 --> 44:46.187
and get him some attention,
and I just wanted to be supportive.

44:46.271 --> 44:49.816
Mrs Dorsey, these murders are
nothing to be joking around about.

44:50.776 --> 44:53.986
Your husband wasted
valuable police time and resources

44:54.113 --> 44:56.364
that could've been spent
catching the Doomsday Killers.

44:56.990 --> 44:58.282
I am so sorry.

44:58.992 --> 45:02.203
I will talk to Steve,
tell him to get those videos down.

45:02.705 --> 45:03.788
This will not happen again.

45:04.498 --> 45:05.623
I'd appreciate that.

45:20.639 --> 45:22.890
If this was all a joke,

45:22.975 --> 45:26.185
why do you have all these books
by Professor James Gellar?

45:30.983 --> 45:33.317
What are we gonna do? He's a cop.

45:33.402 --> 45:36.904
He doesn't enforce God's law, we do.

45:39.658 --> 45:41.033
It's a sign.

45:44.830 --> 45:46.247
"Miami Metro Homicide."

45:46.373 --> 45:48.875
That's where
God wants us to stage wormwood.

45:53.046 --> 45:55.006
Nothing to tell you
what wormwood is going to be.

45:55.507 --> 45:58.843
I don't care what it's gonna be,
I wanna know where it's gonna be.

45:59.928 --> 46:01.429
I have to fix this.

46:37.633 --> 46:38.883
Holly.

46:39.259 --> 46:42.595
But this doesn't look like wormwood.
She was stabbed, not poisoned.

46:42.721 --> 46:44.555
You're still too late.
She's already dead.

46:44.765 --> 46:47.058
Travis is gone
and you killed the wrong guy.

46:47.100 --> 46:48.267
When you gonna let this go?

46:48.769 --> 46:50.645
When I kill Travis.

46:50.938 --> 46:52.438
Are you sure you can make that happen?

46:52.564 --> 46:54.148
Isn't that what you taught me to do?

46:54.316 --> 46:55.483
I didn't have a choice.

46:55.901 --> 46:58.152
According to you,
I don't have one either.

46:58.946 --> 47:00.905
Well, you have a choice to make
right now.

47:00.948 --> 47:04.992
- Maybe you should call the police.
- I told you, I don't call the police.

47:05.244 --> 47:06.744
Travis is mine.

47:07.287 --> 47:09.288
Dexter, don't make this personal.

47:17.422 --> 47:19.090
Methylphosphonyl difluoride?

47:19.258 --> 47:20.591
And isopropyl alcohol.

47:21.260 --> 47:22.969
Mix them together, they're lethal.

47:23.262 --> 47:26.472
Poison gas. This is wormwood.

47:28.767 --> 47:30.685
This could kill
who knows how many people.

47:30.769 --> 47:32.937
Dexter, you have to call the police.

47:33.772 --> 47:35.773
Why would I listen to you?
I'm only here because of you,

47:35.858 --> 47:37.942
now I'm supposed to
trust your judgement?

47:38.026 --> 47:39.777
- I'll make my own decision.
- Dex.

47:39.820 --> 47:41.195
Leave me alone!

47:49.329 --> 47:50.621
Brother Sam said it.

47:50.706 --> 47:54.792
Sometimes you have to surrender
to something greater than yourself.

47:56.670 --> 47:58.880
911. What's your emergency?

47:58.964 --> 48:03.301
The Doomsday Killers are hiding out
on a yacht at 114 Bleaker Canal Road.

48:03.343 --> 48:04.677
And who's calling, please?

48:04.803 --> 48:08.556
I'd rather not leave my name.
Hurry. They have poison gas.
