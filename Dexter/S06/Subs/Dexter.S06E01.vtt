00:09.681 --> 00:11.140
Previously on Dexter...

00:12.267 --> 00:14.768
People think it's fun
to pretend you're a monster.

00:14.811 --> 00:17.104
Me, I spend my life
pretending I'm not.

00:17.147 --> 00:20.274
What made me the way I am
left a hollow place inside.

00:21.860 --> 00:24.111
So I've become an expert
at blending in,

00:24.154 --> 00:25.988
camouflaging myself.

00:26.281 --> 00:28.365
They make it look so easy,

00:28.491 --> 00:30.617
connecting with another human being.

00:30.952 --> 00:32.327
I love you.

00:32.454 --> 00:35.372
But if I could have feelings at all,
I'd have them for Deb.

00:35.457 --> 00:37.791
Why is it we never
talk brother-sister stuff?

00:37.876 --> 00:40.669
To be a brother, to have a friend...

00:40.795 --> 00:42.671
I only have one person
I can trust any more.

00:42.797 --> 00:43.881
You.

00:44.007 --> 00:45.340
To have a family...

00:45.508 --> 00:47.301
- Rita's pregnant.
- That's so great!

00:47.802 --> 00:51.138
If you play a role long enough,
really commit,

00:51.306 --> 00:53.390
does it ever become real?

00:54.476 --> 00:57.144
Any time you let someone get close,
it ends badly.

00:57.312 --> 00:58.979
I will fuck you back!

00:59.022 --> 01:00.189
Harry was right.

01:02.233 --> 01:05.152
- I've never felt this.
- You've never had a son before.

01:05.195 --> 01:06.862
You wanna see him come into the world.

01:06.988 --> 01:09.865
Yes. I've never wanted
anything so much in my life.

01:10.033 --> 01:13.160
Sure, I'm still who I was, who I am.

01:13.244 --> 01:15.079
Question is, what do I become?

01:15.497 --> 01:18.040
Camouflage is
nature's craftiest trick.

01:18.166 --> 01:21.001
Arthur's terrorised them
into maintaining his cover.

01:21.044 --> 01:23.170
They're nothing but human shields.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.172
That's what happens to people
who live with a monster.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.340
I'm nothing like him!

01:26.883 --> 01:28.342
My family is nothing like that.

01:29.094 --> 01:31.345
I have to be the one to kill him.

01:31.554 --> 01:33.388
I have a family, too, Arthur.

01:36.851 --> 01:40.354
I thought I could change what I am,
keep my family safe.

01:41.064 --> 01:42.564
But it doesn't matter what I do.

01:43.191 --> 01:44.900
I'm what's wrong.

01:47.028 --> 01:48.570
So what's your plan here?

01:49.572 --> 01:51.865
I can't get revenge for Rita's death.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.868
But I can help Lumen
avenge what was done to her.

01:58.790 --> 02:02.084
In her eyes, I'm not a monster at all.

02:03.878 --> 02:05.420
I don't feel it any more.

02:05.547 --> 02:06.922
I'm so sorry.

02:07.048 --> 02:08.882
Don't be sorry your darkness is gone.

02:09.134 --> 02:12.052
I'll carry it for you. Always.

02:13.221 --> 02:15.055
She made me think,
for the briefest moment,

02:15.140 --> 02:17.224
that I might even
have a chance to be human.

02:18.726 --> 02:21.728
But wishes, of course,
are for children.

04:20.014 --> 04:23.725
There are times in our lives
when everything seems to go wrong.

04:23.935 --> 04:28.188
When, despite our best efforts,
and for no apparent rhyme or reason,

04:28.231 --> 04:29.898
tragedy strikes.

04:31.609 --> 04:33.277
911, what's your emergency?

04:33.361 --> 04:36.863
- I've been stabbed.
- I understand, sir.

04:37.532 --> 04:38.865
Can you tell me your location?

04:38.908 --> 04:40.534
Please, I need help.

04:41.619 --> 04:44.538
Team 42, we have a possible stabbing
in the warehouse district.

04:44.622 --> 04:46.540
Please stand by
for approximate address.

05:05.268 --> 05:07.561
And there are other times
when everything goes

05:07.729 --> 05:08.895
just perfectly.

05:09.564 --> 05:11.898
That's how the last year
has been for me.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.615
Hello, Ben.

05:21.409 --> 05:22.743
Roger.

05:23.911 --> 05:26.496
You know it's wrong
what you've been doing.

05:26.622 --> 05:28.081
What's going on?

05:28.666 --> 05:30.500
How do you know our names?

05:32.587 --> 05:36.131
Helping some of your patients live
and letting others die.

05:37.091 --> 05:39.426
Making them die

05:39.469 --> 05:42.471
so you could harvest their body parts.

05:42.597 --> 05:44.931
The police arrested
the emergency room doctor

05:44.974 --> 05:48.935
who was selling them,
and that closed the case.

05:49.103 --> 05:53.482
But I knew they must've had
a regular supplier.

05:53.608 --> 05:56.443
So I did my research,
and here you are.

05:58.529 --> 06:00.947
- We were just trying to...
- No!

06:01.699 --> 06:03.992
You were just trying to
help yourselves make some money.

06:09.332 --> 06:10.874
That's all.

06:25.306 --> 06:31.812
I've learned that periods of darkness
can overcome us at any time.

06:31.896 --> 06:35.524
But I've also found
that I'm able to endure,

06:36.025 --> 06:38.151
overcome,

06:38.194 --> 06:41.988
and in the process, grown stronger,

06:42.198 --> 06:44.157
smarter,

06:44.242 --> 06:45.492
better.

06:48.871 --> 06:51.832
All is well in my little corner
of the world.

07:27.535 --> 07:30.036
- Dexter!
- Hey, Jamie.

07:30.121 --> 07:31.705
It's not what you're thinking.

07:31.789 --> 07:33.206
Hey, Dex.

07:33.374 --> 07:35.083
It's really not what you're thinking.

07:35.209 --> 07:37.794
Angel kept an eye on Harrison
while I took a really quick swim.

07:38.880 --> 07:39.880
Thank you.

07:41.382 --> 07:42.757
This was a great idea.

07:43.551 --> 07:46.136
Buying the apartment next to yours?

07:46.220 --> 07:48.555
Because now you can slip in and out
of your place, day or night,

07:48.639 --> 07:49.723
without anyone knowing.

07:49.765 --> 07:52.392
I never really thought about that.
We just needed the extra space.

07:53.436 --> 07:54.769
How's my sister working out for you?

07:55.146 --> 07:56.438
Great. Harrison loves her.

07:56.564 --> 07:57.898
And I love him.

07:58.399 --> 08:00.817
- He get to sleep OK?
- Oh, yeah. He's sleeping like,

08:00.902 --> 08:02.611
you know, a baby.

08:02.737 --> 08:03.904
Except he's not a baby any more.

08:03.946 --> 08:06.239
He's got his first preschool
interview in the morning.

08:06.282 --> 08:08.116
They grow up fast.

08:08.409 --> 08:10.160
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Thanks.

08:10.745 --> 08:11.995
- I guess we should be leaving.
- Yeah.

08:12.079 --> 08:13.413
Unless you need me to stay.

08:13.456 --> 08:16.124
I'm gonna be up studying all night,
so I can do that here just as easily.

08:16.250 --> 08:17.751
No, no. You should go, I'm good.

08:18.336 --> 08:20.086
- OK.
- But I will need you

08:20.171 --> 08:21.296
to stay late tomorrow night.

08:22.465 --> 08:24.341
Your high school reunion,
already on my calendar.

08:25.176 --> 08:26.760
- Thanks.
- Bye.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.763
- But leave the shirt on.
- Angel.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.149
Hey, buddy.

08:42.151 --> 08:44.319
Big day for you tomorrow.

08:46.614 --> 08:48.657
We're all moving forward.

08:55.665 --> 08:56.706
At Our Lady of the Gulf,

08:56.791 --> 08:58.625
we like to create enough structure
for our children,

08:58.709 --> 09:02.837
so that they feel safe, and enough
freedom so that they feel challenged.

09:03.798 --> 09:05.966
- OK.
- Attendance in our preschool

09:06.050 --> 09:08.468
guarantees your child admission
to our secondary school,

09:08.553 --> 09:11.846
which, as I'm sure you know,
is a highly esteemed feeder school

09:11.973 --> 09:14.641
to some of the finest Ivy League
universities in the country.

09:14.725 --> 09:16.142
Harvard, here we come.

09:16.185 --> 09:19.896
And, as I'm sure you know, we have
a very rigorous admission process.

09:20.231 --> 09:23.567
Not everyone that applies
to Our Lady of the Gulf gets in.

09:23.734 --> 09:26.069
Mr Morgan,
you were referred to us by...

09:26.153 --> 09:29.072
- Angel Batista.
- Sergeant Batista,

09:29.198 --> 09:30.865
at the police station, where we work.

09:30.992 --> 09:37.205
We being the people that protect you
in case something bad happens.

09:37.915 --> 09:41.084
Sergeant Batista's daughter went here,
and he recommended the school.

09:41.502 --> 09:44.838
I remember Angel.
His daughter did very well here.

09:45.506 --> 09:50.093
So you are Catholic as well,
Mr Morgan?

09:50.219 --> 09:52.262
Actually, I'm not.

09:52.346 --> 09:54.180
And though it does
have a certain appeal,

09:54.265 --> 09:56.725
I'm not sure it's right for everyone.

09:58.769 --> 10:01.104
- So, Protestant?
- No.

10:01.522 --> 10:02.689
- Jewish?
- No.

10:03.858 --> 10:05.692
- Muslim?
- Nope.

10:06.527 --> 10:08.778
Any religious affiliation?

10:09.030 --> 10:10.196
No.

10:11.449 --> 10:12.699
What do you believe in, Mr Morgan?

10:14.619 --> 10:18.747
Nothing. I don't believe in anything.

10:26.213 --> 10:28.882
Harrison really seemed to like it
in there. He didn't wanna leave.

10:29.008 --> 10:30.842
I think he just liked the cookies.

10:31.302 --> 10:32.761
And he already made some friends.

10:37.558 --> 10:39.726
You're not really sold on this place,
are you?

10:40.853 --> 10:41.895
Not completely.

10:41.979 --> 10:43.021
Is it because of the religious thing?

10:43.105 --> 10:44.689
- Partly.
- What you said in there,

10:44.774 --> 10:46.858
do you really believe that?
You really believe in nothing?

10:48.069 --> 10:51.196
Yeah, I suppose I believe
in a certain set of principles.

10:52.031 --> 10:53.073
What kind of principles?

10:53.199 --> 10:56.409
A set of rules on how to
conduct myself in the world,

10:56.494 --> 10:58.912
so that I don't get into trouble.

11:02.375 --> 11:05.418
I'm not the most religious person
in the world, I mean,

11:05.503 --> 11:09.381
Mom practically had to drag me
to church, but seriously?

11:09.507 --> 11:11.174
- What?
- A set of rules to follow,

11:11.258 --> 11:12.967
so you don't get in trouble?

11:13.302 --> 11:14.719
Sounds like something
I might teach a puppy.

11:15.346 --> 11:16.471
Is that so bad?

11:16.555 --> 11:18.765
Just sounds kind of cold and empty.

11:21.936 --> 11:23.228
Does it?

11:23.312 --> 11:24.562
Yeah.

11:25.690 --> 11:27.565
I don't know, you can believe
whatever you wanna believe.

11:27.650 --> 11:29.609
Or not believe
whatever you wanna believe.

11:29.694 --> 11:32.529
But it's not just about you any more.

11:33.864 --> 11:35.490
You're a father. What about Harrison?

11:35.574 --> 11:37.575
You have to think about
what you want him to believe.

11:38.077 --> 11:39.119
Right.

11:53.509 --> 11:54.884
Anyway, I'll see you
back at the station

11:54.969 --> 11:57.011
for LaGuerta's little costume party.

11:57.179 --> 11:58.555
OK.

12:01.016 --> 12:02.642
To be honest,
I've given a lot of thought

12:02.727 --> 12:04.811
to what I don't wanna
pass on to Harrison,

12:04.895 --> 12:06.479
namely my dark passenger,

12:06.564 --> 12:08.898
but very little about
what I do want to pass on.

12:13.028 --> 12:14.571
Good afternoon to my colleagues

12:14.655 --> 12:20.034
at Miami Metro Homicide,
family, friends,

12:20.119 --> 12:21.953
ladies and gentlemen of the press.

12:23.038 --> 12:24.956
Today we join
in witnessing the promotion

12:25.040 --> 12:28.376
of one of Miami Metro's finest,
Maria LaGuerta.

12:29.545 --> 12:31.713
- The fuck have you been?
- I had to run some errands.

12:32.214 --> 12:33.965
- What errands?
- When she joined our ranks,

12:34.300 --> 12:37.343
she was appointed to the department
12 years ago in June.

12:37.470 --> 12:38.928
Why do you smell like old lady?

12:39.722 --> 12:41.723
I was at the mall.
They sprayed me with cologne.

12:41.807 --> 12:43.516
The mall?
The only thing you smell like

12:43.601 --> 12:45.268
when you leave the mall is a corn dog.

12:46.020 --> 12:47.771
It was too early for a corn dog.

12:51.025 --> 12:53.109
Not always an easy task for a uniform.

12:56.030 --> 12:58.281
They're looking
awfully lovey-dovey up there.

12:58.407 --> 13:00.450
- You think the two of them are...
- Gross, no way.

13:00.534 --> 13:02.035
Matthews and LaGuerta hate each other.

13:02.244 --> 13:04.245
Oh, yeah, just like you and Quinn
used to hate each other?

13:04.330 --> 13:05.371
And now you've been
living together for...

13:05.456 --> 13:09.083
...I'm proud to also consider
my amiga cubana.

13:10.419 --> 13:12.378
See what I mean?

13:13.589 --> 13:15.340
They do seem a little too friendly.

13:16.008 --> 13:19.511
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Captain LaGuerta.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.265
One more person moving forward.

13:32.983 --> 13:35.109
Thank you, thank you.

13:50.209 --> 13:52.502
- Captain LaGuerta.
- Deputy Chief.

13:54.713 --> 13:56.965
That was a beautiful speech.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.551
I was touched. It was almost as if...

13:59.718 --> 14:01.469
Almost as if
you'd written it yourself?

14:01.554 --> 14:02.846
Yeah.

14:03.973 --> 14:07.016
Well, I couldn't
leave anything to chance.

14:07.101 --> 14:08.768
But you were very convincing...

14:08.853 --> 14:10.645
OK, cut the crap, Maria.
Give me the book.

14:12.273 --> 14:14.315
You know,
you're lucky I'm the one who found it.

14:14.441 --> 14:17.360
Anybody else would've
thrown you to the wolves.

14:17.862 --> 14:19.571
Can you imagine the headlines?

14:20.281 --> 14:23.324
"Deputy Chief Matthews
featured prominently

14:23.659 --> 14:26.119
"in Miami madam's little black book."

14:26.203 --> 14:28.705
Please, don't talk
about integrity to me.

14:29.540 --> 14:30.957
You divorced that husband of yours

14:31.041 --> 14:32.917
as soon as you realised
he was no career asset.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.502
That is not true.

14:34.587 --> 14:35.879
- And you know that.
- Save it.

14:38.215 --> 14:40.008
I'm not interested.

14:44.972 --> 14:46.431
Watch your step, Maria.

14:47.224 --> 14:48.766
You're playing with the big boys now.

14:56.233 --> 14:58.234
All right, keep it tight, everybody.
Come on, come on, come on.

14:58.319 --> 15:00.236
Stay with me, everyone. Stay with me.

15:00.321 --> 15:01.905
Take a very reverent look around.

15:01.989 --> 15:05.742
This is the home
of Miami Metro Homicide.

15:05.951 --> 15:09.162
And this is the heart of it all,
my lab.

15:10.247 --> 15:11.915
Who are you,
and why are you in my way?

15:11.999 --> 15:15.251
I'm Peter, I'm one of
Professor Masuka's students.

15:15.377 --> 15:17.211
- Professor Masuka?
- I'm teaching

15:17.296 --> 15:18.504
both the extension and online classes

15:18.589 --> 15:20.465
in forensic pathology
at the university.

15:21.300 --> 15:24.761
Class, this is Detective Morgan
and Detective Quinn.

15:25.095 --> 15:27.513
And that is Sergeant Batista.

15:27.598 --> 15:30.892
And this is the future
of forensic science.

15:31.018 --> 15:34.312
Well, the future looks very bright.

15:40.986 --> 15:43.655
All right, let's go, let's go.
Right this way, right this way.

15:43.739 --> 15:45.657
Next stop is my lab,
and then the spatter room,

15:45.741 --> 15:48.785
and then what's always
the last stop, the morgue.

15:52.247 --> 15:54.165
Maybe I should teach a class.

15:54.249 --> 15:56.000
Yeah, on how to rob a cradle.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.460
Hey, I'm twice divorced.
Leave me alone.

15:59.630 --> 16:03.174
- Who are all those people?
- The future of boring.

16:04.677 --> 16:05.885
Nice jacket.

16:06.345 --> 16:08.721
You getting all duded up
for the big high school reunion?

16:08.847 --> 16:11.516
- Twenty years.
- Speaking of schools,

16:11.892 --> 16:13.768
have you heard from
Harrison's preschool yet?

16:13.936 --> 16:15.561
- Not yet.
- Tick-tock, Dex.

16:15.688 --> 16:16.938
OK, OK.

16:17.439 --> 16:19.857
I can't believe
you're going to your reunion.

16:19.942 --> 16:22.235
You're, like, the only person
that hated high school more than me.

16:22.528 --> 16:26.072
It'll be good to catch up
with some of the old friends.

16:28.409 --> 16:29.450
You're hoping to get laid.

16:31.829 --> 16:33.329
You got me.

16:38.585 --> 16:39.877
Janet Walker.

16:40.421 --> 16:42.130
But I knew her as Janet McKellen.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.889
I didn't exactly
have friends in high school,

16:51.974 --> 16:53.808
but she was always nice to me.

16:55.686 --> 16:57.020
She and Joe Walker were voted

16:57.104 --> 16:59.355
"most beautiful couple"
our senior year.

16:59.481 --> 17:02.400
Unlike Janet,
Joe hardly knew I existed.

17:04.403 --> 17:06.195
Joe was captain of the football team.

17:06.321 --> 17:08.072
A real bruiser on the field.

17:08.323 --> 17:10.992
But I remember him
for the bruises he left on Janet.

17:12.202 --> 17:13.995
They got married
straight out of high school

17:14.079 --> 17:15.288
and moved to Virginia.

17:17.332 --> 17:18.499
I'd almost forgotten about her

17:18.584 --> 17:21.377
until I noticed her obituary
in the alumni newsletter.

17:22.046 --> 17:25.256
She was found dead three years ago,
an apparent suicide.

17:25.507 --> 17:27.508
But there was blood
underneath her fingernails.

17:29.344 --> 17:30.762
How could it get there

17:30.888 --> 17:32.638
if her fingers were
wrapped around the grip,

17:32.723 --> 17:34.098
pointing away from her body?

17:34.183 --> 17:35.641
It must belong to someone else.

17:35.726 --> 17:38.352
Perhaps someone she scratched
while putting up a fight.

17:46.361 --> 17:48.780
Perhaps someone who
will be at the reunion tonight.

18:26.151 --> 18:29.445
Take us closer to the edge.
They like shallow water.

18:32.199 --> 18:35.451
You know, Florida water snakes

18:36.787 --> 18:38.121
don't lay eggs.

18:40.666 --> 18:43.209
They give birth to live young.

18:44.086 --> 18:45.920
Around 20 or 30,

18:46.255 --> 18:48.089
sometimes even more.

18:53.345 --> 18:54.554
There.

18:54.847 --> 18:56.639
And she's pregnant.

18:57.683 --> 18:59.892
Makes her fat and slow.

19:11.071 --> 19:12.446
Well done.

19:17.244 --> 19:18.870
There's a lot of them inside.

19:20.205 --> 19:22.331
All you're gonna need is seven.

19:34.553 --> 19:37.180
High school,
a small world unto itself,

19:37.264 --> 19:40.099
combining all the warmest elements
of a federal work camp

19:40.184 --> 19:42.435
with those of
a third-world poultry farm.

19:42.769 --> 19:45.146
It's a miracle I graduated
without killing anyone.

19:57.492 --> 19:59.160
I was invisible in high school.

20:00.037 --> 20:02.455
Just a shadow
passing through the hallway.

20:05.042 --> 20:08.544
- Dexter!
- Alan.

20:08.629 --> 20:11.214
Best biology lab partners ever,
right, dude?

20:11.340 --> 20:13.132
Oh, you bet, dude.

20:13.217 --> 20:16.510
Man, I never saw anyone
dissect a foetal pig as fast as you.

20:16.887 --> 20:19.222
You're, like, the first student
ever to ask for seconds.

20:19.473 --> 20:20.890
That was a great learning experience.

20:20.974 --> 20:22.225
Obviously.

20:22.309 --> 20:26.145
Now you're some
hotshot blood spatter guy.

20:26.313 --> 20:27.813
- It's awesome!
- Thanks.

20:28.565 --> 20:30.566
Hey, we should check out
all these activities

20:30.651 --> 20:33.152
- they've got planned for us.
- Yeah, you go on ahead.

20:36.198 --> 20:38.199
I'm only here for one activity.

20:40.994 --> 20:42.662
Hey, there he is.

20:42.829 --> 20:43.996
And there he is.

20:46.250 --> 20:48.167
Still the centre of attention.

20:49.336 --> 20:51.921
I'm finally gonna get some use
out of my class ring.

20:52.005 --> 20:54.507
I sharpened part of it,
so that I can prick Joe's hand

20:54.591 --> 20:57.093
when we shake
and draw a small drop of blood.

20:59.388 --> 21:02.014
- Dexter!
- Mindy.

21:02.432 --> 21:03.933
Hey, my date to the spring formal.

21:04.017 --> 21:06.352
- Which was held right here.
- What a night that was.

21:06.603 --> 21:09.188
Hey, I'm so sorry
to hear about your wife.

21:09.523 --> 21:11.190
Oh, thanks.

21:11.733 --> 21:15.027
Yeah, that was a horrible thing,
but... You know.

21:15.112 --> 21:16.529
Right, of course.

21:16.613 --> 21:18.406
What about you?
Did you ever get married?

21:18.532 --> 21:21.617
I did. Honey...

21:21.702 --> 21:23.202
This is my wife Heather.

21:25.789 --> 21:27.581
You're the last man that I ever dated.

21:29.293 --> 21:30.960
Well, I'm glad if I was of any help.

21:31.712 --> 21:33.296
Dexter, hey, Mr Blood Spatter guy.

21:33.380 --> 21:35.256
I read about you in the paper.
Lookin' good.

21:35.382 --> 21:36.882
- Thanks.
- Dexter?

21:39.761 --> 21:42.305
- Trisha.
- You look fantastic.

21:42.723 --> 21:44.307
I can't wait to sit down and catch up.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.726
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Right now?

21:46.977 --> 21:49.645
There's some people
I need to say hello to first.

21:51.064 --> 21:53.065
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, good to see you.

21:53.233 --> 21:55.401
Dexter Morgan. Wow!

21:55.444 --> 21:57.278
Looks like someone's been working out.

21:57.404 --> 21:59.113
Yeah, doing my best.

22:03.118 --> 22:05.578
Dexter! So sorry about your wife.

22:05.662 --> 22:07.830
- We read all about it.
- Yeah.

22:07.914 --> 22:09.623
Thank you.

22:14.379 --> 22:16.380
You've had a personal tragedy.

22:16.423 --> 22:19.759
Unlike everyone else, you look better
than you did 20 years ago,

22:19.801 --> 22:20.968
and you've got a cool job.

22:22.804 --> 22:26.057
Put all those things together,
and it makes you...

22:26.266 --> 22:28.768
- Popular.
- How's it feel?

22:31.646 --> 22:34.565
- I hate it.
- Come on, it's great.

22:34.608 --> 22:36.734
Most of the people here
would love to be popular.

22:36.777 --> 22:39.487
Most of the people here don't
have two rolls of duct tape,

22:39.613 --> 22:42.948
80 yards of plastic sheeting,
and a surgical saw in their trunk.

22:43.075 --> 22:45.284
It's not the end of the world, Dex.

22:45.452 --> 22:47.286
No, but it definitely
makes things more difficult.

22:47.412 --> 22:49.288
I'm used to flying under the radar.

22:49.331 --> 22:50.915
So you're flying a little higher.

22:52.250 --> 22:54.085
That's a good thing.

22:54.628 --> 22:56.295
So what am I supposed to do?

22:56.421 --> 22:58.089
Enjoy it, son.

23:11.478 --> 23:14.688
Being a blood spatter analyst really
isn't so much of a job

23:14.815 --> 23:16.023
as it's a calling.

23:16.441 --> 23:19.985
You guys are the modern
American cowboys.

23:20.821 --> 23:21.987
Yes.

23:23.156 --> 23:24.532
Yee-haw!

23:29.371 --> 23:31.205
I'm gonna go grab a refill.

23:31.331 --> 23:32.873
All right.

23:39.881 --> 23:42.007
Joe. Hey.

23:44.052 --> 23:46.303
Dexter. What's going on, man?

23:47.472 --> 23:49.473
Nice, a sample of my own blood.

23:50.809 --> 23:53.853
- You know, life.
- I know, man.

23:55.564 --> 23:56.856
I know.

23:56.982 --> 23:59.400
Looks like you've done pretty well
for yourself over the past 20 years.

24:00.235 --> 24:02.361
I have. I moved to Virginia,

24:02.404 --> 24:05.072
bought a couple sporting goods stores.

24:05.198 --> 24:06.824
It's good business.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.492
How about you?

24:08.535 --> 24:10.744
I work for Miami Metro Homicide.

24:11.329 --> 24:14.039
- You're a cop?
- No, no, I'm a lab geek.

24:14.082 --> 24:16.083
I work in the forensics department.

24:16.209 --> 24:17.668
Lab geek! That's who you are!

24:17.711 --> 24:20.212
Now I remember, the science brainiac.

24:20.338 --> 24:22.423
Yep, that would be me.

24:25.010 --> 24:27.011
Hey, I was sorry to hear about Janet.

24:28.054 --> 24:29.388
Yeah.

24:30.265 --> 24:31.891
That was tough.

24:32.434 --> 24:35.227
But I understand you kind of
went through the same thing?

24:35.353 --> 24:37.521
Yeah. It's true,

24:37.564 --> 24:39.690
we both lost our wives way too early.

24:40.901 --> 24:43.068
Sometimes life sucks.

24:43.195 --> 24:44.361
What do you do?

24:44.404 --> 24:46.030
You know, it's been three years now,

24:46.072 --> 24:49.909
and still sometimes
I get so angry with Janet

24:50.035 --> 24:51.911
doing what she did,
leaving me like that.

24:52.537 --> 24:53.746
Yeah, it must be hard on you.

24:55.081 --> 24:59.001
Yeah.

24:59.669 --> 25:01.003
Wow.

25:03.340 --> 25:07.051
Get a look at that. Trisha Billings.

25:07.093 --> 25:09.595
Right. Right, I spoke to her
a little while ago.

25:09.721 --> 25:13.015
Yes, little Miss Prom Queen
still hot as ever.

25:15.227 --> 25:17.019
You know, my one regret in high school

25:17.103 --> 25:19.271
was that I never tapped
that sweet ass.

25:20.524 --> 25:22.066
Well, you were dating Janet then.

25:23.860 --> 25:25.110
Right.

25:26.112 --> 25:27.446
Of course.

25:28.281 --> 25:29.448
But...

25:30.784 --> 25:32.409
I should at least go say hello.

25:37.624 --> 25:41.085
I need to find another way
to get a drop of Joe's blood.

25:47.634 --> 25:49.385
And I think I just found it.

25:50.136 --> 25:53.639
Come on, Dexter. It's Hammertime.

25:56.643 --> 25:58.477
I have no idea what "Hammertime" is.

26:00.939 --> 26:02.982
Or how it differs from regular time.

26:33.263 --> 26:34.805
Patience.

27:07.505 --> 27:09.923
"In the midst of the street
was the tree of life,

27:10.008 --> 27:12.051
"which bears 12 manner of fruit

27:12.135 --> 27:14.136
"and yielded her fruit every month."

27:14.804 --> 27:16.430
Do you want something?

27:17.682 --> 27:19.308
I'd like some oranges, please.

27:42.332 --> 27:43.832
Seems small without your stuff.

27:44.376 --> 27:45.542
Had to make room for you.

27:45.710 --> 27:47.086
I'm acting LT only.

27:47.170 --> 27:49.338
Not if I recommend you
for the position full-time.

27:49.422 --> 27:50.547
You don't owe me anything.
You know that.

27:51.591 --> 27:53.926
- Yes, I know that.
- I mean, that was the deal.

27:54.010 --> 27:55.969
We divorce, things go back
the way they were

27:56.054 --> 27:58.514
- when we were still friends.
- That's exactly what this is.

27:59.516 --> 28:01.350
I'm choosing you to run Homicide,

28:01.434 --> 28:03.102
because you're the best there is.

28:03.186 --> 28:05.270
- There's no other reason.
- You sure?

28:09.818 --> 28:11.151
Honestly.

28:15.573 --> 28:18.033
OK, my motives are not unselfish.

28:18.243 --> 28:20.661
I need someone in here
who I can trust,

28:20.829 --> 28:23.664
- someone who will have my back.
- I don't know.

28:24.541 --> 28:26.250
I'm someone who needs to
be on the streets.

28:26.376 --> 28:28.961
The street can be exciting,
but it's also hard.

28:29.629 --> 28:31.797
And none of us
are getting any younger.

28:32.799 --> 28:34.425
You need to start
thinking about your future here.

28:35.969 --> 28:39.388
Besides, the prestige
and salary bump can't hurt.

28:39.472 --> 28:42.558
I know what you're saying, but...
How much of a salary bump?

28:42.892 --> 28:43.976
20% the first year.

28:45.478 --> 28:46.979
Think about it.

28:47.147 --> 28:49.064
Fine. But no promises.

28:49.149 --> 28:51.817
OK, Lieutenant Batista.

29:00.493 --> 29:03.579
Wishbone, Hail Mary, buttonhook...

29:03.663 --> 29:05.497
Nothing is what it seems.

29:05.582 --> 29:08.125
If I have any hope of blending in
I need to learn this.

29:08.460 --> 29:10.753
Just enough so that
I can get close to Joe

29:10.837 --> 29:12.838
and draw a bit of blood.

29:14.632 --> 29:17.342
Even the coffin corner
isn't as fun as you'd think.

29:18.470 --> 29:20.471
We've got a situation. Grab your kit.

29:33.026 --> 29:34.818
Pros only.

29:34.986 --> 29:36.695
Everybody stay behind the yellow tape

29:36.780 --> 29:38.363
and watch me work my magic.

29:38.448 --> 29:42.159
Watch well, and one of you will be
lucky enough to become my intern.

29:43.119 --> 29:44.203
A prize opportunity...

29:45.622 --> 29:46.955
that will have to be earned.

29:48.500 --> 29:50.375
Ten bucks the hot chick earns it.

29:50.710 --> 29:52.711
I can't take that bet.
It's too obvious.

29:52.796 --> 29:55.798
- So what have we got?
- About 3 pounds of meat.

29:56.382 --> 29:57.841
- Any body?
- Not yet.

29:57.884 --> 30:00.010
An early morning customer
called it in.

30:05.892 --> 30:07.226
Intestines.

30:07.310 --> 30:09.686
- We've covered that, Sherlock.
- They're human.

30:11.022 --> 30:14.733
These tissue tears indicate they
were removed in a very crude manner.

30:14.901 --> 30:16.068
Yeah, but where's the body?

30:16.986 --> 30:18.737
Where was the vic disembowelled?

30:18.863 --> 30:23.575
This spatter suggests the initial blow
was to the head from behind.

30:23.993 --> 30:26.036
Probably in the process of unloading.

30:26.079 --> 30:28.080
The victim went down

30:28.581 --> 30:30.415
and he was dragged

30:31.709 --> 30:33.210
down to here.

30:35.922 --> 30:37.589
Watch the blood.

30:40.927 --> 30:43.679
This spray comes from a stab wound,

30:43.763 --> 30:44.888
that's likely what killed him.

30:44.931 --> 30:46.765
And this pool of blood in the dirt

30:46.850 --> 30:48.350
suggests he was disembowelled here.

30:48.434 --> 30:49.726
No signs of a struggle,

30:49.894 --> 30:52.020
judging from
the undisturbed blood pool.

30:52.105 --> 30:53.438
Yeah, he was either
dead or unconscious

30:53.523 --> 30:55.274
when his intestines were removed.

30:55.441 --> 30:57.109
No usable footprints
through the blood?

30:57.527 --> 30:58.610
What do you think we're up against?

30:58.695 --> 31:01.572
I mean, leaving the intestines on
the scale wasn't done by accident.

31:01.614 --> 31:03.615
Well, body part removal
could be drug-related.

31:03.741 --> 31:06.368
It could be Santería, voodoo.

31:06.786 --> 31:07.786
Let's hold on a second, folks.

31:07.912 --> 31:10.789
Could you guys set up
a larger perimeter, search the area?

31:10.874 --> 31:12.583
The body might've been dumped nearby.

31:13.376 --> 31:16.587
Hey. Can we talk in private?

31:17.297 --> 31:19.464
- Yeah, go ahead.
- No, I mean, like, later.

31:19.716 --> 31:21.258
- Over dinner.
- Why?

31:23.219 --> 31:24.553
What's the big deal?

31:24.637 --> 31:26.305
That's what I'm asking you.
You're being weird.

31:26.431 --> 31:27.472
You're being weird.

31:27.599 --> 31:29.308
OK, now you're being weird and stupid.

31:31.311 --> 31:33.228
Did you buy another big-screen TV
for the apartment?

31:33.438 --> 31:35.063
If you bought another big-screen
for the apartment

31:35.148 --> 31:36.481
and you're expecting me
to pay for half of it,

31:36.608 --> 31:37.733
- there's no way...
- I didn't buy anything.

31:37.817 --> 31:40.402
- Jesus Christ, leave me alone.
- I'd return it.

31:42.238 --> 31:43.989
I got all I need.

31:44.490 --> 31:45.657
I'm gonna sneak back to my reunion.

31:45.742 --> 31:48.410
I got a big flag football game
to suit up for.

31:51.414 --> 31:53.081
Did I just hear him right?

31:57.420 --> 31:59.504
You run the post corner.
Everyone else know what they're doing?

31:59.631 --> 32:00.964
- Ready!
- Ready.

32:01.799 --> 32:03.759
- Let's go.
- Yep, you got your man, right?

32:04.677 --> 32:07.512
This time, the plan is when Joe is
at the bottom of a pile,

32:07.597 --> 32:09.681
I'll give him a quick jab
and get my sample.

32:10.433 --> 32:12.643
Eighteen! Five!

32:13.019 --> 32:14.811
Red, yellow, hike!

32:20.109 --> 32:22.486
Unfortunately,
Joe never seems to go down.

32:22.820 --> 32:24.529
Block that shit!

32:26.950 --> 32:28.450
Unlike me.

32:30.370 --> 32:33.372
Come on, Dexter! Stay low, block high.

32:33.998 --> 32:35.791
You gotta block that shit, Morgan.

32:39.045 --> 32:40.545
My lancet.

32:40.713 --> 32:42.839
No lancet means no blood sample.

32:42.882 --> 32:44.132
Huddle up, girls.

32:50.723 --> 32:52.349
So I want you
to break outside and go deep.

32:52.684 --> 32:54.601
Dexter, you're an offensive lineman,

32:54.852 --> 32:56.895
and it's your job to
stay close to the quarterback

32:57.021 --> 32:58.397
to protect him from the rushers.

32:58.439 --> 33:00.232
And while you're there,
stick in close,

33:00.400 --> 33:03.276
give the little prick a hard jab
in the nose with your elbow.

33:03.403 --> 33:05.112
Make him bleed, Dexter.

33:12.412 --> 33:14.079
Blue 46, hike!

33:17.375 --> 33:18.709
Shit!

33:18.751 --> 33:20.252
- Sorry, Joe.
- What the fuck was that?

33:20.628 --> 33:21.920
Sorry.

33:22.797 --> 33:24.631
Who taught you how to play football?

33:25.133 --> 33:26.425
My dad.

33:48.781 --> 33:50.449
And we've got a blood match.

33:51.325 --> 33:53.493
Tomorrow night, Joe is all mine.

33:58.332 --> 34:00.417
- Dexter.
- Night, Angel.

34:01.252 --> 34:04.087
Did you take Harrison
for his preschool interview?

34:06.257 --> 34:07.758
Yeah, I did.

34:07.967 --> 34:09.801
Good, cos Auri really liked it there.

34:10.762 --> 34:12.804
She didn't find it scary?

34:13.806 --> 34:15.682
The statues, and the... You know.

34:15.975 --> 34:17.100
The crucifix.

34:17.602 --> 34:20.812
That's a very powerful image of
the sacrifice that was made for us.

34:21.147 --> 34:22.856
All kids have to learn
those kind of things.

34:22.982 --> 34:24.149
Those kinds of things.

34:25.526 --> 34:27.110
Sorry, but why?

34:27.153 --> 34:30.530
I only ask, because I wasn't brought
up with much church experience.

34:30.656 --> 34:32.532
No, that's OK.
These are good questions.

34:36.621 --> 34:37.662
It's the catechism.

34:37.789 --> 34:39.998
And they need to learn that,
because...

34:43.628 --> 34:47.339
God has put a desire
for himself in every person.

34:48.716 --> 34:50.175
Look, I know this is a little basic,

34:50.301 --> 34:51.676
but how do we even know
there is a God?

34:53.513 --> 34:55.555
You know,
just so I can explain it to Harrison.

34:55.890 --> 34:57.390
Oh, well...

34:58.851 --> 35:00.852
Well, there is a God,

35:02.188 --> 35:03.688
because in...

35:06.859 --> 35:08.235
In every one of us,

35:08.820 --> 35:12.697
there is a powerful sense
of moral goodness.

35:13.074 --> 35:14.366
OK.

35:15.034 --> 35:17.410
But honestly,
when you really get down to it,

35:18.371 --> 35:19.704
it's all about faith.

35:21.499 --> 35:25.210
It's something you feel,
not something you can explain.

35:26.879 --> 35:28.713
This is very hard to put into words.

35:29.715 --> 35:31.925
Because it makes no sense.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.719
Thanks, Angel, you've really
made it all much more clear.

35:35.012 --> 35:36.721
Sure. Always happy to help.

35:41.561 --> 35:43.895
This place is kind of fancy, isn't it?

35:44.021 --> 35:45.438
It's OK, I'm buying.

35:45.565 --> 35:47.399
And I'm eating.

35:53.072 --> 35:56.741
That was nice of Dexter
to let you out early tonight.

35:57.076 --> 35:59.286
Yeah, he's such a good boss.

35:59.912 --> 36:03.081
He works around my school schedule,
whatever I need.

36:03.249 --> 36:04.749
He's a good guy.

36:05.084 --> 36:08.420
With all he went through last year,
you know, losing his wife...

36:08.546 --> 36:09.963
I'm glad he's got you helping him out.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.299
Yeah, so sad.

36:12.717 --> 36:14.885
Well, I think he's putting it
all behind him at least.

36:15.928 --> 36:17.971
Well, I don't know. Some nights...

36:18.973 --> 36:20.265
What?

36:20.892 --> 36:24.477
It just seems like some nights,
the pain, the loneliness,

36:24.604 --> 36:26.771
whatever it is he's feeling,
gets to be too much

36:26.814 --> 36:29.232
and he's gotta
just disappear for a while,

36:29.442 --> 36:31.234
go out on his boat.

36:31.611 --> 36:33.445
I think he's trying
to keep it away from Harrison.

36:33.571 --> 36:35.614
Yeah. He really loves his son.

36:36.490 --> 36:37.616
Poor guy needs a hobby or something.

36:38.075 --> 36:39.451
Totally. Thank you.

36:39.619 --> 36:42.996
Thanks. Can I get a nice
bottle of champagne, please?

36:43.164 --> 36:44.456
Thanks.

36:44.916 --> 36:47.959
Champagne? What is up with you?

36:48.336 --> 36:50.170
We're celebrating.

36:50.713 --> 36:52.797
You're looking at
the next lieutenant of Homicide.

36:53.049 --> 36:55.634
You? Angel!

36:55.676 --> 36:57.344
That is so fantastic!

36:57.470 --> 36:59.512
- Wait, when did this happen?
- It's not official yet.

36:59.639 --> 37:01.723
I'm only acting LT, but, you know,

37:01.807 --> 37:03.350
it should come through any day now.

37:03.476 --> 37:04.809
I am so happy for you.

37:04.894 --> 37:06.186
It comes with a nice salary bump.

37:06.312 --> 37:08.647
We can finally get out
of that little apartment

37:08.689 --> 37:11.191
- and into a nice house.
- Wouldn't that be so great?

37:11.400 --> 37:13.652
I could put Auri
back in ballet lessons.

37:13.736 --> 37:15.237
How's she doing?

37:15.404 --> 37:17.405
You know, a teenager.

37:18.407 --> 37:20.659
She doesn't need her daddy any more.

37:21.035 --> 37:22.911
It's a phase, I'm sure.

37:22.995 --> 37:24.412
I'm sure.

37:25.539 --> 37:26.998
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

37:32.046 --> 37:34.256
What?

37:35.049 --> 37:38.885
You're kind of almost
naked on top there.

37:41.055 --> 37:42.681
You sound just like Pop.

37:42.890 --> 37:44.599
Por favor, don't say that.

37:44.684 --> 37:47.060
It's true. He used to follow me
when I walked to school

37:47.186 --> 37:48.561
to make sure
I didn't talk to any boys.

37:48.854 --> 37:51.231
I just don't want people thinking
that you're my girlfriend.

37:51.857 --> 37:53.024
Why would they think that?

37:53.067 --> 37:54.442
Because you just took off your top.

37:54.527 --> 37:56.945
- You're all sexualised.
- Oh, my God!

37:57.405 --> 37:59.030
You're serious!

37:59.365 --> 38:01.032
I know we didn't grow up together,

38:01.075 --> 38:03.868
- but I'm your sister, Angel.
- I know, I know.

38:04.120 --> 38:06.579
She's not my girlfriend.

38:09.542 --> 38:10.875
What?

38:11.627 --> 38:13.545
I just told her
that you're not my girlfriend.

38:14.130 --> 38:15.588
She probably thinks
you're a prostitute.

38:16.549 --> 38:18.967
Oh, my God. I was wrong.

38:19.093 --> 38:21.386
You're not like Pop, you are Pop.

38:22.263 --> 38:24.222
I should beat you for that.

38:24.432 --> 38:26.266
Exactly like Pop.

38:27.643 --> 38:28.768
Man!

38:44.076 --> 38:46.619
- Sister?
- Mr Morgan.

38:46.746 --> 38:48.246
- Good morning.
- Hi.

38:49.081 --> 38:51.333
I just wanted to apologise
for the other day.

38:51.417 --> 38:54.627
I didn't mean to
come across as indifferent.

38:54.795 --> 38:56.463
Of course not.

38:57.298 --> 39:02.344
The fact is, I'm pretty ignorant
in spiritual matters.

39:02.428 --> 39:05.305
I had a rather
unconventional childhood.

39:06.349 --> 39:09.851
My father taught me
what he thought was important.

39:09.935 --> 39:15.148
But I guess we had some concerns
that seemed more pressing

39:15.274 --> 39:18.193
- than learning about God.
- I see.

39:18.611 --> 39:20.779
But I want Harrison
to have a normal childhood,

39:21.113 --> 39:22.822
a good childhood.

39:23.657 --> 39:25.700
I would like for him to go here.

39:26.660 --> 39:29.204
And you came all the way out here
this morning just to tell me this?

39:31.165 --> 39:33.124
It seemed important.

39:37.713 --> 39:39.339
I'll see if we can find
a place for your son.

39:40.466 --> 39:41.883
Thank you.

40:03.906 --> 40:05.156
Hey.

40:05.699 --> 40:08.034
I've got my intern
photographing the scene.

40:09.161 --> 40:11.037
- That's your intern?
- What happened to the little hottie?

40:11.414 --> 40:13.998
What are you suggesting?
That I would pick Ryan as my intern

40:14.041 --> 40:17.377
simply because of her
remarkable breasts and buttocks?

40:17.878 --> 40:19.838
- Yeah.
- I find that incredibly insulting

40:19.880 --> 40:21.423
that you would question my integrity.

40:22.341 --> 40:24.676
I picked the student with
the highest test scores. End of story.

40:24.760 --> 40:27.846
- So what have we got here?
- Floater, washed ashore.

40:27.930 --> 40:29.013
Some lady called it in.

40:35.938 --> 40:37.230
He's dead.

40:37.356 --> 40:38.440
That's your best guy?

40:39.900 --> 40:41.234
Looks like he was killed
by the stab wound.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.777
He wasn't drowned.

40:42.862 --> 40:44.612
His body was put
in the water postmortem.

40:45.114 --> 40:47.073
So he was dumped.
Someone tried to hide the body?

40:48.117 --> 40:49.367
Vince?

40:49.452 --> 40:51.244
He wasn't in the water very long.

40:51.370 --> 40:52.871
Three, four hours, max.

40:52.955 --> 40:54.122
So he was dumped right offshore.

40:54.415 --> 40:56.332
Doesn't look like somebody
was trying to hide him.

40:56.625 --> 40:58.793
No, more like they wanted
the body to be found.

40:58.878 --> 41:01.129
Last thing I need
is a complicated crime scene.

41:02.298 --> 41:03.840
Holy shit.

41:04.175 --> 41:06.301
Someone cut him open,
then sewed him back up.

41:06.677 --> 41:08.136
And it just got complicated.

41:08.554 --> 41:10.305
These incisions were made postmortem.

41:11.056 --> 41:12.849
Our fruit vendor?

41:18.147 --> 41:20.190
- Omar Rivera.
- That's our guy.

41:23.652 --> 41:25.153
These stitchings are really weird.

41:25.279 --> 41:27.655
There's, like, an "A" and
then a horseshoe kind of thing.

41:29.366 --> 41:31.576
It's Greek. Alpha, omega.

41:31.952 --> 41:33.411
How do you know Greek?

41:33.537 --> 41:35.371
I dated some sorority chicks
back in the day.

41:35.915 --> 41:37.081
Of course you did.

41:40.753 --> 41:42.086
Holy shit, it's moving.

41:42.379 --> 41:43.505
There's something inside.

41:53.349 --> 41:55.558
Holy frankenfuck! Snakes!

42:00.648 --> 42:01.773
Bag 'em, bag 'em.

42:19.875 --> 42:20.959
- Got 'em all?
- Yeah.

42:21.043 --> 42:23.086
- How many we got?
- Seven.

42:24.255 --> 42:25.505
Seven snakes.

42:29.009 --> 42:30.301
Your guy just fainted.

42:31.929 --> 42:34.097
That's not a good sign
for a crime scene investigator.

42:34.557 --> 42:36.349
Goodbye, big guy.

42:36.433 --> 42:38.309
Hello, runner-up, little Miss Hottie.

42:38.394 --> 42:39.978
Can we get back to this, please?

42:40.187 --> 42:41.813
Snakes. I mean, what the fuck?

42:42.439 --> 42:45.400
How does that happen? I mean, what?
Did the snakes crawl inside of him?

42:46.110 --> 42:48.027
No, they're freshwater snakes.
Somebody put them there.

42:48.153 --> 42:50.613
Somebody cut him open,
took out his intestines,

42:50.698 --> 42:52.490
and replaced them with snakes.

42:52.700 --> 42:55.159
- Why?
- To send a message, maybe?

42:58.122 --> 42:59.956
Dude, what kind of message
does it send

43:00.040 --> 43:01.666
putting snakes
in a dead guy's stomach?

43:02.167 --> 43:03.835
Some kind of warning, maybe.

43:05.879 --> 43:07.630
Whatever the message, whoever sent it

43:07.715 --> 43:09.424
went to a lot of time and trouble.

43:10.342 --> 43:12.135
This is no amateur.

43:24.523 --> 43:25.773
After Joe's had a couple of drinks,

43:25.899 --> 43:27.900
I'll figure out a way
to get him to step outside,

43:27.985 --> 43:30.153
- where I'll M99 him and...
- Dexter!

43:31.989 --> 43:33.323
Trisha.

43:33.449 --> 43:34.532
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:35.367 --> 43:37.619
I was hoping I'd see you
before the weekend was over.

43:38.203 --> 43:40.121
Oh, well, here I am.

43:42.958 --> 43:44.083
Shall we?

43:45.127 --> 43:48.087
If it wasn't for you, I'd have never
made it through high school.

43:53.385 --> 43:55.219
You saved my life.

43:56.138 --> 43:58.139
I saved your... How?

43:59.350 --> 44:00.892
We had so many classes together,

44:00.976 --> 44:02.685
and I'd always sit right behind you.

44:02.853 --> 44:05.563
Every test we took,
I'd copy all your answers.

44:05.731 --> 44:08.441
- It's how I got through.
- Oh, well, I never noticed.

44:09.276 --> 44:11.736
That's OK. That makes us even.

44:12.738 --> 44:14.447
I never noticed how cute you are.

44:15.074 --> 44:16.699
Until now.

44:19.370 --> 44:22.163
Oh, my God, Mr Smith's class.

44:22.247 --> 44:23.956
This is it.

44:25.417 --> 44:27.210
You helped me a lot in this classroom.

44:36.512 --> 44:38.513
Maybe I should give you
a little something back.

44:41.975 --> 44:43.559
Trisha, I don't have time for this.

44:43.644 --> 44:45.228
Yes, you do.

44:52.736 --> 44:56.155
This is really...

44:57.449 --> 44:59.033
Stop talking, Dexter.

45:19.263 --> 45:22.181
Oh, God, what did I get myself into?

45:22.307 --> 45:24.100
This is never good.

45:25.352 --> 45:27.186
That was so good.

45:27.312 --> 45:28.980
Thanks, sweetie.

45:41.118 --> 45:42.618
Your purse.

45:44.371 --> 45:46.497
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

45:47.166 --> 45:49.083
Whoa, that was easy.

46:07.728 --> 46:10.646
Trisha, you bad girl.

46:38.008 --> 46:39.675
What is this?

46:40.928 --> 46:42.178
Trisha?

46:43.806 --> 46:45.139
You here?

46:45.474 --> 46:47.642
What the fuck?

46:47.768 --> 46:49.977
Fast reflexes. I hate jocks.

46:50.479 --> 46:53.773
- It's you.
- I'm a mighty panther.

46:58.237 --> 47:00.112
I'm the gold and red.

47:00.489 --> 47:02.406
Jesus, you still are some weird loser.

47:02.783 --> 47:03.950
What the fuck's up with you?

47:04.284 --> 47:05.952
Tonight is meant for victory.

47:06.036 --> 47:08.204
It's time to make you dead.

47:10.290 --> 47:11.833
I don't think that last line is right.

47:11.959 --> 47:13.251
I'm pretty sure it is.

47:32.062 --> 47:33.729
Welcome back.

47:34.815 --> 47:36.274
What the hell is going on?

47:36.733 --> 47:38.734
Why'd you do it, Joe?

47:40.612 --> 47:42.488
- Why'd you kill Janet?
- What?

47:42.865 --> 47:45.074
Who said I killed Janet?
I didn't kill Janet. I was...

47:46.910 --> 47:47.952
No more lies.

47:52.416 --> 47:55.626
I'm a blood spatter expert, remember?
I see things others miss.

47:58.463 --> 48:01.048
You shot Janet,
then put the gun in her hand.

48:01.258 --> 48:03.843
No, I came home and I found her...

48:03.927 --> 48:06.679
OK, OK, OK.

48:06.889 --> 48:08.055
But I had to.

48:08.140 --> 48:09.765
Yeah? Why? Why'd you have to?

48:10.517 --> 48:13.978
Because we were having problems,
and the marriage was over.

48:14.062 --> 48:16.731
- And...
- And so you killed her?

48:17.941 --> 48:19.525
Do you know
how expensive a divorce is?

48:19.818 --> 48:21.152
Really?

48:21.403 --> 48:23.195
That's your answer?

48:31.622 --> 48:33.789
What would Jesus have done?

48:35.542 --> 48:37.251
Seriously now.

48:43.884 --> 48:46.385
How do you reconcile your belief
in a higher power, in a god,

48:46.470 --> 48:47.511
with what you've done?

48:48.847 --> 48:50.097
What difference does it make?

48:50.223 --> 48:51.641
I'm just curious.

48:51.850 --> 48:54.560
So what, I'm supposed
to defend my beliefs to you?

48:55.395 --> 48:57.229
If you don't mind.

48:57.648 --> 49:00.942
Look, I mean, everyone makes mistakes.

49:03.153 --> 49:05.196
And they do things
that they shouldn't do.

49:05.280 --> 49:08.783
And they're only human.
But God, see, God forgives us.

49:08.867 --> 49:10.451
Really, it's as simple as that?

49:10.535 --> 49:12.244
You kill someone,
God forgives you for it?

49:12.329 --> 49:13.579
- Yes.
- So I could kill you

49:13.664 --> 49:15.039
- and God would forgive me?
- Well, no.

49:15.123 --> 49:17.249
- You just said he would.
- You have to truly repent.

49:19.670 --> 49:21.754
Do you truly repent for killing Janet?

49:21.838 --> 49:23.714
- Yes, definitely.
- Liar.

49:23.799 --> 49:25.341
No, no, you don't wanna do that!

49:26.259 --> 49:27.802
- Why is that?
- Cos...

49:28.428 --> 49:30.513
If you let me go,
God will give you life everlasting

49:30.597 --> 49:32.848
and whatever you want.

49:32.933 --> 49:34.767
There's really nothing I need.

49:36.687 --> 49:38.771
You know, you don't wanna...

49:38.855 --> 49:40.523
You don't wanna make God mad.

49:41.066 --> 49:42.650
Don't you hear how foolish you sound?

49:42.734 --> 49:44.318
Because he will smite you

49:44.444 --> 49:46.779
with swords and rocks and thunder.

49:46.905 --> 49:50.116
Thunder is just the noise.
It would be lightning.

49:50.200 --> 49:52.576
You cannot kill me,
for God is a mighty fortress.

49:52.661 --> 49:53.703
Joe, please, stop.

49:53.870 --> 49:56.998
And I have been washed with the blood
of the lamb and he will protect me!

50:02.295 --> 50:04.296
Sorry, hammer time.

50:09.469 --> 50:11.178
So I talked to the coast guard today,

50:11.263 --> 50:13.180
and they confirmed
what we'd already figured.

50:13.557 --> 50:15.558
With the tides and all that,
that body was probably

50:15.642 --> 50:18.269
tossed in the water
no more than a 1/4 mile offshore.

50:20.439 --> 50:21.772
Really?

50:21.898 --> 50:23.441
You don't seem very interested.

50:23.525 --> 50:26.569
No, of course I'm interested.
I just...

50:28.155 --> 50:29.488
Don't really wanna talk about work.

50:29.573 --> 50:31.699
What is going on with you?
You're acting so weird lately.

50:31.783 --> 50:33.075
I'm not acting weird, I...

50:33.160 --> 50:34.702
You're about to drink the candle.

50:38.331 --> 50:40.291
I'm just gonna use the restroom.

50:52.137 --> 50:53.429
Debra...

50:54.931 --> 50:56.807
will you marry me?

50:58.351 --> 50:59.810
God, I sound like a fucking idiot.

51:02.981 --> 51:04.482
Thank you.

51:07.277 --> 51:09.070
Get down, get down, get down!

51:18.080 --> 51:19.497
Fuck! He's wearing Kevlar.

51:32.052 --> 51:33.552
Don't fuckin' move!

51:34.554 --> 51:35.679
You all right?

51:35.764 --> 51:37.139
Yeah.

51:42.270 --> 51:43.979
Life is good.

51:45.190 --> 51:46.857
I'm not at all unhappy.

51:46.942 --> 51:50.861
I'm quite content to go about my life
believing in nothing,

51:51.571 --> 51:54.240
with no fear that there might be
something more out there.

51:58.161 --> 52:00.579
"I stood upon the sand of the sea,

52:01.540 --> 52:04.083
"and I saw a serpent
rise up out of the sea,

52:04.459 --> 52:06.293
"having seven heads."

52:06.962 --> 52:09.630
"And upon his heads,
the name of blasphemy."

52:13.385 --> 52:14.802
So it's begun?

52:14.886 --> 52:18.180
Yes. It's begun.

52:24.896 --> 52:26.689
But I also have a son,

52:26.773 --> 52:28.440
and I have to think
about what he wants

52:28.525 --> 52:30.109
and what's best for him,

52:30.193 --> 52:31.944
because who knows?

52:32.112 --> 52:34.655
Maybe he'll grow up to be someone
who wants to think about

52:35.365 --> 52:36.740
those kinds of things.
