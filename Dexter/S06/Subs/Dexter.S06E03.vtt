WEBVTT

00:09.431 --> 00:10.889
Previously on Dexter...

00:10.932 --> 00:13.559
Holy frankenfuck! Snakes!

00:13.601 --> 00:14.935
This is no amateur.

00:15.770 --> 00:17.312
What the fuck?

00:17.605 --> 00:19.481
Debra Morgan, will you...

00:19.607 --> 00:20.899
Are you insane?

00:20.942 --> 00:23.444
What is that holy piece of shit
doing here?

00:24.654 --> 00:28.115
- Brother Sam?
- One big, bad ex-con turned minister.

00:28.241 --> 00:30.451
Runs an auto body shop
using former inmates.

00:30.493 --> 00:32.453
That can't be a man of the cloth.

00:32.954 --> 00:34.246
That's a killer.

00:34.289 --> 00:36.415
It's why I'm making you
Homicide's new lieutenant.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.250
Fuckballs, you're serious.

00:38.793 --> 00:40.002
I couldn't be happier.

00:40.128 --> 00:42.129
It's about time a real cop
had that job.

00:44.090 --> 00:47.301
How come if Matthews hates you,
I'm always the one paying the price?

00:47.927 --> 00:51.013
I can't tell if I'm seeing a man
who's changed for the better

00:51.139 --> 00:52.806
orjust a better cover.

00:53.099 --> 00:55.309
So that darkness inside is gone?

00:55.852 --> 00:58.312
It's still there,
but I'm fighting its ass every day.

00:59.022 --> 01:00.439
Please get off the property.

01:00.482 --> 01:02.649
Not without our boy Nick.

01:02.692 --> 01:04.151
You deaf, pendejo?

01:07.781 --> 01:09.323
I can't marry you.

01:09.365 --> 01:10.449
I'm sorry.

01:10.492 --> 01:11.867
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:11.993 --> 01:14.828
I give you Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

01:19.459 --> 01:21.293
- Hey, you all right?
- No.

01:22.003 --> 01:23.003
Really?

01:23.129 --> 01:25.130
Yeah, I think I heard something snap.

03:22.790 --> 03:25.459
How about we wind up
the Kentucky Derby

03:25.585 --> 03:27.961
and we focus on breakfast?

03:28.087 --> 03:29.963
- Yummy, OK?
- No.

03:30.006 --> 03:31.965
- No, Harrison.
- Mine. Horsey mine.

03:32.091 --> 03:34.426
When you're Harrison's age,
everything's important.

03:34.469 --> 03:37.930
Everything has meaning,
even a piece of moulded plastic.

03:38.973 --> 03:42.517
How about we can play
with the horse afterwards, OK?

03:45.980 --> 03:48.148
It took me 20 minutes
to decide what to wear.

03:49.609 --> 03:51.860
- Really?
- What? Don't I look OK?

03:51.986 --> 03:56.657
Yeah. You put on a jacket
over your regular clothes.

03:56.783 --> 03:59.785
Yeah, well, I don't want to overdo it.
I still want to look like me.

03:59.827 --> 04:01.453
Just Lieutenant-me.

04:01.496 --> 04:02.663
Smart.

04:05.875 --> 04:07.709
It's dispatch.

04:07.835 --> 04:10.170
Probable homicide, 930 Euclid.

04:10.296 --> 04:12.506
It's about 10 minutes away.
I'll meet you there.

04:12.632 --> 04:14.508
You're going to the crime scene?

04:14.634 --> 04:16.301
It's just LaGuerta never went
into the field

04:16.344 --> 04:18.470
unless she knew the case
was gonna be high-profile.

04:18.513 --> 04:20.806
Yeah, well, I'm not LaGuerta, am I?

04:20.848 --> 04:22.891
It's totally your call.

04:24.519 --> 04:27.354
Shit. You're probably right.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.648
It's my first day.
I should probably be at the station

04:29.691 --> 04:32.317
working the snakes killing...

04:32.360 --> 04:33.819
in my fucking office.

04:36.030 --> 04:39.074
OK, buddy. Be good to Jamie today.
And no Fruit Roll-Ups.

04:39.409 --> 04:40.575
They make you fart.

04:40.702 --> 04:41.702
Don't we know.

04:43.037 --> 04:44.746
Good luck today.
You're gonna be great.

04:46.249 --> 04:47.541
Thanks.

05:01.055 --> 05:02.514
Why are you doing this to me?

05:02.557 --> 05:04.891
Please, just let me go.

05:05.351 --> 05:08.520
You're not going anywhere
until you've repented for your sins.

05:09.230 --> 05:12.065
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything.

05:12.108 --> 05:13.191
Not to me.

05:15.403 --> 05:16.528
To God.

05:21.576 --> 05:23.618
Beg forgiveness, Nathan.

05:25.079 --> 05:27.873
If you're sincere,
all of this will end.

05:28.541 --> 05:31.084
If not, it will get much worse.

05:31.127 --> 05:33.920
But I am sincere.
Please don't... Wait.

05:51.439 --> 05:53.607
0 to 60 in 7.2.

05:53.691 --> 05:56.401
A full 800 RPMs over the red line.

05:56.444 --> 05:59.321
In high school, that was my dream car.

06:00.948 --> 06:02.908
Didn't Smokey drive one of those?

06:02.950 --> 06:03.992
Or was it the Bandit?

06:04.118 --> 06:05.118
Burt Reynolds.

06:05.328 --> 06:07.996
Yo, guys! Body's down here.

06:15.129 --> 06:16.963
Any idea who she is?

06:18.466 --> 06:21.134
From her tight mini and
a 24-pack of Trojans in her pocket,

06:21.260 --> 06:22.969
I'd say she's a working girl.

06:23.513 --> 06:24.638
No driver's licence?

06:24.764 --> 06:26.473
Haven't found a purse or an ID.

06:26.974 --> 06:28.517
We need to roll her over.

06:31.104 --> 06:32.145
Easy.

06:32.188 --> 06:34.106
Guess she lost her gym membership.

06:34.982 --> 06:37.484
- Where the hell's Quinn?
- He's on his way.

06:38.986 --> 06:41.446
Multiple blunt force trauma

06:41.489 --> 06:44.157
or manual strangulation.
Take your pick.

06:58.548 --> 06:59.881
Are you crazy?

07:00.007 --> 07:02.134
OK, OK. I'm late. I'm sorry.

07:02.176 --> 07:04.177
Not that. The girl.

07:04.303 --> 07:05.887
What are you doing, man?
What about Deb?

07:06.180 --> 07:07.514
Deb and I broke up.

07:09.350 --> 07:10.517
You broke up?

07:10.560 --> 07:12.227
Yeah, three days ago. We're over.

07:12.353 --> 07:14.688
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.
What happened?

07:14.730 --> 07:16.314
Lieutenant Morgan happened.

07:16.357 --> 07:18.191
She ditched you
because she got promoted?

07:18.234 --> 07:20.735
- That doesn't sound like Deb.
- Yeah?

07:20.862 --> 07:23.196
Cos this is the same Deb
that stole your job.

07:23.239 --> 07:26.241
She didn't steal my job.
It was never mine to start with.

07:26.367 --> 07:28.326
That's always been your problem.
You're too nice.

07:28.369 --> 07:30.162
You let these fucking people
walk all over you.

07:30.204 --> 07:31.872
That's bullshit.

07:32.707 --> 07:35.000
Keep telling yourself that,
Mrs LaGuerta.

07:40.173 --> 07:42.424
You're lucky we got work to do.

07:50.099 --> 07:52.559
- What's so interesting?
- Tooth is chipped.

07:52.685 --> 07:54.561
No surprise there.
She really got worked over.

07:54.687 --> 07:56.062
It's probably from the beating.

07:56.189 --> 07:58.690
Or someone tried to rip it out.

08:07.742 --> 08:09.576
You'll be leading
your first briefing soon,

08:09.619 --> 08:11.286
so make sure you scan
all the field reports.

08:11.412 --> 08:14.372
It's next on my list. I just wanna
finish going through these résumés.

08:14.415 --> 08:15.457
Résumés?

08:15.583 --> 08:17.792
I need to pick a new detective
to take my place.

08:18.419 --> 08:19.961
I can't afford to be
down a man right now.

08:20.087 --> 08:21.254
Well, I can help you with that.

08:21.380 --> 08:23.381
Let's see here...

08:27.553 --> 08:29.471
Sam Harmon from Narcotics.

08:29.597 --> 08:30.805
He's a real up-and-comer,

08:30.932 --> 08:33.600
and the fact that his father's
a district judge could come in handy.

08:34.268 --> 08:35.936
Yeah, I know Sam. He's a solid cop.

08:36.062 --> 08:37.896
Great. Happy to help.

08:38.397 --> 08:40.065
There are a lot of other names
on this list.

08:40.107 --> 08:41.441
You know,
there's this guy from Chicago...

08:41.484 --> 08:43.985
Forget him. With everything
on your plate right now,

08:44.111 --> 08:47.405
the last thing you want to worry about
is a transfer situation, trust me.

08:47.615 --> 08:50.992
Harmon's your guy.
Do you want me to start the paperwork?

08:52.078 --> 08:53.119
No.

08:53.496 --> 08:54.996
I've got it.

08:58.501 --> 08:59.834
Go ahead.

09:00.127 --> 09:01.127
Morgan.

09:01.254 --> 09:03.129
Don't let her shove something
down your throat,

09:03.172 --> 09:05.924
not unless you're ready
for seconds or thirds.

09:06.342 --> 09:09.010
Take it from Mrs LaGuerta.

09:09.136 --> 09:11.137
Got it. Thanks.

09:11.180 --> 09:13.640
Deb, one of the most important
things about this job

09:13.683 --> 09:15.934
is knowing how to
marshal your resources.

09:15.977 --> 09:18.311
Take the help when it's offered.

09:18.646 --> 09:21.147
Remember, we're in this together.

10:10.865 --> 10:12.824
I remember when I found that
under your bed.

10:12.867 --> 10:15.535
I would have rather it had been
a stack of Playboys.

10:17.371 --> 10:19.122
Most kids in the eighth grade
were obsessed

10:19.206 --> 10:20.790
with their favourite baseball players.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.876
You tracked serial killers.

10:23.002 --> 10:24.377
Only certain ones.

10:26.213 --> 10:27.797
The Tooth Fairy was smart...

10:29.467 --> 10:31.509
and arrogant.

10:31.552 --> 10:33.345
They never caught him,
even when he left a body

10:33.387 --> 10:35.513
on a deputy sheriff's lawn.

10:36.390 --> 10:41.311
Fifteen women, prostitutes,
all dumped on the roadside,

10:41.395 --> 10:43.313
all missing their lateral incisors.

10:43.981 --> 10:46.900
You really think there's a connection
to the victim from this morning?

10:47.026 --> 10:48.568
Her lateral incisor was cracked

10:48.653 --> 10:51.154
like someone tried to
rip it out with pliers.

10:51.405 --> 10:54.240
There was damage to her gums.

10:54.325 --> 10:57.994
Probably a result of the beating,
like Masuka said.

10:58.996 --> 11:02.082
Maybe someone was
trying to relive old times?

11:02.541 --> 11:05.418
The Tooth Fairy killings
were in the '80s, Dexter.

11:05.503 --> 11:07.921
He'd be 70 years old at least.

11:08.047 --> 11:10.423
What would he be doing in Miami?

11:11.258 --> 11:14.052
Why do most 70-year-olds
come to Miami?

11:25.564 --> 11:28.358
They say old age
is like a second childhood.

11:29.443 --> 11:31.403
There are primary colours,

11:33.114 --> 11:34.614
tricycles

11:37.576 --> 11:39.285
and ball-chasing.

11:42.081 --> 11:45.083
I barely made it through
my first childhood.

11:47.420 --> 11:49.462
I guess no one makes it
through the second.

11:52.007 --> 11:54.634
This place is one block
from where the victim was found.

11:54.677 --> 11:57.470
A short walk for a retiree
on a mission.

12:02.518 --> 12:04.144
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

12:04.270 --> 12:06.980
I'm thinking about moving
my dad down here.

12:07.106 --> 12:10.316
He's 81, but still sprightly.

12:10.443 --> 12:11.526
Bless his heart.

12:11.944 --> 12:13.611
Coral Island's a great facility.

12:13.654 --> 12:15.488
I'm happy to answer
any questions you have.

12:15.614 --> 12:18.324
Do you have any other residents
here from Oregon?

12:18.451 --> 12:21.369
My dad's kind of shy and
it'd be nice to have people around

12:21.495 --> 12:24.664
with something in common,
besides hearing loss.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.333
Let's see.

12:30.463 --> 12:33.673
We have three residents from Oregon.
Fine people.

12:33.799 --> 12:36.009
I'm sure your dad will
get along with them famously.

12:36.051 --> 12:37.385
That's good to hear.

12:37.511 --> 12:38.803
Here are some brochures

12:38.846 --> 12:41.181
with everything you need to know
about Coral Island.

12:41.307 --> 12:43.141
There's some forms to fill out
in case you're interested

12:43.184 --> 12:44.684
in having your dad join us.

12:45.686 --> 12:46.978
Thanks.

12:48.856 --> 12:51.191
I hate to trouble you,
but that coffee really looks good.

12:51.233 --> 12:54.569
I was gonna get some earlier.
I feel a caffeine headache coming on.

12:54.695 --> 12:57.530
I know what that's like.
I'll fetch you a mug.

12:57.656 --> 13:00.200
- Be right back.
- I appreciate it.

13:10.169 --> 13:11.503
One woman,

13:11.545 --> 13:13.213
another in a wheelchair.

13:13.255 --> 13:14.547
That leaves...

13:16.884 --> 13:19.511
Moved here from Grants Pass, Oregon,
five years ago.

13:20.054 --> 13:23.014
How are you spending
your second childhood?

13:27.728 --> 13:29.187
What's that?

13:29.230 --> 13:30.730
You've been doing such a good job,

13:30.773 --> 13:33.900
I put together a little surprise
for your viewing pleasure.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.068
Is this what I think it is?

13:35.194 --> 13:37.737
Evidence from
the Ice Truck Killer investigation.

13:37.905 --> 13:40.240
You said in class
how you were really into this case.

13:40.366 --> 13:41.783
Are you kidding?

13:41.909 --> 13:46.079
I was obsessed with this case.
I have followed it night and day.

13:46.121 --> 13:47.413
This is really sweet.

13:52.586 --> 13:55.880
This is the Ice Truck Killer's
hospital ID.

14:00.261 --> 14:02.554
And the holy of holies.

14:12.940 --> 14:14.607
You know,

14:14.733 --> 14:16.943
when the details of this case
were made public,

14:17.069 --> 14:19.779
I painted my nails like this
for a whole week.

14:20.573 --> 14:22.115
Is that just wrong?

14:22.241 --> 14:23.783
Is it wrong that it makes me hot?

14:27.580 --> 14:28.955
What do they do with all this stuff?

14:29.081 --> 14:32.333
It just sits here in evidence,
forever.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.460
That's a shame.

14:34.587 --> 14:37.130
I mean, this is a piece of history.

14:39.091 --> 14:40.508
It's time for the briefing.

14:44.805 --> 14:46.347
There you are.

14:47.808 --> 14:49.642
I've sat through God knows
how many briefings.

14:49.685 --> 14:51.102
Why am I so fucking nervous?

14:51.145 --> 14:53.980
Because everyone will be looking
to see if you know what you're doing.

14:54.106 --> 14:55.189
Do me a favour.

14:55.316 --> 14:58.318
When you get back to your desk,
look up the word "rhetorical".

14:58.360 --> 15:00.194
You'll be fine, Deb.

15:00.821 --> 15:02.196
OK, everyone,
we've got a lot to cover,

15:02.323 --> 15:03.990
so let's get started.

15:04.116 --> 15:06.326
First up is the homicide on Euclid.

15:06.368 --> 15:08.161
Where are we
on identifying the victim?

15:08.287 --> 15:11.539
Her fingerprints gave us a name:
Rosalia Davolos.

15:11.832 --> 15:15.710
Several priors for solicitation.
We talked to the local merchants.

15:15.836 --> 15:17.629
Seems that strip was
practically her office.

15:17.671 --> 15:18.880
Did we run her cell phone?

15:19.006 --> 15:21.883
It turned up a long list of numbers,
mostly johns.

15:22.009 --> 15:23.301
We're working through the names now.

15:23.344 --> 15:24.510
What about a tox screen?

15:24.637 --> 15:28.014
Trace amounts of cocaine
in her system and...

15:28.682 --> 15:29.682
doughnuts.

15:30.893 --> 15:33.353
Let's check the area
for known pushers.

15:33.479 --> 15:37.148
Maybe she got caught up in a bad deal
or she got behind on a payment.

15:37.191 --> 15:39.233
I'm hoping five
or six people will volunteer...

15:39.360 --> 15:40.860
They'll never tie this
to a quarter-century-old

15:40.903 --> 15:43.321
serial killer case from Oregon.

15:43.656 --> 15:46.741
Not sure I have either,
but I can dream.

15:46.867 --> 15:48.868
That takes us to the snakes killing.

15:49.370 --> 15:51.871
It's looking like this wasn't
a drug cartel hit after all.

15:51.997 --> 15:53.206
As much as I hate to admit it,

15:53.332 --> 15:55.541
maybe Brother Sam was right
about our victim.

15:55.668 --> 15:57.710
Maybe he'd cleaned up his act.

15:58.045 --> 15:59.212
That doesn't mean
there wasn't someone out there

15:59.338 --> 16:01.047
looking to settle an old score.

16:01.173 --> 16:03.591
What if we made some of
the details of the case public,

16:03.717 --> 16:05.885
like the snakes?
Might scare up a lead.

16:11.016 --> 16:12.350
No.

16:12.393 --> 16:14.769
That may compromise the case
when it goes to court.

16:14.895 --> 16:17.689
If we don't catch anyone,
this will never go to court.

16:18.190 --> 16:21.234
I think Detective Quinn has a point.

16:22.528 --> 16:26.406
We let word out about the snakes,
the press will eat it up. Who knows?

16:26.573 --> 16:28.574
Maybe something will shake loose.

16:30.202 --> 16:32.537
- What about the trial?
- Quinn's right.

16:32.579 --> 16:35.415
There'll never be a trial
unless we get someone into custody.

16:35.457 --> 16:37.250
I think it's worth a try.

16:37.292 --> 16:41.212
Angel, get started on the statement.
Have it on my desk by this afternoon.

16:50.222 --> 16:53.766
I don't think you really believe
what you are saying, Nathan!

16:53.809 --> 16:56.102
You need to believe
what you are saying!

16:56.228 --> 16:58.104
I do. I swear.

16:58.230 --> 17:00.773
I don't know what it is
you want from me.

17:00.816 --> 17:04.569
I want to hear you tell God
that you are sorry.

17:04.611 --> 17:06.070
OK. OK.

17:06.113 --> 17:08.823
Please, please, God...

17:08.949 --> 17:13.119
I'm sorry for everything
I've ever done.

17:13.245 --> 17:15.580
Just forgive me.

17:15.622 --> 17:20.168
Forgive me.

17:29.136 --> 17:30.428
No, no. Wait. Wait.

17:30.471 --> 17:32.138
Where are you going? Let me go!

17:32.264 --> 17:33.681
Let me go!

17:45.152 --> 17:47.862
He's telling you
what you want to hear.

17:49.406 --> 17:51.991
He thinks we're gonna release him.

17:59.333 --> 18:02.502
How much longer do we
have to make him suffer?

18:04.254 --> 18:07.006
You really have a good heart, Travis.

18:08.050 --> 18:09.592
That's why I picked you.

18:12.179 --> 18:15.181
But there's much more at stake here

18:15.265 --> 18:17.350
than one man's suffering.

18:18.769 --> 18:20.937
Don't we have to be strong?

18:23.690 --> 18:26.859
He has to be pure or we can't proceed.

18:28.862 --> 18:30.029
Yes.

18:31.365 --> 18:32.949
He's coming around.

18:33.909 --> 18:35.701
It just takes time.

18:47.881 --> 18:49.048
Good morning, Walter.

18:49.091 --> 18:51.968
Keep saying that
and one day you might be right.

18:52.594 --> 18:55.471
Sam's group is about to tee off.
You can join them.

18:57.558 --> 18:59.058
I'm short a partner.

18:59.560 --> 19:00.560
Dan.

19:01.812 --> 19:03.312
Walter Kenney.

19:04.398 --> 19:06.566
I'm a little rusty,
but I'll try not to slow you down.

19:07.442 --> 19:09.110
Just get a cart, will you?

19:13.907 --> 19:16.242
Worst mistake I ever made
was moving down

19:16.326 --> 19:18.578
to this piss-butt corner
of the country.

19:20.664 --> 19:22.915
How bad can it be?
It's the Sunshine State.

19:22.958 --> 19:27.086
Only sunshine around here
is what they blow up your ass.

19:27.171 --> 19:30.173
The rest is mosquitoes, humidity

19:30.257 --> 19:32.300
and people that don't speak English.

19:34.136 --> 19:38.347
So what's a young guy like you
doing around Coral Island?

19:38.432 --> 19:41.100
Or do you get off
hanging out with corpses?

19:43.812 --> 19:45.938
I'm checking it out for my dad.

19:45.981 --> 19:47.315
You want to help your dad?

19:47.441 --> 19:49.358
Take him to the end of the pier
and push him off.

19:49.443 --> 19:51.360
You'll be doing him a favour.

19:52.279 --> 19:55.448
If I was any more in the rough,
I'd need a fucking machete.

19:55.949 --> 19:58.284
This is like being trapped
in a toxic cloud

19:59.953 --> 20:01.454
that cheats.

20:07.461 --> 20:08.794
Son of a bitch!

20:08.879 --> 20:10.046
You OK?

20:10.130 --> 20:12.715
I always scream in pain
when I take a swing.

20:12.799 --> 20:15.468
Don't just stand there.
I need to sit down.

20:15.510 --> 20:16.886
All right.

20:18.305 --> 20:21.515
I ruptured my back two years ago.
It hasn't been the same since.

20:21.642 --> 20:23.476
OK, just take it easy.

20:23.518 --> 20:24.852
Jesus fucking Christ!

20:25.979 --> 20:29.398
Listen, I'm done here.
Just drop me off at the club bar.

20:29.566 --> 20:31.400
I need something to kill the pain.

20:32.402 --> 20:33.986
You got it.

20:40.535 --> 20:42.662
So what'd you used to do up in Oregon?

20:44.665 --> 20:47.208
I was a pipe fitter for 25 years.

20:47.668 --> 20:50.753
Shit job, but I managed
to work up a pension.

20:51.505 --> 20:53.547
All I want to do now is play golf.

20:55.342 --> 20:57.718
Maybe you should find
something else to pass the time.

20:58.553 --> 21:01.555
I tell you, it's hell not
being able to do what you love.

21:02.182 --> 21:04.016
Is he talking about golf
or his failure

21:04.101 --> 21:06.686
to rip out Rosalia Davolos' tooth?

21:08.563 --> 21:10.773
Walter Kenney may be
the world's oldest asshole,

21:10.857 --> 21:12.775
but that doesn't make him a killer.

21:12.859 --> 21:15.861
On the other hand,
maybe I gave up too soon.

21:19.449 --> 21:22.910
He wears a dental implant
for the lateral incisor.

21:23.036 --> 21:25.746
The same one the Tooth Fairy
pulled from his victims.

21:28.917 --> 21:30.293
Excuse me.

21:31.128 --> 21:32.211
Hello?

21:32.296 --> 21:34.547
This is Sam from Good Shepherd Auto.

21:34.589 --> 21:36.382
I was just calling to
let you know your car's ready.

21:36.466 --> 21:37.883
Great. When can I pick it up?

21:37.926 --> 21:39.552
If you get here before 6:00,

21:39.636 --> 21:42.555
you won't have to
fight the dog off this time.

21:43.557 --> 21:45.099
- I'm on my way.
- OK.

21:56.236 --> 21:59.780
This is on me.
I got to go pick up my car.

21:59.906 --> 22:01.449
You know,
I've got a shitload of errands

22:01.575 --> 22:03.409
to run tomorrow
and with my back the way it is,

22:03.493 --> 22:05.786
I'm gonna have
a real hard time on the bus.

22:05.912 --> 22:07.663
You wouldn't want to
give me a ride, would you?

22:07.748 --> 22:09.123
Perfect, now I won't
have to make an excuse

22:09.249 --> 22:10.416
to run into you again.

22:10.459 --> 22:13.586
I'm in 72. Pick me up at 9:00.

22:13.628 --> 22:15.755
Actually, I'd rather
have my teeth pulled.

22:15.839 --> 22:17.423
Happy to do it.

22:39.279 --> 22:42.948
People don't put no oil in it
and then wonder why they... Hey!

22:43.450 --> 22:46.535
Hey, man, yeah. She's right down here.
I'll be right back, Nick.

22:48.121 --> 22:51.123
God bless him.
Nick has been busting his ass, man.

22:51.208 --> 22:54.460
He's off the drugs.
Cut his ties with the gang, man.

22:54.503 --> 22:57.380
I really think he wants to change.

22:57.464 --> 22:58.714
You must be relieved.

22:58.799 --> 23:01.050
I'm proud of him is what I am, man.

23:01.134 --> 23:03.010
It's not easy turning
your life around, man.

23:03.136 --> 23:04.387
It could go south at any minute,

23:04.471 --> 23:08.140
but I'll take the blessings
as they come.

23:08.308 --> 23:10.976
This looks like the day I bought it.
You do good work.

23:13.146 --> 23:16.774
It's all these repair jobs
that pay for that good work.

23:18.068 --> 23:21.153
Listen. You got any plans this Sunday?

23:21.238 --> 23:22.738
Like service?

23:23.573 --> 23:24.990
What would I be getting serviced?

23:27.411 --> 23:28.619
Like a church service.

23:28.703 --> 23:30.704
No. Not much of a churchgoer.

23:30.789 --> 23:32.081
Yeah, I figured that.

23:32.666 --> 23:35.376
Well, we having something
like a company get-together,

23:35.460 --> 23:36.502
like a beach party.

23:36.586 --> 23:38.337
It'd be great if you could come.

23:38.422 --> 23:41.215
This Sunday's tough.
I don't have a sitter for Harrison.

23:41.299 --> 23:42.425
That's your boy?

23:42.509 --> 23:45.010
Yep. He's two.

23:45.303 --> 23:49.056
Yeah? Bring him along.
It's a kid-friendly environment.

23:49.141 --> 23:50.391
He'll love it.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.853
Play some ball, put the grill on,

23:53.937 --> 23:57.064
have a little beach barbecue baptism.

23:57.399 --> 23:59.483
- Baptism?
- Yeah. Nick.

23:59.734 --> 24:01.861
He's taking the big leap, praise God.

24:02.654 --> 24:04.155
He's taking the Holy Spirit
on right there

24:04.239 --> 24:05.698
in the waters of the Biscayne Bay.

24:05.782 --> 24:07.575
Sounds like you're trying
to get me to go to church.

24:07.659 --> 24:09.076
So what?

24:09.161 --> 24:10.703
What? You afraid
you gonna catch something?

24:12.998 --> 24:14.665
I'm just not sure I fit in.

24:15.584 --> 24:18.043
Sure you do. Listen.

24:18.962 --> 24:21.213
I just think it'd be great for you

24:21.298 --> 24:25.217
to take a stand with someone whose
life that you helped turn around.

24:26.136 --> 24:29.180
And if you do happen to find God,

24:29.264 --> 24:31.098
a lot worse ways
you could spend your day off.

24:44.237 --> 24:46.655
Only one mention of Walter Kenney
in the criminal database,

24:46.740 --> 24:49.200
and he's identified as a victim.

24:49.284 --> 24:50.493
Walter Kenney's mother,

24:50.577 --> 24:53.496
charged with felony child abuse
against her son.

24:56.458 --> 24:58.626
I have to vent,
or my head's gonna explode.

24:58.710 --> 25:00.461
- What's wrong?
- Everything.

25:00.962 --> 25:04.381
I'm my ex-boyfriend's boss.
I don't know how to act.

25:04.466 --> 25:06.800
I don't know what to do.
I don't know who to hire.

25:06.885 --> 25:10.346
I have a stack of paperwork
on my desk that's taller than I am.

25:10.430 --> 25:11.972
Take a breath, sit down.

25:12.057 --> 25:15.351
I think I really fucked up
taking this promotion.

25:15.435 --> 25:17.895
I was a fucking great detective

25:18.271 --> 25:20.064
who loved her fucking job.

25:21.608 --> 25:26.362
I traded it all in for politics and
paperwork and LaGuerta up my ass.

25:26.446 --> 25:28.906
Deb, you're too smart to think
that this was gonna be easy.

25:28.990 --> 25:30.157
Well, I didn't expect this.

25:30.242 --> 25:33.452
I didn't expect people sitting around
waiting for me to fall on my face.

25:33.537 --> 25:35.287
No one wants you to fail.

25:35.372 --> 25:38.249
OK, LaGuerta probably wouldn't lose
any sleep if you stumbled a bit.

25:38.333 --> 25:39.542
She'd pop a bottle of champagne.

25:39.668 --> 25:43.379
But guess what. You're new at the job.
You're gonna stumble.

25:43.463 --> 25:44.630
You think LaGuerta never messed up?

25:44.714 --> 25:46.006
Shit, yeah.

25:46.132 --> 25:47.341
Cut yourself some slack.

25:48.260 --> 25:50.010
You've been Lieutenant one day.

25:50.095 --> 25:51.887
If a couple months go by,
you still hate it,

25:51.972 --> 25:53.222
you can demote yourself,

25:53.306 --> 25:55.266
but until then, just go with your gut.

25:55.642 --> 25:58.102
And when you screw up,
just don't take me down with you.

25:58.186 --> 25:59.478
I need the paycheck.

26:00.605 --> 26:01.772
OK.

26:02.482 --> 26:04.191
My panic needle's
swinging out of the red.

26:04.276 --> 26:05.317
Good.

26:06.611 --> 26:08.237
How are you with the Quinn of it?

26:09.990 --> 26:11.490
I miss being with him.

26:12.450 --> 26:13.993
Really?

26:14.077 --> 26:15.661
Quinn's a good guy.
We had fun together.

26:15.745 --> 26:17.788
It was easy. No expectations.

26:17.872 --> 26:20.291
That's one decision
I know I made right.

26:20.375 --> 26:22.376
Quinn and I were
never meant to get serious.

26:24.379 --> 26:26.964
I have to go. I have to put people
on the snakes killing.

26:27.048 --> 26:29.008
Thank you for talking me
off the ledge.

26:29.092 --> 26:30.259
You're the best.

26:30.343 --> 26:32.344
Is it a good time for me
to ask for a raise?

26:32.429 --> 26:34.221
- Terrible.
- I'm serious.

26:35.599 --> 26:37.224
Fuck off and die.

26:41.271 --> 26:43.314
Maybe she shouldn't have
taken the promotion.

26:44.107 --> 26:45.316
She might not be cut out for it.

26:45.400 --> 26:48.319
I think there's very little
Deb's not cut out for.

26:50.572 --> 26:52.615
Kenney's mother was taken into custody

26:52.699 --> 26:57.328
for repeatedly hitting her son
in the face in public.

26:58.330 --> 26:59.622
I'm not seeing the connection.

26:59.706 --> 27:01.665
Maybe that's how he lost his tooth.

27:01.750 --> 27:05.294
So Walter Kenney has mother issues.
Sounds familiar.

27:05.378 --> 27:07.421
Doesn't mean that
he is the Tooth Fairy.

27:07.505 --> 27:12.384
But it's another reason for me
to spend my day off with Mr Sunshine.

27:33.531 --> 27:35.074
You said 9:00.

27:36.284 --> 27:37.826
I just need a couple of seconds.

27:49.673 --> 27:52.675
TV, Barcalounger
and a view of the parking lot.

27:52.759 --> 27:55.636
This wasn't on
the Coral Island brochure.

28:20.412 --> 28:21.662
My son.

28:25.500 --> 28:29.753
Gave him everything in life,
and now I can't get him on the phone.

28:30.296 --> 28:31.547
You have kids?

28:33.258 --> 28:34.883
You're lucky.

28:34.968 --> 28:37.386
Ungrateful little pricks.

28:37.470 --> 28:40.222
They suck the life out of you,
and then they vanish.

28:40.473 --> 28:42.891
Where are my fucking house keys?

28:44.769 --> 28:47.855
He's completely alone.
Alienated everyone around him.

28:53.403 --> 28:56.822
Here they are.
I'm losing my fucking mind.

29:02.454 --> 29:04.455
Abrams in 23.

29:07.083 --> 29:09.209
Dumb as a bag of dog shit.

29:12.046 --> 29:14.757
Looks like a space
just opened up for your dad.

29:26.603 --> 29:27.811
Shit.

29:30.398 --> 29:33.734
Here's my prescription.
Just pick it up for me, will you?

29:37.030 --> 29:38.197
Sure.

29:41.993 --> 29:43.577
Hey, hey, hey!

29:45.246 --> 29:47.498
And a six-pack of beer
from the liquor store

29:47.582 --> 29:51.126
and the latest Teen Ass,
Nipple Parade and Spanked.

29:52.837 --> 29:54.963
Teen Ass, Nipple Parade and Spanked.

29:55.048 --> 29:59.134
Can this really be the man
who inspired me to keep a scrapbook?

30:07.894 --> 30:09.478
Can I get

30:09.562 --> 30:12.856
Teen Ass, Nipple Parade, and Spanked?

30:20.240 --> 30:22.574
Some needs just don't go away.

30:23.201 --> 30:26.078
Even if the equipment
is on life support.

30:26.704 --> 30:28.580
Does that hold true for killing?

30:34.462 --> 30:37.339
Just one last stop,
and then I'm out of your hair.

30:44.597 --> 30:46.723
I'll take the bus home from here.

30:47.183 --> 30:48.767
What about your back?

30:48.852 --> 30:50.394
Got my remedy.

30:52.939 --> 30:54.189
See you.

31:12.625 --> 31:14.084
What wrong turns do you take

31:14.168 --> 31:16.253
to lead to this at the end
of your life?

31:20.884 --> 31:23.594
An 8 by 12 storage shed,
a six-pack of beer

31:23.678 --> 31:25.804
and a stack of porno mags.

31:31.811 --> 31:34.146
I need those rundowns
on the interviews you did

31:34.230 --> 31:35.522
with the victim's johns.

31:35.607 --> 31:37.608
Yeah, I'm still working on them.

31:37.692 --> 31:38.859
Anything I should know?

31:38.943 --> 31:42.404
They're all sketchy characters,
but their alibis check out.

31:42.488 --> 31:45.032
Final forensics report
on the snakes killing.

31:45.116 --> 31:47.367
Nothing new, but if you notice
the grammar's improved,

31:47.452 --> 31:49.786
it's because Ryan typed it up.

31:50.538 --> 31:53.916
So, Ryan, right?
You've been here a week now.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.584
How you liking it?

31:55.668 --> 31:57.127
- It's heaven.
- Yeah?

31:57.211 --> 31:59.379
- Even with Vince around?
- Good one.

32:00.131 --> 32:01.798
I love homicide.

32:02.216 --> 32:04.343
I've always been fascinated
by people who do bad things.

32:04.427 --> 32:06.303
Maybe that's cos you got
a little bad in you.

32:07.722 --> 32:08.805
You think?

32:08.932 --> 32:11.475
I think you got a lot of bad in you.

32:12.602 --> 32:13.894
You may be right.

32:14.020 --> 32:15.062
Yeah.

32:15.480 --> 32:16.939
But you'll never know.

32:22.570 --> 32:24.655
Can I talk to you for a second?

32:30.161 --> 32:33.121
We're still interviewing
Rosalia's johns.

32:33.206 --> 32:35.165
- So far, nothing.
- Not about the case.

32:36.584 --> 32:39.336
I want to know how you're doing
with the whole situation.

32:40.004 --> 32:42.297
Right. I'm good.

32:42.382 --> 32:45.008
Matter of fact,
I just got done packing up your stuff.

32:45.093 --> 32:46.426
You didn't have to do that.

32:46.511 --> 32:48.845
You know, I figured you're busy
with your new job and all.

32:48.930 --> 32:51.556
You know, might not have time.
Kind of wanted it out of the house.

32:51.641 --> 32:53.642
So if you want to pick it up,

32:53.726 --> 32:57.562
it's in the garage right next
to the big bag of fertiliser.

33:00.149 --> 33:01.900
Quinn, I know you're pissed.

33:01.985 --> 33:05.028
You're doing a great job
of letting me know that.

33:05.113 --> 33:07.114
But this wasn't easy on me either.

33:07.198 --> 33:08.281
I'm sure.

33:08.366 --> 33:10.951
You know, from what I hear, that
promotion just came out of the blue.

33:11.202 --> 33:12.828
You think that my becoming Lieutenant

33:12.912 --> 33:14.788
had anything to do
with what happened between us?

33:14.872 --> 33:18.166
No, I'm sure it was just
a big fucking coincidence.

33:18.251 --> 33:20.168
Quinn, that is so fucking unfair.

33:20.253 --> 33:21.920
There seems to be
a lot of that going around.

33:22.005 --> 33:24.464
I got my share.
Maybe you're getting yours.

34:34.994 --> 34:36.161
Don't hurt me.

34:36.245 --> 34:38.830
You have to make a choice, Nathan.

34:38.915 --> 34:40.207
Are you going to be saved?

34:40.291 --> 34:42.626
- It's up to you.
- Yes, please!

34:43.086 --> 34:44.127
Please.

34:45.505 --> 34:50.050
Dear God, cleanse me of all my sins.

34:50.134 --> 34:52.928
Forgive me for all the evil
that I've done.

34:54.055 --> 34:55.806
Forgive me, please.

34:57.266 --> 35:01.561
Forgive me.

35:03.606 --> 35:06.733
Forgive me. Forgive me.

35:08.861 --> 35:10.278
He's ready.

35:14.909 --> 35:17.244
Two hours in that storage facility.

35:17.328 --> 35:21.164
I'm guessing he wasn't
organising his Penthouse collection.

36:45.458 --> 36:47.459
It's like my box of slides.

36:50.546 --> 36:52.631
Dried blood on the roots.

36:52.965 --> 36:55.508
These are from all of his victims.

36:56.385 --> 36:58.261
He's the Tooth Fairy.

37:05.394 --> 37:08.313
The man who terrorised
the Pacific Northwest for 20 years.

37:08.397 --> 37:10.941
All he has left is a box of teeth.

37:14.028 --> 37:18.198
Is this what happens to serial killers
at the end of their lives?

37:25.957 --> 37:27.082
Everything's ready.

37:27.166 --> 37:29.167
Kenney's apartment will
make the perfect kill room.

37:29.252 --> 37:33.129
No one ever visits him and the maid
won't show up until the morning.

37:33.798 --> 37:37.217
Tonight, Walter Kenney
will have his final tee-off.

37:44.183 --> 37:45.684
- Hello?
- It's Walter.

37:45.768 --> 37:46.893
I'm really fucked!

37:46.978 --> 37:48.019
What is it?

37:48.104 --> 37:51.481
I got off at the wrong stop, and now
I don't know where the hell I am.

37:52.108 --> 37:55.193
I've been riding around for hours.
Fucking hell!

37:55.278 --> 37:58.113
OK, OK. Just calm down.
I'll swing by and pick you up.

37:58.239 --> 38:00.407
What's the street name
and number of the bus stop?

38:02.618 --> 38:06.246
321 Alatka.

38:06.330 --> 38:09.791
Got it. Just stay where you are.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

38:09.875 --> 38:11.459
He made it easy for me to vet him.

38:11.544 --> 38:14.004
Now he's making it easy
for me to kill him.

38:14.088 --> 38:16.631
Kenney's a monster,
but at least he's considerate.

38:31.314 --> 38:33.606
I don't know
what the fuck's wrong with me.

38:33.691 --> 38:35.400
Sometimes I get so confused.

38:35.484 --> 38:36.568
Yeah, don't worry about it.

38:36.652 --> 38:38.403
I'm just glad
I was in the neighbourhood.

38:39.572 --> 38:43.408
I don't know what I would have done
if you hadn't answered.

38:44.118 --> 38:45.910
You're a good kid.

38:45.995 --> 38:47.954
As if I wasn't starting
to feel enough pity for him,

38:48.039 --> 38:49.914
now he's throwing gratitude at me?

38:49.999 --> 38:54.669
Keep your eye on the road
or I'll blow your head out the window.

38:55.963 --> 38:57.922
Drive until I tell you to turn.

38:58.466 --> 38:59.799
How did you get on to me?

38:59.884 --> 39:01.092
I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:01.177 --> 39:03.720
You're Miami Metro, Dexter.

39:04.472 --> 39:08.266
I checked your car registration
when you were filling my prescription,

39:08.351 --> 39:12.896
and then I "goggled" your name.
Yeah, that's right, dickwad.

39:12.980 --> 39:15.482
Maybe I haven't taken
a decent shit in 10 years,

39:15.566 --> 39:17.233
but I'm not fucking stupid.

39:20.488 --> 39:22.322
Turn right at the next light.

39:28.788 --> 39:30.288
Where are we going?

39:30.373 --> 39:32.123
To settle our business.

39:32.208 --> 39:35.835
You're gonna tell me
how you figured out who I am.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.212
And then you're gonna kill me?

39:37.296 --> 39:39.214
You haven't left me much choice,
have you?

39:40.591 --> 39:43.134
Left into the next parking lot.

39:43.219 --> 39:44.427
OK.

39:46.806 --> 39:48.264
And just for kicks,

39:48.349 --> 39:51.684
I might rip out all your teeth
before I shoot you.

39:52.895 --> 39:54.979
What the fuck are you...

40:05.699 --> 40:08.118
Those are ready for cataloguing.

40:08.619 --> 40:11.079
Hey, after work tonight,
you want to grab some pho?

40:12.540 --> 40:13.623
Grab some what?

40:13.707 --> 40:14.833
It's Vietnamese food.

40:14.917 --> 40:17.210
It's basically a large bowl
of noodles.

40:17.837 --> 40:19.003
And broth.

40:19.672 --> 40:22.298
So you're asking me out? As in a date?

40:22.383 --> 40:24.467
You don't have to call it that
if you don't want to.

40:24.552 --> 40:25.927
I want to.

40:27.263 --> 40:28.430
So that's a yes?

40:28.764 --> 40:29.931
Yeah.

40:31.725 --> 40:32.767
Wow.

40:33.936 --> 40:35.019
What?

40:35.104 --> 40:37.772
It's just that I ran the conversation
through my mind a bunch of times.

40:37.857 --> 40:40.733
It always ended in rejection
and bodily harm.

40:41.527 --> 40:43.653
You should be more confident.

40:43.737 --> 40:46.072
You know, in the right light,
you're actually kind of cute.

40:49.034 --> 40:51.870
I'm about to interview my top pick
for the detective slot.

40:51.954 --> 40:53.204
I thought you might want to sit in.

40:53.289 --> 40:55.665
No point.
Sam Harmon and I go way back.

40:55.791 --> 40:58.042
- Harmon's not my top choice.
- He's not?

40:58.127 --> 41:01.379
It's Mike Anderson,
the transfer from Chicago.

41:01.464 --> 41:04.507
He's got 10 years on homicide,
a ridiculous solve rate,

41:04.592 --> 41:06.926
recommendations coming out of his ass.

41:07.011 --> 41:08.136
We'd be lucky to have him.

41:08.220 --> 41:09.804
I really put a lot
of thought into this.

41:09.889 --> 41:13.016
If that's true, then I'm seriously
worried about your judgement,

41:13.100 --> 41:14.976
because this is a huge mistake.

41:15.060 --> 41:16.895
I don't think it is.

41:17.104 --> 41:18.646
Look, I know I'm new at this job.

41:18.814 --> 41:20.857
And it's not that
I don't value your advice,

41:20.941 --> 41:23.568
but sometimes I have to trust my gut,

41:23.652 --> 41:25.862
and right now my gut is
telling me Mike Anderson.

41:27.323 --> 41:29.282
It's your decision, Lieutenant.

41:29.366 --> 41:31.409
You can do whatever the hell you want.

41:31.494 --> 41:33.495
But understand this:
You're on your own.

41:33.579 --> 41:35.663
If this doesn't work out,

41:36.248 --> 41:38.208
don't look to me to have your back.

41:53.140 --> 41:55.016
Mike Anderson.
I'm here to see the lieutenant.

41:55.100 --> 41:57.894
That's me. It's great to meet you.
Debra Morgan.

42:00.564 --> 42:03.066
- What's funny?
- You, the lieutenant.

42:03.150 --> 42:04.359
- That a problem?
- Listen.

42:04.443 --> 42:06.945
I just got off a three-hour flight
and I'm really tired,

42:07.029 --> 42:10.323
which means I'm not in the mood
for any cute department razzing.

42:10.407 --> 42:12.700
So will you take me
to your boss, please?

42:12.785 --> 42:15.328
Maybe score me some coffee
on the way, no cream.

42:18.624 --> 42:20.083
You listen.

42:20.167 --> 42:22.418
Right now, you're my top choice
for this job,

42:22.503 --> 42:24.629
but that can change real fucking fast.

42:25.256 --> 42:27.840
I put my ass on the line
even considering you,

42:28.509 --> 42:30.176
so stow the attitude

42:30.261 --> 42:31.844
or the only job you're gonna
find in this city

42:31.929 --> 42:34.681
is guarding a landfill
as a rent-a-cop.

42:34.848 --> 42:37.725
Look, I apologise.
I didn't mean any disrespect.

42:38.394 --> 42:41.229
It's just the other lieutenants
I've served under had...

42:41.313 --> 42:42.564
Dicks?

42:42.773 --> 42:44.649
Been around the block.

42:44.733 --> 42:47.527
Trust me. This is just as weird for me
as it is for you.

42:49.113 --> 42:50.613
Moving on.

42:51.031 --> 42:52.448
Let's talk.

42:58.831 --> 43:01.207
You know,
I just got my car out of the shop.

43:01.292 --> 43:03.167
What the hell is this?

43:03.252 --> 43:05.295
This is the end, Walter.

43:06.589 --> 43:08.798
You pulled your last tooth.

43:09.133 --> 43:10.967
How did I get here?

43:11.051 --> 43:12.218
Service entrance.

43:12.720 --> 43:14.929
I think I tweaked my back.

43:15.681 --> 43:17.056
Fuck me.

43:17.141 --> 43:19.350
You could have spent
your final days relaxing,

43:19.435 --> 43:24.355
enjoying life,
but then there was Rosalia Davolos.

43:24.565 --> 43:29.277
She's the first one in 10 years.
Wasn't she? Why now?

43:29.528 --> 43:31.654
I got tired of staring
at a box of teeth.

43:32.990 --> 43:34.991
Took me 10 minutes to kill the whore.

43:35.200 --> 43:39.203
Lost another 20 trying
to pull the goddamn tooth.

43:43.959 --> 43:45.877
You know, when I was in high school,

43:45.961 --> 43:48.921
it seemed you were all
the country was talking about.

43:49.006 --> 43:50.256
The Tooth Fairy.

43:50.341 --> 43:53.259
Too clever for the police.
They couldn't catch you.

43:53.469 --> 43:56.137
Like Burt Reynolds with his Trans Am.

43:56.930 --> 43:59.557
I still can't believe
you are the same man

43:59.642 --> 44:02.226
that dumped a body
at a deputy sheriff's house.

44:03.646 --> 44:05.647
Total fucking accident.

44:06.273 --> 44:08.066
I downed a few too many

44:08.150 --> 44:10.610
and didn't feel like driving out
to the highway

44:10.736 --> 44:12.403
to get rid of the bitch.

44:12.488 --> 44:14.072
That's disappointing.

44:14.114 --> 44:17.283
Well, I'm very fucking sorry
to let you down.

44:17.409 --> 44:19.494
Does that mean
you don't want my autograph?

44:19.953 --> 44:21.245
No.

44:21.747 --> 44:24.749
Just this.

44:25.417 --> 44:26.918
I took teeth.

44:27.461 --> 44:28.586
You take blood.

44:28.671 --> 44:31.255
You're the same kind of sick fuck,
aren't you?

44:31.340 --> 44:33.132
At least I'm never gonna
end up like you.

44:33.258 --> 44:36.594
Yeah? When you can't do this any more,
what do you have then?

44:38.597 --> 44:39.639
More.

44:39.765 --> 44:41.766
You're kidding yourself, asshole.

44:41.809 --> 44:44.102
All I ever cared about was killing,

44:44.186 --> 44:46.479
and I can't even do that
right any more.

44:46.605 --> 44:48.481
That's what you've got
to look forward to.

44:48.607 --> 44:53.027
This is your future,
and it includes adult fucking diapers!

44:53.112 --> 44:54.654
You are not my future.

44:54.780 --> 44:57.365
I will not spend
my final days getting drunk

44:57.449 --> 44:59.367
and staring at a box of trophies.

44:59.451 --> 45:01.953
Keep telling yourself that.

45:03.497 --> 45:05.456
Make sure they know who I am.

45:05.541 --> 45:09.001
I wish I could see the look
on my son's face when he finds out.

45:09.128 --> 45:11.504
He won't be able to ignore that!

45:15.134 --> 45:18.136
I'd never want my son to know
who I was.

45:18.220 --> 45:20.638
You said you didn't have a kid.

45:20.973 --> 45:23.224
I also said my name was Dan.

45:27.563 --> 45:28.730
What are you doing?

45:28.814 --> 45:30.481
You're not gonna die
as the Tooth Fairy.

45:30.566 --> 45:34.026
You're gonna die as a sad old man
of a heart attack.

45:34.153 --> 45:35.319
No!

45:36.822 --> 45:42.076
The latest resident to check out of
the Coral Island Retirement Village.

45:59.011 --> 46:02.930
Walter Kenney's son will never
know his father was a monster.

46:03.348 --> 46:05.433
Or at least not a killer.

46:22.868 --> 46:25.953
We all want life to have
some kind of meaning.

46:35.380 --> 46:39.133
Seems like the older we get,
the harder we look for it...

46:53.482 --> 46:55.775
...and the harder it is to find.

47:07.412 --> 47:10.414
And some of us just look
in the wrong place.

47:21.260 --> 47:23.970
But if our lives don't have meaning...

47:25.597 --> 47:27.431
Horsey, Daddy.

47:30.936 --> 47:34.230
...what can we leave behind
for those we care about?

47:34.565 --> 47:35.982
There you go, buddy.

47:51.623 --> 47:54.125
Walter Kenney wanted
to pass on the ugliness

47:54.251 --> 47:56.294
that his life had become.

48:12.311 --> 48:14.145
What will I pass on?

48:42.007 --> 48:45.176
I don't know which slide goes where,
who's who.

48:46.637 --> 48:48.679
There's no order any more.
