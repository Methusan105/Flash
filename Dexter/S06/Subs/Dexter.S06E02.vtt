00:09.931 --> 00:11.682
Previously on Dexter...

00:11.766 --> 00:12.850
What do you think we're up against?

00:12.934 --> 00:15.185
I mean, leaving the intestines on
the scale wasn't done by accident.

00:15.437 --> 00:17.438
The body part removal
could be drug-related.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.356
It could be SanterÃ­a, voodoo.

00:19.941 --> 00:21.275
Attendance in our preschool

00:21.359 --> 00:24.028
guarantees your child admission
to our secondary school.

00:24.195 --> 00:25.654
So you are Catholic?

00:26.114 --> 00:27.156
Actually, I'm not.

00:27.490 --> 00:28.949
What do you believe in, Mr Morgan?

00:29.034 --> 00:31.618
Nothing. I don't believe in anything.

00:32.037 --> 00:33.495
You can believe
whatever you want to believe,

00:33.621 --> 00:35.456
but it's not just about you any more.

00:36.291 --> 00:39.001
What kind of father keeps
blood slides in his apartment?

00:40.045 --> 00:43.464
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Captain LaGuerta.

00:46.468 --> 00:48.385
Seems small without your stuff.

00:48.470 --> 00:50.971
- Had to make room for you.
- I'm acting LT only.

00:51.306 --> 00:53.390
Not if I recommend you
for the position full-time.

00:53.975 --> 00:56.226
What is going on with you?
You're acting so weird lately.

00:56.686 --> 00:59.021
Debra, will you marry me?

00:59.481 --> 01:01.190
God, I sound like a fucking idiot.

01:02.484 --> 01:04.318
Get down, get down! Everybody down!

01:12.077 --> 01:14.536
- What have we got here?
- Floater, washed ashore.

01:14.662 --> 01:15.662
Some lady called it in.

01:15.830 --> 01:17.664
Doesn't look like somebody
was trying to hide him.

01:17.749 --> 01:19.666
More like they wanted
the body to be found.

01:20.001 --> 01:21.251
There's something inside.

01:22.170 --> 01:24.254
Holy frankenfuck! Snakes!

01:24.714 --> 01:26.006
This is no amateur.

01:27.050 --> 01:28.092
So it's begun?

01:29.719 --> 01:32.679
Yes. It's begun.

03:31.341 --> 03:32.382
Until a few days ago,

03:32.467 --> 03:35.135
I was convinced
there was nothing I believed in.

03:36.054 --> 03:39.139
But I was wrong.
There is something I truly believe.

03:41.684 --> 03:43.977
Everything's better
after a bubble bath.

03:46.356 --> 03:47.981
Rituals are important.

03:54.197 --> 03:58.158
Not just for a serial killer,
but also for a two-year-old,

03:58.201 --> 04:00.077
if you want him to go to bed on time.

04:04.415 --> 04:05.499
Put him back.

04:05.541 --> 04:09.002
Not that I mind,
this ritual has become my favourite.

04:09.087 --> 04:13.215
Bedtime. Alone with my son.
Being myself.

04:13.675 --> 04:17.177
- Monster story, Daddy.
- Again?

04:17.220 --> 04:19.680
OK, I may have told him
this one before.

04:22.934 --> 04:28.063
Once upon a time
there was a little chino,

04:28.189 --> 04:30.899
scaring everyone who lived
in the hood.

04:31.025 --> 04:34.278
Nobody knew what to do. But Daddy did.

04:36.406 --> 04:39.866
He would slay that icky monster,

04:39.909 --> 04:43.036
hiding what was left of him
in a special place

04:43.121 --> 04:45.080
that no one would ever find.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.416
Daddy's box.

04:51.462 --> 04:53.422
You know about Daddy's box?

04:55.633 --> 04:57.384
I always knew this day would come.

04:59.095 --> 05:00.554
Just not so soon.

05:03.308 --> 05:05.726
I'm not sure
how this next chapter goes.

05:13.067 --> 05:16.111
- Is that the last of them?
- Just one more to go.

05:17.905 --> 05:19.239
We'll be ready soon.

05:21.326 --> 05:22.909
I may be a little late tomorrow.

05:25.913 --> 05:27.247
And you tell me that now?

05:30.418 --> 05:33.670
Can't help it. It shouldn't take long.
Nothing's changed.

05:34.339 --> 05:38.592
- Travis, we have to find another.
- Don't you think I already know that?

05:46.934 --> 05:48.602
Now look what you've done.

05:48.644 --> 05:51.772
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
- No, it's OK. It's OK.

05:53.107 --> 05:54.608
These things happen.

05:56.027 --> 05:59.613
I just want to make sure
that I can rely on you.

06:01.449 --> 06:03.533
- Of course.
- Good boy.

06:22.470 --> 06:23.553
Hello.

06:31.479 --> 06:32.479
Wow.

06:33.147 --> 06:34.689
Full-on breakfast.

06:34.857 --> 06:37.317
Yeah, juice is in the fridge.
Freshly squeezed.

06:37.485 --> 06:40.028
Fresh-squeezed.
Well, aren't we the fucking Kennedys.

06:40.154 --> 06:42.155
A good breakfast is a good way
to start the day.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.990
Yeah, another day
of sitting on our asses,

06:44.075 --> 06:47.411
waiting for OIS to clear us
on the restaurant shooting.

06:47.495 --> 06:49.037
Pancakes?

06:49.163 --> 06:52.666
You do realise the bar is set
very high with me and pancakes.

06:52.708 --> 06:54.084
My dad's were the best.

06:56.504 --> 06:57.712
What the fuck?

07:00.758 --> 07:02.008
What are you doing?

07:02.552 --> 07:04.428
I wanted to do this the other night,

07:04.512 --> 07:06.763
but the shooting sort of
messed everything up.

07:09.183 --> 07:11.101
Debra Morgan, will you...

07:11.185 --> 07:13.186
- Are you insane?
- Come on, Deb.

07:13.229 --> 07:14.521
I'm trying to
be fucking romantic here.

07:14.897 --> 07:17.357
Romantic isn't springing
something like this on me.

07:17.442 --> 07:20.235
When have we ever
talked about marriage?

07:22.780 --> 07:24.030
Will you get up?

07:24.740 --> 07:26.867
Come on, Deb,
we've been at this for a year.

07:26.951 --> 07:28.869
You make me happy, I make you happy.

07:28.953 --> 07:30.579
- So?
- So...

07:31.581 --> 07:33.874
- I love you.
- But...

07:35.751 --> 07:37.335
This is huge!

07:38.463 --> 07:40.255
You don't like the ring?
Is it the ring?

07:41.215 --> 07:42.632
No, it's...

07:43.968 --> 07:45.719
It's beautiful. It's just...

07:50.558 --> 07:53.268
I just need time to think about this.

07:53.936 --> 07:55.729
Take all the time you need.

07:59.108 --> 08:02.152
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Pancakes are burning.

08:08.075 --> 08:11.870
Quinn just fucking proposed to me
over fucking pancakes.

08:11.954 --> 08:14.039
What the fuck is wrong with him?

08:14.123 --> 08:15.207
He's Quinn?

08:15.291 --> 08:18.627
I never said I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with him.

08:20.463 --> 08:22.464
So I take it this means it's a "no"?

08:22.548 --> 08:23.632
I can only hope.

08:23.716 --> 08:25.634
Quinn as Deb's boyfriend is one thing.

08:25.718 --> 08:28.678
Uncle to my son, over his dead body.

08:28.763 --> 08:29.804
Maybe.

08:30.765 --> 08:34.100
I don't know.
I mean, I guess Quinn makes me happy.

08:34.268 --> 08:36.228
Really?
Cos there's a vein in your forehead.

08:37.688 --> 08:42.484
Quinn and I, we get along great,
and there's no drama.

08:42.735 --> 08:46.947
And after the last couple years,
that's kind of nice.

08:48.366 --> 08:49.407
But?

08:49.492 --> 08:52.911
But I'm not sure I want anything more
than no drama right now.

08:53.037 --> 08:54.454
Sounds like you have your answer.

08:54.539 --> 08:56.831
But if I tell him "no,"
then it's over, right?

08:56.916 --> 08:58.917
And I'm not sure I want that, either.

08:59.001 --> 09:01.461
God, why can't things
just stay the same?

09:03.047 --> 09:04.339
Tell me about it.

09:04.423 --> 09:07.008
Come on, we're gonna be late
for the briefing.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.888
Watch this. She totally decks him.

09:12.014 --> 09:13.932
- She flattened that guy.
- Where was Quinn?

09:14.016 --> 09:16.977
- She's already got 500,000 hits.
- Hey, hey, she's coming.

09:19.063 --> 09:20.522
Nice.

09:20.606 --> 09:22.816
Yeah, yeah, I'm a hero.
Fuck you very much.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.569
You've totally gone viral, Morgan.
You're an Internet sensation.

09:26.028 --> 09:27.153
Give it a rest, man.

09:27.238 --> 09:28.905
What? Dude, she's a superstar.

09:28.990 --> 09:30.073
I mean, have you guys
read the comments...

09:30.157 --> 09:31.241
She has,

09:31.492 --> 09:33.577
and if you're the one
that wrote the poem about my ass...

09:33.661 --> 09:36.454
I know not of what you speak.
And it was a limerick, thank you.

09:36.539 --> 09:37.664
Can we get started, please?

09:37.748 --> 09:39.249
All right, everyone, settle down.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.668
Where are we with ballistics
from the restaurant shooting?

09:41.919 --> 09:44.087
All casings and bullets
are accounted for.

09:44.380 --> 09:46.506
All the victims were shot
by the shooter's gun

09:46.591 --> 09:48.800
and no stray bullets
from Morgan or Quinn.

09:48.884 --> 09:49.926
The shooter talking?

09:50.011 --> 09:51.928
He was pissed off
the restaurant fired him.

09:52.013 --> 09:53.388
The manager was the first to go down.

09:53.472 --> 09:56.891
Two dead, all because this asshole
wanted his job back waiting tables.

09:56.976 --> 09:58.268
All right,
with the shooting behind us,

09:58.352 --> 10:02.022
we put everything into finding out
who did this to Omar Rivera.

10:02.607 --> 10:04.733
Dex, the ME report come back
on the fruit vendor?

10:04.859 --> 10:05.900
Nothing we didn't already know.

10:06.027 --> 10:08.028
The stitches and the snakes
are definitely post-mortem.

10:08.404 --> 10:10.280
I and my lovely new intern Ryan

10:10.364 --> 10:11.698
are still waiting
for the medical examiner

10:11.782 --> 10:13.116
to return our snakes.

10:13.367 --> 10:16.077
Keep me updated.
Yale is looking into our vic.

10:16.537 --> 10:18.913
Rivera had ties with the Salas Cartel.

10:19.290 --> 10:20.874
You still thinking
this is drug-related?

10:20.958 --> 10:24.919
Well, to a cartel,
a snake is a snitch.

10:25.046 --> 10:27.380
If this wasn't a warning to others
to keep their mouths shut,

10:27.465 --> 10:28.923
I'm not sure what the message is.

10:29.967 --> 10:33.219
Maybe because the message
is in a language only I understand.

10:34.889 --> 10:37.265
What is that holy piece of shit
doing here?

10:39.560 --> 10:42.479
I know that piece of shit.
Or at least I did.

10:43.230 --> 10:46.483
Rivera worked at Brother Sam's garage
after he got out ofjail.

10:46.776 --> 10:49.235
Hey, I don't like it
any more than any of you.

10:50.154 --> 10:52.155
Maybe the padre points us
in the right direction.

10:52.782 --> 10:54.991
Guys like that
and his ex-con fucking friends

10:55.076 --> 10:56.785
can go to hell for all I care.

10:59.330 --> 11:03.416
- Brother Sam?
- One big, bad ex-con turned minister.

11:03.459 --> 11:05.752
Runs an auto body shop
using former inmates.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.462
And, as you can see,
some of our brothers in blue

11:07.588 --> 11:08.797
think it's a sham.

11:09.757 --> 11:12.759
They may be right.
That can't be a man of the cloth.

11:13.678 --> 11:14.928
That's a killer.

11:26.982 --> 11:28.775
Settled in next door.

11:28.943 --> 11:31.277
Well, that would explain
the smell of perfume.

11:33.948 --> 11:38.493
I was wondering,
have you gotten around to finalising

11:38.619 --> 11:41.287
- Sergeant Batista's paperwork?
- I'm on top of that.

11:41.372 --> 11:44.624
Because I haven't seen anything
come across my desk.

11:44.709 --> 11:46.000
I think the sooner

11:46.127 --> 11:47.961
the department has
a full-time lieutenant, the better.

11:48.045 --> 11:49.504
I could not agree more.

11:53.718 --> 11:55.009
Is that all, Captain?

11:58.556 --> 11:59.806
That's all.

12:12.486 --> 12:14.654
When's the last time you saw Rivera?

12:16.198 --> 12:18.825
A few months ago.

12:18.909 --> 12:22.036
He came in.
He needed some brakes for his pickup.

12:24.206 --> 12:26.332
He brought

12:26.417 --> 12:28.668
everybody grapefruits and oranges.

12:30.713 --> 12:31.921
It was a good day.

12:34.884 --> 12:36.009
So are you...

12:36.051 --> 12:38.261
Are you guys any closer to finding out
who did this to him?

12:38.345 --> 12:40.013
Well, that's why you're here.

12:42.224 --> 12:44.893
But I need something to go on.

12:47.688 --> 12:50.356
When I knew Brother Sam,
he was Samuel Wright.

12:50.524 --> 12:52.609
A string of holdups
led to the inevitable.

12:52.693 --> 12:55.528
One of his victims fought back
and Wright killed him.

12:56.697 --> 12:57.697
I was ready to make my move

12:57.782 --> 13:00.033
until a drug bust
took Wright off my table.

13:00.451 --> 13:03.119
And you never saw Rivera hanging out
with any of his old crew?

13:04.205 --> 13:05.205
No, I didn't.

13:07.124 --> 13:11.211
Omar had moved past that world.
He was on a righteous path.

13:11.921 --> 13:14.547
It's funny, cos I remember you
saying the same thing

13:14.590 --> 13:16.382
about the last ex-con you vouched for.

13:17.301 --> 13:18.635
Remember Victor Torres?

13:18.719 --> 13:21.805
He gets paroled and goes out
and kills a 19-year-old girl.

13:21.889 --> 13:23.890
There's not a day that goes by

13:23.933 --> 13:27.060
that I don't pray for that girl
or reach out to her family.

13:27.144 --> 13:28.394
Well, her blood's on your hands.

13:28.437 --> 13:30.939
There's a lot more
than that girl's blood on my hands.

13:34.735 --> 13:38.905
My past, the things that I've done,
the life that I lived,

13:38.948 --> 13:40.114
is haunting me to this day.

13:40.241 --> 13:41.783
- Bullshit.
- I don't give a rat's ass

13:41.909 --> 13:44.160
what you think about me,
you understand?

13:44.245 --> 13:46.621
Or the work that I do
or the men that I do it with.

13:47.164 --> 13:52.293
What I do know is this:
Omar did not have this coming.

13:53.254 --> 13:57.674
His demons were gone. Men can change.

14:02.096 --> 14:03.096
Men, maybe.

14:03.180 --> 14:05.181
- Are we done?
- Yeah.

14:05.266 --> 14:06.975
- Thanks for coming in.
- OK.

14:11.689 --> 14:13.356
But what about a monster?

14:23.033 --> 14:24.951
You wanted to see me, sir?

14:25.035 --> 14:29.831
I remember when I had this office.
Miami was a different place.

14:30.958 --> 14:32.542
Corruption was everywhere.

14:34.169 --> 14:37.046
My dad said you never knew
who you could trust back then.

14:37.882 --> 14:39.215
Harry was one of the good ones.

14:41.510 --> 14:44.012
- And so are you.
- Thank you, sir.

14:45.139 --> 14:46.222
That means a lot.

14:47.641 --> 14:49.893
It's why I'm making you
Homicide's new lieutenant.

14:50.561 --> 14:52.312
Me, right. Lieutenant.

14:53.981 --> 14:57.525
Fuckballs, you're serious. Sir.

14:57.651 --> 14:59.402
You're exactly what
this department needs.

14:59.528 --> 15:02.739
- A fresh face, new ideas.
- Wait, really?

15:03.866 --> 15:05.074
You want me in charge?

15:07.328 --> 15:08.703
I don't even know what to say.

15:08.829 --> 15:11.331
- Well, "yes" would work.
- But this is Batista's job.

15:12.207 --> 15:14.000
He's expecting it. He's earned it.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.543
Well, Sergeant Batista's
a fine officer,

15:15.669 --> 15:18.671
but he comes with certain baggage.

15:19.673 --> 15:22.342
Besides, he's not a hero. You are.

15:22.384 --> 15:23.676
Why does everyone keep saying that?

15:23.719 --> 15:25.762
- I was just doing my job.
- That's not how I see it.

15:25.846 --> 15:31.059
That's not how the city sees it. No.
This office needs someone like you.

15:32.019 --> 15:34.103
Oh, my God. Dexter would flip out.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.440
And poor Masuka.
I'd be that little fuck's boss.

15:38.609 --> 15:40.193
I'd be everybody's boss.

15:41.862 --> 15:43.571
This is an honour.

15:45.866 --> 15:47.533
Do you really think I'm ready
for something like this?

15:47.868 --> 15:50.870
Listen, I know this is
a lot to take in.

15:50.913 --> 15:52.956
We can talk about it
more tomorrow, OK?

15:56.210 --> 15:58.962
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

16:06.387 --> 16:07.470
Lieutenant.

16:12.393 --> 16:14.602
What the fuck is going on today?

16:17.773 --> 16:19.732
Keep your eyes on the bouncing ball

16:19.817 --> 16:21.734
and not on Daddy's bad pictures.

16:23.404 --> 16:26.072
Samuel Wright killed
this store owner in cold blood.

16:26.156 --> 16:28.157
Bashed in his head with a bottle.

16:28.242 --> 16:32.078
Now he's calling himself Brother Sam,
professing to be a changed man.

16:32.830 --> 16:33.913
But I can't tell if I'm seeing

16:33.998 --> 16:37.417
a man who's changed for the better
orjust a better cover.

16:37.501 --> 16:38.918
Daddy's box.

16:40.921 --> 16:42.922
You want to put this in Daddy's box?

16:44.425 --> 16:45.466
Thank you.

16:48.178 --> 16:50.763
It seems like yesterday
he was just learning to crawl.

16:53.350 --> 16:54.851
Daddy's box.

16:55.477 --> 16:57.645
Or he's putting
all the pieces together.

16:59.106 --> 17:00.815
What I say, what I do.

17:02.609 --> 17:03.776
Where things go.

17:05.029 --> 17:08.156
- I'll be more careful.
- Is that gonna be enough?

17:14.038 --> 17:16.372
You're looking at
Homicide's new fucking lieutenant.

17:17.332 --> 17:19.500
I know, right? Got any beer?

17:22.171 --> 17:25.381
That's quite the day. Lieutenant.

17:27.051 --> 17:28.968
Nope.

17:29.011 --> 17:31.387
Two beers in
and it still sounds fucking weird.

17:33.891 --> 17:35.141
I can't do this.

17:36.643 --> 17:38.478
And it totally dicks Batista.

17:40.105 --> 17:42.148
What could Matthews
possibly be thinking?

17:44.026 --> 17:48.321
That you're smart, you're driven,
you're a great detective.

17:48.614 --> 17:51.741
Who'll be leading the department
that may hunt me down one day.

17:53.327 --> 17:54.869
You should give yourself some credit.

17:54.953 --> 17:56.245
You should give me another beer.

17:56.830 --> 17:57.914
I'm empty here.

18:00.375 --> 18:02.585
You ever wonder why Dad never made LT?

18:02.669 --> 18:05.129
He had his hands full. With me.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.215
Everyone talked about him
like he was some super cop,

18:07.299 --> 18:09.467
but he stayed in the pen
his whole career.

18:10.010 --> 18:11.344
Maybe he never wanted it.

18:13.430 --> 18:14.722
You know, after his funeral,

18:16.475 --> 18:20.019
a tiny part of me was relieved.

18:21.480 --> 18:24.565
I tried so hard to get him
to pay attention to me.

18:26.151 --> 18:27.193
And I thought with him gone,

18:27.277 --> 18:29.570
I wouldn't need his approval
any more, but...

18:31.406 --> 18:34.283
Twenty years later, I still do.
He's still up here in my head.

18:35.953 --> 18:37.120
You don't say.

18:37.204 --> 18:39.914
The weird thing is,
if I take this job,

18:39.998 --> 18:42.834
I'll have achieved more
than he ever did on the force.

18:43.377 --> 18:45.586
And that's the part
that scares the shit out of me.

18:45.754 --> 18:47.171
Not sure I follow.

18:47.339 --> 18:50.550
Dad was my litmus test
for what a real cop is supposed to be.

18:51.677 --> 18:53.136
And if he never made lieutenant...

18:53.220 --> 18:55.179
Then you have no one
to compare yourself to.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.973
And I don't want to
be fucking LaGuerta.

18:58.642 --> 19:02.103
So how would I even know
if I was doing a good job?

19:02.187 --> 19:03.896
I'd be totally on my own on this.

19:05.149 --> 19:06.524
Well, if you don't want the job,
don't take it.

19:06.608 --> 19:08.067
Fuck you. Of course I want it.

19:10.445 --> 19:12.113
Holy shit, I really want it.

19:17.870 --> 19:20.746
Quinn, again.
What the fuck does he want?

19:21.498 --> 19:23.541
Out on a limb here,
but maybe an answer

19:23.625 --> 19:25.376
as to whether you want to
be Debra Quinn?

19:26.170 --> 19:28.212
Jesus H. Fuck, I totally forgot.

19:29.506 --> 19:32.341
Debra Quinn.
Your initials would be DQ.

19:33.343 --> 19:35.219
- Like the...
- I will kill you.

19:37.806 --> 19:41.434
I have no idea what to say to him.
I've got to stall.

19:43.562 --> 19:44.896
Can I sleep here?

19:45.189 --> 19:47.773
About one life-altering decision a day
is my max.

19:47.858 --> 19:50.234
Yeah. I'll sleep on the couch
in the other room.

19:50.319 --> 19:51.944
That's why you don't suck
as a brother.

19:52.779 --> 19:55.656
Yeah, but what about as a father?

20:29.524 --> 20:32.610
Travis! God damn it.

20:33.028 --> 20:35.029
Really wish
you wouldn't use that word.

20:35.197 --> 20:38.199
Well, maybe I wouldn't
if my brother would use the doorbell.

20:42.579 --> 20:44.330
You really scared me.

20:52.339 --> 20:55.174
Slow down.
And save some room for dessert.

20:56.843 --> 20:58.511
I told you, I have to work tonight.

21:01.098 --> 21:04.600
You're working too much.
I can see it in your face.

21:07.187 --> 21:08.562
I like to keep busy.

21:10.274 --> 21:12.233
You want busy,
try keeping a bunch of fifth-graders

21:12.317 --> 21:14.527
focused on art.

21:14.611 --> 21:16.070
Today, all they could talk about was

21:16.154 --> 21:18.489
they found another flock
of those dead birds up north.

21:19.783 --> 21:22.076
They think it's the end of the world
or something.

21:25.205 --> 21:26.539
What if it were?

21:27.708 --> 21:30.710
Then I'd say
we better eat this ice cream fast.

21:30.794 --> 21:33.004
No, I can't stay. I have to go.

21:33.088 --> 21:36.340
Come on. Blow off work for once.
For me.

21:37.134 --> 21:39.385
I barely get to see you any more.

21:39.469 --> 21:41.178
Well, that was before...

21:43.098 --> 21:44.265
Before what?

21:48.854 --> 21:50.062
It's nothing.

21:53.442 --> 21:58.112
Travis, we used to be so close.
We used to talk and do things.

21:58.196 --> 22:01.157
Now it's like pulling teeth
just to see you for an hour.

22:02.326 --> 22:03.409
I miss you.

22:05.078 --> 22:06.954
I miss you, too.

22:07.164 --> 22:09.874
Then let me spend an evening
with my baby brother.

22:11.126 --> 22:12.209
Please?

22:42.657 --> 22:44.367
Now, who put that there?

22:58.090 --> 23:00.424
Good thing I have just the place
to get this fixed.

23:19.194 --> 23:23.322
If Brother Sam believes in giving
men like this a second chance,

23:23.407 --> 23:26.283
who am I to deny him one on my table?

23:26.368 --> 23:27.660
You here about Eddie?

23:29.955 --> 23:33.082
- What?
- Eddie. You here about Eddie?

23:34.543 --> 23:35.709
His parole agent.

23:35.877 --> 23:38.587
No, I'm just a customer.
I dinged my car.

23:38.672 --> 23:40.464
Is Brother Sam here?

23:42.592 --> 23:43.801
He's out back.

23:56.314 --> 23:57.398
Can I help you?

23:57.482 --> 23:58.858
Yeah. I was hoping to get an estimate.

24:00.485 --> 24:02.278
You're not from around here, are you?

24:02.362 --> 24:04.155
Your shop came highly recommended.

24:04.239 --> 24:06.740
- By who?
- Co-worker.

24:11.246 --> 24:12.580
You out front?

24:16.835 --> 24:18.752
Was that the holy spirit?

24:18.837 --> 24:21.672
Or his dark passenger
checking out mine?

24:21.756 --> 24:24.216
Yeah, my guys can have this out
in a day or two.

24:29.473 --> 24:32.224
"Good Shepherd."
What's that mean, exactly?

24:34.144 --> 24:39.023
Well, the men you see here,
they're like my flock.

24:39.483 --> 24:44.069
And my job is to make sure
that they don't wander.

24:45.697 --> 24:47.031
That's a lot to take on.

24:47.532 --> 24:49.617
Yeah, well, I got a lot to answer for.

24:52.579 --> 24:54.705
Nothing broke that can't be fixed,
right?

24:56.666 --> 25:00.336
Lord have mercy.
No car is ever totalled.

25:01.421 --> 25:05.466
Yeah, it's like a man's life.
Like a man's soul.

25:05.550 --> 25:06.759
I ought to know that.

25:09.763 --> 25:12.139
You know, I once killed a man
and walked off scot-free?

25:13.600 --> 25:14.892
- For that I need to pay.
...need to pay.

25:17.229 --> 25:19.939
- I'm surprised to hear you say that.
- Don't be.

25:20.899 --> 25:23.359
The spirit moves me
to tell my story and share.

25:24.694 --> 25:27.196
I was facing death row.

25:27.280 --> 25:31.825
The judge presiding over my case
suddenly dropped dead.

25:32.077 --> 25:33.369
Mistrial?

25:34.871 --> 25:36.747
Yeah. It sounds
like divine intervention.

25:36.957 --> 25:38.457
Yeah.

25:38.542 --> 25:41.252
God was playing me all right,
you know.

25:41.336 --> 25:44.255
I had to go out here
and get good and high

25:44.339 --> 25:46.507
before he just said,
"Son, that's enough."

25:47.259 --> 25:49.677
And I get stopped.

25:50.512 --> 25:54.014
Possession charge.
I go back to jail, but,

25:54.099 --> 25:56.517
hallelujah, praise God,
that's how I got saved.

25:57.602 --> 25:59.687
So that darkness inside is gone?

26:00.605 --> 26:01.730
No.

26:02.983 --> 26:05.734
It's still there,
but I'm fighting its ass every day.

26:07.195 --> 26:09.655
I really don't have much of a choice,
you know?

26:11.783 --> 26:14.618
I sacrificed that bad part of my soul

26:16.371 --> 26:18.831
to make up for some of the pain
I caused.

26:20.584 --> 26:22.167
Nick still hasn't showed.

26:23.420 --> 26:26.380
You find him and you tell him
I'm coming for him, you understand?

26:27.007 --> 26:28.841
Now. Tell him now.

26:34.222 --> 26:35.639
One of the flock get lost?

26:36.975 --> 26:38.559
Yeah, something like that.

26:40.729 --> 26:44.023
So what do you say there, brother?

26:48.653 --> 26:50.279
I guess I'll be seeing you soon.

26:52.115 --> 26:54.867
All right. You have a blessed day.

26:59.497 --> 27:02.583
Once we work our magic,
we put it up on the board here.

27:02.667 --> 27:04.293
What are the abbreviations?

27:04.377 --> 27:07.963
What was run?
TR is trace. TX, toxicology.

27:08.048 --> 27:11.175
So where does everything go
after it's been run?

27:11.259 --> 27:13.260
Inquisitive. I like.

27:14.471 --> 27:15.763
Evidence, down the hall.

27:18.600 --> 27:19.808
Cool.

27:20.226 --> 27:23.145
Yeah, medical examiner
finally sent 'em over.

27:24.606 --> 27:27.232
- They don't make you squeamish?
- Are you kidding?

27:28.568 --> 27:31.737
- I love this.
- Me, too.

27:39.454 --> 27:40.537
Vince.

27:43.750 --> 27:46.377
- Hands off.
- She's my student.

27:46.461 --> 27:49.505
Yeah, and a lawsuit landing on my desk
if she catches you staring like that.

27:49.589 --> 27:52.716
Sounds like someone's expecting
to make Lieutenant Buzz-kill.

27:59.641 --> 28:01.809
Take these files
down to Central Booking.

28:01.893 --> 28:04.061
Have them cross-referenced
with the CI lab

28:04.145 --> 28:06.438
- and get back to me right away.
- Yes, sir.

28:13.863 --> 28:15.030
Wow.

28:15.782 --> 28:17.408
You really drink that swill?

28:18.827 --> 28:19.952
Keeps me young.

28:20.036 --> 28:22.538
How about we go around the corner
and I buy you a real cup of coffee?

28:22.622 --> 28:24.748
- My treat.
- OK.

28:27.377 --> 28:29.253
Dexter, you got a minute?

28:29.337 --> 28:30.379
Yeah, I need to get to my lab.

28:30.463 --> 28:32.881
Has Deb mentioned anything to you,
you know, about us?

28:32.966 --> 28:35.759
- She may have said you proposed.
- And?

28:35.844 --> 28:37.511
The pancakes weren't bad.

28:37.595 --> 28:40.305
- I fucked this up royally, didn't I?
- I wouldn't know.

28:40.390 --> 28:42.850
Look, I know you and I have
had our differences,

28:42.934 --> 28:46.437
but it would really mean a lot to me
if you could help me out here.

28:46.521 --> 28:49.106
- Well, this is between you and Deb.
- No, I know.

28:49.190 --> 28:50.649
It's just,
I don't want her to feel like

28:50.734 --> 28:54.570
she has to, you know,
choose between you or me.

28:55.238 --> 28:56.488
She doesn't.

28:56.865 --> 28:59.032
Because it is never going to be you.

29:00.952 --> 29:01.994
No, I got it.

29:02.078 --> 29:04.371
- I said it was my treat.
- I got it. Here.

29:05.290 --> 29:06.582
I can afford it.

29:09.377 --> 29:10.502
What is it?

29:12.756 --> 29:16.175
I just wanted to let you know

29:16.259 --> 29:19.803
that I'm the detective I am
because of you.

29:20.680 --> 29:21.805
Thank you.

29:22.640 --> 29:26.602
And you have always,
always had my back.

29:26.686 --> 29:29.396
And, more than that,
you're like family to me.

29:29.481 --> 29:30.689
Where is this going?

29:32.692 --> 29:34.359
- Don't look at me for a second.
- Deb.

29:38.990 --> 29:41.658
Angel, Matthews has asked me
to be the new lieutenant.

29:44.829 --> 29:47.080
I'm sorry.
I know how much you wanted this.

29:50.627 --> 29:51.877
What did you say?

29:51.961 --> 29:54.379
That you should be
the new lieutenant, not me.

29:54.714 --> 29:56.465
- What did he say?
- He wouldn't listen.

29:58.468 --> 30:01.053
I could never, ever do this job
without your blessing,

30:01.137 --> 30:02.179
so you just say the word,

30:02.263 --> 30:04.556
and I'll tell Matthews
to go fuck himself.

30:09.103 --> 30:10.562
This...

30:12.941 --> 30:14.066
It's really great.

30:17.362 --> 30:18.946
- You mean that?
- Damn right.

30:19.864 --> 30:21.990
It's about time a real cop
had that job.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.745
I couldn't be happier. Come here.

30:29.457 --> 30:31.583
I'm gonna need
that money back, though.

30:31.668 --> 30:32.709
OK.

30:38.383 --> 30:41.802
- Angel.
- It's been a long day, Maria.

30:41.886 --> 30:45.472
I just found out about Morgan.
I'm so sorry.

30:45.557 --> 30:47.766
There's nothing to be sorry about.

30:47.851 --> 30:50.060
I was on the fence about this
whole lieutenant thing anyway.

30:50.144 --> 30:52.563
Look, this has nothing to do with you.

30:52.647 --> 30:55.399
Matthews is just using Morgan
to get back at me,

30:55.483 --> 30:56.567
but it won't work.

30:56.651 --> 30:59.570
- I mean, she's barely out of diapers.
- Don't do that.

31:00.780 --> 31:04.533
Deb's a good detective.
Better than you ever were.

31:06.244 --> 31:08.370
Look, you're angry
and you have every right to be,

31:08.454 --> 31:10.914
but I will fix this. I...

31:10.999 --> 31:13.000
Enough, Maria, enough.

31:15.545 --> 31:16.753
Angel, I'm so sorry.

31:16.838 --> 31:19.590
How come if Matthews hates you,
I'm always the one paying the price?

31:54.500 --> 31:57.878
The good shepherd has fled his field
for seedier pastures.

32:03.134 --> 32:04.760
The question is, why?

32:47.971 --> 32:50.430
It seems old habits die hard.

32:50.515 --> 32:52.933
Brother Sam's not a changed man
after all.

32:54.060 --> 32:55.268
Hallelujah.

33:18.543 --> 33:22.295
I can't come back for Brother Sam
until I make sure he killed that man.

33:24.424 --> 33:28.093
But while I'm checking,
better safe than sorry.

33:37.437 --> 33:41.148
I was right all along.
Brother Sam is no shepherd.

33:41.232 --> 33:42.524
He's still a wolf.

33:54.829 --> 33:57.706
Well, it is an animal tranquiliser.

33:57.790 --> 33:58.832
Good doggy.

34:01.836 --> 34:03.003
Who the fuck is out here?

34:03.087 --> 34:05.797
Sam, it's me. I was here earlier.
The SUV.

34:05.882 --> 34:09.259
I left my clicker for my garage
in the glove compartment.

34:10.053 --> 34:11.720
I thought it was too late to call.

34:11.804 --> 34:13.388
- Do you mind?
- Sit!

34:13.639 --> 34:14.723
Eli!

34:20.646 --> 34:23.774
Sorry. I didn't see anyone here.
I thought I would be in and out.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.651
Your car's inside.

34:27.361 --> 34:28.987
Maybe I should just
come back tomorrow.

34:29.072 --> 34:30.197
No.

34:31.783 --> 34:33.158
We can get it over with now.

34:35.870 --> 34:36.912
OK.

34:38.289 --> 34:39.414
Eli!

34:41.751 --> 34:43.001
Appreciate it.

34:48.758 --> 34:51.510
This isn't how I envisioned
taking down Brother Sam,

34:51.594 --> 34:53.845
but it's either him or me
if I want to stay...

34:57.100 --> 34:58.225
Alive?

34:58.309 --> 34:59.935
Get off the man's damn car.

35:01.479 --> 35:02.687
Can't believe you hit me, man.

35:02.772 --> 35:04.648
I can't believe you took a shot at me.

35:04.732 --> 35:06.358
Now I'm confused.

35:06.442 --> 35:08.610
Take Eli out back
and don't you think about running off.

35:08.694 --> 35:11.363
I chased your ass down once.
I'll do it again. You understand?

35:12.240 --> 35:13.406
Come on, boy.

35:19.705 --> 35:21.164
Your missing worker.

35:24.127 --> 35:25.794
You know, the Bible says,

35:25.878 --> 35:28.880
"David broke a lamb's leg
to protect it from wandering off."

35:30.383 --> 35:32.592
I have to tend to my flock
any way I can.

35:33.302 --> 35:34.928
- Drugs?
- Yeah.

35:35.012 --> 35:36.096
I knew when he missed his shift,

35:36.180 --> 35:38.849
he was just holed up in his house,
getting high.

35:39.725 --> 35:40.976
The good shepherd.

35:41.853 --> 35:43.436
Yeah, when I have to be.

35:46.190 --> 35:47.399
It's open.

35:51.487 --> 35:54.239
- The clicker.
- Oh, right.

35:59.745 --> 36:00.787
I got it...

36:00.872 --> 36:01.913
All wrong.

36:01.998 --> 36:04.416
Is this what the power of belief
is all about?

36:04.500 --> 36:06.877
Knowing a dead fruit vendor
never strayed,

36:06.961 --> 36:09.296
tending to a lost member
of your flock,

36:09.589 --> 36:11.173
the ability to change?

36:16.262 --> 36:19.055
- What is it?
- Nothing good.

36:22.226 --> 36:23.310
Stay back.

36:28.816 --> 36:30.275
- Where's our boy?
- Safe.

36:30.359 --> 36:32.527
- Please get off the property.
- Fuck you.

36:34.113 --> 36:35.363
Is there a problem?

36:36.449 --> 36:38.450
This is you staying back?
This is not your fight.

36:39.035 --> 36:41.453
Hey, you deaf, pendejo?

36:48.336 --> 36:49.669
You should pick up
your friend and leave.

36:49.754 --> 36:50.921
We're going.

36:51.881 --> 36:53.798
But not without our boy, Nick.

37:04.477 --> 37:09.147
I'm not afraid of you, son.
And I damn sure ain't afraid to die.

37:10.608 --> 37:13.610
I know what's waiting for me
on the other side. Do you?

37:14.654 --> 37:16.571
"Mark the perfect man

37:16.656 --> 37:19.449
"and behold the upright,
for at the end of that man is peace."

37:19.575 --> 37:20.659
Shut up.

37:24.789 --> 37:26.122
What you waiting for, son?

37:27.667 --> 37:29.417
He can't tell
if Brother Sam is bluffing,

37:29.502 --> 37:31.378
crazy or a true believer.

37:33.047 --> 37:34.172
Join the club.

37:37.218 --> 37:39.219
- You don't want to do that.
- Faith, brother.

37:39.679 --> 37:41.054
God is in control.

37:46.143 --> 37:47.602
Miami Metro.

37:48.854 --> 37:50.689
You kill him or me,

37:50.773 --> 37:53.191
you'll have the whole department
after you.

37:53.818 --> 37:56.695
Yo, Julio,
let's get the fuck out of here.

37:57.613 --> 37:59.072
This ain't over.

37:59.156 --> 38:01.992
Well, until it is,
I'm praying for you, son.

38:02.076 --> 38:04.160
Well, you best be praying
I don't put you down

38:04.245 --> 38:06.204
like the last fuck-up that crossed me.

38:06.706 --> 38:08.164
Remember Hector Nunez?

38:09.583 --> 38:11.543
They never found his body, did they?

38:22.305 --> 38:24.055
- That was...
- That was a miracle.

38:26.892 --> 38:28.184
Miami Metro?

38:30.021 --> 38:33.106
Forensics department. Lab geek.

38:33.482 --> 38:34.649
They didn't need to know that.

38:34.734 --> 38:36.484
You don't fight like no lab geek.

38:41.824 --> 38:42.866
Lord have mercy.

38:42.950 --> 38:46.619
It's just an evening
full of wonders tonight, huh?

38:47.246 --> 38:50.332
Praise God.
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

38:52.001 --> 38:53.209
You don't say.

39:12.063 --> 39:13.605
Where were you last night?

39:15.441 --> 39:16.649
My sister's.

39:18.903 --> 39:20.820
She was worried about me.

39:22.281 --> 39:23.531
I couldn't get away.

39:24.408 --> 39:26.701
You know
that she can't be saved, right?

39:27.953 --> 39:29.996
She is a good person.

39:32.541 --> 39:34.000
She's all that I have.

39:36.128 --> 39:37.462
You know that isn't true.

39:38.506 --> 39:42.050
You have me and you have God now.

39:42.593 --> 39:46.388
But I see
you have to be reminded of that.

39:49.934 --> 39:51.768
Is this what you want, Travis?

40:00.820 --> 40:02.612
To hurt me?

40:02.696 --> 40:04.781
You see how I suffer for your sins?

40:05.324 --> 40:06.449
Stop!

40:08.244 --> 40:09.577
I won't see her again.

40:11.664 --> 40:12.831
I won't.

40:14.917 --> 40:15.959
I swear.

40:16.043 --> 40:19.087
It's my job to take care of you.

40:20.089 --> 40:22.006
- Not hers.
- Forgive me.

40:24.969 --> 40:26.261
I will do better.

40:28.639 --> 40:31.766
I will show you that I'm worthy.

40:45.823 --> 40:47.574
Oh, fuck me.

40:51.537 --> 40:52.704
Hey.

40:53.789 --> 40:54.873
So...

40:56.250 --> 40:59.794
You shouldn't have. Really.

41:00.004 --> 41:02.005
You know, I figured if, you know,
we're gonna talk,

41:02.089 --> 41:05.592
then why not over Chinese
from that place you like?

41:05.676 --> 41:07.760
- Beer's in the...
- I can't marry you.

41:07.845 --> 41:09.846
...fridge.
- I'm sorry.

41:09.972 --> 41:11.973
You're so good to me, but I can't.

41:16.228 --> 41:20.273
Well, if you don't want to be with me,
then why are you with me?

41:20.858 --> 41:22.150
Because...

41:23.110 --> 41:24.277
it wasn't...

41:25.821 --> 41:26.905
this.

41:28.657 --> 41:32.577
I'm sorry for wanting to
be an adult here, Deb, but...

41:32.870 --> 41:37.123
I never meant to hurt you.
Or lead you on.

41:39.043 --> 41:41.294
I just like things the way they are.

41:46.300 --> 41:49.010
Yeah. That's...

41:49.929 --> 41:52.472
not good enough, you know?
I want more.

41:53.349 --> 41:54.474
That's the problem.

41:56.143 --> 41:57.227
I don't.

42:02.233 --> 42:04.943
- You are a great...
- You know what? Just don't.

42:05.027 --> 42:07.237
Don't be here when I get back,
all right?

42:13.202 --> 42:14.869
And I'm your new boss.

42:34.640 --> 42:37.892
- Did you tell the little guy a story?
- Jamie put him to bed.

42:41.146 --> 42:43.856
Looks like Brother Sam's
a changed man after all.

42:43.941 --> 42:46.109
He was true to his word
about being a good shepherd.

42:46.944 --> 42:49.070
He put his own life on the line
to save that kid

42:49.154 --> 42:50.446
from a pack of wolves.

42:51.031 --> 42:53.157
And here's the leader of the pack.

42:54.660 --> 42:56.995
Harrison eventually is going to
need a good shepherd, too.

42:59.373 --> 43:00.665
I'll be there for him.

43:02.334 --> 43:03.418
And what about him?

43:06.505 --> 43:07.589
I was set on proving

43:07.673 --> 43:09.966
Brother Sam still deserves
to be on my table,

43:10.050 --> 43:11.551
but miraculously,

43:11.635 --> 43:14.762
Julio goes and vets himself
to take his place.

43:16.015 --> 43:18.683
Hector Nunez was a barber
in Julio's neighbourhood.

43:18.726 --> 43:22.312
Went missing six months ago. No body.

43:23.647 --> 43:25.231
The Almighty at work?

43:26.191 --> 43:28.985
I'm not ready to call Julio
a sign from God,

43:29.069 --> 43:33.072
but I am thankful for the bounty
I am about to receive.

43:38.120 --> 43:39.454
I have any clean shirts?

43:39.538 --> 43:41.289
Your room. Or former room.

43:41.415 --> 43:44.959
- Deb being here is temporary.
- Who doesn't rinse out their bowl?

43:45.044 --> 43:46.377
Temporary, I promise.

43:48.547 --> 43:50.340
Deb. I need a shirt.

43:53.927 --> 43:55.345
What do you think?

43:56.597 --> 43:57.972
Dad would be proud.

43:58.932 --> 44:02.393
Thanks again for letting me crash here
until I find a place.

44:02.478 --> 44:04.437
It's why I don't suck, remember?

44:05.689 --> 44:07.565
Just help Jamie out when you can.

44:09.318 --> 44:11.444
Am I making the biggest mistake
of my life?

44:16.909 --> 44:18.117
I don't know, Deb.

44:18.202 --> 44:19.285
As Harrison gets older,

44:19.370 --> 44:21.371
I've been thinking more
about what I believe in.

44:21.455 --> 44:23.498
I'm coming to find
the list is kind of short.

44:26.001 --> 44:27.710
What do any of us really believe in?

44:28.587 --> 44:30.213
That you'll be a great lieutenant.

44:33.676 --> 44:36.052
Screw Dad.
I'm gonna make you proud of me.

44:38.222 --> 44:41.766
Dissected all seven baby snakes.
Stomachs were empty.

44:41.850 --> 44:44.977
They didn't come from a pet store.
Most likely the wild.

44:45.062 --> 44:46.354
Back to square one.

44:51.276 --> 44:52.860
Remember Barry Manilow tickets.

44:52.945 --> 44:54.362
Toxicology's back.

44:54.446 --> 44:57.240
- On what? The board is clear.
- The snakes.

44:57.324 --> 45:00.034
I hope you don't mind,
but I ran tissue samples.

45:00.994 --> 45:03.079
Which I would have done.

45:03.163 --> 45:05.039
And look. Heavy metals.

45:05.124 --> 45:06.999
If there was nothing
in the bellies of the snakes,

45:07.084 --> 45:08.501
where did it come from?

45:10.337 --> 45:12.839
From Mama snake,

45:13.799 --> 45:16.259
who had to have been living
in a toxic environment

45:16.343 --> 45:17.885
to pass it on to her young.

45:17.970 --> 45:20.471
You wanna look up EPA clean-up sites
or should I?

45:21.390 --> 45:23.516
I'd rather look up your...

45:25.436 --> 45:27.729
I mean, I didn't... I wasn't...

45:29.189 --> 45:32.150
- Please don't sue.
- You like to watch.

45:33.777 --> 45:34.944
Good to know.

45:38.532 --> 45:39.991
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

45:40.075 --> 45:41.951
Morgan as lieutenant?

45:42.119 --> 45:44.412
Yes. I was just sending
over the paperwork.

45:44.496 --> 45:45.788
Fuck you, Tom.

45:45.956 --> 45:49.542
You get one of those as captain,
but don't push your luck, Maria.

45:49.626 --> 45:50.877
We agreed

45:50.961 --> 45:53.254
- the new lieutenant would be Batista.
- I agreed to nothing.

45:53.464 --> 45:55.381
And need I remind you
that all personnel decisions

45:55.466 --> 45:56.883
are ultimately my decision.

45:57.468 --> 45:58.843
If they weren't,

45:58.927 --> 46:01.304
your little plan to blackmail me
wouldn't have worked.

46:02.848 --> 46:04.932
This is gonna be a fucking disaster

46:05.058 --> 46:08.686
- and I won't take the fall for it.
- Well, we'll see, won't we?

46:09.980 --> 46:12.899
- Better hurry. Don't want to be late.
- For what?

46:12.983 --> 46:15.485
Your first official task, Captain.

46:19.031 --> 46:20.740
The Everglades?

46:20.824 --> 46:23.034
All 4,000 square miles of it?
That's your big break?

46:23.118 --> 46:24.243
I never said the Everglades.

46:24.328 --> 46:28.206
I said hazardous waste sites
near or around the Everglades.

46:28.290 --> 46:30.458
It would explain where the pollutants
in the snakes came from.

46:30.542 --> 46:32.668
Yeah. We narrowed this down.

46:32.753 --> 46:35.671
Someone could have seen
the bad guys coming or going.

46:39.218 --> 46:43.179
- I suppose it's a start.
- What gives with all the reporters?

46:43.514 --> 46:45.723
We're getting a new lieutenant.

46:49.478 --> 46:51.187
What the fuck did you say to Deb?

46:51.563 --> 46:52.980
Good morning to you, too.

46:53.065 --> 46:54.106
You know, everything was fine,

46:54.191 --> 46:55.566
until she spent the night
at your place.

46:56.360 --> 46:58.778
You know, she's made her choice,
but it's not you or me.

47:00.280 --> 47:02.365
Press conference is starting.

47:07.287 --> 47:12.041
Everyone, thank you for coming
on such short notice.

47:13.460 --> 47:16.420
You're here today,
because it's my privilege

47:16.505 --> 47:19.382
to introduce an officer who...

47:19.466 --> 47:22.301
while under my watch,
has proven herself

47:22.386 --> 47:26.138
to be one of Miami's finest
and a true friend.

47:27.140 --> 47:28.641
Ladies and gentlemen,

47:28.725 --> 47:32.353
I give you the youngest officer
ever to make lieutenant

47:32.437 --> 47:35.690
in the history
of Miami Metro Homicide,

47:35.774 --> 47:36.899
Debra Morgan.

48:00.507 --> 48:03.593
I gotta hand it to you, Julio.
You ran quite a racket.

48:05.178 --> 48:08.556
I read all about how you were
shaking down local business owners

48:10.726 --> 48:12.560
like Hector Nunez.

48:18.191 --> 48:19.275
You.

48:19.359 --> 48:21.611
- You recognise this shop, don't you?
- Fuck you.

48:21.695 --> 48:24.405
My boys will fucking kill you
for this.

48:25.574 --> 48:29.660
Let me guess.
With your history of violence,

48:29.745 --> 48:33.080
Hector stood up to you and your gang

48:33.165 --> 48:35.166
and that's why
they never found his body.

48:37.753 --> 48:39.754
Just the way they'll never find yours.

48:39.838 --> 48:41.881
Yeah, I killed him. So what?

48:42.007 --> 48:44.342
You're a dead man. My boys will...

48:47.179 --> 48:48.846
Will miss you, I'm sure.

48:49.848 --> 48:51.098
So I'll make this quick.

48:54.019 --> 48:55.436
I have to get home.

48:57.230 --> 48:59.857
I have a much more important
ritual to tend to.

49:02.069 --> 49:05.112
You must be thinking "Why me?"
Right about now.

49:05.197 --> 49:06.864
I can't explain it myself.

49:07.115 --> 49:11.619
God. The universe. Irony.

49:14.289 --> 49:16.707
Brother Sam wasn't
who I thought he was, but you...

49:17.751 --> 49:18.960
This...

49:19.461 --> 49:20.920
I know all too well.

49:24.883 --> 49:26.217
Always the same ending.

49:34.393 --> 49:37.228
Because monsters don't
get to live happily ever after.

50:12.973 --> 50:14.765
Hands up and...

50:16.518 --> 50:17.768
Good job.

50:18.937 --> 50:21.188
The good thing about
the mind of a two-year-old,

50:21.273 --> 50:22.815
it's easily distracted.

50:22.941 --> 50:23.983
You want to roll it?

50:28.113 --> 50:30.990
He won't remember Daddy's box
if he has one of his own.

50:36.788 --> 50:39.206
Monster story, Daddy.

50:39.624 --> 50:41.459
How about a new story?

50:47.674 --> 50:50.801
"Once upon a time,
there were three little pigs.

50:52.220 --> 50:55.139
"The first little pig built
a house of straw.

50:57.184 --> 50:59.477
"The second, a house of sticks.

51:02.230 --> 51:04.690
"And the third, a house of bricks.

51:08.820 --> 51:11.489
"But along came the big, bad wolf."

51:13.325 --> 51:15.034
Wolves come in many forms.

51:15.994 --> 51:18.662
Some have big eyes,
the better to see you with.

51:19.539 --> 51:22.208
You want to connect this part.
That's the joiner.

51:22.334 --> 51:24.043
Others huff and puff...

51:25.712 --> 51:27.838
- Hey, you all right?
- No.

51:27.881 --> 51:29.215
...while others hide in plain sight.

51:29.341 --> 51:30.341
- I think I sprained my ankle.
- Really?

51:30.425 --> 51:31.926
- Let's take a look at it.
- I heard something snap.

51:32.010 --> 51:34.011
- Did you fall down or something?
- Yeah.

51:34.054 --> 51:37.890
I should know, because like it or not,
I'm one, too.

51:38.016 --> 51:39.934
That's never going to change.

51:45.941 --> 51:47.024
And neither is the fact

51:47.109 --> 51:49.443
my little lamb
is becoming a little boy.

51:50.278 --> 51:54.198
Walking. Talking. Listening.

51:57.702 --> 52:00.287
As much as I want Harrison
to stay this way forever,

52:00.372 --> 52:02.123
from now on,
the only wolves in his life

52:02.207 --> 52:04.208
have to be the stuff of fairy tales.

52:05.710 --> 52:08.712
I can no longer allow him
to see the real me.

52:08.755 --> 52:10.548
Only the version that's make-believe.

52:11.800 --> 52:14.969
It's the only way this story
gets to have a happy ending.
