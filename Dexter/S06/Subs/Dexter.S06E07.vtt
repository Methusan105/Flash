00:08.888 --> 00:10.305
Previously on Dexter...

00:10.432 --> 00:11.765
You're not alone anymore, Dexter.

00:11.933 --> 00:17.479
You can be yourself with me,
your real, genuine self.

00:17.605 --> 00:19.231
You can...

00:19.649 --> 00:20.774
Sorry.

00:22.318 --> 00:23.444
Jonah, why are you still here?

00:23.778 --> 00:26.155
I can't leave my mom
and sister alone with him.

00:27.824 --> 00:29.742
Everything's ready to mark the whore.

00:31.077 --> 00:32.286
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:32.328 --> 00:33.454
No, please.

00:33.496 --> 00:35.289
- Where are you taking me?
- You're free.

00:35.957 --> 00:37.916
I know it was Nick who shot you.

00:39.002 --> 00:41.170
Tell him that I forgive him.

00:41.421 --> 00:43.839
He's dead, which makes you a murderer.

00:44.299 --> 00:46.759
They got no proof.
Nobody can do anything!

00:55.101 --> 00:56.143
Hey, little brother.

00:58.354 --> 00:59.646
Miss me?

02:55.430 --> 03:00.475
I've been lost before.
After Rita died, after Lumen left.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.771
But now I've been found.

03:06.107 --> 03:08.901
Brian Moser, my dead brother,

03:09.277 --> 03:11.278
it's been a long time
since I've seen him.

03:11.946 --> 03:13.405
Too long.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.783
Here. Catch.

03:21.289 --> 03:23.999
You used to love to play.
Why the long face?

03:24.292 --> 03:27.586
Brother Sam had hoped I'd be able
to forgive Nick for shooting him.

03:29.464 --> 03:32.466
Cos you don't turn the other cheek,
you slice it.

03:32.592 --> 03:36.511
Brother Sam doesn't know you
like Brother Brian does.

03:36.638 --> 03:37.804
Admit it.

03:38.014 --> 03:40.849
You're a little glad to see me.

03:40.975 --> 03:43.602
- I feel...
- Relieved?

03:43.645 --> 03:46.521
Relieved. Unburdened.

03:46.648 --> 03:48.815
Like maybe I can stop pretending.

03:51.110 --> 03:53.278
Pretending there's any light in me.

03:53.321 --> 03:55.489
Feel that sun.

03:56.282 --> 03:58.283
Feels good, doesn't it?

03:59.661 --> 04:03.664
You know, we don't have to go back.

04:03.790 --> 04:05.624
We could keep going.

04:09.545 --> 04:10.671
It's Debra.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.216
The one that got away.

04:15.843 --> 04:17.010
Hey, Deb, what's up?

04:18.179 --> 04:19.388
I'll get there as soon as I can.

04:23.184 --> 04:25.018
We'll talk about this later.

04:34.904 --> 04:37.906
Closing the door. Must be serious.

04:42.203 --> 04:43.245
Very serious.

04:44.038 --> 04:45.372
It's Trinity.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.541
He's back. He killed again.

04:50.378 --> 04:52.546
- He... What?
- Two people.

04:53.214 --> 04:54.589
Family members, his wife,

04:54.716 --> 04:57.009
Sally Mitchell,
and his daughter Rebecca.

04:58.928 --> 05:01.513
Witpro placed the Mitchells
in the middle of Bumfuck, Nebraska,

05:01.556 --> 05:04.057
and somehow Trinity managed
to track them down.

05:04.183 --> 05:06.852
Well, not Trinity. You killed Trinity.

05:08.021 --> 05:09.104
What about his son, Jonah?

05:09.230 --> 05:11.732
Trinity came after him, too,
but Jonah survived the attack.

05:11.858 --> 05:12.899
How lucky.

05:13.401 --> 05:14.609
Didn't he say what happened?

05:15.028 --> 05:16.111
According to his statement,

05:16.571 --> 05:17.738
Jonah came home from work

05:17.864 --> 05:20.365
and saw Trinity push Sally
down the stairs

05:20.408 --> 05:21.575
and begin to beat her.

05:22.243 --> 05:24.911
Jonah fought him off. Trinity ran.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.457
And Jonah went upstairs
and found Rebecca

05:30.209 --> 05:31.752
dead in a tub.

05:33.254 --> 05:34.755
Or Jonah killed them

05:34.881 --> 05:37.758
and is masquerading
as the Trinity Killer.

05:39.218 --> 05:42.596
And this all happened in Nebraska?

05:44.557 --> 05:45.974
Some town called Kearney.

05:46.100 --> 05:47.142
Road trip.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.273
Brother Sam's death is
hard enough on you, I'm sure,

05:53.900 --> 05:55.108
and to top it off with this...

05:55.276 --> 05:56.943
Let's go kill Jonah.

05:58.488 --> 06:01.948
- I... I'm gonna need some time.
- Whatever you need.

06:03.242 --> 06:04.326
Take the day.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.087
"Carnival."

06:18.257 --> 06:20.175
- What?
- Nothing.

06:20.301 --> 06:22.844
I just love having you here.

06:24.764 --> 06:26.348
Usually when you come to stay with me,

06:26.474 --> 06:30.519
there's some problem
that you need help with.

06:36.109 --> 06:40.987
I can't, for the life of me,
figure out how...

06:45.993 --> 06:48.328
how to turn off the predictive text
on my phone.

06:48.454 --> 06:49.663
Do you have any idea how to do that?

06:49.789 --> 06:52.666
I texted my boss
that I had two tickets to jizz fest.

06:53.126 --> 06:55.043
Well, maybe you'll get a promotion.

06:55.169 --> 06:58.171
Well, I wouldn't hold my breath
on that one.

06:59.173 --> 07:01.299
Your boss doesn't mind
you not coming in?

07:01.384 --> 07:02.968
My boss thinks I'm out tracking down

07:03.010 --> 07:06.179
an ancient manuscript
from a private collector.

07:08.808 --> 07:11.393
You sure you can't get
the whole day off?

07:11.519 --> 07:14.855
Parent/teacher conferences are a bitch
to reschedule.

07:17.191 --> 07:19.234
I'll only be a few hours.

07:35.209 --> 07:36.543
- I'm done.
- Done?

07:36.586 --> 07:38.170
With you. With everything.

07:39.881 --> 07:42.382
God is the one with choice, Travis.

07:43.050 --> 07:44.551
He chose you and me.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.262
We, however, have no say.

07:48.222 --> 07:49.431
What about free will?

07:49.765 --> 07:52.017
Please. Let me inside.

07:54.061 --> 07:57.063
No. You see? Free will.

07:57.398 --> 07:59.065
God's will doesn't stop

07:59.108 --> 08:01.067
just because you want to play house
with your sister.

08:01.694 --> 08:04.237
Until this little detour of yours
is over,

08:04.363 --> 08:08.283
I will carry on his work.
For the both of us.

08:16.751 --> 08:17.918
Rebecca Mitchell.

08:18.002 --> 08:20.795
Severed femoral artery.
She bled out in minutes.

08:21.923 --> 08:23.798
- Razor blade?
- Check.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.259
- Mirror?
- Check.

08:26.761 --> 08:27.928
Sally Mitchell.

08:29.096 --> 08:31.932
She was pushed down the stairs,
but that's not what killed her.

08:32.808 --> 08:35.268
She suffered blunt-force traumas
to the head, neck and chest.

08:35.811 --> 08:37.938
She was bludgeoned.
Was it with a hammer?

08:38.481 --> 08:39.648
Hockey stick.

08:39.941 --> 08:43.276
A girl dead in the bathtub,
a mom pushed and bludgeoned.

08:43.319 --> 08:45.612
Kind of
an efficient little combo pack there.

08:45.947 --> 08:47.030
Jonah's been a very good student.

08:47.490 --> 08:50.784
But Jonah loved his mom and sister.

08:51.285 --> 08:54.955
When has love ever kept people
from killing one another?

08:55.873 --> 08:59.459
You and I both know how easy
it would be to choke Becca out.

08:59.502 --> 09:01.294
Jonah climbs in the tub behind her,

09:01.379 --> 09:04.214
cuts off her airway, opens her artery.

09:04.715 --> 09:07.217
Now, Mommy,
it's kind of genius of Jonah

09:07.301 --> 09:09.135
to bludgeon her on the staircase, why?

09:09.470 --> 09:12.556
Because the castoff pattern is
consistent with Trinity's height.

09:12.807 --> 09:13.974
Jonah stands on the highest step,

09:14.016 --> 09:17.310
and suddenly he's as tall
as good old dad.

09:17.353 --> 09:19.479
Kid has some real talent.

09:21.732 --> 09:22.857
It's in his blood.

09:23.526 --> 09:26.152
Son of a serial killer
becomes a killer.

09:26.404 --> 09:27.487
What are the odds?

09:30.825 --> 09:32.993
Let's go play in your room.

09:34.412 --> 09:36.204
Cute kid. My nephew.

09:39.709 --> 09:43.420
Kearney, Nebraska is a mere 30 hours
from Miami, FLA.

09:43.754 --> 09:45.338
Thirty-one if you must stop
along the way.

09:45.756 --> 09:49.050
We could rent a car, take I-95 north.

09:49.719 --> 09:52.178
Don't tell me
you're having second thoughts.

09:52.263 --> 09:54.764
What about DDK?
Miami Metro could get to them first.

09:54.849 --> 09:57.058
- They're not even close!
- I don't know.

09:57.351 --> 09:58.602
When you 86'ed Trinity,

09:58.686 --> 10:01.521
you gave Jonah the perfect alibi
to get away with murder.

10:01.606 --> 10:04.691
I know how much you hate it
when people get away with murder.

10:04.775 --> 10:06.860
Everyone, that is, except for you.

10:07.194 --> 10:09.446
So I'm a little, what,
responsible for this happening?

10:09.530 --> 10:11.698
Your life is nothing
but responsibility.

10:11.907 --> 10:13.533
Look around, Dexter.

10:13.618 --> 10:15.410
Look at your life!

10:15.536 --> 10:18.955
Sippy cups, poopy diapers,
baby monitors!

10:19.040 --> 10:20.373
You've been domesticated!

10:21.375 --> 10:24.044
You need to take this trip.

10:24.086 --> 10:25.962
Come on, Dexter.

10:27.089 --> 10:29.716
When was the last time you had fun?

10:34.305 --> 10:36.222
Thanks for coming over
on such short notice.

10:37.099 --> 10:38.141
No problem.

10:38.225 --> 10:40.477
I shouldn't be gone
more than four or five days.

10:44.440 --> 10:45.565
Come in.

10:46.901 --> 10:48.485
Timing's perfect.

10:48.569 --> 10:50.737
The first chapter of my dissertation
is due next week,

10:50.821 --> 10:52.739
and I never get anything done at home,

10:52.782 --> 10:55.116
especially when Angel's there.

10:55.826 --> 10:57.744
It's Brother Sam, isn't it?
You miss him.

10:58.746 --> 11:00.914
I just need to get away from it all.

11:00.998 --> 11:02.499
I'll only bug you
if it's super important.

11:03.918 --> 11:05.251
- Where you going?
- I'm not sure.

11:05.336 --> 11:08.588
Maybe down to the Keys,
wherever the road takes me.

11:08.673 --> 11:11.091
Well, have fun. Let's get you to bed.

11:12.635 --> 11:15.095
- I love you.
- Wow. "Love." Really?

11:16.263 --> 11:17.764
It's weird seeing you with a kid.

11:18.432 --> 11:19.599
Let's go to Nebraska.

11:43.624 --> 11:44.999
Starting your mornings off right,

11:45.126 --> 11:47.711
Georgia's Heart to Heart,
Rock Hits 96.

11:52.466 --> 11:54.300
Deb, hey, it's me.

11:54.468 --> 11:56.469
You know, I'm gonna need
more than a day to clear my head.

11:56.554 --> 11:59.013
It's hard to concentrate.

11:59.140 --> 12:01.516
There's a lot to digest, I guess.

12:02.184 --> 12:04.185
I'll be back in four days, five tops.

12:05.646 --> 12:07.647
Hope that hearing thing goes well.

12:10.818 --> 12:14.487
Seventy percent of the murders
in my district were by firearms.

12:15.030 --> 12:17.323
What percentage of murders
is by spiked collar?

12:18.743 --> 12:22.328
I created a separate category
for the Doomsday Killer murders.

12:22.371 --> 12:25.832
So that those unsolved cases
don't count against your clearances?

12:27.501 --> 12:29.377
What is your division's
clearance rate?

12:30.921 --> 12:32.255
Forty-two percent.

12:32.339 --> 12:36.760
Add back in the open DDK murders,
and your clearance rate drops to...

12:39.889 --> 12:42.223
Twenty-nine percent,
but I can explain...

12:42.349 --> 12:44.851
Numbers can't hear you. Moving on.

12:46.353 --> 12:47.520
Hey.

12:48.105 --> 12:51.524
Six of those murders happened
on your watch, before I took over.

12:51.609 --> 12:53.234
The clearance rate is a running total.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.028
It doesn't matter
who was in the lieutenant's position.

12:55.446 --> 12:57.739
If it doesn't fucking matter,
then what was that in there?

12:57.865 --> 12:58.948
Cos it felt personal.

12:59.033 --> 13:01.951
That was my first COMPSTAT hearing,
as a captain.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.875
So you were just as nervous as I was.

13:08.959 --> 13:10.251
But it has to be a fuckload easier

13:10.377 --> 13:12.796
to sit there and listen to stats
than it is to present them.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.756
It is. But as your captain,

13:14.882 --> 13:17.217
they're my stats, too,
so they have to be accurate.

13:17.885 --> 13:20.970
My numbers are lousy.
Makes me feel lousy.

13:21.055 --> 13:24.224
That's why I like COMPSTAT.
It's just numbers.

13:29.063 --> 13:30.647
Look, I don't know what happened
between you and Quinn,

13:32.107 --> 13:34.567
but I lost a relationship
because of this job,

13:34.652 --> 13:39.239
and I take great comfort
in the pure objectivity of numbers.

13:40.324 --> 13:44.118
At COMPSTAT, there's no age,
no gender, no feelings.

13:44.578 --> 13:45.787
Improve your numbers,

13:45.913 --> 13:47.455
and everything will change.
I promise you.

13:47.790 --> 13:51.000
And if you don't catch DDK,
you will crash and burn.

14:08.769 --> 14:11.271
Hey, bro, I got your message.

14:11.313 --> 14:15.191
I know this is a tough time for you,
so take today off.

14:15.276 --> 14:17.485
But please don't take four.

14:17.611 --> 14:20.113
What's left of my ass just got handed
to me on a paper plate

14:20.155 --> 14:21.948
at the COMPSTAT hearing.

14:22.032 --> 14:25.118
DDK is either gonna make my career
or end it.

14:25.703 --> 14:27.453
I need your help.

14:55.524 --> 14:57.400
She's cute.

14:59.653 --> 15:01.195
No. I keep telling you no.

15:01.488 --> 15:03.531
Go talk to her, Dexter.

15:03.657 --> 15:04.824
I told you

15:06.035 --> 15:07.493
I don't like fucking
when your mom's home.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.747
Register's over here. I gotta go.

15:15.544 --> 15:16.753
Smile, Dexter.

15:20.007 --> 15:21.049
You know, if it's any consolation,

15:21.175 --> 15:23.009
I think boundaries are good
in a relationship.

15:23.093 --> 15:24.218
Is that right?

15:24.345 --> 15:25.929
Let's do her.

15:26.513 --> 15:28.222
I, for example,
would never fuck anyone

15:28.349 --> 15:29.557
if my mom were home.

15:29.683 --> 15:31.434
Or I should say
if my adoptive mother were home.

15:31.518 --> 15:34.020
I could never have fucked anyone
if my actual mother were home,

15:34.063 --> 15:36.064
cos she was murdered in front of me
when I was three.

15:37.024 --> 15:38.399
Is that right?

15:40.778 --> 15:42.737
I don't see any mothers around here.
Do you?

15:55.376 --> 15:56.751
That was...

15:57.378 --> 15:58.711
Thanks.

15:59.713 --> 16:03.257
Wouldn't it have been more fun
to kill her than fuck her?

16:04.885 --> 16:06.719
I got what I wanted.

16:15.479 --> 16:16.729
Right through the "O".

16:22.778 --> 16:23.903
I don't even like guns.

16:23.946 --> 16:25.989
Faster! Let's go faster!

16:32.079 --> 16:35.164
Try different targets.
Something more familiar.

16:44.925 --> 16:47.969
Gospel Hour is happy
to welcome Pastor Bill O'Connor

16:48.095 --> 16:50.930
of Kearney's
First United Methodist Church.

16:50.973 --> 16:53.141
He will command his angels,
concerning you,

16:53.267 --> 16:55.309
and they will lift you up
in their hands,

16:55.394 --> 16:58.271
so that you will not strike
your foot against a stone.

17:08.490 --> 17:11.284
A twister would do this town a favour.

17:14.705 --> 17:17.373
Stay here.
I want to talk to Jonah face-to-face.

17:54.995 --> 17:56.162
Hello, Dexter Morgan.

17:59.166 --> 18:00.541
After Rita Morgan died,

18:00.667 --> 18:04.170
Kyle Butler's face was all over
the news as her grieving husband.

18:05.005 --> 18:09.008
That's when we realised Kyle Butler
was really Dexter Morgan.

18:09.426 --> 18:11.594
No one connected the dots for the FBI.

18:11.762 --> 18:13.846
We talked about it,

18:14.681 --> 18:17.850
but decided as a family
that you tried to help us.

18:18.727 --> 18:20.895
So we tried to help you.

18:22.856 --> 18:25.775
But why did you lie
about who you were?

18:27.444 --> 18:29.028
I was trying to protect my family.

18:30.447 --> 18:32.573
I suspected your dad
was the Trinity Killer.

18:32.699 --> 18:35.952
I thought I could bring him to justice

18:37.121 --> 18:39.205
before he killed again.

18:41.208 --> 18:44.418
I wanted to be a hero. It was stupid,

18:44.545 --> 18:46.045
and selfish.

18:47.631 --> 18:49.257
That's what got Rita killed.

18:49.466 --> 18:51.968
Then my father ruined both our lives.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.387
What happened here, Jonah?

18:56.932 --> 18:58.141
What I really think happened?

18:58.225 --> 18:59.559
This I want to hear.

19:00.227 --> 19:04.272
My mom probably called him
at some point asking for money,

19:04.940 --> 19:06.774
making it easy for him to find us.

19:07.234 --> 19:09.694
- Did you see your father?
- Yeah.

19:10.821 --> 19:13.156
I mean, I heard him before I saw him

19:14.324 --> 19:16.617
fighting with my mom
at the top of the stairs.

19:16.702 --> 19:19.370
And I came in, and he looked at me.

19:20.747 --> 19:23.457
Then he pushed her down the stairs
like he wanted me to see.

19:24.668 --> 19:27.211
Then he started hitting her
with my hockey stick,

19:27.296 --> 19:30.298
and I grabbed it and fought him off.
He ran.

19:32.759 --> 19:34.177
I went to my mom and...

19:37.139 --> 19:41.017
Then I went upstairs,
and that's when I found Becca.

19:42.853 --> 19:44.061
What a performance.

19:44.313 --> 19:45.438
Jonah, I'm sorry.

19:45.898 --> 19:47.148
You're sorry?

19:47.608 --> 19:49.192
For your loss.

19:51.653 --> 19:53.821
Yeah, well,
I'm sorry for your loss, too.

19:55.741 --> 19:59.076
Now, is that why you came
all the way out here? To tell me that?

20:01.914 --> 20:03.831
I just wanted to see
how you were holding up.

20:05.250 --> 20:06.334
I'm gonna be OK.

20:11.423 --> 20:14.091
Go back to Miami. It's over.

20:17.512 --> 20:19.597
I'd say the fun is just beginning.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.687
LT.

20:27.272 --> 20:29.607
The unis took a statement
from a woman at St Joseph's.

20:29.691 --> 20:31.234
Says she was chained up for a few days

20:31.318 --> 20:32.610
by someone called "the Professor".

20:33.320 --> 20:34.654
Was her name Mary Ann or Ginger?

20:34.863 --> 20:36.864
No, it's Holly.

20:40.827 --> 20:43.746
One of them kept
calling the other "Professor".

20:44.289 --> 20:47.250
But I didn't see either of them.
I was blindfolded.

20:47.501 --> 20:48.626
There were two of them?

20:48.710 --> 20:50.586
The younger guy is the one
who let me go.

20:50.837 --> 20:53.881
I sort of could tell
that he was the weaker of the two.

20:54.132 --> 20:56.884
The younger guy said...
He kept calling me...

20:57.803 --> 20:59.595
Holly, you're safe.

21:00.555 --> 21:01.639
What did he call you?

21:03.433 --> 21:04.600
The whore.

21:04.685 --> 21:07.270
They didn't touch me,
except when they chained me.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.231
And the Professor, I think,

21:10.357 --> 21:14.360
would jam his knee behind my neck

21:15.612 --> 21:19.782
and hold my head,
so that I couldn't close my mouth.

21:20.284 --> 21:22.034
And then he would pour this stuff
into it.

21:22.369 --> 21:25.037
And the younger guy kept
saying that he was sorry,

21:25.122 --> 21:26.747
so sorry for doing this to me.

21:26.832 --> 21:28.124
What'd they make you drink?

21:28.834 --> 21:31.252
It was cold and it made me puke.

21:31.586 --> 21:32.962
It tasted like metal.

21:33.630 --> 21:34.922
I think it was blood.

21:38.176 --> 21:41.262
There's probably no way
to get a sample of that blood,

21:41.346 --> 21:43.389
but we should run it all past Dexter.

21:43.598 --> 21:45.558
Jamie said she was watching Harrison
for a few days.

21:45.767 --> 21:49.437
Yeah, Dex said he needed a break,
so he just took off.

21:49.521 --> 21:50.604
I get that.

21:50.689 --> 21:52.023
Did Jamie mention where he was going?

21:52.107 --> 21:54.025
No, but it was part
of a larger conversation

21:54.109 --> 21:56.193
about a date she has with Louis.

21:56.737 --> 21:58.654
- Masuka's intern?
- Yeah. She met him at your party.

21:59.031 --> 22:00.323
Let me get this straight.

22:00.615 --> 22:02.700
The guy who is Masuka's tool
all day long

22:02.784 --> 22:04.368
is gonna be sexing up your sister?

22:04.870 --> 22:06.120
When you get a hold of Dexter,
find me.

22:06.413 --> 22:09.081
...for the Knights of Columbus
Demolition Derby.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.375
Make sure you stop by
and give Doc a big hello.

22:13.670 --> 22:15.629
Debra, Debra, Debra.

22:16.173 --> 22:17.673
Is she really worth it, Dexter?

22:19.426 --> 22:21.927
What is it with you and her?

22:22.721 --> 22:24.555
I feel like I ran over a nail
or something.

22:26.266 --> 22:27.641
Let's pull over.

22:27.726 --> 22:29.685
We need to find a base camp, anyway.

22:33.690 --> 22:34.899
This looks good.

23:01.385 --> 23:03.886
And if I can just get your signature
right there.

23:05.972 --> 23:07.223
Keep that pen if you want.

23:09.017 --> 23:10.810
That'll be $39. Please, and thank you.

23:15.107 --> 23:17.483
I saw from your plates
that you're from Florida.

23:18.151 --> 23:19.318
Must be happy to get out of there.

23:19.736 --> 23:22.154
From what I see on the news,
that Miami is a real sewer.

23:23.657 --> 23:25.658
And now, whatever the hell
is going on down there.

23:25.784 --> 23:27.326
Horses running in the streets.

23:28.328 --> 23:30.955
- People say the world is ending.
- Crazy assholes.

23:31.957 --> 23:33.666
So what brings you to these parts?

23:36.086 --> 23:37.962
I'm following the Oregon Trail.

23:38.797 --> 23:40.840
Well, so partial
to the great outdoors,

23:40.966 --> 23:42.299
what is it you do back in Florida?

23:42.968 --> 23:44.009
Landscaping.

23:44.845 --> 23:45.970
Never made any sense to me.

23:47.347 --> 23:50.015
Just hiring someone to do
what nature does naturally.

23:50.100 --> 23:52.601
This place would turn anyone
into a homicidal maniac.

23:52.686 --> 23:54.812
Can you point me
to the nearest garage? I have a flat.

23:55.522 --> 23:56.689
I can patch that for you.

23:57.482 --> 23:59.859
- You can do that?
- Yeah. We're pretty handy here.

24:00.652 --> 24:02.111
Unlike us city people.

24:03.113 --> 24:04.155
Can you patch a tyre?

24:06.283 --> 24:07.366
No, I cannot.

24:07.617 --> 24:10.369
Well, I'm happy to help. I'll give you
a good deal, too. How about 20 bucks?

24:10.829 --> 24:13.205
- Sign me up.
- It's a deal.

24:14.416 --> 24:15.916
Not a callous on that hand, is there?

24:19.421 --> 24:20.671
I wear gloves when I work.

24:23.216 --> 24:24.425
About how long do you think?

24:25.177 --> 24:27.052
It shouldn't take me
more than a while.

24:27.262 --> 24:28.888
Town's not too far
if you want to grab a bite.

24:29.014 --> 24:30.681
Just follow the road.
It'll take you directly there.

24:31.516 --> 24:32.766
I'm starving.

24:34.394 --> 24:35.728
You're welcome.

24:48.408 --> 24:49.867
Shortcut?

24:50.076 --> 24:51.619
Lead the way.

25:14.142 --> 25:16.101
It's a little pot farm.

25:17.729 --> 25:21.148
Now I see why Shady Norm
wanted us to stay on the road.

25:21.775 --> 25:24.443
Shady Norm's been a very
industrious little fellow, hasn't he?

25:26.321 --> 25:27.488
Come on, let's get out of here.

25:27.989 --> 25:29.073
Let's get lunch.

25:50.345 --> 25:51.971
"When the whore of Babylon
is revealed,

25:52.138 --> 25:53.973
"she is sitting
on a scarlet coloured beast

25:54.015 --> 25:55.140
"having seven heads."

25:55.308 --> 25:58.060
There were some pictures of this beast
in Gellar's sketch book.

25:58.144 --> 25:59.812
I blew them up a little.
Looks like a dragon.

26:00.647 --> 26:01.689
Yeah, on paper.

26:01.815 --> 26:03.983
Who knows how they'll bring it to life
in the next tableau?

26:04.150 --> 26:05.192
Listen to this.

26:05.318 --> 26:08.862
"The whore, in addition to being
arrayed in purple and scarlet,

26:08.989 --> 26:11.323
"will be drunk
with the blood of the saints."

26:11.366 --> 26:13.242
That's why they had
Holly drink the blood.

26:13.368 --> 26:14.660
Drunk on the blood of the saints?

26:14.828 --> 26:16.245
Were they making her
drink their blood?

26:16.496 --> 26:19.915
If they considered themselves saints,
the creepy fucks.

26:20.166 --> 26:22.084
And why'd the younger guy let her go?
Who is he?

26:22.335 --> 26:23.752
Probably a former student, right?

26:24.004 --> 26:25.671
I mean, he kept referring to Gellar
as "Professor".

26:26.089 --> 26:27.590
How do we get an ID on him?

26:28.008 --> 26:30.259
Well, Gellar taught at Tallahassee
for 12 years.

26:30.552 --> 26:34.888
400 students per year, 4,800 names.
2,400 if you exclude females.

26:35.015 --> 26:36.015
So if they're gonna continue,

26:36.099 --> 26:38.267
the best way for us
to stop the next murder from happening

26:38.351 --> 26:40.352
is to get a name
on Gellar's accomplice

26:40.437 --> 26:43.689
in a haystack
of 2,400 potential suspects?

26:44.065 --> 26:45.858
Fuck just isn't enough right now.

26:46.526 --> 26:47.901
2,400 is not that big a number.

26:48.028 --> 26:49.945
Yeah, unless you're talking virgins.

26:50.739 --> 26:51.780
Maybe I could be of some help.

26:52.741 --> 26:53.949
I'll work on it.

26:54.367 --> 26:57.620
I would kill myself, but it would add
to my murder total for the month.

26:57.871 --> 27:00.205
At least we're closer to catching him
than we were this morning.

27:00.582 --> 27:02.041
Yeah, I feel a lot better.

27:04.294 --> 27:05.878
Where the fuck is Dexter?

27:10.050 --> 27:12.384
I promise I won't tell anyone.

27:12.469 --> 27:13.802
Well, how do I know I can trust you?

27:17.223 --> 27:19.600
Oh, well, that kiss is a contract,
you know.

27:20.060 --> 27:21.226
- Come on.
- All right.

27:22.062 --> 27:23.228
OK, this is rough.

27:23.313 --> 27:25.064
And it's not even
a beta version, but...

27:27.275 --> 27:29.735
You totally got my brother.

27:30.403 --> 27:33.280
Even down to the way
that hat sits on his big head.

27:33.406 --> 27:34.782
Is he like the star of your game?

27:34.908 --> 27:36.742
Well, the game is
modelled on the department,

27:36.826 --> 27:40.287
so if he's the lead on a case,
then he's kind of the star. Yeah.

27:40.413 --> 27:42.122
- You're really smart.
- I know.

27:44.834 --> 27:46.251
Someone's here.

27:48.630 --> 27:50.756
- Debra?
- Hi. Where's Dexter?

27:50.924 --> 27:51.965
On a trip.

27:52.509 --> 27:53.634
Where did he go?

27:54.094 --> 27:55.344
I don't know.

27:55.762 --> 27:56.804
The Keys?

27:56.930 --> 27:58.639
His boat is still docked
at the marina.

27:58.765 --> 27:59.973
Well, maybe he took his car.

28:01.101 --> 28:03.644
- Have you tried calling him?
- About a thousand times.

28:05.313 --> 28:06.522
But not from here.

28:08.441 --> 28:10.776
If you could go somewhere else,
where would it be?

28:11.945 --> 28:13.487
I've never been to Portland.

28:13.613 --> 28:14.780
That's a little predictable, isn't it?

28:14.864 --> 28:16.490
Isn't that
where all serial killers go?

28:19.452 --> 28:21.704
Home, sweet home.
Don't answer that, Dexter.

28:22.622 --> 28:23.831
Jamie? What's wrong?

28:24.040 --> 28:26.291
Where in fucktopia are you?

28:26.459 --> 28:27.710
Deb. Hi.

28:28.628 --> 28:29.795
Did you get my messages?

28:29.963 --> 28:31.380
What's that sound?

28:31.631 --> 28:33.632
I can barely hear you.
The reception's terrible.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.551
We had a breakthrough on the DDK case.

28:36.469 --> 28:38.470
- Deb, I gotta go.
- You know,

28:39.222 --> 28:41.473
you could have asked me
before you just took off.

28:42.809 --> 28:44.351
You offered me some time off.

28:44.477 --> 28:47.146
I meant the afternoon,
not five fucking days

28:47.188 --> 28:49.481
to go wherever it is that you are!

28:50.150 --> 28:51.191
Where are you?

28:51.359 --> 28:52.735
It's, I don't know,

28:55.196 --> 28:56.238
personal.

28:56.322 --> 28:57.364
I'm your sister.

28:57.574 --> 29:00.659
Then tell my lieutenant
that I'll be back as soon as I can.

29:01.202 --> 29:02.911
I'm sorry, you're breaking up.

29:04.038 --> 29:06.165
We don't have much time.
We gotta do Jonah's now.

29:06.708 --> 29:07.750
Let's go.

29:08.168 --> 29:09.209
Goody.

29:42.952 --> 29:45.287
There it is. 1965 Walnut Street.

29:45.413 --> 29:48.624
Home of the family
formerly known as the Mitchells.

29:53.588 --> 29:55.214
You want to kill him here
or just lie in wait?

29:58.760 --> 29:59.885
Neither.

30:00.887 --> 30:02.179
Then what are we doing here?

30:03.181 --> 30:04.389
I don't know
for sure that he's guilty.

30:05.725 --> 30:07.017
Not this again.

30:07.227 --> 30:08.727
Harry's code.

30:09.020 --> 30:12.606
Tell me why it matters
if a person is good or bad.

30:12.732 --> 30:15.234
Does it make you feel better
to kill bad people?

30:15.401 --> 30:16.443
It's part of the ritual.

30:16.736 --> 30:18.737
You don't need
a justification to kill.

30:18.905 --> 30:20.280
The code is more than that.

30:20.406 --> 30:21.865
It's kept me from getting caught.

30:23.076 --> 30:24.409
It's given me a life.

30:25.078 --> 30:27.120
A life that is a big, fat lie.

30:28.414 --> 30:29.748
Just like Jonah's story.

30:31.042 --> 30:33.627
What more proof do you need
that Jonah's guilty?

30:40.885 --> 30:42.928
The FBI didn't photograph
the entire living room.

30:43.388 --> 30:45.097
Maybe Jonah made a rookie mistake.

30:47.267 --> 30:48.433
My knives!

30:50.436 --> 30:52.145
I'm guessing it's the motel gimp.

30:54.065 --> 30:55.983
Whoever it is
also took my forensic kit.

30:56.609 --> 30:58.151
Now, that I don't miss so much.

31:13.751 --> 31:14.793
It's the Midwest.

31:16.796 --> 31:18.130
Nobody locks their doors.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.445
There's no blood anywhere.

31:45.450 --> 31:46.658
Bleach.

31:47.327 --> 31:48.493
He cleaned up.

31:54.334 --> 31:56.209
Rebecca died in the bathtub upstairs.

31:58.338 --> 31:59.379
I'm bored.

32:01.674 --> 32:03.550
Why aren't we setting up a kill room?

32:06.012 --> 32:07.638
This is where Jonah would
have had to stand

32:07.680 --> 32:10.140
to make it look like
his father beat his mother to death.

32:11.809 --> 32:14.144
Try it. Take a pretend swing.

32:27.700 --> 32:29.701
Not the best clean-up job
I've ever seen.

32:30.703 --> 32:32.037
Now for the living room.

32:34.499 --> 32:35.916
This is the kitchen.

32:36.167 --> 32:38.001
I'm making a test for bleach,

32:38.044 --> 32:40.879
which I wouldn't have to do
if my forensic kit hadn't been stolen.

32:52.266 --> 32:54.434
Get the fuck out of my house.

32:56.729 --> 32:58.605
Show me where it happened, Jonah.

32:59.399 --> 33:01.942
Your father killed your mother here,
on this staircase?

33:02.110 --> 33:03.568
Police can be here in three minutes.

33:03.736 --> 33:05.445
Here is where her body was,

33:05.571 --> 33:08.740
and here is where you cleaned up
your mother's blood.

33:09.242 --> 33:10.701
You're a sick fuck, you know that?

33:10.743 --> 33:12.703
Where'd you fight your father off?
It was here, right?

33:12.745 --> 33:15.372
When you took the weapon from him
and hit him,

33:15.540 --> 33:17.249
- chasing him off?
- Yeah.

33:17.333 --> 33:20.377
- Swinging at him the whole time.
- Yeah, I was. Yeah.

33:20.545 --> 33:22.587
If that were true,
there'd be blood here on the wall,

33:22.672 --> 33:25.340
and on the ceiling here.
But there's no spatter here.

33:25.591 --> 33:27.509
Hey, that's because I cleaned it up.
Now go!

33:27.593 --> 33:29.219
- With bleach?
- Yes.

33:31.264 --> 33:32.597
Not on this wall.

33:33.099 --> 33:34.433
Because there was no blood
on this wall,

33:34.559 --> 33:36.184
because your father was never here.

33:38.062 --> 33:41.440
I know for a fact that Trinity
did not kill anyone in this house.

33:50.616 --> 33:52.242
Is that because you killed him?

33:56.122 --> 33:57.205
Yes.

33:59.417 --> 34:02.044
Just like you killed your mother
and your sister.

34:07.550 --> 34:08.592
Get him.

34:26.611 --> 34:27.903
Satisfied?

34:28.321 --> 34:29.821
Let's go set up a kill room.

34:29.947 --> 34:31.740
That's my baby brother.

34:32.909 --> 34:34.284
What about your knives, Dexter?

34:34.452 --> 34:35.827
You're gonna need them.

34:59.268 --> 35:00.644
He's in the shed.

35:10.446 --> 35:11.863
Hey, there.

35:13.199 --> 35:15.033
You're real interesting, Florida,
you know that?

35:16.202 --> 35:20.205
All these potions and solutions
in this kit I found in your car.

35:20.706 --> 35:21.832
And these knives of yours.

35:24.043 --> 35:26.211
They ain't exactly
landscaping tools now, are they?

35:29.006 --> 35:30.132
I'd like them back.

35:30.216 --> 35:33.385
I know you saw what I was growing
out there in that cornfield.

35:33.553 --> 35:34.719
You know what's going on here.

35:34.804 --> 35:36.555
- I don't care about that.
- Really?

35:37.181 --> 35:38.223
Then what are you doing here?

35:39.350 --> 35:41.059
You obviously have
some sort of desk job.

35:41.144 --> 35:43.019
Those hands of yours are so smooth.

35:43.563 --> 35:46.731
You with the DEA, ATF, FBI?

35:47.024 --> 35:48.400
Why don't you put the knife down
and we can talk?

35:48.901 --> 35:49.901
What are they worth to you?

35:51.362 --> 35:54.364
I can see you have some money
by that fancy car of yours.

35:55.074 --> 35:56.158
It's a rental.

35:56.325 --> 35:58.326
This is not how I was hoping
our first kill would be.

35:58.828 --> 36:00.912
I should think
knives like those of yours

36:00.997 --> 36:05.333
would be worth $10,000 to you.

36:05.501 --> 36:07.252
This guy is leaving you no choice.

36:07.420 --> 36:09.212
He's gonna kill you
if you don't kill him first.

36:09.255 --> 36:11.923
So I pay you $10,000,
you forget you ever saw me?

36:12.049 --> 36:13.258
You can have your knives back.

36:13.759 --> 36:16.845
I'll go find an ATM,
but I'm taking these with me.

36:17.013 --> 36:18.680
I found this in your car, too.

36:20.474 --> 36:22.142
$10,000.

36:22.226 --> 36:23.852
Please, and thank you.

36:24.729 --> 36:25.854
Or you're a dead man.

36:51.964 --> 36:54.674
At last, a kill!

36:55.468 --> 36:58.303
No lengthy vetting process,
no stalking.

36:58.387 --> 37:00.096
One could argue self-defence, maybe.

37:00.765 --> 37:02.641
A little too much talking
for my taste.

37:02.767 --> 37:03.892
Did you see his eyes?

37:05.228 --> 37:06.436
Yes.

37:07.104 --> 37:09.105
Why do you wake up your victims
when they're on the table?

37:11.359 --> 37:12.734
I want them to know what they've done.

37:12.818 --> 37:13.860
Bullshit!

37:15.112 --> 37:17.322
You like to watch the light
go out of their eyes.

37:18.616 --> 37:21.034
Doesn't make a bit of difference
if they're guilty or not.

37:24.330 --> 37:26.039
How do you feel?

37:29.168 --> 37:31.044
Like anything is possible.

37:32.129 --> 37:34.756
This is the life
I've always wanted for you.

37:37.468 --> 37:38.843
Where do we go from here?

37:40.763 --> 37:41.805
Jonah.

37:43.015 --> 37:44.557
And then what, Dexter?

37:46.018 --> 37:47.310
And then

37:49.313 --> 37:50.647
we keep going.

37:54.318 --> 37:55.652
But first things first.

37:57.446 --> 37:59.906
How do you dispose of a body
when you're miles from an ocean?

38:00.116 --> 38:02.867
Norm's a thief,
a pot-grower and an asshole,

38:02.952 --> 38:05.287
any one of which
would explain his death.

38:05.413 --> 38:06.830
You can just
leave his body out in the open.

38:12.503 --> 38:13.712
I have a better idea.

38:25.224 --> 38:26.599
I hope you took a souvenir.

39:16.817 --> 39:19.736
It's nice to see you, Travis.
I thought you were done with me.

39:22.990 --> 39:25.241
These are your things.
I wanted them out of my apartment.

39:29.580 --> 39:30.872
Would have been a little bit easier

39:30.956 --> 39:33.625
if you'd just dumped them
in the trash, wouldn't it?

39:36.879 --> 39:38.546
I thought bringing them here
would give me closure.

39:41.884 --> 39:43.259
Closure.

39:44.387 --> 39:45.929
Sounds like you went
from reading the Bible

39:46.013 --> 39:47.222
to reading the self-help books.

39:47.807 --> 39:51.601
But if you really came here
because you secretly wanted me to beg,

39:51.894 --> 39:56.231
well then,
please, Travis, come back to me.

39:56.690 --> 39:58.233
I didn't come here to have you beg.

39:58.317 --> 39:59.901
How about a story, then?

40:01.070 --> 40:02.779
I read one the other day in the paper

40:02.863 --> 40:05.615
about a little girl
in California who was abducted.

40:05.991 --> 40:07.617
They went into her room,
and they grabbed her

40:07.701 --> 40:09.869
while she was asleep
next to her teddy bear.

40:09.995 --> 40:11.454
They raped her
and then they killed her,

40:11.539 --> 40:12.872
and then they dumped her
into the woods.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.833
- Don't tell me...
- There was another story

40:14.917 --> 40:18.211
about someone
who set off a bomb in Pennsylvania.

40:18.712 --> 40:22.132
Eleven people were killed, 20 maimed.

40:24.301 --> 40:28.179
That's why the world as it is
has to end.

40:28.514 --> 40:29.556
Stop talking.

40:29.640 --> 40:34.394
The sins of humankind continue
unless we put a stop to it.

40:34.478 --> 40:36.229
No, no, shut up. You shut up!

40:37.898 --> 40:39.357
Are you gonna kill me?

40:39.900 --> 40:41.860
Is that what you want to do, Travis?

40:45.531 --> 40:46.614
What I want

40:51.537 --> 40:53.246
is to be free.

41:02.590 --> 41:03.673
I'll talk to God.

41:05.259 --> 41:06.634
I release you.

41:08.262 --> 41:09.679
I can go?

41:10.473 --> 41:12.140
You know where the door is.

41:25.654 --> 41:27.530
You have no messages.

41:31.869 --> 41:33.119
You're looming.

41:36.665 --> 41:38.708
I came to apologise.

41:41.670 --> 41:45.465
I apologise
for being an asshole at your party.

41:45.966 --> 41:48.134
And for sleeping
with that professor chick.

41:48.719 --> 41:51.554
And I apologise for proposing to you.

41:54.391 --> 41:57.769
I just thought it was something
people did after a while, you know?

41:59.188 --> 42:00.355
Like buying a coffee table.

42:03.817 --> 42:06.236
- We never bought a coffee table.
- Well, we talked about it.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.279
And we couldn't talk
about getting married?

42:10.407 --> 42:13.451
We did have something good, right?
I mean, I'm not crazy, am I?

42:16.205 --> 42:17.497
Yeah.

42:19.583 --> 42:21.000
We had something good.

42:25.339 --> 42:26.714
You know, there's times
when I come home,

42:26.799 --> 42:28.883
and I still expect to see you there.

42:29.677 --> 42:32.262
And then I open up the door,

42:33.389 --> 42:35.265
and everything's so neat and clean.

42:36.016 --> 42:37.559
And it hits me all over again.

42:40.688 --> 42:41.896
You're gone.

42:47.194 --> 42:50.113
- I'm right here.
- Yeah.

42:51.198 --> 42:54.075
- In LaGuerta's office.
- Fuck, I know, right?

42:55.369 --> 42:56.578
It still feels like her office.

42:56.662 --> 42:58.496
I think that's why
I haven't unpacked anything.

42:59.081 --> 43:00.290
At all.

43:00.749 --> 43:01.958
Yeah.

43:05.004 --> 43:08.798
I wanted to tell you first
about this before anyone.

43:10.676 --> 43:12.719
- I made that difficult.
- Yeah, but

43:14.722 --> 43:18.016
you were hurt because of me.

43:20.519 --> 43:22.353
And for that, I am truly sorry.

43:24.857 --> 43:26.190
I really miss you, Deb.

43:28.694 --> 43:32.030
You, like, kept me glued or something.

43:32.072 --> 43:33.865
Sometimes I don't know what I'm doing.

43:33.907 --> 43:35.950
I feel like the last day
my life made any sense

43:36.035 --> 43:37.869
was the last day I spent with you.

43:58.265 --> 43:59.307
We can't.

44:05.564 --> 44:06.564
We're over, aren't we?

44:07.941 --> 44:10.234
Like "over" over.

44:34.301 --> 44:36.636
This is what our life together
could have been like

44:36.804 --> 44:38.096
if you hadn't have killed me.

44:42.142 --> 44:43.476
- Here's the call.
- Jonah.

44:44.603 --> 44:45.812
Hello?

44:46.271 --> 44:48.773
Dexter, can we talk about this?

44:49.358 --> 44:50.441
Sure, Jonah.

44:50.526 --> 44:53.945
Maybe somewhere private.
I was thinking the shop's closed.

44:54.279 --> 44:55.279
I'll meet you there.

44:55.989 --> 44:57.782
Jonah doesn't want to chitchat,
you know.

44:58.158 --> 44:59.200
I know.

44:59.952 --> 45:01.285
He has every reason
to want to kill me.

45:01.328 --> 45:02.954
I'm the one person
who knows what he did.

45:03.497 --> 45:05.832
Don't you just love it
when things fall into place?

45:45.497 --> 45:46.831
You shouldn't have come to Nebraska.

45:46.915 --> 45:48.541
I had to. I didn't believe it.

45:48.667 --> 45:51.335
Believe what? That I turned
into a killer like my father?

45:51.879 --> 45:53.671
Yes. I thought I set you free.

45:54.089 --> 45:55.673
Set your whole family free.

45:57.009 --> 45:58.509
I wanted to kill him myself.

45:59.762 --> 46:02.096
But you'll settle
for killing your mom and your sister?

46:02.681 --> 46:04.056
Yeah, and you.

46:08.687 --> 46:10.897
Do it, Dexter! Do it!

46:12.691 --> 46:13.900
Kill me!

46:16.528 --> 46:17.570
What did you say?

46:18.530 --> 46:19.864
Please.

46:21.408 --> 46:24.035
- You want me to kill you?
- What are you waiting for?

46:24.369 --> 46:25.953
Kill me for what I did.

46:31.710 --> 46:32.877
Tell me what happened.

46:32.920 --> 46:34.128
Who cares what happened?

46:34.213 --> 46:35.713
I didn't kill Becca.

46:37.883 --> 46:39.258
She killed herself.

46:40.594 --> 46:43.304
I found her like that in the tub,
my baby sister.

46:44.932 --> 46:47.058
God, I should have gotten her
out of that house sooner.

46:47.142 --> 46:48.434
She couldn't take it any more.

46:49.728 --> 46:51.270
- Take what?
- Dexter?

46:51.730 --> 46:52.730
My mom.

46:54.399 --> 46:58.069
How she just...
She blamed us for everything he did.

46:58.904 --> 47:00.655
She just...
She was still in love with him.

47:00.739 --> 47:02.281
She kept defending him.

47:03.951 --> 47:08.120
She just wished he would come and
whisk her away to Thailand or Mexico.

47:09.081 --> 47:10.414
Then I found Becca.

47:12.167 --> 47:14.836
And I just... I exploded on Mom.

47:14.920 --> 47:19.257
I kept hitting her over and over,
just like Dad!

47:19.967 --> 47:21.843
I'm my father's son!

47:22.261 --> 47:24.178
Time to put him down, Dexter.

47:32.604 --> 47:35.606
You brought me here to provoke
a fight, hoping I would kill you.

47:35.774 --> 47:39.151
Death by Dexter. Fantastic idea!

47:39.278 --> 47:40.278
Kill him!

47:45.951 --> 47:47.159
What if this were my son?

47:47.286 --> 47:49.370
We have come so far.

47:49.454 --> 47:50.663
He's not a monster.

47:50.956 --> 47:52.957
Don't you want to see
the light in his eyes go out?

47:54.293 --> 47:55.293
No.

47:55.794 --> 47:59.964
- Think how good it will feel.
- He has a conscience.

48:00.299 --> 48:01.716
And regret.

48:02.134 --> 48:05.636
This is the wishy-washy part of you
I can't stand.

48:07.389 --> 48:08.890
Biney's mad.

48:12.311 --> 48:14.228
This is like Debra all over again.

48:15.230 --> 48:16.314
You're weak.

48:20.652 --> 48:21.986
I'm stronger than you.

48:24.489 --> 48:26.073
We had a plan, Dexter.

48:26.199 --> 48:27.325
Just you and me.

48:28.493 --> 48:29.994
I'm going home.

48:36.877 --> 48:39.003
- Baby brother.
- Wait!

48:40.339 --> 48:42.673
How am I supposed to live with this?

48:46.678 --> 48:47.845
Forgive yourself.

48:58.398 --> 49:00.399
Have you been a good girl,
Debra Morgan?

49:00.525 --> 49:02.735
Because it's about to be Christmas.

49:03.028 --> 49:04.028
Show her, Louis.

49:04.112 --> 49:06.113
I created a programme
that cross-referenced

49:06.198 --> 49:09.742
former students of Gellar with people
living in a 20-mile radius of Miami.

49:09.868 --> 49:12.203
- I excluded a few variables.
- And presto!

49:12.245 --> 49:14.205
- Two hundred names.
- It was that easy?

49:14.373 --> 49:16.958
- But not all that legal.
- Not a problemo.

49:17.042 --> 49:19.460
Louis Greene is not
an employee of Miami Metro,

49:19.628 --> 49:21.045
just an unpaid intern.

49:23.382 --> 49:24.799
Thank you.

49:24.925 --> 49:26.217
I think.

49:26.718 --> 49:28.219
Here to serve.

49:36.228 --> 49:38.562
If you want a ride to work,
I'm leaving in seven minutes.

49:39.147 --> 49:41.232
- Not six?
- Not eight.

49:42.567 --> 49:43.901
I'll be ready.

50:05.590 --> 50:08.801
Brother Sam believed
light can keep darkness at bay.

50:10.595 --> 50:12.430
But I wonder if darkness
is defined by light.

50:13.932 --> 50:15.933
If so,
darkness can't exist on its own.

50:19.604 --> 50:22.606
There must, by definition,
be light somewhere,

50:24.026 --> 50:25.359
waiting to be found.

50:35.287 --> 50:36.287
Welcome home, Son.
