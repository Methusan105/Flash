WEBVTT

00:09.389 --> 00:10.806
Previously on Dexter...

00:11.141 --> 00:12.933
That takes us to the snakes killing.

00:13.018 --> 00:14.977
Maybe Brother Sam
was right about our victim.

00:15.353 --> 00:16.437
Is this what I think it is?

00:16.688 --> 00:19.064
Evidence from
the Ice Truck Killer investigation.

00:25.488 --> 00:26.864
You think that my becoming Lieutenant

00:26.948 --> 00:28.866
had anything to do
with what happened between us?

00:28.950 --> 00:31.577
No, I'm sure it was just
a big fucking coincidence.

00:32.078 --> 00:33.203
I don't know how to act.

00:33.288 --> 00:35.039
I don't know what to do.
I don't know who to hire.

00:35.123 --> 00:37.374
Deb, you're too smart to think
that this was gonna be easy.

00:37.792 --> 00:40.419
I put my ass on the line
even considering you,

00:40.920 --> 00:42.379
so stow the attitude.

00:44.966 --> 00:46.467
Are you going to be saved?

00:46.551 --> 00:48.510
- It's up to you.
- Yes, please!

00:48.595 --> 00:52.806
Dear God, cleanse me of all my sins.

00:54.100 --> 00:55.267
He's ready.

02:54.345 --> 02:56.180
Do you undertake
to keep God's commandments

02:56.264 --> 02:58.307
and the faith of his son, our Lord?

02:58.391 --> 02:59.474
I do.

02:59.559 --> 03:02.686
Some people think that religion
began as a way for primitive cultures

03:02.770 --> 03:05.105
to explain natural phenomenon,

03:05.440 --> 03:07.691
the fire, the wind, the rain.

03:08.318 --> 03:10.194
They created a God for each one.

03:11.112 --> 03:13.155
I baptise you, my brother, in Christ.

03:13.656 --> 03:15.115
You are baptised with Christ in death.

03:15.950 --> 03:18.202
You'd think science
would have made religion obsolete.

03:19.621 --> 03:20.662
But it hasn't.

03:26.920 --> 03:28.462
Go for a swim,

03:29.255 --> 03:30.797
come out a new man.

03:31.716 --> 03:34.176
If only I believed
it were that simple.

03:36.512 --> 03:40.474
But Brother Sam believes,
and because of that, he's fulfilled.

03:43.269 --> 03:44.937
It's written all over his face.

04:00.161 --> 04:01.703
That's my son, Harrison.

04:02.830 --> 04:03.956
Can you say hi?

04:06.584 --> 04:07.668
Guess not.

04:08.127 --> 04:09.461
It's all right.

04:10.672 --> 04:13.131
Did you see Nick?
He wanted to thank you for coming by.

04:13.258 --> 04:17.511
Yeah, he can thank me tomorrow
at the shop when I bring my car in.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.346
What? You had another accident?

04:19.764 --> 04:20.931
Bad driving karma.

04:21.599 --> 04:24.101
Man, somebody trying to tell you
to slow down, brother.

04:25.561 --> 04:26.728
So what'd you think?

04:29.023 --> 04:30.774
It was interesting.

04:31.776 --> 04:33.485
Don't get me wrong.
The spiritual stuff,

04:33.569 --> 04:35.862
the second chances,
I think it's great.

04:35.989 --> 04:37.322
For Nick.

04:38.074 --> 04:39.116
But not for you, huh?

04:42.328 --> 04:43.662
I get it.

04:44.289 --> 04:46.665
You take a dunk in the bay,
you fix all your problems.

04:46.874 --> 04:48.375
It probably sounds
like bullshit to you.

04:48.876 --> 04:50.419
That's one word for it.

04:50.503 --> 04:52.170
But, you know,
it's not about the dunk.

04:52.755 --> 04:56.967
It's about, surrender to something
greater than yourself.

04:57.635 --> 05:00.012
- I don't get it.
- Man, just look around.

05:02.056 --> 05:03.765
You think you make the sun
come up in the morning?

05:03.850 --> 05:05.559
You think you can make
the tide come in?

05:05.685 --> 05:08.478
No, but that's the Earth rotating
on its axis, the pull of the moon.

05:08.688 --> 05:11.273
So you do believe
in something greater than yourself.

05:19.741 --> 05:22.367
- Got to go. Work.
- OK.

05:23.119 --> 05:24.411
Harrison, get the car.

05:24.537 --> 05:27.080
Yeah, somebody
got to do the driving with him.

05:31.919 --> 05:32.961
Go ahead.

05:41.888 --> 05:44.014
Jesus Christ!

06:01.616 --> 06:03.367
What's with the wicked rodeo?

06:04.118 --> 06:05.702
Your guess is as good as mine.

06:06.412 --> 06:08.663
Some sick fuck sewed
body parts to mannequins

06:08.748 --> 06:10.624
and then strapped them to horses.

06:10.708 --> 06:12.250
I mean, what the fuck?

06:12.335 --> 06:15.545
Body parts?
This spectacle makes me think of...

06:15.671 --> 06:17.130
Brian, my brother.

06:17.215 --> 06:18.298
Your brother?

06:18.758 --> 06:20.592
- Rudy, the Ice Truck Killer?
- Sorry.

06:20.676 --> 06:23.178
No, it's OK. I was thinking it, too.

06:23.262 --> 06:24.971
Just the idea that someone
would put this much...

06:25.056 --> 06:27.766
- Imagination.
...brutality into killing.

06:28.101 --> 06:29.142
Come here.
I want to show you something.

06:29.435 --> 06:31.061
- Lieutenant.
- Hold on a sec.

06:33.064 --> 06:34.106
Check it out.

06:34.649 --> 06:36.608
- Lieutenant.
- I'm in the middle of something.

06:36.692 --> 06:37.734
Remember this?

06:41.906 --> 06:46.201
It's the same insignia that was carved
into the stomach of the snakes victim.

06:46.285 --> 06:47.411
Looks like a signature.

06:49.872 --> 06:51.748
Same sick fuck.
Two different killings.

06:51.833 --> 06:53.208
Hey, Lieutenant?

06:53.751 --> 06:55.085
For the love of God, what?

06:59.090 --> 07:00.257
Right.

07:01.050 --> 07:02.300
One at a time. Go.

07:02.385 --> 07:04.052
Been calling around the local stables.

07:04.137 --> 07:06.096
There's one about a mile
north from here,

07:06.180 --> 07:08.056
reported four horses missing
two days ago.

07:08.599 --> 07:10.183
- Quinn?
- Mounted patrol's on the way.

07:10.268 --> 07:11.435
They'll be here within the hour.

07:11.519 --> 07:13.854
I've been counting the body parts
and typing the blood,

07:13.938 --> 07:14.980
and it's all B-positive.

07:15.064 --> 07:17.065
So I think we're looking
at one victim here.

07:17.150 --> 07:19.484
Jesus. Somebody
went to a lot of trouble.

07:20.278 --> 07:21.570
He's trying to tell us something.

07:21.863 --> 07:23.947
Yeah. "I'm a crazy piece of shit."

07:24.699 --> 07:26.867
He's saying,
"It's the end of the world."

07:27.368 --> 07:28.410
Something like that.

07:28.870 --> 07:32.706
Four horsemen of the Apocalypse,
white, red, pale, and black.

07:32.957 --> 07:34.332
Doesn't take a genius
to figure it out.

07:34.625 --> 07:35.667
And who are you?

07:35.751 --> 07:38.128
I'm sorry.
This is Mike Anderson from Chicago.

07:38.212 --> 07:41.465
He's my replacement.
Mike, this is everyone.

07:41.549 --> 07:42.591
You were saying?

07:42.675 --> 07:45.677
The killer's showing us a scene
from the Book of Revelation.

07:45.761 --> 07:47.179
A killer with faith?

07:49.307 --> 07:50.682
- Damn, it's hot out here.
- Yeah.

07:50.766 --> 07:52.225
It's Miami, genius.

07:53.186 --> 07:55.312
- What about snakes?
- What about them?

07:55.730 --> 07:58.064
Seven snakes. Any mention of them
in the Book of Revelation?

07:58.566 --> 08:00.400
- Don't know. I'll look into it.
- Do that.

08:01.277 --> 08:02.861
In the meantime, you two,
go to the stable.

08:02.945 --> 08:05.155
See if a surveillance tape
will give us a suspect.

08:05.281 --> 08:07.115
Dexter, Masuka,
take shots of the horses

08:07.200 --> 08:08.742
so we can start
taking this shit apart.

08:10.745 --> 08:13.413
Whoever did this
seems to be a member of my tribe.

08:15.541 --> 08:17.792
But this is a horse
of a different colour.

08:20.421 --> 08:21.671
What is this?

08:29.847 --> 08:33.099
Masuka confirmed that the body parts
all belong to the same victim.

08:33.392 --> 08:35.769
We got an ID off the fingerprints,
Nathan Roberts.

08:36.771 --> 08:39.397
Went for a jog a couple of days ago,
never came back.

08:39.690 --> 08:41.566
Did you compare the kill wound
against the snakes victim?

08:41.859 --> 08:43.318
- I did.
- And?

08:44.237 --> 08:45.403
It's a perfect match.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.406
Same signature, same kill wound.

08:48.491 --> 08:49.616
Same killer.

08:50.076 --> 08:54.037
The ME's report
said there was residue in the wound.

08:54.413 --> 08:56.998
It's being processed. We should
have it back at the lab later today.

08:57.333 --> 08:58.833
Any ideas for a murder weapon?

08:59.544 --> 09:01.169
Some kind of stabbing implement.

09:01.254 --> 09:04.297
Won't know for sure until we get
the ME's measurements of the wound.

09:04.632 --> 09:06.007
What about the cuts on the body?

09:07.468 --> 09:10.011
I'm guessing a bone saw.

09:17.687 --> 09:19.854
What do we have here?

09:35.329 --> 09:37.747
1242.

09:37.832 --> 09:39.457
- What is it?
- I don't know.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.835
- Some kind of message.
- Another one?

09:42.962 --> 09:44.754
Jesus! How much
does this fucker have to say?

09:46.132 --> 09:48.091
A lot, apparently.

09:50.636 --> 09:53.346
Want to bet he left one
on the snakes victim, too?

09:55.349 --> 09:57.267
Nothing behind his eyes.

09:57.768 --> 09:59.144
What about the mouth or the ears?

09:59.228 --> 10:00.604
Already checked.

10:01.606 --> 10:02.647
What are we missing?

10:04.900 --> 10:06.818
We're not. It's what he's missing.

10:08.321 --> 10:10.030
His intestines.

10:17.705 --> 10:20.123
Kind of reminds me of
looking for the prize in a cereal box.

10:20.207 --> 10:22.000
You were always good at that, too.

10:23.419 --> 10:24.461
Jackpot!

10:26.130 --> 10:29.174
1237, 1242.
What do you think it means?

10:29.800 --> 10:32.552
That I've been lieutenant
for less than a week

10:32.637 --> 10:35.263
and there's already some game-playing,

10:35.348 --> 10:37.474
sick-as-fuck serial killer
for me to catch?

10:37.683 --> 10:38.892
Technically, he's not a serial killer.

10:40.519 --> 10:41.811
Yet.

10:41.896 --> 10:45.023
Serial killing involves
the murder of several people

10:45.107 --> 10:47.609
in three or more separate events.

10:47.693 --> 10:48.985
So far our guy's only done two.

10:49.195 --> 10:51.112
Are you trying to make me
feel better or worse?

10:52.239 --> 10:53.448
Sorry.

10:57.244 --> 10:58.662
It's Jamie.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.038
Hey, everything OK?

11:00.122 --> 11:02.248
Harrison isn't feeling so great.

11:02.541 --> 11:04.709
- What happened?
- I don't know.

11:04.877 --> 11:07.087
He didn't... He didn't eat breakfast.

11:07.254 --> 11:10.006
But, I mean, he seems OK otherwise.

11:10.091 --> 11:14.094
Just a little tired. I don't know.
Maybe it's a tummy ache, or...

11:14.178 --> 11:15.720
Should I cancel his play-date?

11:15.805 --> 11:18.348
Yeah, absolutely.
It's better to be safe than sorry.

11:18.432 --> 11:19.724
- OK.
- If he gets any worse...

11:19.809 --> 11:21.810
I'll call you. I promise.

11:26.273 --> 11:27.607
You wanted to see me?

11:27.692 --> 11:30.318
Yeah, this four horsemen case,
it's all over the news.

11:30.403 --> 11:31.444
We need to address the press.

11:31.904 --> 11:33.279
Already two steps ahead of you.

11:33.364 --> 11:35.240
I called a conference
for this afternoon,

11:35.324 --> 11:37.701
- and I'm working on a statement.
- Morgan's gonna make the statement.

11:38.994 --> 11:40.328
But she doesn't have any experience.

11:41.163 --> 11:43.206
I've led hundreds
of press conferences,

11:43.332 --> 11:44.791
and, really,
under the circumstances...

11:44.875 --> 11:47.127
Morgan is the new face
of this department, Maria.

11:47.420 --> 11:48.753
- I'm still...
- The old face.

11:50.256 --> 11:51.923
Now, set it up for tomorrow afternoon.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.009
Fine.

11:59.098 --> 12:01.307
Why the fuck
would I lead a press conference?

12:01.726 --> 12:04.310
- Isn't that your thing?
- Usually, yes.

12:04.395 --> 12:07.856
But I made a strategic decision
to put you in the spotlight.

12:07.940 --> 12:10.650
You'll give the public the impression
that the situation's less critical.

12:10.735 --> 12:15.697
Besides, dealing with the press
is your responsibility as lieutenant.

12:15.781 --> 12:16.823
I thought my responsibility

12:16.907 --> 12:18.867
was catching the horse fucker
that's killing people.

12:19.118 --> 12:21.995
You'll have to learn to multitask.
And while you're at it,

12:22.079 --> 12:24.330
you still haven't finished
your fit-for-duty therapy.

12:25.458 --> 12:26.791
The shooting was over two weeks ago.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.293
How am I supposed to find time
to go to a therapist?

12:28.377 --> 12:30.253
Figure it out.

12:31.297 --> 12:33.047
You're a liability
until you get cleared.

12:36.927 --> 12:38.636
Fucking nightmare.

12:42.933 --> 12:43.975
You OK?

12:45.686 --> 12:46.853
Obviously.

12:48.564 --> 12:51.149
You'll be fine. Just...

12:52.651 --> 12:54.027
Never mind. Not my place.

12:55.404 --> 12:57.071
What? Tell me.

12:58.115 --> 13:00.200
You just might want to

13:01.577 --> 13:05.997
dress a little more professional.
Like a lieutenant.

13:07.416 --> 13:09.834
I mean, you know, skirt suit, heels.

13:10.419 --> 13:11.920
What's wrong with the way I dress?

13:12.630 --> 13:13.963
I mean,
you kind of look like you're...

13:14.048 --> 13:15.507
What?

13:15.591 --> 13:16.674
A detective?

13:17.551 --> 13:19.093
No, like you're going to a hoedown.

13:23.891 --> 13:25.308
Where should I put
the medical examiner's report

13:25.392 --> 13:27.644
- for the four horsemen's case?
- Wherever.

13:28.187 --> 13:29.229
You busy later?

13:30.022 --> 13:31.648
Thought we could have our second date.

13:31.732 --> 13:34.025
Sure, I have roller derby practise
until 9:00,

13:34.109 --> 13:35.401
but we can totally hang after.

13:35.486 --> 13:37.821
Wait, wait, wait.
You're a... You're a derby girl?

13:38.239 --> 13:39.489
Got the bruises to prove it.

13:39.990 --> 13:41.199
I think my head just exploded.

13:42.785 --> 13:43.868
I have an idea.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.413
Why don't we have
our second date right now?

13:47.665 --> 13:48.915
What are you thinking?

13:48.999 --> 13:50.959
Little make-out session
in the women's bathroom?

13:51.377 --> 13:54.838
I was thinking some show-and-tell
in the evidence room?

13:54.922 --> 13:56.089
Even better.

13:57.216 --> 13:58.258
Not the dirty kind.

13:59.385 --> 14:03.263
You know, showing me the
Ice Truck Killer stuff was so cool.

14:03.430 --> 14:05.807
I was just thinking maybe
you could show me the Trinity stuff

14:05.891 --> 14:08.226
- or the Bay Harbour Butcher evidence.
- I can't.

14:08.519 --> 14:10.061
FBI has all those files...

14:10.271 --> 14:12.647
But I promise
to make it up to you later.

14:13.524 --> 14:14.941
You better.

14:15.651 --> 14:18.695
Now open the ME's report.
I'm dying to know what it says.

14:24.702 --> 14:27.662
When Brian sent messages,
they were tailor-made for me.

14:28.372 --> 14:30.707
But I should still be able
to crack this guy's code.

14:32.626 --> 14:33.918
- All right.
- Ready?

14:34.003 --> 14:35.169
Let's do this.

14:35.254 --> 14:37.714
Most of you have already
met Detective Mike Anderson.

14:37.798 --> 14:39.340
He's working on a theory
that our killer

14:39.425 --> 14:41.676
is re-enacting scenes
from the Book of Revelation.

14:42.303 --> 14:44.178
There's a lot of brutal imagery here,

14:44.263 --> 14:45.638
and our killer had
a lot to choose from.

14:45.723 --> 14:48.141
I just got the ME report
from the four horsemen vic.

14:48.225 --> 14:49.684
- Guess what it says.
- Must be pretty important

14:49.768 --> 14:50.977
for you to bust in here like this.

14:51.228 --> 14:52.562
He's a little bit of a drama queen.

14:52.646 --> 14:55.356
There were traces of oxidised iron
in the kill wound.

14:55.691 --> 14:58.902
Rust. I mean, nobody's used iron
to make weapons since the Middle Ages.

14:58.986 --> 15:02.280
Which means our killer
could have used an ancient artefact.

15:02.781 --> 15:05.617
- What kind of artefact?
- I'm not sure yet.

15:05.701 --> 15:08.036
But the dimensions of the wound
suggest a sword.

15:08.287 --> 15:10.330
But there are hundreds
of varieties of swords.

15:10.414 --> 15:12.248
Great. Stay on that.
Mike, you were saying?

15:12.333 --> 15:15.084
So far, our killer
has given us three tableaus.

15:15.169 --> 15:16.628
The intestines on the scale,

15:16.712 --> 15:18.755
the snakes victim,
and the four horsemen.

15:18.839 --> 15:21.341
I'm sorry. "Tableaus"?

15:21.508 --> 15:22.592
It's a theatrical term

15:22.676 --> 15:24.802
referring to a picturesque grouping
of people or objects.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.221
All this time, I just thought
they were called crime scenes.

15:27.306 --> 15:29.098
No, it's more than just a crime scene.

15:29.350 --> 15:31.017
Everything he's showing us
has meaning,

15:31.101 --> 15:35.229
from the positioning of the bodies
to the clothes he puts on his victims.

15:35.314 --> 15:36.814
- Nothing's by accident.
- Exactly.

15:36.899 --> 15:37.982
He's communicating with us.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.943
Mike's just helping
with the translation.

15:40.903 --> 15:44.989
The four horsemen of the Apocalypse
are described in Revelation 6,

15:45.074 --> 15:46.282
verses one through eight.

15:46.784 --> 15:49.494
As for the seven snakes murder,
Revelation 13.

15:50.245 --> 15:55.041
"And I stood upon the sand of the sea
and saw a serpent rise out of the sea,

15:55.250 --> 15:57.001
"having seven heads."

15:57.461 --> 15:58.628
And what about the intestines?

15:59.421 --> 16:02.131
There's no passage on intestines,

16:02.216 --> 16:03.883
but the scales ofjustice
are all over the Bible.

16:03.968 --> 16:06.219
I figure he's referencing
God's judgement of mankind.

16:06.512 --> 16:07.887
What about the numbers
we found on the body?

16:07.972 --> 16:09.514
1237 and 1242.

16:09.723 --> 16:11.057
Don't know.

16:11.141 --> 16:12.475
But I can get in touch
with a Revelation expert

16:12.559 --> 16:13.601
who might be able to tell us more.

16:16.897 --> 16:19.023
They happened five days apart.

16:19.817 --> 16:21.442
The two murders,
they happened five days apart.

16:21.527 --> 16:24.362
The difference between
1237 and 1242 is five.

16:24.446 --> 16:25.863
I don't know
why I didn't see it before.

16:25.948 --> 16:27.657
So the numbers are days.

16:27.741 --> 16:28.950
He's counting up to something.

16:29.034 --> 16:30.493
- To what?
- Don't know.

16:30.577 --> 16:35.331
But if all this Revelation stuff
has to do with doomsday,

16:35.416 --> 16:37.083
maybe it's to the end of the world.

16:37.418 --> 16:41.045
OK, so we're looking
for a religious nut-bag.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.214
Quinn, Batista,
round up any end-times fanatics

16:43.298 --> 16:44.340
that might have criminal records.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.844
Let's find this Doomsday Killer.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.400
It's happening, Travis.

17:02.484 --> 17:05.903
Look around us. People are afraid.

17:07.990 --> 17:10.366
Soon, you'll start to understand
what we're...

17:16.290 --> 17:18.624
Travis, are you listening to me?

17:19.001 --> 17:21.085
Yes. They're afraid.

17:21.503 --> 17:24.464
OK, I got it. She's pretty.

17:25.132 --> 17:26.340
- Who?
- The waitress.

17:26.425 --> 17:28.551
You've been staring at her.

17:29.094 --> 17:30.928
But we really have to stay focused.

17:34.141 --> 17:36.601
So you don't think
I should ask her out?

17:37.102 --> 17:39.896
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know. Maybe.

17:41.315 --> 17:43.149
- I think she likes me.
- Hey, Trav.

17:43.233 --> 17:44.734
Can I get you anything else?

17:44.818 --> 17:45.985
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

17:49.031 --> 17:50.406
Thank you.

17:54.953 --> 17:57.205
I thought religion
was supposed to be comforting.

17:57.289 --> 17:59.749
But swarms of locusts, bowls of wrath?

18:00.417 --> 18:02.251
Why would anybody
want to believe this stuff?

18:06.256 --> 18:07.381
Be honest.

18:08.300 --> 18:09.509
Professional or stupid?

18:10.177 --> 18:11.219
Professional.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.597
But you don't look much like you.

18:16.850 --> 18:19.227
You want to tell me
how I'm supposed to catch Doomsday

18:19.311 --> 18:22.522
if I'm spending all my time
writing press statements,

18:22.606 --> 18:26.317
going to court-ordered therapy
and shopping for ugly-ass clothes?

18:26.401 --> 18:28.027
You'll figure it out. You always do.

18:28.112 --> 18:30.446
Quinn used to say that
when I was in meltdown mode.

18:30.531 --> 18:32.615
He saw you in meltdown mode
and he still wanted to marry you?

18:33.575 --> 18:35.576
- Poop explosion.
- Harrison?

18:35.702 --> 18:37.537
If it's Jamie,
you've got bigger problems.

18:38.205 --> 18:40.039
Keep an eye on him
while I'm down in the laundry room?

18:40.124 --> 18:41.624
- His tummy still upset?
- Yeah.

18:41.708 --> 18:44.293
It's probably just a bug, but I can
take him to the doctor tomorrow.

18:47.131 --> 18:50.925
Hey, what's the matter, little man?
You don't feel so good?

18:54.555 --> 18:56.597
Wish I could make it all better.

19:01.228 --> 19:03.646
I guess there are some things
even daddies can't fix.

19:18.036 --> 19:20.413
So I gave you
the friends and family rate.

19:20.706 --> 19:22.999
And I can have that to you ASAP.

19:23.458 --> 19:25.042
Thanks. The sooner the better.

19:25.752 --> 19:27.795
I just want to let you know
I'm taking off, all right?

19:27.880 --> 19:29.255
All right.

19:29.631 --> 19:32.133
- Dex, what's up?
- What's up!

19:32.259 --> 19:33.467
So you headed off to class?

19:33.802 --> 19:35.469
Hey, Sam's sending me
to computer class.

19:35.554 --> 19:38.264
- Gonna build him a bomb website, yo.
- Yeah, you better.

19:38.432 --> 19:40.016
- All right. Laters.
- Be safe.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.142
See you, Nick.

19:41.935 --> 19:43.811
You really take care of these guys.

19:43.896 --> 19:46.522
Yeah, well, you know,
God's taking care of all of us.

19:47.858 --> 19:50.610
Here go your estimate. Again.

19:57.034 --> 19:58.910
- Are these your notes?
- Yeah.

20:00.662 --> 20:03.039
Every time I read it,
I'm finding something new.

20:03.207 --> 20:05.958
- You ever read it?
- Yeah, I just started, for work.

20:07.753 --> 20:09.420
We're tracking this killer.

20:09.504 --> 20:12.381
We think he's re-enacting scenes
from the Book of Revelation.

20:14.593 --> 20:17.136
That four horsemen case
from the news, yeah?

20:20.015 --> 20:21.682
Lord have mercy.

20:22.059 --> 20:25.519
Saying it's in the name of God,
the devil is busy.

20:26.730 --> 20:29.398
You think he's using God
as an excuse to kill?

20:29.733 --> 20:31.901
People use God
as an excuse for a lot of things.

20:32.361 --> 20:36.113
Just because
he believes in some crazy bullshit,

20:36.198 --> 20:38.366
that don't mean
his faith is any less real.

20:40.327 --> 20:42.370
But if faith makes people
do such crazy bullshit,

20:42.454 --> 20:43.496
what's the point of having it?

20:45.791 --> 20:48.501
It's human nature.
Gotta believe in something.

20:49.795 --> 20:51.003
Right?

20:51.296 --> 20:54.590
I mean, haven't you ever
had a problem so big

20:54.675 --> 20:56.676
that you just couldn't
handle it on your own?

20:56.760 --> 20:58.844
- Yeah.
- Well, who helped you?

21:02.099 --> 21:03.349
My dad.

21:08.855 --> 21:11.482
Well, you're lucky, you're blessed.

21:11.942 --> 21:13.109
That's a blessing.

21:15.612 --> 21:18.072
Faith, man,
you put it in the wrong things...

21:21.868 --> 21:23.077
it'll fuck you up.

21:31.586 --> 21:33.045
Goddamn pantyhose.

21:35.090 --> 21:38.217
Has anyone ever died
from crotch asphyxiation?

21:39.177 --> 21:40.553
You have now crossed the line

21:40.637 --> 21:43.097
into inappropriate
brother-sister exchanges.

21:46.226 --> 21:48.394
Is that Lieutenant Morgan in a skirt?

21:48.478 --> 21:51.272
I don't know. I don't recognise her
without the man boots.

21:51.356 --> 21:54.025
You'll recognise my foot
when it's kicking you in the face.

21:54.526 --> 21:57.987
- But the Mayan calendar says...
- The Mayans weren't Christians.

21:58.071 --> 22:01.324
Look, God told Noah that the
great flood would be in seven days.

22:01.658 --> 22:04.035
Batista and Quinn's
people of interest.

22:04.536 --> 22:08.497
Even if none of them is Doomsday,
they're all totally insane.

22:09.875 --> 22:14.503
At 9:45 yesterday morning, four horses
were released at the intersection.

22:16.423 --> 22:19.175
Lieutenant, you ready
for the press conference?

22:20.093 --> 22:21.344
Yeah. I'm just...

22:22.346 --> 22:23.637
practising my statement.

22:24.765 --> 22:26.057
You want some honest advice?

22:27.100 --> 22:28.184
I guess.

22:29.061 --> 22:31.145
Lose the speech. Just relax.

22:31.229 --> 22:33.981
Have a conversation.
You're not a formal person,

22:34.066 --> 22:36.901
so a formal statement
could come off as insincere.

22:38.904 --> 22:42.114
So you're saying
I should just be myself?

22:42.199 --> 22:43.657
Exactly.

22:44.951 --> 22:46.911
Nice shoes, by the way.

22:47.496 --> 22:50.247
- They look better on.
- Yeah, well, they hurt my feet.

22:50.624 --> 22:52.541
You know what else you could use?

23:01.718 --> 23:02.760
Nice.

23:04.846 --> 23:06.055
See you later.

23:07.265 --> 23:09.850
Brother Sam reads his Bible
like I read blood,

23:09.935 --> 23:12.228
and every time he comes away
with something new.

23:12.312 --> 23:14.021
Maybe if I want answers
about this killer,

23:14.106 --> 23:16.273
his work deserves a second look.

23:16.733 --> 23:19.985
Such aggressive, brutal cuts.
He butchered this body.

23:20.278 --> 23:22.113
But that doesn't make any sense.

23:23.115 --> 23:26.784
Not when he was so meticulous
about composing his crime scenes.

23:27.828 --> 23:31.247
The complexity of the stitching
in the belly of that fruit vendor.

23:31.331 --> 23:35.209
The attention to detail,
attaching plastic to flesh.

23:35.919 --> 23:38.337
So why would
this same fastidious craftsman

23:38.422 --> 23:40.840
so carelessly hack and slash?

23:41.174 --> 23:42.675
Unless it's not the same killer.

23:43.009 --> 23:47.221
You think one person cut up the body
and another composed the crime scene?

23:48.682 --> 23:51.976
Maybe we're not looking
for one Doomsday Killer.

23:53.311 --> 23:55.062
Maybe we're looking for two.

24:04.448 --> 24:06.365
This is Vince Masuka.

24:06.450 --> 24:08.742
Hey, I've been bounced around
to, like, five people,

24:08.869 --> 24:10.202
so I'm hoping you can help me.

24:10.287 --> 24:11.537
I can try. What you need?

24:11.872 --> 24:13.747
I'm a collector,
and there's a prosthetic hand

24:13.874 --> 24:15.749
for auction on buythistreasure. Com.

24:15.876 --> 24:18.878
Says it's from
the Ice Truck Killer investigation.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.546
- Is that real?
- What?

24:21.047 --> 24:22.756
No. Hang on a sec.

24:31.558 --> 24:33.392
No, that's... It's gotta be fake.

24:34.436 --> 24:35.895
The only people
with access to our evidence room

24:35.979 --> 24:39.440
are police employees and interns.

24:41.568 --> 24:42.735
Fuck me.

24:42.819 --> 24:45.404
So I shouldn't bid on it, or...

24:45.489 --> 24:47.281
No, definitely not.

24:49.409 --> 24:50.576
Ryan.

24:52.245 --> 24:53.245
Shit.

24:59.878 --> 25:01.670
No, no, no.

25:05.592 --> 25:06.634
What's wrong?

25:08.261 --> 25:10.971
You stole the hand
from the Ice Truck Killer evidence

25:11.139 --> 25:12.264
and sold it online?

25:13.099 --> 25:15.434
You said
it was just going to sit there.

25:15.477 --> 25:17.603
The chain of custody is sacred.

25:19.022 --> 25:20.439
I mean, did you ever stop to think
what would happen

25:20.524 --> 25:22.274
- if we ever needed to go back?
- I'm sorry.

25:23.985 --> 25:26.278
I was short on rent,
and I needed the money, so I...

25:26.321 --> 25:29.782
Are you crazy?
I mean, I could lose my job over this.

25:30.116 --> 25:31.158
No one has to know.

25:31.785 --> 25:32.868
Just...

25:34.955 --> 25:37.456
- Let me make it up to you.
- I'm such an idiot.

25:38.041 --> 25:39.208
For thinking
you were actually into me.

25:39.459 --> 25:40.668
I was.

25:43.380 --> 25:44.547
I am.

25:46.132 --> 25:48.217
Get out. We're done.

26:02.148 --> 26:04.233
And we're live in three,

26:05.068 --> 26:06.569
two, one.

26:07.279 --> 26:09.780
My detectives are interviewing
several suspects,

26:09.823 --> 26:13.325
but we won't release a name
until a suspect is officially charged.

26:13.410 --> 26:14.994
Is it true the four horsemen case

26:15.078 --> 26:17.580
is connected to the murder
of the fruit vendor, Omar Rivera?

26:19.332 --> 26:21.208
We're not here
to discuss the Rivera case.

26:21.334 --> 26:24.003
But the same alpha and omega signature
was found at both crime scenes.

26:24.087 --> 26:25.337
Isn't that right?

26:25.380 --> 26:28.173
Come on, Deb.
Don't go into meltdown mode now.

26:34.681 --> 26:36.932
Actually, yes, we believe
that's our killer's signature.

26:38.059 --> 26:40.769
So if you see something,
say something.

26:41.271 --> 26:42.688
Call the department
with any information

26:42.772 --> 26:44.356
that might help us catch this killer.

26:45.191 --> 26:46.525
We're all in this together.

26:50.030 --> 26:52.114
I'm not gonna lie to you
about this investigation,

26:52.198 --> 26:54.700
because I don't really see the point.

26:54.784 --> 26:55.868
I'm not into politics,

26:55.952 --> 26:58.579
and I don't care
about press conferences or...

26:59.122 --> 27:02.041
Or public opinion. All I care about
is catching the fucker that did this.

27:04.461 --> 27:05.628
Shit.

27:08.298 --> 27:09.715
That'll be all.

27:09.799 --> 27:10.883
Lieutenant Morgan, another question.

27:11.468 --> 27:13.052
Is it me,
or does our captain look happy

27:13.094 --> 27:14.720
our lieutenant just shit the bed?

27:14.763 --> 27:16.221
It's not you.

27:16.306 --> 27:18.223
Trust me. I used to be married to her.

27:19.559 --> 27:22.728
Hey, we got
one more nut-job to interview.

27:22.771 --> 27:26.148
This preacher, Jeremiah Allen.
So we got to make a house call.

27:26.608 --> 27:27.983
All right. Let's go.

27:30.153 --> 27:31.820
Please tell me it wasn't that bad.

27:32.113 --> 27:33.155
It was pretty bad.

27:36.451 --> 27:38.118
Is that LaGuerta's necklace?

27:39.913 --> 27:41.121
I seriously hate you right now.

27:42.457 --> 27:44.249
Deb, hold on a sec.

27:44.584 --> 27:45.793
Hello?

27:47.671 --> 27:49.088
I'll be right there.

27:49.130 --> 27:52.341
Your son's temperature's 104.
We need to get him into surgery ASAP.

27:52.425 --> 27:55.094
- His appendix is ruptured.
- What happens now?

27:55.261 --> 27:57.096
We'll do our best
to make sure he's OK.

28:00.475 --> 28:02.518
Need you to sign
that parental consent.

28:02.602 --> 28:03.769
He's gonna be OK, right?

28:03.853 --> 28:04.978
We'll do everything we can.

28:07.148 --> 28:09.191
Hey, buddy,
Daddy's gonna wait right here

28:09.275 --> 28:11.360
so the doctors
take good care of you, OK?

28:20.036 --> 28:22.329
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Sam from Good Shepherd.

28:22.414 --> 28:23.497
Your car's ready.

28:23.748 --> 28:25.541
You said you needed it ASAP,
so it's here.

28:25.625 --> 28:28.502
Yeah, can I pick it up tomorrow?
I'm at Saint Peter's with my son.

28:28.628 --> 28:31.338
- Is everything OK?
- He just went into surgery.

28:31.423 --> 28:33.215
- Do you need me to...
- I got to go.

28:39.389 --> 28:40.848
You gave us the wrong address.

28:41.391 --> 28:43.851
It was a sandwich shop.

28:43.935 --> 28:46.520
The preacher, Jeremiah Allen.

28:46.604 --> 28:49.440
He's unlisted. Fine! Call me back.

28:49.899 --> 28:52.025
Should have taken my car. Got the GPS.

28:52.694 --> 28:55.028
Just finish up your frita
so we can head back to the station.

28:55.113 --> 28:57.030
We'd already be on the way
if you let me eat in the car.

28:57.115 --> 28:59.533
No way.
You're not getting grease on Norma.

29:00.952 --> 29:02.536
What? It was my mother's name.

29:02.746 --> 29:04.246
Now I think I know
why you're divorced.

29:10.128 --> 29:11.837
Fucking waste of an afternoon.

29:12.422 --> 29:14.923
You got a little, like, cilantro
or something on your...

29:18.052 --> 29:19.261
What the fuck?

29:22.307 --> 29:23.807
Is this yours?

29:23.892 --> 29:27.019
No. It belonged to the kid
that sold me the car.

29:27.187 --> 29:29.271
I mean, the weed, the Trans Am.

29:29.355 --> 29:31.398
If you're having a mid-life crisis,
we can talk about it.

29:31.483 --> 29:34.526
I'm not having a mid-life crisis.
What's wrong with this car?

29:34.611 --> 29:36.987
- I think it's cool.
- Yeah, it's...

29:37.363 --> 29:39.490
- What are you doing?
- I'm making lemonade.

29:39.866 --> 29:42.826
Put that shit away. We're cops.
We're on-duty cops.

29:42.911 --> 29:44.036
So what?

29:44.120 --> 29:46.663
It's not like we're gonna hear back
from dispatch today anyway.

29:49.083 --> 29:50.876
I haven't smoked that shit
since I was 16.

29:51.294 --> 29:53.796
Exactly, Grandpa.
Don't you want to be cool?

29:58.218 --> 29:59.551
Give me that.

30:28.540 --> 30:33.001
I could feel hot flames
of fire roaring in my back.

30:35.088 --> 30:37.256
Dude, quit staring at me.
You're freaking me out.

30:37.674 --> 30:41.468
It's sad. I can feel how much
your heart hurts for Deb.

30:41.553 --> 30:46.223
Dude. Get your big,
fucking sausage hands off me.

30:46.307 --> 30:47.975
That's terrible.

30:50.854 --> 30:52.145
Batista.

30:56.317 --> 30:57.860
Got it. Thanks.

30:59.362 --> 31:01.113
That was dispatch.

31:02.156 --> 31:03.949
We got Jeremiah Allen's address.

31:04.033 --> 31:05.117
Jeremiah who?

31:05.201 --> 31:08.370
The guy. The dude.
The... The preacher.

31:09.581 --> 31:11.582
Right! Awesome.

31:11.833 --> 31:13.458
Where's my hat?

31:16.129 --> 31:18.547
Did you know that children
who undergo anaesthesia

31:18.631 --> 31:21.592
under the age of three are more likely
to develop learning disabilities?

31:22.719 --> 31:23.886
Are you doing research?

31:23.970 --> 31:29.474
And once the appendix bursts,
the complication rate rises to 59%.

31:29.559 --> 31:31.268
Maybe you should get off the internet.

31:36.149 --> 31:37.774
You think
we should call Astor and Cody,

31:37.859 --> 31:39.526
let them know Harrison's in surgery?

31:41.112 --> 31:42.863
No, not yet.
I don't want to worry them.

31:43.615 --> 31:45.657
Deb, is that you on TV?

31:46.701 --> 31:49.912
Or public opinion. All I care about
is catching the... that did this.

31:49.996 --> 31:51.747
Fuck.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.082
Sorry.

31:59.589 --> 32:01.256
- Dexter?
- Sam, what are you doing here?

32:02.717 --> 32:05.594
I figured if I had a son
who was going through surgery,

32:05.678 --> 32:09.222
I'd probably want
some backup, too, so...

32:09.724 --> 32:11.350
- Thanks.
- Brother Sam?

32:12.936 --> 32:14.937
You came in on the Omar Rivera case.

32:17.148 --> 32:19.107
Are you guys, like, friends now?

32:21.569 --> 32:23.820
- Yeah, well, I have the auto shop.
- Yep!

32:26.574 --> 32:29.576
I'm gonna go to the cafeteria,
see if anything's edible.

32:29.994 --> 32:31.036
Any takers?

32:31.204 --> 32:32.412
I'll browse.

32:38.086 --> 32:39.544
How you holding up?

32:40.588 --> 32:42.881
Honestly, not good. I hate not knowing

32:43.466 --> 32:45.592
if he's gonna be OK,
not being able to protect him.

32:46.135 --> 32:48.470
Sometimes you just got to surrender.

32:51.933 --> 32:54.309
I'm sorry, man.
That probably wasn't the...

32:54.435 --> 32:56.645
- It's OK.
...best thing to say.

32:57.230 --> 32:58.647
No, it's...

33:01.025 --> 33:04.403
If I was in your situation,
I would not want to hear that shit.

33:05.488 --> 33:08.031
I used to not always be like this.

33:10.910 --> 33:13.578
People used to talk to me
about God, man.

33:13.830 --> 33:15.747
Used to make me
want to punch them in their face.

33:16.165 --> 33:18.083
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

33:21.546 --> 33:23.463
I used to believe in something else.

33:25.842 --> 33:27.009
What?

33:29.303 --> 33:31.346
The same as you. My dad.

33:35.059 --> 33:37.060
Whatever, that...
That didn't work out.

33:37.145 --> 33:38.687
What happened?

33:40.273 --> 33:42.733
Hey, you got enough on your mind, man.
You don't need to...

33:44.152 --> 33:45.360
Want to hear no stories

33:45.445 --> 33:47.696
- about me and my dad.
- No, I appreciate the distraction.

33:53.327 --> 33:56.788
When I was growing up,
my dad was a real popular guy.

33:59.125 --> 34:00.917
Everybody knew him.

34:02.336 --> 34:04.713
They used to call him "Mister".

34:06.799 --> 34:10.635
He was always working,
but I never really knew what he did.

34:12.513 --> 34:14.890
So one day I asked him.
I said, "Daddy, what do you do?"

34:15.058 --> 34:18.185
He looked at me and said,
"Whatever I want, whenever I need."

34:18.853 --> 34:20.228
Like that.

34:21.606 --> 34:24.608
He said
he was going to see a friend of his.

34:26.944 --> 34:28.612
So we get there.

34:29.447 --> 34:32.657
He says, "Go on up there
and ring that doorbell for me."

34:34.035 --> 34:35.452
So I do it.

34:36.913 --> 34:39.247
And this man comes to the door.

34:40.083 --> 34:44.211
And he's staring at me,
not knowing who I am or why I'm there.

34:46.214 --> 34:49.674
And before I can turn around
and say, "I'm with Mister,"

34:52.220 --> 34:55.055
my dad is standing
right there behind me

34:55.139 --> 34:56.765
with a pistol in his hand.

34:57.809 --> 35:00.185
And he takes his pistol
and he points it at this man,

35:00.728 --> 35:03.146
and he shoots him in the face.
Killed him.

35:07.068 --> 35:08.777
Blood everywhere.

35:10.696 --> 35:12.781
All on my Superman shirt.

35:14.283 --> 35:17.202
My dad just calmly picks me up,

35:18.871 --> 35:22.582
walks to the car, drives off slowly.

35:24.043 --> 35:25.293
And he says,

35:26.629 --> 35:28.088
"You did a good job."

35:34.804 --> 35:35.929
He used you.

35:36.639 --> 35:38.515
No surprise I ended up in prison.

35:41.227 --> 35:42.561
So what changed?

35:49.068 --> 35:52.821
Well, when I first got locked up,
them first few months,

35:52.905 --> 35:56.074
I was just mad.

35:57.410 --> 36:00.704
And I just
wanted to hurt somebody, anybody.

36:04.375 --> 36:05.876
And this new guy comes in.

36:06.210 --> 36:13.175
And he's just loud and bragging,
and, "I was this, that in the street."

36:14.051 --> 36:15.927
And so I'm just looking at him.
I'm thinking to myself,

36:16.012 --> 36:20.056
"OK, when I get a chance,
I'm gonna tune this motherfucker up."

36:21.726 --> 36:24.728
So we get yard time,

36:25.563 --> 36:27.480
and I'm following him.

36:28.107 --> 36:30.358
And he goes into the chapel.

36:32.153 --> 36:33.904
I sneak up on him,

36:35.114 --> 36:37.407
and I start choking him out.

36:38.868 --> 36:40.869
I'm trying to kill him.

36:42.663 --> 36:45.373
And then I see this light.

36:48.586 --> 36:50.378
Like, figuratively, or...

36:51.339 --> 36:54.049
No, no, like, for real. Like, light.

36:54.133 --> 36:57.469
Sunlight coming through
these chapel windows, and...

36:59.889 --> 37:02.599
I could just see everything around me.

37:03.893 --> 37:07.354
I could see where I was at
and what I was doing,

37:09.273 --> 37:11.650
and I didn't want to do it no more.

37:13.402 --> 37:14.903
And you think that was God?

37:20.576 --> 37:22.327
Dexter, all I know

37:22.995 --> 37:25.372
is that when I let that man go,

37:27.583 --> 37:31.544
that I'd never felt that good
about nothing in my life.

37:37.176 --> 37:40.011
- I'm gonna grab some coffee.
- Yeah.

37:55.319 --> 37:59.698
Come on.

38:05.371 --> 38:08.456
Just let him be OK.
Please let him be OK.

38:17.425 --> 38:18.591
I don't know how this works,

38:18.676 --> 38:22.595
but if there's something
I need to do in return, I'll do it.

38:26.350 --> 38:27.392
OK?

38:52.293 --> 38:53.960
You're going out with that woman,
aren't you?

38:55.421 --> 38:56.880
Her name is Erin.

38:57.340 --> 39:00.717
If you like, I could cancel.
I could stay here with you.

39:00.801 --> 39:02.469
There's more work I could do.

39:03.262 --> 39:06.556
No, we were given free will
for a reason, Travis.

39:09.060 --> 39:10.810
You can do whatever you want.

39:13.898 --> 39:16.191
As long as you're willing to...

39:18.152 --> 39:20.904
accept the consequences God gives you.

39:27.912 --> 39:29.621
It's just dinner.

39:30.373 --> 39:32.540
I'll be back home by 10:00.

39:39.340 --> 39:40.757
Good night.

39:48.849 --> 39:51.267
And your parents, are you close?

39:52.436 --> 39:55.688
Yes, we were. They died when I was 14.

39:56.357 --> 39:58.691
- Car wreck.
- I am so sorry.

39:59.026 --> 40:00.402
That's terrible.

40:00.611 --> 40:03.571
My sister pretty much raised me
after that.

40:05.157 --> 40:06.574
Poor thing.

40:07.368 --> 40:09.494
You guys are really lucky
that you had each other.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.752
I want you, Travis.

40:21.632 --> 40:22.882
Travis.

41:07.845 --> 41:09.679
Kid's a champ.
Made it through with flying colours.

41:09.763 --> 41:10.847
Thank God.

41:12.141 --> 41:15.310
I mean, thank you.
Thank you so much, Doctor.

41:15.394 --> 41:17.687
My pleasure.
They're taking him up to recovery now.

41:17.771 --> 41:18.813
You can see him in a few minutes.

41:19.857 --> 41:21.733
I knew he'd be OK.

41:23.319 --> 41:24.944
I got to go.
Matthews wants to talk to me.

41:25.070 --> 41:27.322
Probably about the conference.
I'm totally fucked.

41:29.867 --> 41:31.451
Long day, you should go home.

41:31.535 --> 41:32.785
Are you sure? I can hang.

41:32.870 --> 41:34.829
No, go.
I'll call you if anything changes.

41:34.914 --> 41:36.831
- OK. Good night.
- Good night.

41:38.709 --> 41:40.877
Thanks for staying.
You didn't have to.

41:40.961 --> 41:44.255
Not a problem. I wanted to.
I'm glad little man is all right.

41:44.548 --> 41:46.049
Yeah, me too.

41:46.592 --> 41:48.551
I know. Thank God.

41:50.054 --> 41:51.262
That's just an expression.

41:52.431 --> 41:54.098
I know. Just,

41:54.600 --> 41:56.559
another marvel of modern science.

41:56.810 --> 41:59.270
Yeah, you put your faith in God,
I put my faith in science.

41:59.438 --> 42:02.649
It's cool. We don't have to believe
in the same thing,

42:02.733 --> 42:04.776
but you got to keep an open mind.

42:06.820 --> 42:10.281
You may say I can't prove
that God exists,

42:11.408 --> 42:12.784
but you can't prove he doesn't.

42:17.498 --> 42:19.332
You take care, Dex.

42:34.265 --> 42:35.765
Deputy Chief?

42:36.600 --> 42:38.935
Morgan, did you see the news?

42:39.311 --> 42:41.396
I been getting calls
about it all night.

42:41.480 --> 42:43.398
I did, sir. Let me just say
that I am truly, deeply...

42:43.482 --> 42:46.192
Everybody loves
my new sparkplug of a lieutenant.

42:46.986 --> 42:48.194
- They do?
- You're direct.

42:48.654 --> 42:49.696
No bullshit.

42:49.780 --> 42:51.406
Well, I was just trying
to get the community...

42:51.490 --> 42:54.284
I took a big risk
when I promoted you, Morgan.

42:54.535 --> 42:57.453
I took a lot of crap
from a lot of people.

42:58.247 --> 42:59.664
But today...

43:00.624 --> 43:02.667
today you've made me
very, very proud.

43:04.169 --> 43:06.754
Your dad would have been proud, too.

43:08.173 --> 43:09.549
Keep up the good fucking work.

43:13.220 --> 43:14.470
Thank you, sir.

43:19.351 --> 43:20.476
Hey.

43:21.812 --> 43:24.147
Which one of you characters
drives a Firebird?

43:24.773 --> 43:26.190
Crockett or Tubbs?

43:27.735 --> 43:28.818
You park like a dick.

43:32.865 --> 43:35.908
You guys want to go in my office,
tell me what you've been up to?

43:37.620 --> 43:38.786
Well, we'll be right in.

43:38.871 --> 43:41.914
I've been meaning to thank you
for that fashion advice.

43:42.207 --> 43:44.083
Really upped my professional factor.

43:46.670 --> 43:49.088
Jesus, Anderson,
you have something to say, say it.

43:49.173 --> 43:50.298
With all due respect, Lieutenant,

43:50.382 --> 43:52.258
you should probably
watch the language.

43:52.968 --> 43:56.095
Well, for your information,
Matthews said people liked it.

44:01.435 --> 44:03.019
We have a lead.

44:03.812 --> 44:06.314
We've been speaking to this preacher,
Jeremiah Allen.

44:06.440 --> 44:09.942
Turns out he's obsessed with
this Revelation expert, James Gellar.

44:10.069 --> 44:13.029
The professor,
from the University of Tallahassee?

44:13.113 --> 44:14.405
Yeah?

44:16.158 --> 44:19.077
Found this on a Google search
for "Revelation expert".

44:22.581 --> 44:25.750
- It's all about end times.
- Yeah. Check this out.

44:26.210 --> 44:29.128
The posts end on the day
of our very first crime scene.

44:31.131 --> 44:32.340
I can try and get in touch with him,
but...

44:32.675 --> 44:35.718
You can't get in touch with him,
because he went underground.

44:36.095 --> 44:37.720
Underground. Why?

44:37.805 --> 44:40.348
Now look who's behind the curve.

44:40.432 --> 44:42.100
I called the university.

44:42.184 --> 44:44.811
Gellar disappeared
three years ago after he got fired.

44:44.895 --> 44:46.312
- Ask me why.
- Why?

44:46.689 --> 44:49.732
He got accused
of stealing an ancient sword.

44:50.818 --> 44:53.277
Like the one Masuka thinks our killer
could have used in both murders?

44:53.362 --> 44:54.404
Just like that.

44:55.698 --> 44:59.200
And get this.
This isn't just any Roman sword.

44:59.576 --> 45:01.452
According to medieval legend,

45:01.537 --> 45:04.414
this one belonged
to John the Revelator.

45:06.500 --> 45:09.043
The guy who actually wrote Revelation.

45:11.338 --> 45:13.506
Looks like we just found
our number one person of interest.

45:15.551 --> 45:17.552
- Good job.
- Thank you.

45:36.196 --> 45:37.780
You knew this was gonna happen.

45:38.907 --> 45:43.369
No! Please, let her go. I like her.

45:43.454 --> 45:46.372
You should have thought about that
before you defiled her.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.709
This is the best thing for her.

45:53.130 --> 45:54.797
She's part of God's plan now.

46:07.436 --> 46:10.188
Looks like your prayers were answered.

46:10.773 --> 46:13.566
- I was desperate.
- Hey, no judgement.

46:14.443 --> 46:16.569
You already talk
to an imaginary father figure.

46:17.112 --> 46:19.322
- It didn't mean anything.
- Are you sure?

46:20.741 --> 46:24.076
Harrison's OK,
and you did make that pact.

46:29.333 --> 46:31.501
Come on. You don't really think
there's someone out there

46:31.585 --> 46:33.836
- holding my IOU.
- I don't know.

46:35.506 --> 46:37.590
But if there is, you'd better be ready
to pay the piper.

46:45.474 --> 46:46.557
Hey.

46:46.642 --> 46:47.934
Hey. How's Harrison?

46:48.227 --> 46:49.602
He's fine. He's sleeping.

46:49.812 --> 46:51.145
Are you sure?
Cos I wouldn't want to bother you.

46:51.230 --> 46:52.480
Deb, just tell me what's up.

46:52.856 --> 46:55.441
Got a call to a crime scene
in Coral Gables.

46:55.526 --> 46:57.401
A gardener at the botanical gardens

46:57.569 --> 47:00.321
found an alpha and an omega
outside the greenhouse.

47:01.281 --> 47:02.949
- You think it's Doomsday?
- Could be.

47:03.033 --> 47:05.535
And we might have a suspect,
a middle-aged professor.

47:06.328 --> 47:08.496
- I'm not sure if I should leave.
- Dexter.

47:09.623 --> 47:11.415
Sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt or anything,

47:11.500 --> 47:13.334
but if that's work, you should go.

47:13.460 --> 47:15.336
- But Harrison...
- Harrison is sound asleep.

47:15.587 --> 47:17.588
Between the painkillers
and the sedatives they gave him,

47:17.673 --> 47:19.507
you can probably get there and back
before he even wakes up.

47:19.591 --> 47:22.301
Dex, at the risk of sounding
like the world's worst aunt,

47:22.386 --> 47:24.971
I could really use you on this.
There's blood.

47:27.140 --> 47:29.058
I'll be there.
Call me the minute he wakes up.

47:29.351 --> 47:30.601
I will.

47:34.690 --> 47:37.149
I was drawn to science
out of curiosity.

47:37.234 --> 47:39.777
Any questions I had,
the answers were already there.

47:42.739 --> 47:45.283
But even science is never certain.

47:45.450 --> 47:48.619
Even the soundest of theories
is subject to new data.

47:48.954 --> 47:52.456
And there are some things
even science can't explain.

47:52.708 --> 47:54.292
Brother Sam would say
it's not an accident

47:54.376 --> 47:58.546
that I've stumbled onto a killer who
seems to have his own kind of faith.

47:58.630 --> 48:00.339
And while I don't believe
in an unseen hand

48:00.424 --> 48:02.508
creating his own tableau,

48:03.510 --> 48:06.429
I do believe
I don't have all the answers.

48:06.722 --> 48:08.764
- Dex, thanks for coming.
- What do we got?

48:09.308 --> 48:11.726
Blood and fucking fish.

48:21.904 --> 48:22.945
Catch of the day.

48:28.118 --> 48:31.871
It didn't get here on its own.
So where did it come from?

48:41.256 --> 48:42.298
Dex, where are you going?

48:44.635 --> 48:47.511
Over here! Check this out.

48:53.310 --> 48:54.560
Handle.

49:10.243 --> 49:12.161
- Holy shit.
- In here!

49:23.840 --> 49:28.886
No!

49:36.019 --> 49:38.312
Deb, wait! Could be another trap.

49:38.480 --> 49:40.106
Oh, God, I have to help her!

49:40.524 --> 49:42.775
Her jugular's punctured.
She's already gone.

49:43.443 --> 49:45.778
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

49:48.699 --> 49:51.158
Kill number three. It's official.

49:51.243 --> 49:52.785
He's a serial killer.

49:54.705 --> 49:56.998
Wait, wait, everybody. Listen.

49:59.960 --> 50:01.002
What the hell is that?

50:03.046 --> 50:04.964
It's coming from over here.

50:31.408 --> 50:32.450
Locusts.

50:50.343 --> 50:53.054
I'm not looking
at Debra's middle-aged professor.

50:53.972 --> 50:56.182
Is this Doomsday number two?

51:01.271 --> 51:02.980
But that's not the look of a murderer.

51:03.065 --> 51:05.608
That's the look of a man
with true faith.

51:05.692 --> 51:07.526
I've seen it before on Brother Sam.

51:08.528 --> 51:11.822
Whatever this guy believes,
he knows it to be true.
