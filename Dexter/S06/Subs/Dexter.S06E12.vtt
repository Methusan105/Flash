WEBVTT

00:09.764 --> 00:11.056
Previously on Dexter...

00:11.599 --> 00:13.434
- What do you believe in, Mr Morgan?
- Nothing.

00:13.601 --> 00:15.436
You can believe
whatever you wanna believe.

00:15.478 --> 00:17.229
But it's not just about you any more.

00:17.272 --> 00:19.440
It's why I'm making you
Homicide's new lieutenant.

00:19.482 --> 00:21.108
Fuckballs, you're serious.

00:21.317 --> 00:22.943
There's something inside.

00:23.611 --> 00:25.738
Holy frankenfuck! Snakes!

00:25.780 --> 00:26.905
So it's begun?

00:27.741 --> 00:28.782
Yes.

00:30.952 --> 00:31.952
No!

00:32.954 --> 00:34.955
This Revelation expert, James Gellar.

00:35.081 --> 00:36.832
The professor,
from the University of Tallahassee?

00:36.958 --> 00:39.418
Gellar disappeared
three years ago after he got fired.

00:43.256 --> 00:44.465
Travis Marshall.

00:45.967 --> 00:49.344
I suppose it was God who told you
to kill all those innocent people.

00:49.637 --> 00:52.139
God speaks to the professor.

00:52.474 --> 00:53.766
You're saying Gellar does the killing?

00:54.476 --> 00:55.517
He's so much stronger than me.

00:57.103 --> 00:59.855
Gellar. He's been dead all along.

01:00.273 --> 01:02.649
Travis, you killed Gellar.

01:04.360 --> 01:05.819
"Miami Metro Homicide."

01:05.987 --> 01:08.322
That's where
God wants us to stage wormwood.

01:12.494 --> 01:15.829
Dex, you saved a lot of lives today.
You saved my life.

01:15.872 --> 01:17.998
Every time the shit hits the fan,
I go to him.

01:18.500 --> 01:19.666
He's your safe place.

01:19.793 --> 01:23.378
You're making it sound like
I want to be with him or something.

01:23.505 --> 01:24.546
Well, do you?

01:25.131 --> 01:26.673
This is a job of trust.

01:26.966 --> 01:29.009
And I can't have
a partner I can't trust.

01:29.552 --> 01:31.887
The beast is coming for you.

01:32.639 --> 01:35.682
You didn't really think
you could foil God's plan, did you?

04:04.249 --> 04:08.502
I guess it's fitting that I end up
where I've left so many others.

04:29.941 --> 04:33.151
I only wonder if the world
will be a better place without me.

05:01.723 --> 05:04.558
It's wrong
what people say about dying.

05:05.560 --> 05:08.228
I'm not flashing back over my life,

05:08.813 --> 05:10.897
over the lives I've taken.

05:11.733 --> 05:14.484
I'm thinking about the life I'll miss.

05:14.986 --> 05:17.988
Harrison.
I'll miss watching my son grow up.

05:47.852 --> 05:49.353
Are you OK?

05:51.731 --> 05:53.440
You are very lucky.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.401
God is looking out for you.

06:22.595 --> 06:23.637
Where are we?

06:25.264 --> 06:28.100
Florida. Maybe five miles away.

06:30.311 --> 06:31.937
We'll be there soon.

06:34.899 --> 06:35.941
Perhaps.

06:47.453 --> 06:51.123
He's robbing us,
and I have nothing to give.

07:03.469 --> 07:05.011
I can give him death.

07:17.650 --> 07:18.692
You're safe.

07:22.488 --> 07:23.822
We'll be there soon.

08:14.248 --> 08:15.332
"It's finished."

08:15.416 --> 08:18.543
Those were Travis' last words to me,
and he's right.

08:18.586 --> 08:21.004
There's no way to find him now.

08:21.506 --> 08:22.923
I'm going home to my son.

08:24.926 --> 08:26.426
Excuse me.

08:27.512 --> 08:29.930
- Do you have a phone I can use?
- Oh, sure.

08:30.431 --> 08:33.266
More on the ball games later.
And now, in other news...

08:34.602 --> 08:37.938
The solar eclipse is due
at 3:28 tomorrow afternoon.

08:38.105 --> 08:42.192
It's a great opportunity to trick your
kids into learning a little science.

08:42.276 --> 08:44.194
Stick with us,
and Dr Mehler will teach you

08:44.278 --> 08:46.238
how to make a simple pinhole camera

08:46.280 --> 08:48.949
that will allow you
to watch in safety with your children.

08:49.033 --> 08:51.076
But first, this message.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.413
Stare at the sun, you idiots.

08:56.541 --> 08:59.793
Better you be blinded than
face the horrors that await you.

09:12.056 --> 09:16.059
I can't stay here much longer
if you're gonna stink like that.

09:22.441 --> 09:23.650
Daddy.

09:25.820 --> 09:29.823
I cannot believe you fell off
your boat and swam to shore.

09:30.825 --> 09:31.992
You must be exhausted.

09:32.118 --> 09:34.160
Yeah. Mostly, I feel dumb.

09:35.454 --> 09:36.955
I'll be OK.

09:38.583 --> 09:39.833
Let's go home.

09:40.334 --> 09:41.334
Yeah.

09:48.509 --> 09:51.970
I lost my keys, wallet, cell phone.

09:52.179 --> 09:53.680
Yeah, of course.

10:16.037 --> 10:17.537
Are you OK?

10:18.998 --> 10:23.668
Yeah. Just thirsty, hungry.

10:24.503 --> 10:26.504
I can't imagine
if he would have lost you, Dexter.

10:26.547 --> 10:28.340
You're very lucky.

10:30.343 --> 10:31.551
Yeah.

10:32.637 --> 10:33.845
Lucky.

10:38.809 --> 10:40.727
What can I do to help?

10:41.896 --> 10:44.564
- We're good until the morning.
- OK.

10:45.191 --> 10:46.399
Don't forget, his pageant's tomorrow.

10:47.068 --> 10:48.068
I'll be there.

10:51.030 --> 10:52.489
Thank you.

11:23.562 --> 11:26.898
If some God or some force
did save me today...

11:30.277 --> 11:33.071
I'm sure it was for you
and not for me.

12:37.303 --> 12:38.803
Today's the day.

12:58.282 --> 12:59.491
Dex!

13:05.539 --> 13:07.874
I got a report that
your boat had washed ashore.

13:08.334 --> 13:09.709
I'm OK. I'm OK.

13:09.794 --> 13:12.295
Kept calling your cell phone,
there was no answer.

13:12.630 --> 13:15.215
God, you can't keep doing this to me.

13:16.008 --> 13:18.051
I've almost lost you twice.

13:22.181 --> 13:23.306
I love you.

13:24.308 --> 13:25.850
I love you, too.

13:27.686 --> 13:29.020
You do?

13:30.523 --> 13:31.689
Of course I do.

13:33.484 --> 13:36.236
I don't think
you've ever said it before.

13:53.170 --> 13:55.797
It's a double murder. There's blood.

13:57.925 --> 13:59.425
Will you write down
the address for me?

13:59.969 --> 14:01.010
Are you sure you're up for it?

14:01.470 --> 14:03.054
Yeah, I'm good.

14:23.325 --> 14:25.493
- You been inside yet?
- No.

14:25.995 --> 14:28.079
We've been waiting on you.

15:01.780 --> 15:03.573
This was Travis.

15:04.617 --> 15:05.783
He killed these people...

15:08.078 --> 15:10.580
because he needed a place to hide.

15:19.214 --> 15:21.549
Well, we'll take care,
we'll find out.

15:25.179 --> 15:26.262
It's about fucking time.

15:26.472 --> 15:27.513
I had to get gas.

15:32.144 --> 15:33.561
I'll never get used to that.

15:33.646 --> 15:36.147
The sweet smell of hydrogen sulphide,
carbon dioxide,

15:36.231 --> 15:39.484
and methane all liquefying
into a frothy treat.

15:39.568 --> 15:40.777
Where's Dex?

15:52.247 --> 15:53.289
Fuck me.

15:53.582 --> 15:55.124
Fucking Travis Marshall was here.

15:56.460 --> 15:57.710
Looks like it.

15:58.337 --> 16:00.213
What's the painting of?

16:00.297 --> 16:02.256
It's the beast being thrown
into the lake of fire.

16:02.341 --> 16:03.758
It's the last tableau.

16:04.093 --> 16:05.718
Why do you think
he smashed in the face?

16:06.971 --> 16:08.846
I can't imagine.

16:09.890 --> 16:12.141
Better go photograph the bodies.

16:12.226 --> 16:14.352
I'll take care of this room.

16:20.609 --> 16:22.026
What do you think happened here?

16:22.111 --> 16:23.194
I don't know.

16:24.279 --> 16:26.906
Either way, it's a horrible way to go.

16:41.922 --> 16:44.298
They were both killed
by blows to the head.

16:44.591 --> 16:47.135
Her, once. Him, multiple times.

16:47.428 --> 16:50.179
Blunt instrument.
Most likely that frying pan.

16:52.141 --> 16:53.182
When?

16:53.767 --> 16:55.727
At least 48 hours ago.

16:59.857 --> 17:00.898
You're looking at me weird.

17:02.109 --> 17:03.484
- Am I?
- Aren't you?

17:04.445 --> 17:07.447
I'm just taking pictures, Deb.

17:11.368 --> 17:12.535
OK.

17:13.954 --> 17:15.913
Let's just focus on work
right now, OK?

17:15.998 --> 17:17.081
OK.

17:21.462 --> 17:23.880
Where the fuck is Travis Marshall?

17:24.882 --> 17:26.758
He could be anywhere.

17:27.843 --> 17:29.093
You think he's done
the lake of fire yet?

17:29.178 --> 17:30.762
I don't know.

17:31.138 --> 17:32.346
He could just be hiding out somewhere.

17:32.431 --> 17:35.308
He could just be kicking back
with a beer, waiting for the eclipse.

17:35.893 --> 17:37.894
That's very possible, Deb.

17:42.900 --> 17:44.150
OK...

17:46.737 --> 17:47.779
I'm gonna go back to the office.

17:47.863 --> 17:50.656
I gotta find a way
to catch this fucker.

17:50.908 --> 17:52.658
- I'll see you back there.
- OK.

17:53.243 --> 17:54.494
Sorry.

18:16.141 --> 18:19.811
Despite what Travis said,
maybe it's not quite finished.

18:20.395 --> 18:23.397
My one advantage is
that he thinks I'm dead.

18:45.754 --> 18:47.213
Now, where do I go?

18:50.300 --> 18:51.759
Please, God.

18:52.052 --> 18:54.595
I've done everything
you've asked of me.

19:25.419 --> 19:27.044
Thank you.

19:31.842 --> 19:34.552
You know, my last day
is coming up fast.

19:36.054 --> 19:37.763
A dark day indeed.

19:38.765 --> 19:40.558
You will be missed.

19:46.356 --> 19:47.982
I was wondering...

19:49.860 --> 19:52.862
there's no way
I could stay on permanently?

19:53.113 --> 19:54.280
Maybe as an assistant?

19:54.656 --> 19:56.157
What about your video games?

19:59.286 --> 20:01.287
It just doesn't seem
important any more.

20:02.164 --> 20:06.626
Louis, Miami Metro Homicide
is an elite crew, OK?

20:06.710 --> 20:09.337
Just because you're
the world's greatest batboy

20:09.504 --> 20:12.089
doesn't mean that you're ready
to pinch hit for the Yankees.

20:15.135 --> 20:16.844
In other words...

20:18.889 --> 20:21.307
...finish training, you must.

20:21.725 --> 20:24.310
Save you, it will, Luke.

20:28.315 --> 20:29.732
Maybe I'll throw you
some consulting work,

20:29.816 --> 20:31.234
just to keep your dick wet.

20:31.860 --> 20:33.611
That'd be great.

20:36.198 --> 20:37.365
This is the lake of fire.

20:37.449 --> 20:38.908
It's the last of seven keys

20:38.992 --> 20:40.451
that's supposed to bring about
the end of the world.

20:40.535 --> 20:41.911
It was Travis' last tableau.

20:42.913 --> 20:45.790
A picture taken last night
about seven miles off the coast.

20:45.916 --> 20:47.333
Some guy in an aeroplane saw it

20:47.417 --> 20:48.751
and took a picture
with his cell phone.

20:49.294 --> 20:50.503
Now based on this,

20:50.587 --> 20:53.214
I'm thinking that Travis has already
completed tableau number seven.

20:53.298 --> 20:55.716
- Does anyone think I'm wrong?
- I think we're in agreement.

20:55.801 --> 20:56.842
We've got the coast guard out there

20:56.927 --> 20:59.679
looking for signs of
a wreck or a body, but nothing yet.

20:59.763 --> 21:01.138
Cos I'm right here.

21:01.223 --> 21:03.641
So Travis is done with his work.
Now what?

21:03.725 --> 21:04.892
Well, now all Travis has to do is

21:04.977 --> 21:06.310
sit back and wait
for the end of the world.

21:06.395 --> 21:07.770
Which means he could be anywhere.

21:07.896 --> 21:08.938
Or maybe not.

21:09.022 --> 21:10.856
Maybe he's somewhere very specific.

21:11.024 --> 21:13.192
Somewhere where we can
grab his crazy ass. Check this out.

21:20.784 --> 21:22.827
This is Gellar's last sketch.

21:23.078 --> 21:24.620
- The two witnesses.
- Yeah.

21:25.747 --> 21:26.789
And their dog.

21:26.873 --> 21:29.417
I guess Fido wanted to watch
the end of the world, too.

21:29.501 --> 21:32.044
So you're thinking if Travis
is following Gellar's drawings,

21:32.129 --> 21:34.005
this points to where he'll be next?

21:34.089 --> 21:35.881
And what time he'll be there.

21:35.966 --> 21:39.385
All this shit's gonna go down
when the eclipse is happening.

21:39.469 --> 21:41.012
Which is four hours from now.

21:41.096 --> 21:42.805
Where do you go to watch an eclipse?

21:42.931 --> 21:44.557
Well, you'd want a good view.

21:44.641 --> 21:46.309
No obstructions.

21:46.476 --> 21:47.518
High ground.

21:47.602 --> 21:49.020
Yeah, look where they are.
They're on a mountaintop.

21:49.229 --> 21:52.815
Could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure
there are no mountains in Miami.

21:52.899 --> 21:54.400
Unless you find a substitute.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.902
- Fucking A...
- Skyscrapers.

21:57.029 --> 21:59.363
Fucking big-ass,
tall-as-shit skyscrapers.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.532
- Makes sense.
- It does, right?

22:01.742 --> 22:02.783
I'm gonna call LaGuerta.

22:02.868 --> 22:05.286
I want to station unis on top of
Miami's tallest buildings.

22:05.370 --> 22:07.121
There's a lot of tall buildings
in Miami.

22:07.205 --> 22:08.831
I mean, that's gonna require
a lot of manpower.

22:08.915 --> 22:12.543
I don't care. If Travis gets away,
he is gone for good.

22:18.091 --> 22:20.885
Travis redid
that same sketch yesterday,

22:21.928 --> 22:23.929
and it looks different.

22:28.894 --> 22:31.687
I thought it was a mountain,
but maybe it's a building.

22:31.772 --> 22:34.106
What was the last thing
Travis said to me?

22:34.191 --> 22:37.193
He'd be standing atop
a shining pillar of light.

23:05.722 --> 23:07.431
"The solar-powered Transcorp Building

23:07.516 --> 23:09.934
"was designed to capture
and reflect the sun

23:10.018 --> 23:11.769
"as it moves across the Miami sky."

23:14.272 --> 23:16.107
A pillar of light.

23:21.613 --> 23:23.155
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:24.783 --> 23:25.950
The abandoned church

23:26.034 --> 23:28.035
where Travis and Gellar
were hanging out...

23:28.412 --> 23:29.453
What about it?

23:30.872 --> 23:33.916
I need you to do a final
forensic sweep so we can clear it.

23:35.627 --> 23:39.213
I have Harrison's
Noah's Ark pageant this afternoon.

23:40.382 --> 23:41.966
I promised him.

23:42.592 --> 23:44.135
Afterwards, then.

23:45.011 --> 23:46.470
Copy that.

23:46.972 --> 23:48.222
Hey...

23:52.060 --> 23:53.310
What?

23:54.563 --> 23:56.355
Do we need to talk?

23:58.900 --> 24:01.193
I don't know. Is there something
we should talk about?

24:05.407 --> 24:07.867
I don't know. You almost died.

24:08.201 --> 24:10.369
I didn't know if you needed to...

24:11.913 --> 24:13.706
unload or whatever.

24:16.751 --> 24:18.669
I think I'm OK, but thanks, sis.

24:20.797 --> 24:22.089
Great.

24:23.008 --> 24:24.467
Don't forget about the church.

24:24.759 --> 24:26.093
Got it.

24:27.888 --> 24:30.222
I have plans for that church.

24:38.732 --> 24:40.983
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

24:41.067 --> 24:42.651
This is exactly why I'm doing this.

24:42.736 --> 24:44.361
You never take anything seriously.

24:44.446 --> 24:45.696
Why you're doing what?

24:46.281 --> 24:48.574
I wanted to give you
the heads up about your transfer.

24:48.742 --> 24:51.660
What fucking transfer?
I didn't ask for a transfer.

24:51.745 --> 24:53.537
- I'm putting one in for you.
- The fuck you are.

24:53.622 --> 24:54.788
I am.

24:55.123 --> 24:58.334
You've been screwing up
for the last few months.

25:00.754 --> 25:01.962
And when you almost got me killed...

25:02.047 --> 25:03.631
- I thought we settled that.
- We did.

25:03.965 --> 25:06.509
But as sergeant, I can't risk myself

25:06.593 --> 25:08.761
or anyone else here
in Homicide any more.

25:14.601 --> 25:15.976
Good talk, Sergeant.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.646
So even though Travis Marshall
killed Gellar,

25:18.730 --> 25:20.564
at some point, we're not sure when,

25:20.649 --> 25:22.733
he's still recreating images
from Gellar's sketchbook,

25:22.817 --> 25:23.859
and this is the last one.

25:23.944 --> 25:26.695
It's two witnesses looking
at the eclipse from a mountaintop.

25:26.947 --> 25:30.074
And skyscrapers
are the mountaintops of Miami.

25:30.283 --> 25:32.368
So you think that Travis Marshall

25:32.452 --> 25:34.662
will watch the eclipse
from a skyscraper.

25:34.746 --> 25:36.205
Can you narrow down which one?

25:36.289 --> 25:38.874
The Four Seasons is
the tallest building in Miami,

25:38.959 --> 25:40.292
but we're not sure
where he'll show up.

25:40.752 --> 25:44.129
And that's why I want to put unis on
top of every building over 400 feet.

25:49.010 --> 25:50.052
Do it.

25:50.428 --> 25:51.512
You're agreeing with me?

25:51.763 --> 25:54.223
If you think this is
the best use of your resources,

25:54.307 --> 25:56.058
I trust your judgement.

25:56.142 --> 25:57.643
Yeah, so when this
blows up in my face,

25:57.727 --> 25:58.852
you can fire my ass.

26:01.273 --> 26:03.357
I know that you think
that I'm some heartless bitch,

26:03.441 --> 26:05.067
and sometimes I have to be.

26:05.694 --> 26:08.737
But everything I do is always
in the best interest of Miami Metro.

26:09.281 --> 26:10.656
Matthews might disagree with that.

26:10.740 --> 26:12.283
Well, Matthews put his dick
before his department.

26:12.367 --> 26:13.993
Yeah, and you cut it off.

26:14.911 --> 26:17.162
You didn't hesitate to
take advantage of that situation.

26:17.372 --> 26:18.872
Was that really the best
for Miami Metro?

26:18.957 --> 26:21.709
Morgan, we need to get
Travis Marshall.

26:23.128 --> 26:25.087
All I need to know is
will this plan of yours work?

26:25.463 --> 26:26.505
Yes.

26:26.590 --> 26:29.758
Then count on having
all the manpower you need.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.459
Did you look under your bed?

28:29.295 --> 28:31.338
Maybe Blanky's in here.

28:47.188 --> 28:48.230
We're late.

28:52.861 --> 28:54.278
Here it is.

28:59.743 --> 29:01.201
Dexter.

29:10.086 --> 29:11.795
OK, let's go.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.761
So the beast has a son.

30:28.039 --> 30:29.873
Be a big boy lion.

30:30.917 --> 30:32.417
Just in time for the flood.

30:32.961 --> 30:34.002
Sorry I'm late.

30:34.087 --> 30:37.047
I was getting worried the world would
have to make do with only one lion.

30:37.298 --> 30:39.341
Just a few minutes, everybody,
before the show begins.

30:39.425 --> 30:41.260
Break a leg, you two.

30:42.220 --> 30:44.888
OK, bud. Remember what the lions say?

30:50.103 --> 30:51.311
Sorry.

30:51.437 --> 30:53.272
It's OK, it's OK. We're lions.

30:53.356 --> 30:55.482
That's just what lions do.

30:57.151 --> 30:59.903
All right, now we got an ark
to get on.

31:00.238 --> 31:02.656
And that boat has a place
for all the animals,

31:02.740 --> 31:06.743
not just the sheep and the zebras,
but the lions, too.

31:07.495 --> 31:09.329
I'll be right with you, by your side.

31:09.622 --> 31:11.498
Let's get that mask on.

31:14.002 --> 31:15.502
Two by two,

31:16.045 --> 31:18.881
the animals went inside the ark.

31:19.424 --> 31:21.174
The bunny rabbits,

31:21.634 --> 31:23.051
the tigers,

31:24.095 --> 31:25.804
even the lions.

31:26.723 --> 31:28.724
All of God's creatures.

31:30.268 --> 31:32.686
Noah welcomed them all on his boat.

31:36.399 --> 31:38.567
And the rain kept falling

31:39.110 --> 31:41.612
for 40 days and 40 nights,

31:42.447 --> 31:45.532
until the whole world
was covered in water.

31:50.496 --> 31:53.540
The tallest building in Miami
is the Four Seasons building,

31:53.750 --> 31:56.293
and this is where we believe
Travis Marshall will be.

31:56.377 --> 31:58.086
Sergeant Batista and Detective Quinn

31:58.212 --> 32:00.505
will accompany the two officers
that are stationed there.

32:01.966 --> 32:04.384
If you see Travis Marshall
or contact is made,

32:04.469 --> 32:06.011
call for backup immediately.

32:06.888 --> 32:09.973
He is highly unpredictable
and very dangerous.

32:10.224 --> 32:11.725
Let's go get this fucker.

32:14.479 --> 32:17.022
Check in with me every 15, OK?
I want to stay on top of this.

32:17.106 --> 32:18.774
I spoke to my union rep.

32:19.442 --> 32:22.069
We decided I have
a problem with alcohol,

32:22.278 --> 32:24.321
and as long as I seek help
and admit it,

32:24.405 --> 32:27.532
I can't be transferred or fired.
It's a disease.

32:27.867 --> 32:29.284
Are you shitting me?

32:30.036 --> 32:32.120
That rule is for people
that really have a problem.

32:32.205 --> 32:34.414
You're not an alcoholic,
you're just a fuck-up.

32:34.540 --> 32:37.417
Look, you said
to take control of my life.

32:37.502 --> 32:39.878
That's what I'm trying to do, OK?

32:39.963 --> 32:42.881
I like Homicide.
I'm in it for the long haul.

32:42.966 --> 32:45.717
Why can't you put this much effort
into actual police work?

32:50.139 --> 32:52.307
We remind you
to not look directly at the sun.

32:52.475 --> 32:54.142
The eclipse will happen
within the hour.

32:54.352 --> 32:58.146
And the two witnesses will
watch the world end with their dog.

32:58.898 --> 33:01.108
I still don't get the dog.
Why do they want to bring the dog?

33:01.192 --> 33:02.776
Are you sure that's a dog?

33:03.111 --> 33:04.528
What else could it be?

33:04.862 --> 33:06.989
A sheep, a lamb.

33:07.365 --> 33:08.448
Lamb of God?

33:08.533 --> 33:09.950
A lamb. We've seen that before.

33:10.034 --> 33:11.743
Yeah, it was that hot chick
that Quinn fucked.

33:12.412 --> 33:13.954
Carissa Porter, right.

33:14.038 --> 33:15.622
She was in that tableau
that Gellar staged

33:15.707 --> 33:17.916
at the University of Tallahassee.
She slaughtered a lamb.

33:18.126 --> 33:19.960
The school newspaper sent
the contact sheets from that day.

33:20.044 --> 33:22.170
I've got them right here.

33:23.923 --> 33:27.259
The lamb has only an omega
on its forehead, no alpha.

33:27.343 --> 33:29.136
An omega. The end.

33:29.971 --> 33:32.556
Killing the lamb signifies the end.
Holy fuck.

33:33.016 --> 33:35.559
What if Travis isn't done killing?

33:42.108 --> 33:44.359
- Deb.
- I think Travis is gonna kill again.

33:46.029 --> 33:48.280
- When?
- Before the eclipse.

33:51.034 --> 33:52.159
That's an hour from now.

33:52.243 --> 33:54.703
I know, but I think
he's gonna make a sacrifice.

33:54.871 --> 33:56.413
An offering to his god.

33:59.083 --> 34:00.667
It makes sense, right?

34:01.127 --> 34:03.462
A spilling of blood
to bless the new world.

34:03.546 --> 34:05.088
I mean, I'm not 100% sure, but...

34:05.173 --> 34:06.631
In the last drawing
from Gellar's book,

34:06.716 --> 34:08.967
one of the witnesses has a sword,

34:09.052 --> 34:10.761
and the animal approaching them is...

34:10.845 --> 34:11.887
A lamb.

34:11.971 --> 34:14.473
And that tableau that Gellar did
on campus a few years back,

34:14.557 --> 34:16.058
the slaughter of a lamb.

34:16.392 --> 34:18.226
I don't know
what a lamb means to this crazy prick.

34:18.311 --> 34:21.563
It could be an actual lamb,
it could be an innocent of some kind,

34:22.190 --> 34:23.857
but I think that could be
his next kill.

34:25.568 --> 34:27.069
I gotta go.

34:32.617 --> 34:34.534
Excuse me, Sister.
Have you seen Harrison?

34:35.536 --> 34:36.828
Yes. He just left.

34:37.080 --> 34:38.246
He left?

34:38.331 --> 34:40.373
He was with a man
wearing a lion's mask.

34:40.458 --> 34:43.001
- I thought it was you.
- Where'd they go?

34:54.388 --> 34:58.558
The time is nigh
and the end is near

34:58.851 --> 35:02.687
It's time for God's children
to listen and hear

35:02.772 --> 35:07.818
For his word has said
that the world will end

35:08.528 --> 35:12.989
And the mountain will fall
when he comes again

35:25.837 --> 35:26.962
Hey!

35:27.130 --> 35:29.339
Hey, little boy! Hey, come back here!

35:50.903 --> 35:53.405
The time is 3:26.
Get ready for the eclipse...

35:53.489 --> 35:54.656
Should all be in place by now, right?

35:54.740 --> 35:56.074
Yeah.

35:56.492 --> 35:58.577
Four Seasons,
this is Lieutenant Morgan.

35:59.203 --> 36:00.245
We're all clear up here.

36:00.329 --> 36:03.248
No sign of Travis
or a lamb of any kind.

36:03.374 --> 36:06.668
Copy that. Miami Tower,
this is Lieutenant Morgan. All clear?

36:07.670 --> 36:09.087
All clear.

36:09.172 --> 36:10.463
Copy that.

36:10.548 --> 36:14.092
Transcorp Building,
this is Lieutenant Morgan. All clear?

36:16.888 --> 36:21.892
Transcorp?

36:23.728 --> 36:25.103
All clear.

36:36.407 --> 36:40.327
So jump to the sky
Repent of your sins

36:42.538 --> 36:44.331
Run to your saviour

36:47.501 --> 36:49.711
and you'll be saved again

36:53.216 --> 36:54.257
It is done.

36:58.387 --> 37:01.181
I am the alpha and the omega.

37:04.977 --> 37:07.604
I am the beginning and the end.

37:08.022 --> 37:09.689
I am making everything new.

37:10.858 --> 37:12.150
No!

37:13.694 --> 37:14.736
Stop!

37:15.613 --> 37:16.655
What?

37:16.906 --> 37:17.948
Get away from him!

37:18.032 --> 37:19.532
I killed you. Stay back!

37:20.576 --> 37:22.160
You're supposed to be dead.

37:22.453 --> 37:25.247
How's the world going to end
if the beast is still alive?

37:25.915 --> 37:26.957
It won't.

37:27.041 --> 37:29.960
Until the beast is dead,
a sacrifice is meaningless.

37:32.588 --> 37:33.838
Time is running out, Travis.

37:33.965 --> 37:36.299
I know that. Stay there!

37:37.843 --> 37:39.552
Take me, and let my son go.

37:40.012 --> 37:42.430
You need me. You don't need him.

37:43.057 --> 37:44.432
Let him go. Take him to the elevator.

37:44.892 --> 37:46.351
Do you have
any of your needles with you?

37:48.562 --> 37:49.604
Yes.

37:49.897 --> 37:51.398
Let's see it.

37:52.233 --> 37:53.275
Show me.

37:59.907 --> 38:01.574
Inject yourself.

38:02.535 --> 38:05.328
I will, but not until you let him go.

38:15.506 --> 38:16.965
It's OK, buddy.

38:26.809 --> 38:28.560
Stop! You stay there!

38:37.570 --> 38:39.529
Inject yourself, or I'll kill him.

38:42.658 --> 38:44.200
Do it now!

39:18.152 --> 39:20.028
The eclipse is here, Travis.

39:29.705 --> 39:31.331
Daddy's here.

39:45.054 --> 39:47.847
Looks like the moon has
just finished traversing the sun.

39:48.224 --> 39:50.433
Lieutenant, it's the Four Seasons.
We're all clear.

39:51.143 --> 39:52.769
Miami Tower's all clear.

39:53.354 --> 39:54.729
Marquis, all clear.

39:55.314 --> 39:57.190
50 Biscayne, all clear.

39:57.691 --> 39:58.900
The eclipse is over. Nothing happened.

39:58.984 --> 40:00.527
Marinablue, all clear.

40:01.112 --> 40:02.570
400 Main, all clear.

40:02.738 --> 40:04.989
Transcorp hasn't checked in.

40:08.619 --> 40:11.538
Transcorp, this is Lieutenant Morgan.
Are you there?

40:12.331 --> 40:13.832
Are you there?

40:13.958 --> 40:15.834
Transcorp, do you copy?

40:18.003 --> 40:19.921
God fucking damn it!

40:24.802 --> 40:28.138
10-1, 10-1. Officer down
on top of the Transcorp Building.

40:28.305 --> 40:30.056
Get the paramedics up here now.

40:30.266 --> 40:31.766
Search every fucking inch
of this place!

40:31.851 --> 40:33.435
- Yes, ma'am.
- First quadrant, clear.

40:33.519 --> 40:35.937
- Second quadrant, clear.
- Third quadrant, clear.

40:36.272 --> 40:38.481
- Fourth quadrant, clear.
- All clear.

40:38.732 --> 40:40.692
No sign of Marshall.

40:40.860 --> 40:42.402
Lieutenant!

40:49.368 --> 40:50.785
What the fuck is that?

40:51.078 --> 40:53.288
Looks like it was some kind of altar.

40:53.914 --> 40:55.957
Maybe the officer was the sacrifice.

40:56.625 --> 40:58.126
Let's go! Move!

40:58.210 --> 40:59.919
South quadrant.

41:03.632 --> 41:05.425
Deb, what happened?

41:05.676 --> 41:06.718
He got away.

41:06.802 --> 41:08.428
Lieutenant, the officer's dead.

41:11.765 --> 41:12.974
Deb, you OK?

41:13.350 --> 41:15.310
What does it matter?

41:15.811 --> 41:17.604
How does any of it fucking matter?

41:17.730 --> 41:18.897
Shit.

41:25.488 --> 41:26.905
Where's Morgan?

41:27.615 --> 41:29.491
She needed a moment alone.

41:30.201 --> 41:31.910
She's over there.

41:38.042 --> 41:40.293
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

41:43.506 --> 41:44.964
Don't, OK?

41:46.717 --> 41:48.426
You made the right call.

41:51.222 --> 41:53.973
What is this, you being understanding?

41:54.767 --> 41:56.142
Pragmatic.

41:57.269 --> 42:00.813
You kick a horse during the race,
not after it's over.

42:04.443 --> 42:05.652
Travis Marshall was here.

42:07.446 --> 42:09.113
Yeah, and an officer is dead.

42:09.198 --> 42:11.115
Because of Travis Marshall.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.825
Who's still out there.

42:13.202 --> 42:15.078
Who knows what he'll do next?
He's capable of anything.

42:15.162 --> 42:19.374
And if he fucking disappears,
this case could stay open forever.

42:19.500 --> 42:21.793
You'd always have that
to throw back in my face.

42:22.419 --> 42:23.878
I won't do that.

42:23.963 --> 42:26.256
Why, it's not best for Miami Metro?

42:26.382 --> 42:28.675
Because you'll find him.

42:30.886 --> 42:34.097
You have the potential
to be a good lieutenant,

42:35.641 --> 42:37.809
but you need to prioritise.

42:38.352 --> 42:40.812
You're letting your emotions
take charge of you.

42:45.526 --> 42:46.734
You know what worked for me?

42:47.403 --> 42:50.029
Making my job the centre of my life.

42:51.115 --> 42:55.577
Puts everything else in perspective
because the control is all mine.

42:56.287 --> 43:00.290
And that's what you need to do, Deb,
take control.

43:28.777 --> 43:30.528
One thing I'm sure I have faith in

43:30.613 --> 43:33.698
is the staying power
of animal tranquilisers.

43:34.617 --> 43:35.825
Is that my shirt?

43:49.048 --> 43:51.090
The mighty kings return!

43:51.842 --> 43:53.343
It's a jungle out there.

43:53.469 --> 43:55.219
Here, I'll put him to bed.

43:55.304 --> 43:58.389
No, I got it. I have to go back out.

43:59.266 --> 44:01.976
- Late night?
- Probably not too late.

44:02.061 --> 44:04.479
Deb wants me to
go back to a crime scene,

44:04.563 --> 44:07.357
- collect some evidence.
- OK.

44:07.691 --> 44:10.818
Let me see those paws,
let me see those paws.

44:13.572 --> 44:15.615
I'm glad you're safe.

44:18.952 --> 44:22.497
Whether you're a lion or a lamb,
I'll always love you.

44:29.463 --> 44:32.382
Maybe that's all I need
to pass on to you.

44:50.067 --> 44:51.109
You were right.

44:51.193 --> 44:52.694
Debra, we can schedule a time...

44:52.778 --> 44:54.195
I told him.

44:55.614 --> 44:57.699
I fucking told my brother
that I love him,

44:58.033 --> 45:00.284
and he said "I love you" back.

45:02.204 --> 45:03.788
Not, "Me, too,"
or something like that.

45:03.872 --> 45:06.249
- He actually said, "I love you."
- Wow.

45:06.542 --> 45:07.583
That's big, isn't it?

45:07.626 --> 45:11.921
Yeah, I mean, I don't think he
understood that I'm in love with him,

45:11.964 --> 45:14.799
but still, he said the actual words
for the first time.

45:16.135 --> 45:17.427
So what do you think it means?

45:17.803 --> 45:21.472
I don't know what the fuck it means.
That's why I'm here.

45:23.976 --> 45:25.435
Is this just...

45:28.647 --> 45:29.814
horribly wrong?

45:32.151 --> 45:33.234
Does it feel wrong?

45:33.444 --> 45:34.485
It makes...

45:36.321 --> 45:37.947
my whole life...

45:42.161 --> 45:44.495
every man I've ever loved, make sense.

45:46.165 --> 45:49.292
It's like I've always been
looking for someone like Dexter

45:49.334 --> 45:52.003
or someone
who's the opposite of Dexter

45:52.129 --> 45:55.673
as a way to avoid the fact
that I'm in love with him.

45:57.760 --> 45:59.010
That's just clear to me now,

46:01.096 --> 46:03.598
and I want it to be clear to him.

46:04.183 --> 46:05.683
I want him to understand.

46:06.101 --> 46:07.185
OK.

46:09.021 --> 46:12.482
You want to tell him how you feel
in a way that he can hear you.

46:12.649 --> 46:13.775
Yes.

46:19.114 --> 46:21.199
Is this how it feels
to be in control of your emotions?

46:24.161 --> 46:26.329
But you can't control his.

46:27.289 --> 46:29.999
You don't know
how he's going to react.

46:47.976 --> 46:49.477
Hello, Jesus.

46:53.315 --> 46:54.649
Hello, Travis.

46:54.900 --> 46:56.150
What?

46:57.736 --> 46:59.153
What is going on?

46:59.238 --> 47:02.824
This is the way the world ends.

47:03.992 --> 47:05.910
- Your world, anyway.
- No!

47:06.203 --> 47:09.330
No, no! I'm supposed to
finish enacting the seven keys.

47:09.581 --> 47:11.999
- Sorry.
- But I was chosen!

47:12.417 --> 47:15.086
I was chosen to
bring about the new world.

47:15.170 --> 47:16.921
Chosen to kill innocent people?

47:17.005 --> 47:18.256
No one is innocent.

47:18.382 --> 47:20.091
My son is. You tried to kill him.

47:20.217 --> 47:22.343
God allowed his son to die.

47:23.220 --> 47:24.929
How could you believe in that?

47:25.055 --> 47:27.723
Because I walk the path
of the righteous.

47:28.100 --> 47:30.768
I've known people who believed in God.

47:30.894 --> 47:32.854
They would never use their faith

47:32.938 --> 47:36.566
as a convenient excuse
to kill 10 people.

47:36.942 --> 47:39.443
You used God.

47:39.903 --> 47:41.904
It's not the other way around.

47:43.115 --> 47:44.407
You...

47:45.784 --> 47:47.952
You are a shining example

47:48.537 --> 47:50.746
of how putrid man has become.

47:53.083 --> 47:54.959
I am a father,

47:56.962 --> 47:58.129
a son,

48:00.090 --> 48:01.757
a serial killer.

48:04.428 --> 48:06.804
You're going to burn in hell.

48:07.139 --> 48:10.308
No, I think I belong right here.

48:15.522 --> 48:18.983
Because maybe there is
a place for me in this world...

48:22.029 --> 48:23.529
just as I am.

48:26.867 --> 48:29.493
Light cannot exist without darkness.

48:31.455 --> 48:33.331
Each has its purpose.

48:36.335 --> 48:39.211
And if there is a purpose
to my darkness,

48:39.379 --> 48:42.506
maybe it's to bring some...

48:43.467 --> 48:45.509
balance to the world.

48:54.394 --> 48:55.478
Because, let's face it,

48:55.520 --> 48:58.522
the world is going to be
a better place without you.

49:01.234 --> 49:03.027
The world is going to end.

49:03.737 --> 49:05.237
And when it does,

49:05.364 --> 49:07.156
I will be by God's side.

49:07.824 --> 49:09.742
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

49:10.369 --> 49:11.869
Good for you.

49:13.664 --> 49:15.373
You're mocking me.

49:15.499 --> 49:17.541
No, I almost envy you.

49:18.043 --> 49:19.585
It must be nice

49:20.545 --> 49:22.213
to be so certain.

49:22.422 --> 49:24.674
You're wrong about everything

49:24.716 --> 49:27.009
because you don't believe in God,

49:27.678 --> 49:30.721
but I have faith.
I trust in God's plan.

49:31.390 --> 49:32.431
Really?

49:32.557 --> 49:35.893
Then it must be God's plan
that you're on my table.

49:39.564 --> 49:43.359
Do you think it's God's will
that I'm about to kill you?

49:43.443 --> 49:45.903
God has nothing to do with this!

49:46.029 --> 49:48.114
You are wrapped in plastic

49:48.573 --> 49:50.616
because I want to kill you.

49:54.913 --> 49:56.872
This is not how it's supposed to be!

49:58.125 --> 50:00.918
Maybe this is exactly
how it's supposed to be.

50:04.923 --> 50:09.593
Maybe everything
is exactly as it should be.

50:19.938 --> 50:21.230
Oh, God.
