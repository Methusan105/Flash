<i>It's no accident
that Zach Hamilton is here.</i>

00:16.317 --> 00:18.027
<i>He's drawn to blood, like me.</i>

00:18.193 --> 00:20.947
And the arterial spurting here

00:21.113 --> 00:23.539
indicates that the killer severed

00:23.664 --> 00:25.975
the carotid artery
with the first stab.

00:26.243 --> 00:28.621
I'm promoting Miller to Sergeant.

00:28.787 --> 00:29.788
Are you fucking kidding me?

00:29.955 --> 00:31.666
You actually made me want this,

00:31.832 --> 00:33.543
and now you're gonna take it away.

00:33.709 --> 00:36.218
I just did a little research on you.

00:36.343 --> 00:38.423
You checked into me...
like a criminal.

00:38.589 --> 00:40.383
Hey, Niki...

00:40.549 --> 00:42.190
Dexter, this is Oliver.

00:42.315 --> 00:43.928
- Oliver, Dexter.
- Nice to meet you.

00:44.094 --> 00:45.847
Yeah, you too.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.642
Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.

00:49.808 --> 00:51.066
He deserves to die.

00:51.191 --> 00:53.980
Isn't that a little intolerant
coming from you?

00:54.146 --> 00:57.233
What if you were
to teach Zach the code?

00:57.399 --> 00:59.235
Maybe it's time to see

00:59.401 --> 01:01.242
if the experiment will work.

01:01.367 --> 01:04.324
What possibly makes you think
Zach could be taught the code?

01:04.490 --> 01:05.700
I see something in him.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.827
Why were you going
to kill your father?

01:07.993 --> 01:09.913
Because he's killing my mother.

01:10.079 --> 01:12.415
She's drinking herself to death
because of him.

01:12.581 --> 01:14.834
You killed because you want to kill.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.212
You should just go ahead and kill me.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.992
Why?

01:19.117 --> 01:21.294
'Cause if you don't,
then I will do it again.

01:21.419 --> 01:22.592

01:28.597 --> 01:32.268
- I don't feel so good.
- Deb?

01:35.900 --> 01:37.857

04:12.815 --> 04:14.091
I can't really talk now.

04:14.257 --> 04:17.960
I just thought you should know
that Zach Hamilton called.

04:18.085 --> 04:20.848
I'm so glad you decided
not to kill him, Dexter.

Deb, are you okay?

04:25.769 --> 04:27.188
Dex, where the fuck are you?

04:28.264 --> 04:29.762
Just a sec.

04:32.265 --> 04:34.820
I'm outside of Kendall.
Are you alone?

04:34.986 --> 04:35.810
Why wouldn't I be?

04:35.935 --> 04:37.865
Why are you
on the other side of town?

04:38.031 --> 04:39.658
I need you to come pick me up.

04:39.824 --> 04:40.825
Are you okay to drive?

04:40.992 --> 04:42.984
I think so.
I mean, who the fuck knows?

04:43.109 --> 04:46.954
I woke up on the floor
feeling like shit.

04:47.079 --> 04:48.456
You were gone.

04:48.581 --> 04:51.253
What the...
What the fuck is happening?

04:51.419 --> 04:53.127
<i>Just come pick me up.</i>

04:53.252 --> 04:54.428
<i>I'll text you the location.</i>

05:02.326 --> 05:05.392
<i>If she's come back because she
wants one or both of us dead,</i>

05:05.558 --> 05:08.532
<i>then why are we both still here?</i>

05:14.818 --> 05:16.237
It was Hannah, wasn't it?

05:16.403 --> 05:17.738
It was.

05:19.614 --> 05:21.754
I saw her before I blacked out,

05:21.879 --> 05:23.889
but then I woke up here.

05:24.014 --> 05:25.579
She must have drugged our food.

05:25.745 --> 05:28.594
If Hannah poisoned us,
why didn't she kill us?

05:28.719 --> 05:29.828
Who the fuck knows, Dexter?

05:29.953 --> 05:31.263
Maybe we were supposed to eat more.

05:31.543 --> 05:33.631
Or maybe she just wants
to let us know she's out there.

05:33.756 --> 05:35.956
Maybe this was just the beginning.

05:38.294 --> 05:39.470
If we were normal people, Dexter,

05:39.595 --> 05:42.573
we would go
to the U.S. Marshal Service.

05:42.698 --> 05:44.776
We can't do that.
She knows everything about me.

05:44.901 --> 05:45.976
Yeah, but she didn't talk about you

05:46.101 --> 05:47.226
the last time she was arrested.

05:47.392 --> 05:50.880
Because she was in love with me.

05:51.005 --> 05:52.849
Drugging me and leaving me
on the side of the road

05:52.974 --> 05:56.420
might suggest that's changed.

05:56.545 --> 06:00.190
So what the fuck
are we supposed to do?

06:00.315 --> 06:04.159
There are
traffic surveillance cameras.

06:04.325 --> 06:06.061
She had to have passed them.

06:06.186 --> 06:07.596
I'll put in a request
for the footage,

06:07.721 --> 06:08.706
get a license plate.

of my life was over.

06:18.198 --> 06:19.133
So did I.

06:22.902 --> 06:24.346
The moment I asked you to kill her

06:24.471 --> 06:26.481
was the moment that I started
to lose myself,

06:26.606 --> 06:29.560
and I'm just starting to get back.

06:32.278 --> 06:35.490
I don't want to deal with this.

06:35.615 --> 06:37.691
I want her gone.

06:37.816 --> 06:39.695
Deb, I'll take care of this.

You were supposed to meet me
at 10:00 this morning.

07:30.199 --> 07:30.996
I've been waiting all day.

07:31.162 --> 07:33.374
- You could have been followed.
- By who?

07:33.540 --> 07:36.347
Oh, Detective Quinn?
No, he's pretty easy to lose.

07:36.472 --> 07:38.921
But one day, he'll be there
when you don't expect him.

that I can do too.

and you needed a job.

if this cramps your style,

to try a little gratitude

such a fucking bitch.

who rented one of your vans

some information over the phone.

involved with another killer.

26:01.146 --> 26:03.485
- Well, she's back.
- Mm.

26:03.610 --> 26:04.620
And she poisoned us.

26:04.745 --> 26:05.985
Who knows what the fuck else
she has planned?

26:06.151 --> 26:07.422
What does Dexter say?

26:07.547 --> 26:09.197
He's trying to figure out
what else she's up to,

26:09.363 --> 26:11.574
but I'm afraid he's thinking
with the wrong head right now.

26:11.740 --> 26:12.784
You're concerned for your safety.

26:12.950 --> 26:14.410
And for Dexter's.

26:14.576 --> 26:16.531
Let's take a step back.

26:16.656 --> 26:18.199
From what you've told me,

26:18.324 --> 26:20.902
if she wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead by now.

26:21.027 --> 26:21.903
Well, maybe she just wants to prove

26:22.028 --> 26:23.085
that she has control,

26:23.251 --> 26:25.004
that she can kill us
whenever she wants to.

26:25.170 --> 26:26.881
It's a very unsettling
feeling, isn't it?

26:27.047 --> 26:27.790
Yeah, it is.

26:27.915 --> 26:29.133
So what is it you'd like to do?

26:29.299 --> 26:31.611
I would like to take her
to Marshal Services

26:31.736 --> 26:32.804
and have her the fuck arrested.

26:32.970 --> 26:36.884
- But Hannah knows too much.
- Yeah.

26:37.009 --> 26:38.185
But at least I wouldn't have to worry

26:38.310 --> 26:41.577
about what might or might not be
in my morning coffee.

26:43.547 --> 26:45.107
When the brain surgeon was out there,

26:45.273 --> 26:47.068
a threat to me,

26:47.234 --> 26:49.328
I-I could hardly sleep.

26:49.453 --> 26:51.698
I trusted Dexter
to solve the problem,

26:51.823 --> 26:55.467
and he did.

26:55.592 --> 26:58.303
[Sighs]

26:58.428 --> 26:59.580
And if I can't?

26:59.746 --> 27:02.174
Before you take matters
into your own hands,

27:02.299 --> 27:05.378
be sure to consider all the
consequences of those actions.

27:08.513 --> 27:11.116
<i>The husband is a complication
I don't need.</i>

27:11.241 --> 27:14.752
<i>I have to get Hannah alone,
in a situation I control.</i>

27:14.877 --> 27:16.821
[Knocking at door]

27:16.946 --> 27:19.141
Have you done the blood work
on the triple in Lummus Park?

27:19.307 --> 27:20.825
Not yet.

27:20.950 --> 27:23.646
There's the prints on the
pesticide bottle still to run

27:23.812 --> 27:24.862
and the decomp over in Coconut Grove

27:24.987 --> 27:26.442
- we still have to process.
- Yep.

27:26.567 --> 27:29.735
Whew, we could use
an extra set of hands, right?

27:31.486 --> 27:33.136
Someone lower level,

27:33.261 --> 27:34.938
an extra warm body
to offset all the cold ones.

27:35.063 --> 27:36.172
Don't you think?

27:36.297 --> 27:38.808
I mean, at least to make a dent
in the paperwork.

27:38.933 --> 27:39.954
Sure, I guess.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.957
Excellent idea.

27:49.921 --> 27:52.091
<i>Zach...
What's he doing here?</i>

27:57.151 --> 27:58.152
Quinn.

28:07.427 --> 28:08.524
Okay.

28:08.690 --> 28:11.569
My client requests
that you cease and desist

28:11.735 --> 28:14.488
this 24-hour watch you have on him.

28:14.654 --> 28:15.610
He requests it.

28:15.735 --> 28:16.866
I'd like you to back the fuck off.

28:30.629 --> 28:32.048
You took these photos, Zach?

28:32.214 --> 28:35.009
Yeah, and those
are just the best ones.

28:35.175 --> 28:36.594
Quinn, do you have anything to say?

28:36.760 --> 28:37.762
Yeah, I think the kid's guilty.

28:37.928 --> 28:39.889
I'll answer for you, Detective Quinn.

28:40.055 --> 28:41.307
On behalf of the entire department,

28:41.473 --> 28:42.975
I can assure you that we will...

28:43.141 --> 28:44.397
Well, how did you put it, Zach?

28:44.522 --> 28:45.770
"Back the fuck down."

28:45.936 --> 28:47.355
- "Off."
- Yeah, that too.

28:47.914 --> 28:49.774
Right, Detective Quinn?

28:49.940 --> 28:52.224
- Right.
- That's right.

28:52.349 --> 28:56.113
Gentlemen, let me show you out.

29:01.910 --> 29:03.746
What the fuck were you thinking?

29:03.912 --> 29:05.289
That rich asshole
is walking around, free.

29:05.455 --> 29:06.582
We have nothing on this kid.

29:06.748 --> 29:07.992
That's why I was following him.

29:08.117 --> 29:09.251
Yeah, if this was any other case,

29:09.417 --> 29:11.295
I would personally sign off
on the overtime.

29:11.461 --> 29:14.665
But this one...

29:14.790 --> 29:15.758
Let it go.

29:15.924 --> 29:18.126
That's an order.

29:20.804 --> 29:23.724
By the way, me and Jamie
are moving in together.

29:23.890 --> 29:25.443
You're what?
You're doing what?

29:25.568 --> 29:26.519
Hey, uh, you got a minute?

29:26.685 --> 29:28.145
Uh, make it fast.

29:28.270 --> 29:30.439
Okay, well, Dexter and I
are buried in that glass box.

29:30.605 --> 29:31.774
We need an assistant.

29:31.940 --> 29:32.783
I don't know about that.

29:32.908 --> 29:33.984
Wait, hold on,
we've been under budget

29:34.109 --> 29:35.528
the last three quarters.

29:35.694 --> 29:37.530
- It was Dexter's idea.
- Okay.

29:37.696 --> 29:40.891
Part-time.

29:41.016 --> 29:42.326
You're one hell of a lieutenant.

29:44.051 --> 29:45.527
[Siren wails in distance]

29:45.652 --> 29:48.588
[Police radio chatter]

29:52.919 --> 29:56.882
The photos were a nice touch.

29:59.384 --> 30:02.944
Thanks.
I thought so.

30:03.069 --> 30:05.113
Well, now he's off my tail.

30:05.238 --> 30:07.816
We can get down to business.

30:07.941 --> 30:10.676
Find someone to... you know.

30:10.801 --> 30:12.453
Eventually.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.522
What do you mean, "eventually"?

30:14.647 --> 30:18.058
I mean...

30:18.183 --> 30:21.295
Long before my father taught me
how to do what I do,

30:21.420 --> 30:24.631
he taught me how not to do it.

30:24.756 --> 30:27.067
Why would I want to not do it?

30:27.192 --> 30:29.670
Timing is everything.

30:29.795 --> 30:30.971
One thing you need to learn...

30:31.096 --> 30:33.907
The first thing that I had to learn...

30:34.032 --> 30:35.909
is to wait.

30:36.034 --> 30:38.178
Control your urges.

30:38.303 --> 30:40.926
Channel them appropriately.

30:42.407 --> 30:43.971
Dexter, I can't wait.

30:44.137 --> 30:45.850
I can't control it.

30:46.320 --> 30:48.854
Yes, you can.

30:48.979 --> 30:51.824
You're gonna get your chance,
Zach, I promise...

30:51.949 --> 30:53.792
but the only way I've survived
as long as I have

30:53.917 --> 30:55.493
is by being careful.

30:55.618 --> 30:58.030
I'm gonna teach you how to do that.

30:58.155 --> 30:59.631
And then?

30:59.756 --> 31:02.968
And then you'll be able
to do what I do

31:03.093 --> 31:04.200
and get away with it.

31:20.131 --> 31:24.095
[Beeping]

31:33.788 --> 31:34.814
What do you want?

31:34.980 --> 31:36.565
I saw you with your son.

31:36.731 --> 31:39.804
Maggie never mentioned him.

31:39.929 --> 31:41.612
Hard to picture her
as the family type.

31:41.778 --> 31:43.906
There's nothing going on
between Hannah and me.

31:44.031 --> 31:45.207
Good.
Then listen.

31:45.490 --> 31:47.576
I'd sooner see her in prison
than lose her.

31:47.742 --> 31:49.745
Do you understand?

31:49.911 --> 31:51.580
Because I could call a few people

31:51.705 --> 31:52.873
and ruin your life.

31:53.039 --> 31:54.916
And being a family man,

31:55.041 --> 31:58.019
I'm sure that's not what you'd want.

31:58.144 --> 32:01.155
[Car horn honking]

[Engine starts]

32:14.519 --> 32:15.735
Dexter, what are you doing?

32:16.021 --> 32:18.899
This is something you don't want
to get in the middle of.

32:22.569 --> 32:26.312
He said he'd sooner see her
in prison than lose her.

32:26.437 --> 32:27.947
If that's what he thinks
this is about,

32:28.072 --> 32:29.577
she's the one in danger.

32:29.743 --> 32:30.884
I thought you were going to find out

32:31.009 --> 32:33.486
if Hannah was a threat
to you and Debra,

32:33.611 --> 32:34.788
not if Miles was a threat

32:34.913 --> 32:37.626
to Hannah.
[Phone vibrates]

32:39.350 --> 32:41.755
Why can't I do both?

33:14.783 --> 33:15.933
Your flowers.

33:18.152 --> 33:19.329
That's the thing about plants.

33:19.454 --> 33:21.137
You don't look after 'em, they die.

33:27.263 --> 33:30.262
So... what's up?

33:30.428 --> 33:34.141
Miles just confronted me
at a gas station.

33:34.307 --> 33:37.572
God.
He likes to be dramatic.

33:37.697 --> 33:39.355
Is he a threat?

33:39.521 --> 33:43.118
A "chop you up and toss you
in the ocean" kind of threat?

33:43.243 --> 33:45.186
No.

33:45.311 --> 33:46.955
But he could
make your life miserable,

33:47.080 --> 33:48.447
have people look into you

33:48.613 --> 33:51.392
and follow you around 24/7.

33:51.517 --> 33:53.160
He sounds like a great guy.

33:53.285 --> 33:56.497
And you're really
in a position to judge?

33:56.622 --> 33:57.748
Why did you marry him?

33:57.914 --> 33:59.657
Because he was there
when you weren't.

34:02.810 --> 34:05.381
I needed him, Dexter.

34:05.547 --> 34:07.140
I met him a few years ago

34:07.265 --> 34:09.342
when I did some flowers for him
at an event,

34:09.509 --> 34:13.138
and he found
my background intriguing.

34:13.304 --> 34:15.057
I could tell that he had
a bit of a crush on me,

34:15.223 --> 34:17.249
so when I made my little escape
and when I had nothing

34:17.374 --> 34:18.484
and when I was desperate,

34:18.609 --> 34:20.786
I knew that he could give me
a whole new life,

34:20.911 --> 34:22.106
a new identity,

34:22.272 --> 34:23.273
money.

34:25.682 --> 34:27.382
Plus, he makes me happy.

34:29.686 --> 34:30.572
Bullshit.

34:30.738 --> 34:33.098
If you're so damn happy,

34:33.223 --> 34:34.410
what are you doing back here?

34:34.576 --> 34:36.662
Why did you drug Debra and me?

34:36.828 --> 34:38.580
- You know, I think you should go.
- No, answer me.

34:38.746 --> 34:40.171
I wanted to make sure

34:40.296 --> 34:41.572
that you weren't gonna
put me in jail.

34:41.697 --> 34:43.335
I had to see if you would come to me.

34:43.501 --> 34:45.004
Which I did, and you still
haven't told me why.

34:45.170 --> 34:47.245
Because it doesn't matter why
anymore.

34:47.370 --> 34:48.246
I changed my mind.

34:48.371 --> 34:50.671
About what?

34:52.741 --> 34:55.431
I wanted you to kill Miles for me.

34:59.063 --> 34:59.893
You what?

35:02.569 --> 35:04.994
He's possessive and controlling

35:05.119 --> 35:06.395
and obsessed with me to the point

35:06.520 --> 35:07.630
where he follows me everywhere.

35:07.755 --> 35:09.583
I might as well be in prison.

35:11.321 --> 35:12.168
If I were to try and leave him,

35:12.293 --> 35:14.783
he would... he would just turn me in.

35:14.949 --> 35:16.806
Why haven't you dealt
with this in your usual way?

35:16.931 --> 35:17.911
Because his family already thought

35:18.077 --> 35:19.341
that I was some kind of gold digger

35:19.466 --> 35:20.376
when we got married.

35:20.501 --> 35:21.915
If he was gonna drop dead suddenly,

35:22.081 --> 35:22.801
for no reason,

35:22.926 --> 35:24.710
I would be the first person
that they would turn to.

35:24.876 --> 35:26.378
And once the cops get
a good look at me...

35:26.544 --> 35:28.547
You wanted me to make him disappear.

35:32.112 --> 35:34.011
I thought you might feel
like you owed me.

35:34.177 --> 35:35.929
- Owed you?
- You didn't have to turn me in.

35:36.616 --> 35:38.349
- You ruined my life.
- I did...

35:38.515 --> 35:40.267
You know, it doesn't even
matter anymore,

35:40.433 --> 35:41.595
because like I said,
I changed my mind.

35:41.720 --> 35:42.895
And this is my problem,

35:43.061 --> 35:44.271
and I'm gonna find
a way to deal with it.

35:44.437 --> 35:47.301
Why did you change your mind?

35:47.426 --> 35:49.870
Because the moment that
I saw you there, unconscious,

35:49.995 --> 35:51.005
I realized that,

35:51.130 --> 35:52.806
despite the shitty way
that it all ended,

35:52.931 --> 35:55.833
you were it for me, Dexter.

35:58.045 --> 36:02.849
I've never felt that way
about anyone before or since.

36:02.974 --> 36:04.249
[Sighs]

36:04.415 --> 36:08.378
You're the only person
that I can be that honest with.

36:11.198 --> 36:12.725
And I didn't want to ruin that

36:12.850 --> 36:15.761
by manipulating you
into doing something

36:15.886 --> 36:18.472
that might be bad for you.

36:24.461 --> 36:27.395
It was the same for me.

36:30.266 --> 36:31.652
No, just leave it at that.

36:31.818 --> 36:33.778
I have to go before Miles
finds out where I've gone.

36:33.945 --> 36:36.990
- Hannah...
- Good-bye.

36:39.608 --> 36:43.288
[Sighs]

[Knocking on glass]

36:44.622 --> 36:45.756
Hey.

36:45.881 --> 36:49.860
Um, can I borrow that
high-tech G.P.S. tracker thingy

36:49.985 --> 36:50.546
that you have?

36:52.666 --> 36:53.382
Please?

36:55.007 --> 36:55.801
Yeah.

36:55.967 --> 36:57.933
Being nice
when you need something, huh?

36:58.058 --> 36:59.644
I'm not surprised.

37:04.339 --> 37:07.980
Sorry that I overreacted earlier.

37:08.146 --> 37:12.067
I know that you're interested.

37:12.233 --> 37:13.882
You act like you are.

37:14.007 --> 37:16.905
But, Jake, you don't want
to get involved with me.

37:17.071 --> 37:18.866
You have no idea who I really am.

37:19.032 --> 37:22.327
I just want a chance to find out.

37:42.805 --> 37:45.184
Can I help you?
Is that your car?

37:45.350 --> 37:48.647
Um, it... it's my brother's car.

37:48.772 --> 37:50.917
I think I left my sunglasses
in the passenger seat,

37:51.042 --> 37:52.399
and he's not answering his phone.
