00:10.260 --> 00:11.808
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

00:12.254 --> 00:13.354
What did you do to Yates?

00:13.389 --> 00:14.689
He has a scar
on his head exactly

00:14.723 --> 00:17.659
where your killer has
been harvesting brain fragments.

00:17.903 --> 00:20.738
High heels are a far cry
from brains.

00:20.773 --> 00:23.041
It's not exactly
your killer's usual M.O.

00:23.075 --> 00:25.410
Albert wouldn't be the first
to alter his methods.

00:25.444 --> 00:28.046
She found herself a hero.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.747
I know her—

00:29.782 --> 00:31.049
Janet Thorton.

00:31.083 --> 00:32.644
Do you think the girl
will be all right?

00:32.651 --> 00:33.718
I stemmed the bleeding.

00:33.752 --> 00:35.253
I dropped her off
in front of the E.R.

00:35.287 --> 00:37.455
These are patient files—

00:37.489 --> 00:39.424
- your patient files.
- Dexter, don't.

00:39.458 --> 00:41.292
"Somehow he's deluded himself

00:41.327 --> 00:44.796
into thinking his feelings
for his sister are genuine."

00:44.830 --> 00:46.798
You're trying to keep me
apart from Deb.

00:46.832 --> 00:49.067
That's another way
to isolate your subject—

00:49.101 --> 00:50.501
see what he'll do.

00:50.536 --> 00:52.036
When Yates is dead,

00:52.071 --> 00:55.073
you are out of my life.

00:55.107 --> 00:56.741
You understand?

00:56.775 --> 00:58.076
What about you?

00:58.110 --> 00:59.811
What makes you crazy?

00:59.845 --> 01:00.945
Family shit.

01:00.979 --> 01:04.315
Nothing says family like shit.

01:04.350 --> 01:06.951
I see a lot
of your father in you.

01:06.985 --> 01:10.455
Harry wrestled with the same
doubts regarding Dexter.

01:10.489 --> 01:12.690
The code is a theory.

01:12.725 --> 01:15.760
What Dexter did—
what we did—

01:15.794 --> 01:17.628
I don't think
I can live with this.

01:17.663 --> 01:19.430
Did dad kill himself?

01:19.465 --> 01:21.466
He OD'd on
his heart medication,

01:21.500 --> 01:23.701
thought he'd created a monster.

01:23.736 --> 01:25.503
I think I know how he felt.

01:25.537 --> 01:27.372
But he only got it half right.

03:58.185 --> 03:59.852
Well, we're never
gonna get anywhere

03:59.856 --> 04:03.988
unless one of you
starts talking.

04:05.191 --> 04:08.494
Okay.

04:08.528 --> 04:11.530
Debra, it seems that
you tried to kill Dexter

04:11.564 --> 04:15.434
as well as yourself.

04:15.468 --> 04:19.805
Yes, but then I saved him.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.106
You saved me?

04:21.141 --> 04:23.375
You only had to save me
because you tried to kill me.

04:23.409 --> 04:24.476
I know, but—

04:24.511 --> 04:26.211
You almost left my son
an orphan.

04:26.246 --> 04:28.814
Harrison—who's gonna
take care of him?

04:28.848 --> 04:30.883
Who?

04:33.353 --> 04:34.586
I don't know.

04:34.621 --> 04:36.788
All I've done my whole life

04:36.823 --> 04:39.024
is try to take care of you,
to protect you.

04:39.058 --> 04:40.959
Protect—
Jesus Christ, Dexter.

04:40.994 --> 04:42.594
If this is your way
of protecting me—

04:42.629 --> 04:45.831
Okay, so I'm not perfect!

04:45.865 --> 04:47.766
You think it's easy
being your brother?

04:47.800 --> 04:49.468
You're not even
listening to me.

04:49.502 --> 04:50.802
Y-you don't understand.

04:50.837 --> 04:52.938
I've been trapped
in a fucking fog—

04:52.972 --> 04:54.606
No, I don't understand.

04:54.641 --> 04:57.042
Haven't you heard
anything she said?

04:57.076 --> 04:58.744
I'm stupid that way.

04:58.778 --> 05:00.045
My brain is limited.

05:00.079 --> 05:01.613
So when my sister
tries to kill me,

05:01.648 --> 05:05.083
for some reason
it doesn't make sense.

05:05.118 --> 05:08.187
It's true, Dexter,
what she said.

05:08.221 --> 05:09.922
While in the throws of PTSD:

05:09.956 --> 05:13.225
one's thinking becomes cloudy.

05:13.259 --> 05:15.394
The weight of what
she has been through

05:15.428 --> 05:17.629
has been too much
for her to bear.

05:17.664 --> 05:20.999
Debra has been
in such a turmoil

05:21.034 --> 05:22.734
that she sought out
the first solution

05:22.769 --> 05:24.269
that presented itself.

05:24.304 --> 05:25.370
I had just found out

05:25.405 --> 05:28.607
that dad killed himself
because of you,

05:28.641 --> 05:31.710
'cause of what you are.

05:31.744 --> 05:35.747
I was fucking traumatized
by all this shit.

05:35.782 --> 05:36.882
Yeah, so try to kill us both.

05:36.916 --> 05:39.184
That solves everything.

05:41.254 --> 05:42.788
You are overlooking
an important part

05:42.822 --> 05:44.723
of what happened, Dexter.

05:44.757 --> 05:47.226
Yes, she tried to kill you,
the both of you.

05:47.260 --> 05:50.062
And that was Debra
hitting rock bottom.

05:50.096 --> 05:53.465
But ultimately, as she said,
she saved you.

05:53.499 --> 05:58.203
And that was Debra's
first step toward recovery.

05:58.238 --> 05:59.638
You should see that
as a promising sign

05:59.672 --> 06:01.540
for your sister.

06:01.574 --> 06:04.543
Great.

06:06.746 --> 06:10.148
I'm so fuckin' happy for you.

06:11.384 --> 06:13.051
You know, I was trying
to catch a serial killer

06:13.086 --> 06:14.553
before you tried to drown me.

06:14.587 --> 06:16.455
If it's okay, I think
I'm gonna get back to that,

06:16.489 --> 06:18.223
which, according to you,
is all I'm really good for.

06:18.258 --> 06:19.858
Don't, Dexter.

06:19.892 --> 06:22.828
To hell with both of you.

06:24.097 --> 06:26.999
Don't forget to write
all this down.

06:32.472 --> 06:34.473
I've never seen him so mad.

06:34.507 --> 06:36.875
That wasn't just anger.

06:36.909 --> 06:39.144
- Fuck, it wasn't?
- No.

06:39.178 --> 06:41.680
Underneath all that is hurt.

06:41.714 --> 06:46.118
Dexter is deeply hurt
by what you did.

06:46.152 --> 06:49.421
Well, that makes two of us.

06:49.455 --> 06:52.391
Family therapy—
who needs it?

06:56.296 --> 06:58.864
Family—a burden.

06:58.898 --> 07:00.399
They interfere.

07:01.701 --> 07:04.736
They annoy.

07:04.771 --> 07:06.305
Daddy, I wanna watch cartoons.

07:06.339 --> 07:07.673
They interrupt.

07:07.707 --> 07:09.441
No, you need to get ready
for school.

07:09.475 --> 07:10.776
I wanna watch cartoons.

07:10.810 --> 07:12.477
School.

07:12.512 --> 07:13.633
Yates could be anywhere now.

07:13.646 --> 07:14.880
He could've left Miami.

07:14.914 --> 07:16.181
Dexter, do you have
any plans for tonight?

07:17.850 --> 07:21.787
Um, not sure.

07:24.357 --> 07:25.357
Dexter Morgan.

07:25.391 --> 07:26.752
Please leave a message
at the tone.

07:26.759 --> 07:30.028
It's me. Can we talk?

07:31.698 --> 07:33.265
Fuck.

07:33.299 --> 07:35.067
Harrison, apple or banana?

07:35.101 --> 07:36.435
Banana.

07:36.469 --> 07:40.005
I was thinking of having
Cassie over for dinner.

07:40.039 --> 07:41.506
Okay, go ahead.

07:41.541 --> 07:44.176
- I mean here.
- Why?

07:44.210 --> 07:46.278
I think you'd hit it off.

07:46.312 --> 07:47.846
Five minutes of cartoons.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.014
No minutes of cartoons.

07:49.048 --> 07:50.415
You need to get dressed.

07:50.450 --> 07:52.017
So is that a yes?

07:52.051 --> 07:53.185
Is what a yes?

07:53.219 --> 07:54.586
Dinner tonight.

07:54.620 --> 07:56.121
Two minutes of cartoons?

07:56.155 --> 07:58.090
Harrison, this is not
a negotiation here.

07:58.124 --> 07:59.524
- Now.
- 8:00?

07:59.559 --> 08:00.992
Please, please, please?

08:01.027 --> 08:03.695
Yeah, fine.
Harrison, last warning.

08:14.307 --> 08:17.242
- I gotta go.
- Okay, bye.

08:25.985 --> 08:27.619
This is one of the first days

08:27.653 --> 08:30.622
I'm glad Deb isn't here.

08:34.160 --> 08:35.594
I can lock myself in the lab

08:35.628 --> 08:38.063
and don't have to listen
to anyone's voice but my own.

08:38.097 --> 08:40.532
We gotta go
to the briefing room.

08:40.566 --> 08:42.334
Now?

08:42.368 --> 08:43.902
Now would be good.

08:55.715 --> 08:57.682
You're probably wondering
why I'm smiling.

08:57.717 --> 08:59.684
I'm never wondering
why you're smiling.

08:59.719 --> 09:02.654
I've just confirmed
that I have a daughter.

09:02.688 --> 09:05.190
Someone let you
impregnate them?

09:05.224 --> 09:07.826
Made a donation
to a sperm bank 20 years ago.

09:07.860 --> 09:08.860
You're not saying there's

09:08.861 --> 09:10.429
a female version
of you out there?

09:10.463 --> 09:13.265
Oh, uh, you met her.
Niki—the one you showed in.

09:13.299 --> 09:14.399
That hot chick that
was in your lab?

09:14.434 --> 09:16.234
- No fuckin' way.
- Yes way.

09:16.269 --> 09:18.336
That beautiful girl
came from you?

09:18.371 --> 09:20.472
Yes, indeed.

09:20.506 --> 09:21.706
Are you sure she's yours?

09:21.741 --> 09:23.141
Man, come on,
who you talking to here?

09:23.176 --> 09:25.043
She came in with
the required paperwork.

09:25.077 --> 09:26.545
I even pulled
a piece of her hair.

09:26.579 --> 09:27.813
I just finished testing it.

09:27.847 --> 09:29.948
She's a Masuka,
through and through.

09:29.982 --> 09:31.716
That poor sweet child.

09:31.751 --> 09:34.319
So you and me, Dex, both dads.

09:34.353 --> 09:36.288
How about that?

09:36.322 --> 09:38.757
Great news, Vince.

09:38.791 --> 09:40.258
You know, I'm sure
it's all fine,

09:40.293 --> 09:42.060
but just be careful, you know?

09:42.094 --> 09:45.163
Family showing up like that,
out of nowhere?

09:45.198 --> 09:47.032
Yeah. What do you mean?

09:47.066 --> 09:48.233
Sometimes it's just 'cause

09:48.267 --> 09:49.534
they want something, you know?

09:49.569 --> 09:53.738
Money, a place to stay,
a fuckin' kidney.

09:53.773 --> 09:56.875
Or they wanna kill you.

09:56.909 --> 09:58.243
Lieutenant Batista is currently

09:58.277 --> 10:00.912
with Janet Thorton,
the stabbing victim

10:00.947 --> 10:02.848
who was dropped off
at the hospital.

10:02.882 --> 10:05.050
She finally came to and
is ready to make a statement.

10:05.084 --> 10:06.017
She survived.

10:06.052 --> 10:08.086
One less trophy for Yates.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.688
So I'm running the briefing.

10:09.722 --> 10:11.957
The Norma Rivera case—

10:11.991 --> 10:13.258
the victim had sex with someone

10:13.292 --> 10:14.826
shortly before she was killed.

10:14.861 --> 10:16.127
So we're following
the theory that

10:16.162 --> 10:18.530
whoever she had sex with
is also her killer.

10:18.564 --> 10:21.233
Dexter, were you able to
identify anyone via the semen?

10:21.267 --> 10:24.236
Uh, no matches in any
of the criminal databases.

10:24.270 --> 10:26.104
Whoever had relations
with Ms. Rivera

10:26.138 --> 10:27.873
has never been arrested.

10:27.907 --> 10:30.108
Right, and the M.E.'s report
showed no defensive wounds?

10:30.142 --> 10:32.978
Correct. It's most likely
not a rape.

10:33.012 --> 10:35.747
She was probably friendly
with whoever killed her.

10:35.781 --> 10:38.316
What about the ex-boyfriend?

10:38.351 --> 10:39.551
No, sir, we ruled him out.

10:39.585 --> 10:40.745
He's been locked up in Orlando

10:40.753 --> 10:42.687
for the past week
on assault charge.

10:42.722 --> 10:45.824
We questioned the staff of
Ms. Rivera's former employers.

10:45.858 --> 10:47.192
They led us to believe
she'd been

10:47.226 --> 10:50.896
having an affair
with the boss Ed Hamilton.

10:50.930 --> 10:52.230
When we tried to speak to him,

10:52.265 --> 10:54.299
he lawyered up immediately.

10:54.333 --> 10:57.202
So we got a court order
to compel a DNA sample from him,

10:57.236 --> 10:59.671
to see if Hamilton
was Rivera's last visitor.

10:59.705 --> 11:01.640
You think Hamilton
killed Norma,

11:01.674 --> 11:03.942
to cover up their affair?

11:03.976 --> 11:05.377
We're looking into it,
you know?

11:05.411 --> 11:06.711
Old, rich men don't like

11:06.746 --> 11:08.480
having their
dirty laundry aired,

11:08.514 --> 11:10.081
especially when it's the maid.

11:10.116 --> 11:11.650
Dexter, I'm gonna need you
to join

11:11.684 --> 11:14.152
me and Miller
in paying Hamilton a visit.

11:14.186 --> 11:16.988
Okay, Janet Thorton gave us
the name of her abductor.

11:17.023 --> 11:18.957
Albert Yates.
And we got a home address.

11:18.991 --> 11:21.726
I'm grabbing some unis now
and heading over there.

11:21.761 --> 11:23.395
You won't find him home.

11:23.429 --> 11:26.264
All right, let's get moving.

11:29.101 --> 11:30.936
- Lieutenant, got a minute?
- Yeah.

11:30.970 --> 11:33.004
I noticed you had Quinn
run the briefing.

11:33.039 --> 11:35.507
- Oh, yeah, how'd he do?
- He was fine.

11:35.541 --> 11:37.609
Really? Good.

11:37.643 --> 11:40.579
Is he your choice for sergeant?

11:40.613 --> 11:42.747
I haven't yet
made that decision.

11:42.782 --> 11:44.182
For what it's worth,
I used to run

11:44.183 --> 11:46.117
the morning briefings
back in the gang unit.

11:46.152 --> 11:49.187
I'm ready to take on
more responsibility.

11:49.221 --> 11:52.123
Good to know. Thanks.

12:09.141 --> 12:10.781
I just wanna make sure
you're aware that

12:11.744 --> 12:15.647
the Hamiltons are good friends
to Miami Metro.

12:15.681 --> 12:18.650
Sure.

12:22.421 --> 12:24.556
Be respectful.

12:24.590 --> 12:28.159
Any of Mr. Hamilton's
indiscretions

12:28.194 --> 12:29.928
should take a back seat

12:29.962 --> 12:33.898
to solving
Ms. Rivera's murder.

12:33.933 --> 12:37.035
I understand.

12:37.069 --> 12:39.838
Good.

12:53.252 --> 12:56.254
We're here for Mr. Hamilton.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.734
- Mr. Hamilton.
- Mm-hmm?

13:09.769 --> 13:12.704
These police officers
are here to see you.

13:15.141 --> 13:17.976
Thank you, Claudia.

13:18.010 --> 13:19.344
I thought my lawyer
made it clear

13:19.378 --> 13:21.179
I wouldn't be speaking to you.

13:21.213 --> 13:22.547
You don't have to say a word.

13:22.581 --> 13:24.716
We're just here
for a cheek swab.

13:24.750 --> 13:27.152
- A what?
- It's a DNA sample.

13:27.186 --> 13:28.420
We do have a warrant.

13:28.454 --> 13:29.734
Failure to cooperate
will give us

13:29.755 --> 13:30.955
no choice but to arrest you.

13:30.990 --> 13:32.524
Why do you need my DNA?

13:32.558 --> 13:34.159
Ms. Rivera's autopsy
revealed

13:34.193 --> 13:35.794
she recently
had sexual relations.

13:35.828 --> 13:38.963
My forensics partner is here
to see if it was with you.

13:38.998 --> 13:41.966
Wait, wait.
There's no need for a test.

13:46.305 --> 13:48.673
Norma and I were
having an affair.

13:48.708 --> 13:52.110
My wife found out and
insisted she be dismissed.

13:52.144 --> 13:54.879
A scorned spouse—
was it the wife?

13:54.914 --> 13:56.281
So your wife knew?

13:56.315 --> 13:57.882
Just how upset was she?

13:57.917 --> 13:59.517
No, no, no—my wife's
been in Atlanta

13:59.552 --> 14:01.986
visiting her sister
for the past two weeks.

14:02.021 --> 14:03.455
Oh, right, which is
giving you a little time

14:03.489 --> 14:04.656
to visit Ms. Rivera.

14:04.690 --> 14:06.224
No. Yes.

14:06.258 --> 14:10.195
I mean, I didn't visit her.

14:10.229 --> 14:12.864
She came by here to pick up
a few things she left behind,

14:12.898 --> 14:16.134
and... one thing
led to another,

14:16.168 --> 14:20.972
and, uh, we did
have sex that day.

14:21.006 --> 14:25.143
But she left here alive.

14:25.177 --> 14:27.045
You, uh, didn't visit
her apartment

14:27.079 --> 14:28.713
later that day, did you?

14:28.748 --> 14:29.748
I was here all day.

14:29.782 --> 14:31.349
The Hamiltons' son.

14:31.383 --> 14:33.118
Can anyone corroborate that?

14:33.152 --> 14:36.187
Dad?

14:37.957 --> 14:39.891
- Dad, what's going on?
- Go inside.

14:39.925 --> 14:41.085
You want me to call someone?

14:41.093 --> 14:42.093
I don't want you
to do anything.

14:42.128 --> 14:45.063
Go inside.

14:46.866 --> 14:49.200
All right.

14:51.670 --> 14:53.204
Sorry about that.

14:53.239 --> 14:54.339
Where were we?

14:54.373 --> 14:55.774
You were saying you have proof

14:55.808 --> 14:57.609
that Ms. Rivera
left the premises.

14:57.643 --> 14:59.144
My security cameras—

14:59.178 --> 15:00.945
you'll see Norma
arrive and leave

15:00.980 --> 15:04.582
through the main gate, alone.

15:04.617 --> 15:07.585
I never, ever would hurt Norma.

15:10.556 --> 15:13.558
I loved her.

15:16.762 --> 15:19.731
But does he love his son?

15:23.769 --> 15:26.738
It's Deb.

15:29.809 --> 15:31.810
Hello—

15:31.844 --> 15:34.813
Damn it.

15:45.691 --> 15:47.792
Hey.

15:47.827 --> 15:50.161
Hey.

15:50.196 --> 15:53.832
So you're, like,
what, the DNA guy?

15:53.866 --> 15:55.834
I'm a forensic technician,

15:55.868 --> 15:58.937
specializing in
blood spatter analysis.

15:58.971 --> 16:01.272
Whoa.

16:01.307 --> 16:03.208
So, did you go to the place

16:03.242 --> 16:05.143
where Norma Rivera was killed?

16:05.177 --> 16:06.978
I did.

16:07.012 --> 16:08.780
And what did you see

16:08.814 --> 16:13.618
in, you know, your analysis?

16:13.652 --> 16:16.888
She was beaten to death.

16:16.922 --> 16:20.491
Confidential, huh?

16:20.526 --> 16:22.193
Well, for what it's worth,

16:22.228 --> 16:24.996
you're wasting your time
investigating my dad.

16:25.030 --> 16:29.000
He's an asshole,
but not a killer.

16:29.034 --> 16:31.502
That's quite a testament.

16:31.537 --> 16:34.472
In my family, it's about
as good as it gets.

16:41.447 --> 16:44.382
One more happy family.

You've reached
Dr. Evelyn Vogel.

17:28.427 --> 17:29.794
I'm not available at this time.

17:29.828 --> 17:30.995
Please leave a message.

17:32.064 --> 17:33.364
Dr. Vogel, it's Debra.

17:33.399 --> 17:37.869
I'm—I need
to talk to you, so...

17:39.672 --> 17:41.272
I'm gonna come by.

17:57.356 --> 17:59.691
Dr. Vogel?

17:59.725 --> 18:00.758
Oh, fuck.

18:03.595 --> 18:06.497
Graves marked
by rosebushes—

18:06.532 --> 18:08.566
Yates's previous victims.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.569
He liked to keep them close.

18:11.603 --> 18:13.137
Three bodies so far—

18:13.172 --> 18:15.907
a rosebush planted
on top of each.

18:15.941 --> 18:17.575
You think there are three more?

18:17.609 --> 18:18.743
Count on it.

18:18.777 --> 18:20.445
The sick bastard
turned his basement

18:20.479 --> 18:23.548
into a torture room.

18:23.582 --> 18:26.150
Yo, Dex, check this out.

18:26.185 --> 18:29.821
All of his victims
have broken phalanges.

18:29.855 --> 18:32.991
And it looks like the bones
were broken in sequence,

18:33.025 --> 18:34.492
not all at once.

18:34.526 --> 18:38.629
Look. This bone here had
begun the process of mending.

18:38.664 --> 18:41.132
So he kept him there
in that room for what, weeks?

18:41.166 --> 18:42.533
It looks like it.
He broke each one

18:42.568 --> 18:44.902
of their toes until
he was done, and then—

18:44.937 --> 18:48.039
Finished them off with
a single stab to the chest.

18:48.073 --> 18:50.508
We think this was
one of his first victims.

18:50.542 --> 18:52.410
We believe it's Kendall Jaynes,

18:52.444 --> 18:54.912
been missing since 2008.

18:54.947 --> 18:57.849
He buries the victims'
purses and IDs

18:57.883 --> 18:59.050
with the bodies.

18:59.084 --> 19:03.521
And, get this, with each one,
the left shoe.

19:03.555 --> 19:08.226
I mean, heh, I like feet,
but this is just cray-cray.

19:08.260 --> 19:09.927
- Deb...
- Started about 20 minutes ago.

19:09.962 --> 19:11.529
Lookin' to get
your old job back?

19:11.563 --> 19:12.897
We could use you.
We have six bodies.

19:12.931 --> 19:15.099
No, I need to talk to Dexter.

19:15.134 --> 19:18.202
Dex.

19:18.237 --> 19:19.837
Thanks.
Deb, this isn't—

19:19.872 --> 19:22.840
It's an emergency.
Vogel's been taken.

19:28.514 --> 19:30.081
What do you mean
she's been taken?

19:30.115 --> 19:31.682
I went to her house.
Someone had smashed the window.

19:31.717 --> 19:32.984
They broke in.
She's gone.

19:33.018 --> 19:34.519
Have you called her?

19:34.553 --> 19:36.587
Fuckin' dozen times, no answer.

19:36.622 --> 19:38.890
It's Yates.
He's still in Miami.

19:38.924 --> 19:40.258
I shoulda killed him already.

19:40.292 --> 19:41.826
- I wanna help you.
- No.

19:41.860 --> 19:43.694
- Dexter—
- Deb, you tried helping me

19:43.729 --> 19:45.363
once before, it didn't
work out so well.

19:45.397 --> 19:46.697
That was about killing someone.

19:46.732 --> 19:48.433
- This is about saving someone.
- It's dangerous.

19:48.467 --> 19:50.334
I fuckin' know it's dangerous.

19:50.369 --> 19:52.637
Vogel's life is at stake.

19:52.671 --> 19:54.205
You can hate me
for the rest of your life,

19:54.239 --> 19:55.740
but for right now can we
just set that aside

19:55.774 --> 19:56.974
until we know that she's okay?

19:57.009 --> 19:59.977
I don't hate you.

20:09.121 --> 20:10.221
Why'd you save me?

20:10.255 --> 20:12.490
Why didn't you let me drown?

20:19.364 --> 20:22.333
I saw the car going underwater.

20:25.304 --> 20:28.239
I knew you were gonna die.

20:31.410 --> 20:34.345
I couldn't imagine my life
without you in it.

20:45.691 --> 20:49.293
So now what—everything
just goes back to normal?

20:49.328 --> 20:53.865
It was never normal.

20:53.899 --> 20:55.166
I need to do this.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.702
I-I really need to help.

21:03.408 --> 21:07.078
We need to find Vogel.

21:14.786 --> 21:16.654
We should bring the police
in on this.

21:16.688 --> 21:17.889
They're already doing
everything they can

21:17.923 --> 21:20.725
to find Yates.

21:20.759 --> 21:23.995
This is his work log.

21:24.029 --> 21:26.264
These are all the houses
he's worked in,

21:26.298 --> 21:28.933
some of which might be empty
during the summer.

21:28.967 --> 21:31.335
That's the perfect place
to go with a hostage.

21:31.370 --> 21:33.237
That is a lot of places
to search, Dexter.

21:33.272 --> 21:35.039
We need Miami Metro's help.

21:35.073 --> 21:36.707
They'll be helping us.

21:36.742 --> 21:38.943
They just won't know it.

21:38.977 --> 21:41.179
Just plot those places
out on a map.

21:41.213 --> 21:43.481
Don't do anything on your own.

21:43.515 --> 21:46.817
You still don't trust me,
do you?

21:46.852 --> 21:49.820
I don't want you hurt.

21:53.692 --> 21:54.825
Uhh!

21:57.596 --> 22:01.132
So who's the guy?

22:01.166 --> 22:04.068
What guy?

22:04.102 --> 22:06.537
A.J., this is very serious,
what you're doing.

22:06.572 --> 22:10.441
The guy who
broke into my house!

22:10.475 --> 22:11.576
He's a friend of mine.

22:11.610 --> 22:14.011
I don't like him in my house,

22:14.046 --> 22:15.613
going through my things.

22:15.647 --> 22:16.814
No. I understand.

22:16.848 --> 22:19.817
Good!

22:24.690 --> 22:28.960
A.J., I think I know
what this is about.

22:28.994 --> 22:31.262
It's your surgery.
You blame me.

22:31.296 --> 22:32.396
What?

22:32.431 --> 22:36.100
This little thing?
No!

22:36.134 --> 22:38.769
I liked having my skull
sawed open,

22:38.804 --> 22:40.738
and a chunk of my brain
carved out.

22:40.772 --> 22:41.839
Who wouldn't?

22:41.873 --> 22:43.708
Well, you had a lesion

22:43.742 --> 22:45.576
on the limbic area
of your brain.

22:45.611 --> 22:48.479
And I thought
it was causing your—

22:48.513 --> 22:51.482
your violent episodes.

22:53.252 --> 22:55.553
I-I was only trying
to make you better.

22:55.587 --> 22:57.888
Well, it worked really well,
didn't it?

22:57.923 --> 23:01.959
You're a hell of a doctor!

23:01.994 --> 23:05.730
I only wanted
what was best for you.

23:05.764 --> 23:07.798
I still do.

23:07.833 --> 23:11.636
That's why you sent
your friend after me.

23:11.670 --> 23:14.338
I asked him to protect me.
I had no choice.

23:14.373 --> 23:16.774
You should've just
left me alone.

23:16.808 --> 23:19.577
I will. I will.

23:19.611 --> 23:21.345
You made your point.

23:21.380 --> 23:24.282
There's no reason for us
to go any further.

23:24.316 --> 23:26.651
If you do, you'll—
you'll be caught

23:26.685 --> 23:29.420
and you'll go to jail and—
or worse.

23:29.454 --> 23:31.055
My friend is looking for you.

23:31.089 --> 23:33.024
Ah!

23:33.058 --> 23:35.026
Good!

23:35.060 --> 23:36.360
I can't wait till he finds me.

23:36.395 --> 23:38.462
No, no!

23:42.000 --> 23:43.561
The way I hear it,
the sergeant spot's

23:43.568 --> 23:46.637
just going to be
between you and me.

23:46.672 --> 23:48.072
Is that so?

23:48.106 --> 23:49.373
Not gonna ruin our friendship

23:49.408 --> 23:51.042
when one of us gets it
and the other doesn't?

23:51.076 --> 23:54.278
I didn't know
we had a friendship.

23:54.313 --> 23:55.946
Excuse me.

23:55.981 --> 23:57.248
Miami Metro Homicide.

23:57.282 --> 23:59.150
Don't worry,
you're not in trouble.

23:59.184 --> 24:01.018
- What's your name?
- Armando.

24:01.053 --> 24:03.120
I'm Detective Quinn.
This is Detective Miller.

24:03.155 --> 24:05.089
There was a murder down here
a few days ago.

24:05.123 --> 24:06.457
Take a look at this.

24:06.491 --> 24:08.225
We were wondering
if you saw that man

24:08.260 --> 24:12.063
around this time of day,
early afternoon.

24:12.097 --> 24:13.831
<i>Si,</i> I saw him.

24:13.865 --> 24:15.166
Can you point him out to me?

24:15.200 --> 24:17.802
Uh, this one.

24:17.836 --> 24:19.537
Are you sure?

24:19.571 --> 24:21.339
Yes, uh, he drive a Porsche,

24:21.373 --> 24:23.107
and you don't see too many
Porsches around here.

24:23.141 --> 24:24.542
Would you be willing
to come down to the station

24:24.576 --> 24:27.345
and give a statement that
that's the guy you saw?

24:27.379 --> 24:29.513
I can come by later today.

24:29.548 --> 24:31.415
Yeah, that's fine.

24:31.450 --> 24:34.051
Here. Ask for me
at the front desk.

24:35.220 --> 24:37.988
Great. Wanna get
his information?

24:39.725 --> 24:41.992
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

24:42.027 --> 24:43.994
Just got an eyewitness to place

24:44.029 --> 24:46.364
Zach Hamilton at Norma Rivera's

24:46.398 --> 24:47.932
around the time of her killing.

24:47.966 --> 24:49.333
The son?

24:49.368 --> 24:51.202
I wasn't expecting that.

24:51.236 --> 24:53.204
Me neither.

24:53.238 --> 24:54.772
Mm. I'll let Matthews know.

24:54.806 --> 24:56.607
He's been all over me
about this case.

24:56.641 --> 24:58.409
- All right, bye.
- All right.

25:01.046 --> 25:02.847
This is awkward, isn't it?

25:05.050 --> 25:08.386
Uh, why'd you decide
to look me up now?

25:08.420 --> 25:11.355
Um, well, you know,
partly because

25:11.390 --> 25:14.091
I moved down here from
St. Augustine for school.

25:14.126 --> 25:17.862
Oh, and... what's
the other part?

25:17.896 --> 25:20.531
My mom passed recently.

25:20.565 --> 25:23.367
So, uh, it's just me now.

25:23.402 --> 25:26.303
Oh, I'm sorry to—
I'm sorry to hear that.

25:26.338 --> 25:27.605
Thanks.

25:30.142 --> 25:34.044
Uh, your mom never...
married?

25:34.079 --> 25:36.414
No, it was always
just the two of us.

25:36.448 --> 25:39.683
So now that she's gone, I guess

25:39.718 --> 25:41.719
I've been feeling
kind of alone.

25:41.753 --> 25:44.155
Well, I'm glad you reached out.

25:44.189 --> 25:47.324
Me too.

25:47.359 --> 25:48.426
What about you?

25:48.460 --> 25:50.294
Are you still single?

25:50.328 --> 25:51.695
Yep.

25:51.730 --> 25:53.230
Where do you live?

25:53.265 --> 25:55.533
Oh, I've got a house
down in Coconut Grove.

25:55.567 --> 25:57.568
Fancy.

25:57.602 --> 25:59.837
Are you, like, Mr. Rich Guy?

25:59.871 --> 26:02.973
Well, uh—

26:03.008 --> 26:05.443
I bet you drive a Ferrari.

26:05.477 --> 26:07.244
Masook, what can I get for you?

26:07.279 --> 26:09.346
Hey, Marty, um,
just a coffee for me.

26:09.381 --> 26:11.882
And, uh, Niki?

26:11.917 --> 26:14.652
Um, can I have
a double cappuccino

26:14.686 --> 26:16.353
and a blueberry muffin?

26:16.388 --> 26:19.290
And a veggie burrito
to go, please.

26:23.395 --> 26:25.362
I left my bag in the car.

26:25.397 --> 26:26.997
I'm sorry.
Can you get this one?

26:27.032 --> 26:28.966
- Yeah, no, no—
- I'll get the next one.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.001
No problem, my treat.

26:31.036 --> 26:32.269
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:32.304 --> 26:35.573
Oh, hey, uh, can you add
cheese to my burrito?

26:35.607 --> 26:38.075
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

26:39.945 --> 26:42.246
Yates has installed cable
and Internet

26:42.280 --> 26:44.281
from one end of Miami
to the other.

26:44.316 --> 26:46.016
Even if I only look at homes
he worked on

26:46.051 --> 26:48.085
in the past two weeks,
it'll still take days

26:48.119 --> 26:51.355
to figure out
which homes are vacant—

26:51.389 --> 26:53.324
if he's even in one of them.

26:53.358 --> 26:55.860
And with Vogel
being held by Yates,

26:55.894 --> 26:59.897
doing what he does—

26:59.931 --> 27:03.133
Batista should be done looking
into Yates's money trail.

27:03.168 --> 27:06.570
Time to see if Miami Metro
can help me narrow this down.

27:14.246 --> 27:17.214
Yeah, I'm on hold.
Come in.

27:17.249 --> 27:19.817
Just checking to see how
your end of the hunt's going.

27:19.851 --> 27:22.186
Well, just got
his credit history.

27:22.220 --> 27:23.721
He hasn't used his charge cards

27:23.755 --> 27:26.156
in the last three days,
so that trail is cold.

27:26.191 --> 27:28.726
- So he's using cash?
- Yeah.

27:28.760 --> 27:29.994
He's on the run.

27:30.028 --> 27:31.662
He'd probably have to be
withdrawing his funds

27:31.696 --> 27:33.998
from his bank or ATM.

27:34.032 --> 27:35.766
Yeah, well, I got a judge
to expedite

27:35.800 --> 27:37.040
a warrant on his bank accounts.

27:37.068 --> 27:38.369
I'm on hold with the bank now.

27:38.403 --> 27:40.070
Lieutenant Batista,
thank you so much for holding.

27:40.105 --> 27:41.605
The withdrawals
were in Morningside Park.

27:41.640 --> 27:42.973
Would you like me
to fax the receipts to you?

27:43.008 --> 27:44.129
- That would be fine.
- Okay.

27:44.142 --> 27:45.409
- Okay.
Both: Thank you.

27:45.443 --> 27:47.945
- Bye.
- Good news?

27:47.979 --> 27:50.915
Yates hit up an ATM
near Morningside Park

27:50.949 --> 27:53.183
two times in the last
couple of days.

27:53.218 --> 27:55.185
So he could be holed up
in that area.

27:55.220 --> 27:56.520
Yeah, we'll get
some unis out there.

27:56.555 --> 27:58.322
If he shows his face,
we'll get him.

27:58.356 --> 28:01.325
Yeah, we'll get him.

28:03.862 --> 28:05.162
No, it's a clusterfuck.

28:05.196 --> 28:06.630
Just a couple hours ago,
we had a witness

28:06.665 --> 28:08.098
that placed Zach
at the murder scene

28:08.133 --> 28:09.254
within the time of her death.

28:09.267 --> 28:10.501
Now, we bring him in
for questioning,

28:10.535 --> 28:12.136
and suddenly
he can't remember anything.

28:12.170 --> 28:14.238
Not unusual for a witness
to change his mind.

28:14.272 --> 28:15.873
Yeah, but I think
someone paid him off.

28:15.874 --> 28:17.107
Rich parents like Zach has,

28:17.142 --> 28:18.782
it's not hard to put
two and two together.

28:18.810 --> 28:20.678
Mm. You have
any other witnesses

28:20.712 --> 28:22.313
that can put Zach at the scene?

28:22.347 --> 28:24.748
No. But I will bring that kid
in for questioning,

28:24.783 --> 28:26.517
and I will get a confession
out of him.

28:26.551 --> 28:27.651
Waste of time.

28:27.686 --> 28:28.919
You have nothing to go on,

28:28.954 --> 28:30.654
and his lawyers won't let him
say a word.

28:30.689 --> 28:32.623
- He killed her.
- You don't know that.

28:32.657 --> 28:34.658
Your only witness recanted.

28:34.693 --> 28:36.660
You have no case.

28:36.695 --> 28:39.863
Now, look, you find
something more concrete,

28:39.898 --> 28:41.565
you'll have my full backing.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.901
But until then,
leave the kid alone.

28:43.935 --> 28:47.605
No reason to make enemies
unless we really have to,

28:47.639 --> 28:49.139
especially when
there are people

28:49.174 --> 28:51.008
trying to move up to sergeant.

28:51.042 --> 28:53.077
Capiche?

28:53.111 --> 28:55.245
Yeah.

28:59.718 --> 29:00.951
So what exactly
are we looking for

29:00.986 --> 29:03.020
in the Morningside Park area?

29:03.054 --> 29:04.288
That's a good question.

29:04.322 --> 29:05.389
We need to start figuring out

29:05.423 --> 29:06.657
what kind of buildings
these are,

29:06.691 --> 29:08.459
if any apartments or condos
or businesses

29:08.493 --> 29:10.394
can be scratched off the list.

29:10.428 --> 29:12.730
- And why are we—
- I—

29:12.764 --> 29:14.231
I know, got it.

29:14.265 --> 29:16.033
Top secret shit between
you and your brother.

29:16.067 --> 29:18.369
Understood.

29:18.403 --> 29:20.938
Look at that, a paying client.

29:20.972 --> 29:22.406
- I guess I should go and—
- Oh, I'm sor—

29:22.440 --> 29:24.008
that's a friend of mine.

29:24.042 --> 29:26.510
Good. Hope he needs
a favor.

29:28.713 --> 29:29.980
Masuka, what's up?

29:30.015 --> 29:31.215
I pass by here all the time.

29:31.249 --> 29:35.285
I figured I'd finally
see where you work.

29:35.320 --> 29:37.287
This is it.

29:37.322 --> 29:39.490
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

29:39.524 --> 29:42.760
Can we go somewhere
more private to talk?

29:42.794 --> 29:45.429
- Sure.
- Okay.

29:47.232 --> 29:48.365
What's up?

29:48.400 --> 29:50.300
I wanna hire you to do

29:50.335 --> 29:53.037
a background check on someone.

29:53.071 --> 29:55.305
You do background checks
all the time at Miami Metro.

29:55.340 --> 29:56.674
Why would you
waste your money on me?

29:56.708 --> 29:57.941
Uh, I know, right.

29:57.976 --> 30:01.211
It's more of
a personal situation.

30:01.246 --> 30:03.280
Right.

30:03.314 --> 30:07.351
Who are we stalking?

30:07.385 --> 30:09.486
It's, uh, a family member.

30:09.521 --> 30:10.688
Ooh, gotta be careful.

30:10.722 --> 30:12.623
Don't always wanna know
everything about family.

30:12.657 --> 30:14.858
Yeah, well, I really need this.

30:14.893 --> 30:16.627
All right.
Give me a name.

30:16.661 --> 30:19.730
Niki Walters.

30:19.764 --> 30:23.233
Who is it?
A cousin?

30:23.268 --> 30:25.369
Daughter.

30:25.403 --> 30:27.104
I know, right?

30:27.138 --> 30:28.806
I donated sperm
back in college.

30:28.840 --> 30:31.308
I've got a 20-year-old
daughter.

30:31.342 --> 30:32.876
She just showed up
out of the blue.

30:32.911 --> 30:36.346
Wow, that's fucking weird.

30:36.381 --> 30:38.615
I mean, she seems
really nice, you know?

30:38.650 --> 30:44.121
She's smart. She's pretty.
Seems normal.

30:44.155 --> 30:47.157
But I keep asking myself,
"What's the catch?"

30:47.192 --> 30:50.194
Maybe she just wants
to get to know you.

30:50.228 --> 30:51.829
Maybe.

30:51.863 --> 30:55.499
Or maybe she saw an easy mark
to hit up for money.

30:55.533 --> 30:58.168
You really think
she's here to rip you off?

30:58.203 --> 31:02.473
I don't know what to think.

31:02.507 --> 31:04.508
I mean, I've got no family
except for my parents.

31:04.542 --> 31:06.043
And they're off, retired,

31:06.077 --> 31:08.779
living <i>la vida loca</i> in Tampa.

31:08.813 --> 31:11.115
So it's just me.

31:11.149 --> 31:14.685
And now Niki shows up.

31:14.719 --> 31:19.056
I mean, I like the idea
of having a daughter,

31:19.090 --> 31:20.991
family, right?

31:21.025 --> 31:24.428
But if she's here
just for my money—

31:24.462 --> 31:27.297
I'm sure it's fine.

31:27.332 --> 31:30.768
And either way,
it's—

31:30.802 --> 31:33.771
it's really nice
to have family.

31:33.805 --> 31:37.207
Trust me.

31:37.242 --> 31:38.762
You'll be discrete
about this, right?

31:38.777 --> 31:40.010
I don't want her to know

31:40.044 --> 31:41.178
that I'm looking into her
like this.

31:41.212 --> 31:44.181
She'll never know
anything about it.

31:46.284 --> 31:47.518
Yes, please.

31:47.552 --> 31:50.020
Oh, yeah.

31:50.054 --> 31:52.356
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:52.390 --> 31:53.524
You want a beer?

31:53.558 --> 31:55.425
You remember Cassie, right?

31:55.460 --> 31:57.528
Cassie, yeah.
New neighbor, hi.

31:57.562 --> 32:01.965
Yes, it's good—
it's good to meet you again.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.034
Jamie, can I talk to you
for a sec?

32:04.068 --> 32:05.235
Sure.

32:05.270 --> 32:08.205
Joey, keep stirring that.

32:10.175 --> 32:11.875
What are they doing
in my apartment?

32:11.910 --> 32:13.310
Did you forget we had plans?

32:13.344 --> 32:16.113
- Plans?
- Dinner, remember?

32:16.147 --> 32:17.414
Right.

32:17.448 --> 32:18.916
Yeah, I figured we'd
make it a double date.

32:18.950 --> 32:20.584
Less awkward this way.

32:20.618 --> 32:24.521
I'm gonna have to reschedule.

32:24.556 --> 32:26.123
Uh, excuse me just a sec.

32:26.157 --> 32:27.758
Joey, keep stirring that.

32:27.792 --> 32:29.059
I'm stirrin' it!

32:34.132 --> 32:35.599
Dexter.

32:35.633 --> 32:37.734
You can't do this.

32:37.769 --> 32:39.069
Do what?

32:39.103 --> 32:41.205
I went out of my way
to set this up for you.

32:41.239 --> 32:42.806
I made <i>platanos fritos,</i>
<i>chicharrones.</i>

32:42.841 --> 32:44.474
I planned this whole night
for you.

32:44.509 --> 32:45.876
I'm sorry.
Something came up.

32:45.910 --> 32:49.146
No. No, you do this to me
all the time.

32:49.180 --> 32:50.814
Okay, and I don't mind,
I really don't.

32:50.849 --> 32:52.649
But I invited Cassie and Joey.

32:52.684 --> 32:53.784
You can't be rude to them.

32:53.818 --> 32:56.987
Jamie, really, I have to go.

32:57.021 --> 32:59.223
If you even try
to walk out that door,

32:59.257 --> 33:01.258
Dexter, I will leave.

33:01.292 --> 33:03.393
And you will be stuck here
with Harrison all night long.

33:03.428 --> 33:06.029
- Jamie—
- This is for your own good.

33:06.064 --> 33:07.865
You haven't gone out
with anyone since Hannah.

33:07.899 --> 33:09.366
You stay for dinner.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.134
And when we're done,
I will stay with Harrison

33:11.169 --> 33:14.438
so you can go do whatever it is
you have to do.

33:17.308 --> 33:20.911
Serial killer bested
by 100-pound nanny.

33:20.945 --> 33:22.112
Born and raised.

33:24.082 --> 33:26.884
Dexter's lived in Miami
his whole life.

33:26.918 --> 33:29.019
Oh.

33:29.053 --> 33:32.656
I'm gonna get some more wine.

33:32.690 --> 33:34.157
Deb.

33:34.192 --> 33:35.425
I've got 12 potential homes

33:35.460 --> 33:36.827
Yates could be using
as a hideout.

33:36.861 --> 33:38.528
Shit. I've got seven.

33:38.563 --> 33:41.164
- That's a lot to cover.
- Let's go.

33:41.199 --> 33:44.201
I'll call you back
in five minutes.

33:44.235 --> 33:45.335
So another "S."

33:45.370 --> 33:46.336
Yeah, to you.

33:46.371 --> 33:48.071
<i>Saving Private Ryan.</i>

33:50.541 --> 33:52.376
I love blunt things
in my mouth.

33:52.410 --> 33:54.478
Oh, jeez...

33:54.512 --> 33:55.913
Excuse me.

33:55.947 --> 33:58.115
Hey. Want some help
opening the wine?

33:58.149 --> 34:00.717
Actually, this is
a little embarrassing,

34:00.752 --> 34:02.352
but I kind of need to leave.

34:02.387 --> 34:05.022
Oh, work?
I get it.

34:05.056 --> 34:07.190
When I worked in Finance,
I was at it 24/7 too.

34:07.225 --> 34:10.060
Yeah. 24/7.

34:10.094 --> 34:12.362
But the thing is,
Jamie's put a lot of time

34:12.397 --> 34:13.664
into this whole thing.

34:13.698 --> 34:15.666
Right, you don't wanna
piss off the nanny.

34:15.700 --> 34:17.567
Look, um, go.

34:17.602 --> 34:21.338
I'll take care of Jamie.
We'll be fine.

34:21.372 --> 34:23.040
Maybe we could reschedule?

34:23.074 --> 34:24.841
Yeah. I'd like that.

34:24.876 --> 34:27.811
- Perfect.
- Okay.

34:27.845 --> 34:31.315
Jamie, listen, I'm really sorry
to be the party pooper,

34:31.349 --> 34:32.616
but I've got an early morning.

34:32.650 --> 34:33.884
Do you mind
if I call it a night?

34:33.918 --> 34:35.719
Yeah, turns out
I have to take off too.

34:35.753 --> 34:37.955
Thanks for watching Harrison.

34:37.989 --> 34:40.324
I'm sorry.

34:40.358 --> 34:42.292
I know you went to
so much trouble.

34:48.766 --> 34:49.967
What the fuck took you so long?

34:50.001 --> 34:51.868
It's a long story.

34:51.903 --> 34:54.204
We have 19 houses
we have to look into.

34:54.238 --> 34:56.306
At night?
Fuck me.

34:56.341 --> 34:58.308
How are we even gonna see
if Vogel and Yates

34:58.343 --> 34:59.977
are in a house, if they're even

35:00.011 --> 35:01.572
holed up in one of these
fuckin' places?

35:01.579 --> 35:03.513
What if they're in his van
and he's already killed her?

35:03.548 --> 35:04.848
He hasn't. She's fine.

35:04.882 --> 35:06.683
He keeps his women alive
for weeks.

35:06.718 --> 35:08.385
We'll find her.

35:08.419 --> 35:10.520
Yeah, we will.
We have to.

35:10.555 --> 35:13.890
I'll pick you up
in five minutes.

35:17.095 --> 35:19.529
We'll find her.

35:21.165 --> 35:22.599
Stay still—

35:22.633 --> 35:25.602
unless you want me
to restrain you.

35:39.083 --> 35:41.218
You're not angry
with me, A.J.

35:41.252 --> 35:42.486
You're angry with her.

35:42.520 --> 35:44.488
Shut up.

35:44.522 --> 35:47.491
And you have every right to be.

35:47.525 --> 35:52.629
Your—your mother abused you
horribly, beat you.

35:52.663 --> 35:54.264
Probably caused the lesion.

35:54.298 --> 35:55.999
Don't talk about her.

35:56.034 --> 35:57.701
But I understand, A.J.

35:57.735 --> 36:02.239
I understand the terror
you felt.

36:02.273 --> 36:06.643
She hit you, slapped you.

36:06.677 --> 36:10.113
You'd find a safe place
under the bed.

36:10.148 --> 36:14.151
And she'd look for you, raging.

36:14.185 --> 36:17.421
And you'd curl up under there,

36:17.455 --> 36:22.325
looking out, waiting.

36:24.395 --> 36:26.797
She'd pace back and forth

36:26.831 --> 36:29.166
- in front of the bed.
- Yes.

36:29.200 --> 36:32.369
Shoes clacking.

36:32.403 --> 36:36.073
Yeah.

36:36.107 --> 36:39.709
I feel the panic rising.

36:39.744 --> 36:43.513
The pain you knew awaited.

36:56.094 --> 36:59.062
Don't say another fucking word.

37:02.467 --> 37:03.900
No, no.

37:03.935 --> 37:08.138
Now, you can take the pain
and live a little longer.

37:08.172 --> 37:10.140
Or you can stop struggling,

37:10.174 --> 37:13.176
and I'll kill you right now.

37:15.713 --> 37:19.082
Good.

37:20.751 --> 37:24.354
So...

37:24.388 --> 37:28.425
which little piggy
won't be making it to market?

37:34.165 --> 37:36.299
Albert, stop it!

37:36.334 --> 37:37.400
Don't call me that.

37:37.435 --> 37:39.102
Only my mother called me that.

37:39.137 --> 37:42.973
- Stop that, Albert, now.
- No.

37:43.007 --> 37:44.941
Don't you talk back to me,
you little shit!

37:44.976 --> 37:46.276
I'm not afraid of you.

37:46.310 --> 37:49.913
All you ever do
is disappoint me.

38:15.907 --> 38:18.208
Enough!

38:21.112 --> 38:24.214
Stay.

39:07.325 --> 39:10.093
Don't know this number.

39:11.829 --> 39:14.164
Not this house.

39:18.402 --> 39:21.671
Morgan.

39:21.706 --> 39:23.039
Here.

39:23.074 --> 39:27.577
Let me help you with that cut.

39:27.612 --> 39:29.045
You shouldn't call me Albert.

39:29.080 --> 39:31.181
My name is A.J.

39:31.215 --> 39:32.649
I'm sorry.

39:32.683 --> 39:34.084
It's Vogel.
She's alive.

39:34.118 --> 39:35.218
What?

39:35.253 --> 39:37.387
She is with Yates.
She called me.

39:37.421 --> 39:38.888
She left her phone out
or something.

39:38.923 --> 39:40.390
- Give me that.
- Oh, my God.

39:40.424 --> 39:42.392
You're still bleeding.

39:42.426 --> 39:44.761
It's local.
You think Elway can trace this?

39:44.795 --> 39:46.930
I don't know.
I can fuckin' ask him.

39:46.964 --> 39:49.199
Let me take care of you.

39:49.233 --> 39:50.567
Hey, Deb, what's up?

39:50.601 --> 39:52.202
Look, I don't even
wanna explain to you

39:52.236 --> 39:53.637
why I can't go
through the police,

39:53.671 --> 39:55.105
and I know
it's illegal as hell,

39:55.139 --> 39:58.141
but I need you to trace
a number for me.

39:59.877 --> 40:01.211
What's the number?

40:01.245 --> 40:02.679
You're no different than mom.

40:02.713 --> 40:04.881
Yes, I am.
I understand—

40:04.915 --> 40:07.017
How long is this gonna take?

40:07.051 --> 40:08.718
Fuck if I know.

40:08.753 --> 40:10.053
You're just like her
and all women.

40:10.087 --> 40:12.656
- What if he kills her?
- Don't—

40:12.690 --> 40:15.325
I thought you said it takes,
like, a week for him—

40:15.359 --> 40:19.296
I know what I said.

40:19.330 --> 40:20.864
Let's not think like this.

40:20.898 --> 40:22.766
You had a horrible childhood.

40:24.402 --> 40:25.735
You don't have
to live your life

40:25.770 --> 40:27.504
with the burden of your past.

40:27.538 --> 40:28.605
Yeah?

40:28.639 --> 40:31.408
157 Montgomery.

40:31.442 --> 40:33.543
You're a fuckin' saint.
Thank you.

40:33.577 --> 40:36.746
157 Montgomery.
You know where that is?

40:40.418 --> 40:42.952
You shouldn't have hit me.

40:42.987 --> 40:44.621
She hit him?

40:44.655 --> 40:47.590
I was scared.

40:47.625 --> 40:50.126
I can still help you.

40:50.161 --> 40:51.561
You don't have
to be angry at me.

40:51.595 --> 40:53.897
- You can't help me.
- I can.

40:53.931 --> 40:56.766
I understand what
you've been through.

40:56.801 --> 40:58.968
No child should ever
have to hide

40:59.003 --> 41:03.940
under a bed from a parent.

41:03.974 --> 41:07.143
You sought connection
with her, hmm?

41:07.178 --> 41:10.180
And all she gave you was pain.

41:12.483 --> 41:15.518
What—what you do
with your women,

41:15.553 --> 41:19.255
it's a search
for that same connection

41:19.290 --> 41:23.827
that you never got
from your mother.

41:23.861 --> 41:25.762
But what we have here now,

41:25.796 --> 41:28.531
in this moment, you and I?

41:28.566 --> 41:33.436
This is real human connection.

41:33.471 --> 41:35.338
What you have
with your victims,

41:35.373 --> 41:38.174
that only pales in comparison.

41:38.209 --> 41:41.144
Do you understand?

41:43.013 --> 41:46.516
You poor, poor boy.

41:46.550 --> 41:49.786
All you want is to belong,
don't you?

41:49.820 --> 41:52.622
I can help you.

41:52.656 --> 41:55.558
I can, trust me.

42:04.568 --> 42:07.704
- Oh, what did you do?
- I didn't.

42:07.738 --> 42:09.372
Who did you call? Is this
your little fucking friend?

42:09.407 --> 42:11.341
Dexter, Dexter!

42:11.375 --> 42:12.976
Yeah, you call him.

42:13.010 --> 42:15.912
Fuck you, Dexter!

42:53.984 --> 42:55.251
Fuck.

42:55.286 --> 42:57.954
- You okay?
- Yeah.

43:26.250 --> 43:29.185
Oh, fucking Christ.

43:32.690 --> 43:34.290
Are you all right?

43:34.325 --> 43:35.425
Yeah, I think so.

43:35.459 --> 43:37.460
- Did he hurt you?
- No.

43:37.495 --> 43:40.697
No, thank—
thank you.

43:40.731 --> 43:43.333
Where's Yates?

43:53.210 --> 43:55.845
Let's get you out of here.

43:55.880 --> 43:58.848
Then we can find Yates.

44:13.430 --> 44:15.999
Debra, are you okay?

44:16.033 --> 44:18.167
I'm good.

44:18.202 --> 44:20.169
Really, I'm—I'm good.

44:20.204 --> 44:21.404
Let's just get this cleaned up

44:21.405 --> 44:24.007
and get out of here.

44:25.910 --> 44:28.478
Brain cores.

44:28.512 --> 44:32.882
I'll dump them
with Yates's body.

44:32.917 --> 44:36.419
So this—
so this is finally over.

44:36.453 --> 44:38.788
My tormentor is dead...

44:38.822 --> 44:42.058
thanks to you, Dexter.

44:42.092 --> 44:43.393
And Deb.

44:43.427 --> 44:45.862
Yes. And Deb.

44:45.896 --> 44:47.330
I'm glad to see that
the two of you

44:47.364 --> 44:51.334
have managed to find your way
back to each other.

44:55.472 --> 44:59.275
Well, the family
that kills together...

44:59.310 --> 45:01.177
You're doing well, Debra.

45:01.211 --> 45:04.180
You're very resilient.

45:04.214 --> 45:05.848
We'll see.

45:05.883 --> 45:08.685
You are.

45:08.719 --> 45:11.120
And you never gave up on her.

45:11.155 --> 45:12.889
I'm impressed.

45:12.923 --> 45:16.025
I know Harry would be too.

45:16.060 --> 45:18.928
He was always concerned that,
as you grew older,

45:18.963 --> 45:23.700
you—you might drift apart.

45:23.734 --> 45:27.770
Well, we never really
had a choice.

45:27.805 --> 45:31.541
If anyone really knew us,
they would run screaming.

45:35.980 --> 45:40.783
This is everything.

45:40.818 --> 45:44.821
Okay.

45:44.855 --> 45:47.724
So is this it?

45:51.061 --> 45:53.429
A few days ago,
everything seemed hopeless

45:53.464 --> 45:55.665
between Deb and me.

45:55.699 --> 45:59.969
But through Dr. Vogel
and Yates,

46:00.004 --> 46:04.307
I've got my sister back.

46:04.341 --> 46:08.244
Not like things were before...

46:09.413 --> 46:12.949
It's something different.

46:12.983 --> 46:15.718
But for now, it's enough.

46:17.888 --> 46:20.323
It's beautiful
out here, Dexter.

46:24.528 --> 46:26.596
I like it.

46:29.199 --> 46:32.135
It's peaceful,
alone on the water.

46:35.139 --> 46:37.874
Tonight you brought us.

46:37.908 --> 46:40.843
Yes. Why?

46:44.915 --> 46:47.917
I wanted to be with family.

47:05.051 --> 47:15.777
