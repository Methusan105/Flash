00:10.285 --> 00:11.480
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:11.645 --> 00:12.635
Dex.

00:13.125 --> 00:14.115
Shoot him.

00:14.405 --> 00:15.521
Do what you gotta do.

00:18.125 --> 00:19.445
Oh, my God!

00:19.605 --> 00:22.598
Whoever Deb was before
killing LaGuerta, that person is dead.

00:22.765 --> 00:23.755
Oh, my God!

00:23.965 --> 00:27.003
What we think is the shooter
approached the vehicle from behind.

00:27.285 --> 00:28.878
El Sapo drew his gun.

00:31.485 --> 00:33.158
I know you killed El Sapo.

00:33.565 --> 00:35.397
What if I weren't here
to cover your ass?

00:35.565 --> 00:37.045
You really wanna play
that game?

00:37.485 --> 00:38.919
What's going on with Debra?

00:39.205 --> 00:41.595
- It's between me and her.
- It's affecting you.

00:41.765 --> 00:43.916
We're not going to talk about Deb.

00:44.285 --> 00:48.040
I thought we'd make it to one minute
before you mentioned your fiancée.

00:48.205 --> 00:51.562
I got your brother on my ass
about taking the sergeant's test.

00:51.725 --> 00:53.444
You're on my ass about Deb.

00:55.685 --> 00:58.837
Interior insular cortex is missing,
just like the last one.

00:59.325 --> 01:00.315
So we have a serial.

01:00.485 --> 01:01.635
Vogel was right.

01:02.325 --> 01:03.520
"Lyle Sussman."

01:03.685 --> 01:07.315
- I don't know anybody by that name.
- It doesn't mean he doesn't know you.

01:09.525 --> 01:10.925
He was coerced.

01:11.125 --> 01:14.004
Sussman was never a real killer.
He's just another victim.

01:14.805 --> 01:16.125
You were wrong about me.

01:16.845 --> 01:18.837
I destroyed Deb.

01:19.045 --> 01:20.161
I'm a mistake.

01:20.685 --> 01:23.075
You're exactly what you need to be.

03:16.125 --> 03:17.354
Daddy?

03:27.285 --> 03:28.355
Harrison?

03:31.685 --> 03:33.039
Daddy?

03:34.685 --> 03:36.483
Harrison?

03:45.965 --> 03:47.160
Daddy?

03:47.325 --> 03:48.475
Harrison?

03:53.405 --> 03:55.761
My tummy hurts.

04:03.125 --> 04:05.276
Harrison, did you eat
a whole box of popsicles?

04:10.125 --> 04:11.764
Harrison.

04:14.005 --> 04:17.077
- Why?
- Because I love them.

04:20.125 --> 04:23.004
All right. Come on.

04:34.245 --> 04:37.443
Drink this. It'll make you feel better.
I promise.

04:45.325 --> 04:46.645
Good boy.

04:58.765 --> 05:02.679
<i>A tiny shot of pink
is all it takes to fix my son's pain.</i>

05:03.365 --> 05:06.244
<i>I just wish it were that easy
to help Deb.</i>

05:33.045 --> 05:35.276
- What?
- Lieutenant Morgan?

05:35.485 --> 05:37.078
Formerly known as.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.278
Have you been drinking?

05:40.765 --> 05:42.404
There a problem, officer?

05:42.565 --> 05:45.239
Well, yes. You're in a car,
drunk, with an open container.

05:45.405 --> 05:47.283
Several, actually.

05:49.085 --> 05:50.838
Well, at least I pulled over.

05:52.765 --> 05:54.916
I've had a really bad couple of days.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.117
Maybe you could just
cut me some slack?

05:57.885 --> 06:00.081
- I wish I could, but—
- But what?

06:00.245 --> 06:01.998
There's been damage to city property.

06:02.165 --> 06:04.555
Property damage?
Are you fucking kidding me?

06:04.765 --> 06:06.996
I'm gonna need you
to get out of the car, please.

06:23.965 --> 06:26.685
Oh, mother shit.

06:28.645 --> 06:30.637
Is there someone I can call?
Your brother?

06:30.805 --> 06:33.115
No, fucking don't call Dexter.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.564
Quinn.

06:48.525 --> 06:51.040
Yeah. I'll be right there.

06:51.205 --> 06:52.400
Is everything okay?

06:52.965 --> 06:54.479
Yeah. Just cop stuff.

06:55.205 --> 06:56.525
- Okay.
- I'll call you later.

06:56.685 --> 06:57.675
Okay.

07:18.045 --> 07:19.525
- Deb.
- I'm up.

07:21.085 --> 07:22.201
You okay?

07:23.925 --> 07:25.564
I feel like I got hit by a truck.

07:27.685 --> 07:28.675
Jesus, Deb.

07:28.885 --> 07:31.161
Oh, God, please,
just save me the lecture, okay?

07:32.605 --> 07:34.642
My head hurts like a motherfucker.

07:35.325 --> 07:36.805
I'm not gonna lecture you.

07:38.685 --> 07:39.755
They book you yet?

07:39.925 --> 07:41.405
No, not yet.

07:43.005 --> 07:45.281
They kept me out
of the drunk tank, though.

07:47.805 --> 07:49.922
Thank God for professional courtesy.

07:51.525 --> 07:52.754
All right.

07:52.925 --> 07:55.485
Let me see if I can get you out of this.

07:57.525 --> 07:59.357
Hey. How you doing?

08:00.245 --> 08:01.565
Can I get a little help?

08:01.725 --> 08:03.000
What can I do for you?

08:18.565 --> 08:21.000
<i>Deb's had me
on such a roller coaster...</i>

08:21.165 --> 08:24.715
<i>I actually appreciate
walking into familiar territory.</i>

08:25.405 --> 08:26.919
<i>Lyle Sussman's cabin.</i>

08:30.565 --> 08:32.238
<i>But where's the body?</i>

08:39.405 --> 08:42.045
Dex? This is our guy, Sussman.

08:46.205 --> 08:47.719
The Brain Surgeon.

08:48.925 --> 08:50.359
<i>Not exactly.</i>

08:52.925 --> 08:55.520
<i>Did the real Brain Surgeon
restage the crime scene...</i>

08:55.925 --> 08:58.076
<i>obscuring any evidence
that Sussman's body...</i>

08:58.245 --> 09:00.885
<i>was ever hanging
from a hook in the back of his skull?</i>

09:01.045 --> 09:02.638
Give me a hand?

09:13.085 --> 09:15.520
His front teeth are broken.

09:16.245 --> 09:19.682
Looks like Sussman put this shotgun
in his mouth, and blam...

09:21.765 --> 09:23.245
blew his head off.

09:23.845 --> 09:28.044
<i>Or someone put the gun in his mouth
and pulled the trigger post-mortem.</i>

09:36.285 --> 09:38.277
GSR on Sussman's hands.

09:38.805 --> 09:42.845
Maybe he finally found his conscience,
couldn't live with what he did.

09:44.085 --> 09:45.405
No note, though.

09:45.925 --> 09:47.359
Ah, suicide.

09:47.565 --> 09:50.717
- Makes our lives so much easier.
- You should put that on a T-shirt.

09:53.205 --> 09:56.243
<i>Whoever's after Vogel
wants the cops off the case.</i>

09:57.805 --> 10:00.320
- Is Vogel here yet?
- I just called her.

10:00.805 --> 10:02.398
Where the fuck is Quinn?

10:07.525 --> 10:09.437
You can thank me later.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.955
You still keep a stash of gum in here?

10:14.205 --> 10:15.798
I can smell my own breath.

10:16.245 --> 10:17.918
You sure you want to go to work...

10:18.085 --> 10:20.077
after spending the night
in the station?

10:20.245 --> 10:22.805
I mean, I could take you home.
You could shower.

10:23.445 --> 10:25.323
I keep deodorant in my desk.

10:35.125 --> 10:36.684
Thanks for the ride.

10:37.965 --> 10:39.638
Deb, wait.

10:41.165 --> 10:42.565
What?

10:44.245 --> 10:47.397
- Should I be worried?
- About what?

10:48.725 --> 10:50.159
About you.

10:51.125 --> 10:54.562
Think you might have a problem?

10:55.885 --> 10:57.922
You mean like a drinking problem?

10:58.965 --> 11:00.684
I'm just saying.

11:01.325 --> 11:03.123
Are you serious? You, of all people...

11:03.285 --> 11:06.437
- ... accusing me of a drinking problem?
- Not accusing you of anything.

11:06.645 --> 11:09.843
How many times have you shown up
at a crime scene smelling like booze?

11:10.005 --> 11:11.075
A lot, okay?

11:11.245 --> 11:13.555
Which means I've been down this road,
so I get it.

11:13.725 --> 11:15.717
I'm not down any fucking road.

11:16.125 --> 11:18.560
But at least when I was spinning out,
I had a reason.

11:19.685 --> 11:22.837
- What do you mean, you had a reason?
- You, dumb-ass.

11:23.805 --> 11:26.081
You turned down my proposal.
That was my reason.

11:26.245 --> 11:27.964
So, what's yours?

11:35.205 --> 11:38.198
Maybe I just don't know my own limits,
or something.

11:43.885 --> 11:47.037
- I didn't—
- That's my boss. I gotta go.

11:47.205 --> 11:48.719
Deb—

11:57.445 --> 11:58.925
You might want to straighten up.

11:59.085 --> 12:01.645
We have a new client coming in at 9.

13:16.085 --> 13:19.157
I'm frightened. He's escalating,
and we're left to play catch-up.

13:19.365 --> 13:22.961
I'll run tests at the lab, but I'm guessing
this tissue belongs to Sussman.

13:23.125 --> 13:26.197
Explains why the killer
blew his head off with a shotgun...

13:26.805 --> 13:30.321
so nobody'd notice the pieces were
missing. What part of the brain is it?

13:30.485 --> 13:32.397
It's the occipital lobe.

13:32.565 --> 13:34.284
It's responsible for vision.

13:35.405 --> 13:37.237
He's sending us a message.

13:37.445 --> 13:38.925
He's watching us.

13:39.125 --> 13:41.003
That, and the "His" and "Hers" boxes?

13:41.165 --> 13:43.122
He's aware of me now, not just you.

13:43.565 --> 13:45.955
I'm sorry, Dexter,
to have dragged you into this.

13:47.485 --> 13:49.397
He sent both packages to you.

13:50.445 --> 13:53.677
Maybe doesn't know how to find me.
Probably doesn't even know my name.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.605
- Yet.
- Yeah, I know.

13:55.765 --> 13:58.155
I need to get to him
before he gets to me.

13:58.325 --> 13:59.998
I've been going through your book...

14:00.165 --> 14:04.398
and cross-referencing it with the
source files and list of suspects.

14:04.965 --> 14:06.115
Any progress?

14:06.325 --> 14:08.078
I managed to clear
the first two names.

14:08.285 --> 14:09.514
So who's next?

14:09.685 --> 14:11.563
Ron Galuzzo.

14:11.725 --> 14:15.605
According to your files, he strangled
his best friend in high school...

14:15.765 --> 14:17.722
but convinced you
that it was a bully?

14:17.885 --> 14:19.399
Yeah.

14:19.565 --> 14:22.637
It's rare
that someone can fool me like that.

14:22.845 --> 14:24.837
At his hearing,
I argued for leniency...

14:25.405 --> 14:28.159
but when I eventually got him
to admit he'd been lying...

14:28.325 --> 14:30.123
I reversed my recommendation.

14:30.285 --> 14:32.959
So if Galuzzo read your book
and recognised his story—

14:33.125 --> 14:35.720
He would've realised
that he'd been institutionalised...

14:35.885 --> 14:37.842
until he was 21 because of me.

14:38.365 --> 14:40.755
That's a pretty good reason
to hold a grudge.

14:41.765 --> 14:42.994
Dex.

14:43.165 --> 14:44.155
Excuse me.

14:48.885 --> 14:50.205
It's about your sister.

14:51.645 --> 14:52.715
What about her?

14:52.885 --> 14:55.116
She got brought in
for a DUI last night.

14:57.045 --> 14:58.161
Shit.

14:58.325 --> 15:02.035
I managed to get her out of it,
but still, it was pretty bad.

15:02.285 --> 15:05.801
She asked me not to say anything
so I feel like a shit friend for telling...

15:05.965 --> 15:07.479
but I'm worried about her.

15:08.045 --> 15:09.604
What the fuck's going on?

15:10.045 --> 15:12.480
- She's been having a hard time.
- Yeah, I know.

15:12.685 --> 15:15.723
But, man, this is, like,
a whole new level.

15:16.085 --> 15:17.280
What are we gonna do?

15:18.285 --> 15:21.198
I'll figure something out.
Thanks for the heads-up.

15:22.045 --> 15:24.844
I'm putting you up for sergeant,
and you show up late?

15:25.005 --> 15:27.474
Are you trying
to make me look like an asshole?

15:27.645 --> 15:29.796
Sorry. I had a situation.

15:29.965 --> 15:32.480
You want a situation?
Come to the cabin.

15:40.085 --> 15:41.644
What is it?

15:42.325 --> 15:46.160
It's Deb. She was brought in
for a DUI I need to check on her.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.118
Is alcohol an issue for her?

15:49.165 --> 15:52.237
I'm an issue for her.
She's acting this way because of me.

15:52.445 --> 15:56.121
But you can't keep taking on your
sister's problems, especially right now.

15:56.285 --> 15:58.595
It's my fault, okay?

15:59.925 --> 16:02.440
Deb found out what I am.

16:02.605 --> 16:04.085
She knows everything.

16:04.845 --> 16:06.564
Everything?

16:06.965 --> 16:08.081
How?

16:08.325 --> 16:12.444
It's a long story. Just suffice to say,
she's not handling it well.

16:14.085 --> 16:16.725
You do really feel badly, don't you?

16:17.685 --> 16:19.278
Are you analysing me now?

16:19.445 --> 16:21.880
- It's just so unusual.
- It's really not a good time.

16:32.925 --> 16:36.202
Most of the time, when people think
their partner's having an affair...

16:36.365 --> 16:38.118
their partner's having an affair.

16:41.085 --> 16:44.874
- But not always, right?
- No, certainly not always.

16:45.725 --> 16:47.239
This is for you.

16:47.445 --> 16:49.755
My assistant will explain
the retainer and payment schedule...

16:49.925 --> 16:52.565
and we'll get back to you
when we've found something.

17:00.125 --> 17:02.082
So nervous.

17:02.485 --> 17:04.875
Is that normal, to be nervous?

17:05.085 --> 17:07.520
Well, people go through
a wide range of emotions.

17:07.685 --> 17:10.644
I think the important thing
is finding out the truth.

17:14.805 --> 17:17.365
Don't look at me.
I think the truth is overrated.

17:19.085 --> 17:22.123
Call us if you have any questions,
and we'll be in touch.

17:22.285 --> 17:23.401
Yeah.

17:23.605 --> 17:25.039
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

17:27.565 --> 17:31.605
Well, it looks like we have to work on
our client-relation skills.

17:31.805 --> 17:33.444
Are we done? I need a fucking nap.

17:33.605 --> 17:36.723
No, we're not done.
I've got something for you.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.198
What is that? A fucking shit shake?

17:49.645 --> 17:51.602
Special custom-made
supplement formula.

17:51.765 --> 17:54.997
It's got vitamins, some electrolytes,
a couple Chinese herbs.

17:55.165 --> 17:58.602
- It'll knock the hangover right out.
- How do you know I'm hung over?

18:02.445 --> 18:04.357
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:08.605 --> 18:10.198
It's your brother.

18:14.845 --> 18:17.644
Awesome. Fucking awesome.

18:25.325 --> 18:26.918
What do you want?

18:30.085 --> 18:32.475
I heard about
what happened last night.

18:33.565 --> 18:35.124
Fucking Quinn.

18:35.445 --> 18:36.959
He's worried about you.

18:37.125 --> 18:38.639
We both are.

18:40.085 --> 18:41.439
You almost got a DUI?

18:41.645 --> 18:43.796
I think the operative word
is "almost."

18:44.885 --> 18:46.001
It's not a big deal.

18:46.165 --> 18:47.565
It's a very big deal.

18:47.725 --> 18:49.921
This is why I didn't tell you.
Knew you'd freak out.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.554
I'm not freaking out.
I'm just trying to help.

18:52.765 --> 18:56.315
Fuck, Dexter.
I don't have time for this, you know?

18:56.845 --> 18:59.565
I have to find out if some asshole
is banging some chick...

18:59.725 --> 19:01.762
which he probably is,
so I can tell her...

19:01.925 --> 19:04.281
and she can get
a killer divorce settlement...

19:04.445 --> 19:07.483
and they can move on with
their stupid, fucking boring lives...

19:07.645 --> 19:09.841
and I can move on with mine.

19:10.365 --> 19:13.483
- Because this is my life now.
- Well, it wasn't always.

19:15.925 --> 19:18.360
How about dinner tonight?

19:18.805 --> 19:21.195
- We can talk.
- I don't want to talk to you.

19:21.365 --> 19:23.675
Well, I'm gonna keep showing up here
until you do.

19:25.325 --> 19:27.282
If I agree to dinner, will you leave?

19:27.525 --> 19:28.925
Yes.

19:29.965 --> 19:31.035
Fine.

19:32.925 --> 19:35.360
Great. I'll pick you up at 8.

19:47.965 --> 19:50.355
ME's report is back from the cabin.

19:50.525 --> 19:54.519
They've officially ruled
Lyle Sussman's death as a suicide.

19:55.085 --> 19:59.523
So with that, the Brain Surgeon case
is officially closed.

19:59.925 --> 20:03.362
Okay. I'll call Evelyn,
thank her for her help.

20:03.805 --> 20:06.718
Evelyn? Someone's got
a high hard one for the good doctor.

20:06.885 --> 20:08.763
What did I say
about standing so close?

20:08.925 --> 20:10.917
Any progress
on that El Sapo shooting?

20:11.285 --> 20:14.676
Still no leads. I've been going back
and forth with Fort Lauderdale P.D.

20:14.845 --> 20:17.724
Apparently, El Sapo was a suspect
in the stabbing...

20:17.885 --> 20:21.242
of a smash-and-grab lowlife
by the name of Andrew Briggs.

20:21.445 --> 20:24.836
<i>The cops will never find out
that Deb killed El Sapo.</i>

20:25.285 --> 20:28.403
<i>So right now,
I can focus on protecting Vogel...</i>

20:28.565 --> 20:29.715
<i>and myself.</i>

20:39.045 --> 20:40.240
<i>Ron Galuzzo.</i>

20:40.605 --> 20:42.597
<i>He could be hunting me right now.</i>

20:47.285 --> 20:50.676
<i>Or he could be selling
fitness equipment at the mall.</i>

20:50.845 --> 20:52.199
Good work today, everyone.

20:57.085 --> 20:58.235
Deputy chief, got a sec?

21:09.285 --> 21:10.435
Wanted to let you know...

21:10.605 --> 21:13.643
I've been thinking about
what you said, finding a new sergeant.

21:13.805 --> 21:15.558
And I've got my eye on Joey Quinn.

21:15.765 --> 21:17.518
Quinn? No way.

21:17.685 --> 21:19.881
- He's not sergeant material.
- He's a good cop.

21:20.045 --> 21:22.480
He's irresponsible, unpredictable...

21:22.965 --> 21:25.480
not to mention unintelligible.

21:25.765 --> 21:27.518
No way he can pass
that sergeant exam.

21:27.885 --> 21:28.875
He'll pass.

21:29.445 --> 21:30.481
If you say so.

21:49.365 --> 21:51.482
- Are you getting all this?
- Yeah.

21:51.925 --> 21:54.679
This guy's making this
way too easy for us.

21:54.845 --> 21:57.041
Yeah, it's really fucking classy.

21:58.605 --> 22:02.565
So tell me, who's the guy
that dropped you off this morning?

22:03.005 --> 22:05.361
Who? Quinn?

22:06.765 --> 22:07.835
He's a friend.

22:08.005 --> 22:10.679
Kind of friend that drops you off
in last night's clothes?

22:10.845 --> 22:13.883
God, we're not sleeping together,
if that's what you're implying.

22:14.085 --> 22:15.883
Not that it's any of your business.

22:16.045 --> 22:17.718
No judgement, no judgement.

22:17.885 --> 22:20.923
You are certainly allowed
to be a player...

22:21.085 --> 22:24.795
- ... if you so choose.
- What makes you think I'm a player?

22:25.605 --> 22:29.485
First there's Briggs,
then there's your new friend.

22:29.725 --> 22:31.603
Well, he's not a new friend.

22:31.885 --> 22:34.400
We used to date, just not anymore.

22:35.045 --> 22:36.365
Really?

22:37.565 --> 22:38.999
So what happened?

22:40.965 --> 22:42.718
He proposed. I said no.

22:43.685 --> 22:45.244
Jesus Christ.

22:45.605 --> 22:48.074
He's certainly a better man than I am.

22:48.925 --> 22:52.680
Woman turns down my proposal,
I'm not gonna stay friends with her.

22:52.845 --> 22:55.758
Yeah, but that's just because
you're a giant pussy.

23:00.005 --> 23:01.803
Yes. Could be.

23:14.405 --> 23:15.475
<i>Ron Galuzzo.</i>

23:15.645 --> 23:18.638
<i>If he is a killer, then a mall
is the perfect watering hole...</i>

23:18.805 --> 23:20.603
<i>for him to choose his prey.</i>

23:20.805 --> 23:25.084
So any of our products is gonna make
you stay in the shape that you are.

23:26.085 --> 23:31.843
And I need to do some more work,
so I'll see you a little bit later, okay?

23:32.005 --> 23:33.758
<i>It was dark at Sussman's cabin.</i>

23:33.925 --> 23:35.598
<i>Does he recognise me?</i>

23:36.325 --> 23:38.635
You've got a keen eye, my friend.

23:39.645 --> 23:41.682
The Chiseller 300.

23:42.485 --> 23:45.125
- Top of the line.
<i>- Or is he just trying to make a sale?</i>

23:45.285 --> 23:48.517
Just looking for an all-over workout,
maximise my time.

23:48.685 --> 23:51.484
- Mind if I take a body measurement?
- Sure.

23:56.845 --> 23:59.041
Looks like
you're already in pretty good shape.

24:02.845 --> 24:05.838
Oh, you have
a very low fat-to-muscle ratio.

24:06.285 --> 24:08.322
Well, thanks.
I do what I can, you know.

24:10.885 --> 24:14.674
Yeah, this equipment
is more for beginners...

24:14.845 --> 24:18.202
people who don't already have
an established routine.

24:18.365 --> 24:20.834
<i>Does he know who I am?
Is he trying to get rid of me?</i>

24:21.005 --> 24:22.962
I'm just looking
to change up my workout.

24:23.125 --> 24:24.320
I'd love any suggestions.

24:29.005 --> 24:30.405
That baby...

24:30.565 --> 24:34.195
cut you up faster
than a chef at Benihaha.

24:34.365 --> 24:36.402
- Come on, give it a try.
- Okay.

24:36.805 --> 24:38.956
<i>He doesn't seem to recognise me.</i>

24:41.165 --> 24:42.235
Careful.

24:42.405 --> 24:44.397
<i>Maybe a grudge against Vogel
will be harder to hide.</i>

24:46.285 --> 24:49.596
I like to read when I work out. Keeps
me from getting motion sickness.

24:49.805 --> 24:51.683
This one, I can't put down.
Heard of it?

24:51.885 --> 24:53.524
I'm not much of a reader.

24:53.725 --> 24:56.194
You probably heard of the author.
She's pretty famous.

24:56.805 --> 24:59.320
They call her
the Psychopath Whisperer.

25:00.445 --> 25:02.402
Dr. Evelyn Vogel?

25:02.605 --> 25:04.961
- Never heard of her.
<i>- Of course he's heard of Vogel.</i>

25:05.125 --> 25:06.923
<i>She treated him. He's lying.</i>

25:08.125 --> 25:09.605
You know, a fit guy like you...

25:09.765 --> 25:13.441
you need to get up to at least
level five to feel the full effect.

25:13.965 --> 25:16.639
<i>But why lie,
unless he has something to hide?</i>

25:16.805 --> 25:18.205
Yeah, I feel it.

25:18.365 --> 25:20.277
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

25:22.885 --> 25:24.877
Don't forget to breathe.

25:26.845 --> 25:28.882
You went to see Galuzzo?

25:29.725 --> 25:31.239
You could have exposed us both.

25:31.405 --> 25:34.523
It was worth the risk.
He's definitely hiding something.

25:35.525 --> 25:37.005
So now what?

25:37.565 --> 25:40.000
I break into his house tomorrow,
when he's at work...

25:40.165 --> 25:42.157
try to find evidence
that he's our man.

25:42.325 --> 25:44.476
And in the meantime,
what if he comes for me?

25:44.645 --> 25:47.035
Do you have any way
to protect yourself?

25:47.445 --> 25:49.755
A gun. I haven't used it for years.

25:50.205 --> 25:52.879
Keep it loaded
and call me if you need me.

25:53.205 --> 25:54.525
I'm meeting Deb for dinner.

25:55.285 --> 25:58.244
- I'll check in with you later.
- Wait. Just—

25:58.605 --> 26:01.882
There's one thing I was wondering
about since we last spoke.

26:02.525 --> 26:03.595
Yes?

26:03.765 --> 26:06.485
When Harry and I
came up with the code...

26:06.645 --> 26:09.638
he insisted
that you only kill bad people.

26:09.885 --> 26:13.720
And I insisted
that the first rule of the code be:

26:13.965 --> 26:15.115
"Don't get caught."

26:17.165 --> 26:18.997
Giving you a little wiggle room.

26:22.005 --> 26:23.121
Okay.

26:23.925 --> 26:26.042
So my question is this:

26:28.485 --> 26:33.241
When your sister found out about who
you were and what you were doing...

26:35.725 --> 26:38.479
- ... why didn't you kill her?
- What?

26:38.925 --> 26:40.803
Not that I'd advocate such a thing...

26:41.165 --> 26:45.239
but since Debra knew the truth
about you, she's clearly a risk—

26:45.405 --> 26:47.317
I would never kill Debra.
She's my sister.

26:47.485 --> 26:49.044
I love her.

26:50.005 --> 26:52.361
What exactly do you love about her?

26:56.165 --> 26:57.519
What do you mean?

26:57.805 --> 27:00.081
When a psychopath
speaks about love...

27:01.005 --> 27:04.157
it doesn't really mean the same thing
as for typical people.

27:04.325 --> 27:06.396
So what do you love about her?

27:10.045 --> 27:11.638
I don't know.

27:14.605 --> 27:16.517
I love having steaks
and beer with her...

27:19.405 --> 27:20.725
and until recently...

27:20.885 --> 27:27.075
the fact that she was always there
for me, the way she looked up to me.

27:27.725 --> 27:30.479
But none of that
is really about Debra.

27:31.245 --> 27:33.714
It's about what she does for you.

27:35.125 --> 27:36.479
So you're saying I'm selfish?

27:36.645 --> 27:38.204
I'm not criticising.

27:39.045 --> 27:42.197
Selfless love is hard enough
for typical people.

27:42.365 --> 27:44.596
And for psychopaths...

27:45.685 --> 27:46.721
it's impossible.

27:46.885 --> 27:49.719
Why are you telling me this?
So I'll feel bad about myself?

27:49.925 --> 27:51.484
Quite the contrary.

27:52.525 --> 27:54.642
I want you to revel in what you are.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.797
I told you, you're perfect.

27:57.525 --> 28:00.120
How can you say that
when you know what I've done to Deb?

28:00.325 --> 28:01.759
That's my point.

28:01.925 --> 28:03.882
You're perfect as a psychopath.

28:04.085 --> 28:07.317
All this talk about helping Debra,
and loving her...

28:07.485 --> 28:11.638
it's like you're Michelangelo
trying to play the banjo.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.605
I'm trying to be a good brother.

28:13.765 --> 28:16.234
Why don't you let me help Debra?

28:16.565 --> 28:18.921
Because she wouldn't even listen
to you.

28:19.365 --> 28:22.085
I'm the only one who understands her.

28:22.245 --> 28:26.603
Dexter, you admitted
to being the cause of her pain.

28:27.965 --> 28:30.321
How can you expect to be the solution?

28:31.485 --> 28:32.635
I can handle Deb.

28:34.485 --> 28:36.602
I've been doing it my entire life.

28:39.605 --> 28:40.755
All right, next question.

28:40.925 --> 28:44.714
Physically evasive movements to defeat
an officer's attempt to control is:

28:44.885 --> 28:49.198
A, active aggression,
B, physical resistance...

28:49.365 --> 28:53.439
C, active resistance,
D, active evasion?

28:55.845 --> 28:57.564
B, active aggression.

28:57.765 --> 29:01.441
Okay, active aggression is actually A.

29:02.085 --> 29:03.360
And B, it's wrong.

29:03.925 --> 29:05.803
The answer is C, active resistance.

29:06.845 --> 29:08.074
Wait, I'm confused.

29:08.245 --> 29:09.474
Of course you are.

29:09.685 --> 29:11.836
Matthews was right.
You're a fucking lost cause.

29:12.005 --> 29:14.361
Jesus, Angel. Easy.

29:14.565 --> 29:16.557
Yeah, Angel. Easy.

29:17.285 --> 29:20.517
I stuck my neck out
on the line for you with Matthews.

29:21.045 --> 29:22.525
You better not fuck this up.

29:23.045 --> 29:24.684
Will you please cut him some slack?

29:24.845 --> 29:28.236
He's tired from being called out
in the middle of the night on that case.

29:28.405 --> 29:30.636
What case? There's no case.

29:35.805 --> 29:37.478
I'm...

29:40.885 --> 29:42.239
I'm gonna let you guys talk.

29:54.045 --> 29:56.162
So where did you really go at 4 a.m.?

29:56.605 --> 29:58.995
Deb was in trouble
and needed my help.

29:59.325 --> 30:01.556
She's been going through
kind of a hard time.

30:03.005 --> 30:04.280
And why did she call you?

30:04.965 --> 30:06.081
Why not her brother?

30:06.285 --> 30:10.120
I don't think they're getting along,
you know, and she's a friend.

30:10.285 --> 30:12.959
- I couldn't say no.
- She's more than a friend.

30:13.205 --> 30:14.844
I mean, you used to fuck her.

30:16.525 --> 30:19.359
And now she's calling you
for everything.

30:20.205 --> 30:22.037
What am I supposed to think?

30:22.685 --> 30:28.363
Jamie, I swear to you, there is nothing
going on between me and Deb.

30:28.805 --> 30:30.080
Then why lie about it?

30:30.285 --> 30:32.197
Because I didn't think
you'd understand.

30:32.845 --> 30:34.359
Well, you're right.

30:34.565 --> 30:35.681
I don't.

30:36.245 --> 30:38.077
Enjoy your dinner.

30:57.525 --> 30:59.642
The fuck are we doing
in this hellhole?

31:01.245 --> 31:04.363
Can I get you something to drink?
We have a wide array of cocktails.

31:04.525 --> 31:06.801
I'll take a bourbon, neat. Thank you.

31:07.765 --> 31:09.802
Two cokes, please.

31:12.365 --> 31:14.038
I knew this was a mistake.

31:14.885 --> 31:16.956
I wanted to show you something.

31:17.605 --> 31:21.679
You see that man over there?
The father?

31:23.405 --> 31:26.079
- Yeah.
- Does he look familiar?

31:30.765 --> 31:32.358
Fuck if I know.

31:39.285 --> 31:41.356
<i>Fuck. He's wearing Kevlar.</i>

31:49.565 --> 31:50.635
<i>Don't fucking move!</i>

31:50.845 --> 31:52.598
So what, Dex?
That was a long time ago.

31:52.805 --> 31:54.034
Yeah, but look.

31:57.245 --> 31:59.396
See this guy, the guy you saved?

32:01.205 --> 32:03.561
That's him. Right there.

32:11.005 --> 32:13.884
His little girl wouldn't have a father
if it weren't for you.

32:14.645 --> 32:17.444
That's why I brought you
to this hellhole, to show you that.

32:23.405 --> 32:27.285
I know you think you're a bad person
after all that happened, but you're not.

32:27.485 --> 32:30.523
You're a good person.

32:33.725 --> 32:35.523
You brought a lot of good to the world.

32:49.805 --> 32:52.036
I'm fucking starving.

33:38.885 --> 33:41.798
<i>Have a nice day at the mall.</i>

33:44.645 --> 33:47.285
I realise this is not the outcome
you were hoping for...

33:47.445 --> 33:50.916
but it can help
with a favourable divorce settlement.

33:56.685 --> 33:59.644
If you want,
we can forward those to your attorney.

34:05.085 --> 34:06.155
I don't know.

34:07.525 --> 34:08.879
You don't have to decide now.

34:09.805 --> 34:11.444
I realise it's a lot to take in.

34:12.525 --> 34:15.359
I mean, I don't know if that's him.

34:17.405 --> 34:18.475
I'm sorry?

34:18.685 --> 34:23.476
This man in the pictures,
I'm not sure that's my husband.

34:25.445 --> 34:27.721
That's him, all right.
Look, you can see his face.

34:28.245 --> 34:29.804
Not clearly.

34:30.325 --> 34:31.759
The lighting isn't very good.

34:31.965 --> 34:34.924
Mrs. Gerard, I assure you,
we're always very careful—

34:35.085 --> 34:36.235
This was a mistake.

34:36.405 --> 34:39.000
- Mrs. Gerard—
- I'm sorry that I wasted your time.

34:39.485 --> 34:41.681
I'll leave a cheque at the front desk.

34:47.685 --> 34:50.439
Is she fucking kidding?
That's obviously her husband.

34:54.245 --> 34:56.043
She just didn't want to see it.

34:56.205 --> 34:58.674
People get used to living in denial.

34:59.405 --> 35:01.681
It's just easier, you know?

35:13.125 --> 35:16.004
<i>Galuzzo has to be the guy
we're looking for.</i>

35:30.365 --> 35:34.484
<i>Why would Galuzzo be such a slob
everywhere else but here?</i>

36:01.005 --> 36:03.884
<i>That's why the kitchen is so clean:
It's a kill room.</i>

36:04.045 --> 36:06.719
<i>Galuzzo wasn't checking my body fat
for my own fitness.</i>

36:06.885 --> 36:09.719
<i>He was checking to see
if I was fit to have as a main course.</i>

36:11.045 --> 36:14.243
<i>He's definitely a butcher. But does
that make him the Brain Surgeon?</i>

36:24.245 --> 36:25.679
<i>Our killer leaves bodies out...</i>

36:25.845 --> 36:28.724
<i>but Galuzzo keeps his bodies
to season and savour.</i>

36:29.325 --> 36:30.884
<i>This brain is completely intact...</i>

36:31.085 --> 36:34.965
<i>marinating in some sort of...
garlic sauce.</i>

36:36.005 --> 36:39.077
<i>Galuzzo wouldn't waste brains
by sending them to Vogel.</i>

36:39.245 --> 36:42.044
<i>They're a delicacy. He eats them.</i>

36:43.685 --> 36:46.883
<i>Which means whoever's after us
is still out there...</i>

36:47.045 --> 36:49.401
<i>and he still has the upper hand.</i>

36:56.325 --> 36:58.237
<i>Fuck. He's wearing Kevlar.</i>

37:19.765 --> 37:21.802
<i>Fuck. He's wearing Kevlar.</i>

38:13.525 --> 38:15.835
Deb, what are you doing here?

38:19.325 --> 38:22.602
I want to make an official statement.

38:23.365 --> 38:25.118
How much have you had to drink?

38:26.605 --> 38:28.278
One or two.

38:28.485 --> 38:31.398
- Why don't we get some coffee?
- I don't want coffee.

38:31.565 --> 38:33.716
I want to confess.

38:34.485 --> 38:36.397
You want to confess to what?

38:39.525 --> 38:41.676
I killed LaGuerta.

38:44.125 --> 38:46.594
- You what?
- I killed LaGuer—

38:47.325 --> 38:49.601
Why don't we go someplace quiet
where we can talk?

38:49.805 --> 38:51.922
- Fuck!
- I got you.

38:53.045 --> 38:54.035
Take it easy.

38:55.005 --> 38:55.995
Calm down.

39:12.765 --> 39:14.085
What are you talking about?

39:15.325 --> 39:17.476
I told you. I killed LaGuerta.

39:18.645 --> 39:21.080
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It does.

39:23.885 --> 39:27.481
On New Year's Eve, I was at Papa's.

39:29.845 --> 39:32.804
I called dispatch to find out
where she was going.

39:32.965 --> 39:35.275
They said she was going
to the shipping yard...

39:35.445 --> 39:38.119
where she met Estrada before.

39:38.325 --> 39:40.681
So you feel guilty
that you didn't back her up.

39:41.045 --> 39:43.799
I don't feel guilty.
I am guilty.

39:43.965 --> 39:46.958
No, you can't let yourself
think that way.

39:47.205 --> 39:48.525
You had no way of knowing...

39:48.685 --> 39:51.280
- ... what she was doing there.
- I did know.

39:52.725 --> 39:54.603
I killed her.

39:55.165 --> 39:59.398
Deb, Estrada killed LaGuerta.
We both know that.

40:01.525 --> 40:04.040
That's not what happened.
I'll tell you what happened.

40:04.205 --> 40:05.924
I know what happened.

40:06.125 --> 40:08.799
The bullet that killed LaGuerta
came from Estrada's gun.

40:09.565 --> 40:12.956
He shot first. It was a through and
through. Bullet was never recovered.

40:13.125 --> 40:15.003
She shot back. He went down.

40:15.165 --> 40:19.000
He got one more shot off, and that
bullet was traced to Estrada's gun.

40:20.845 --> 40:23.440
They both died at the same time.

40:25.485 --> 40:27.681
- That's not true.
- It is.

40:28.245 --> 40:30.282
Remember,
Dexter walked us through it.

40:30.485 --> 40:32.317
Dexter! Oh, fuck.

40:32.525 --> 40:33.641
Hey.

40:34.565 --> 40:37.000
Oh, God, Joey, you have to believe—

40:37.205 --> 40:38.639
Okay, okay. I believe you.

40:38.845 --> 40:40.723
I believe you. All right?

40:41.645 --> 40:43.079
Okay.

40:43.285 --> 40:48.076
Here, just write down everything you
remember from that night, all right?

40:48.245 --> 40:49.235
- Okay.
- All right.

40:49.405 --> 40:51.283
Good. Good.

40:54.045 --> 40:56.640
- Okay.
- I'll be right back with you.

41:05.805 --> 41:07.922
What about Arnold Gordon?
Trauma surgeon.

41:08.085 --> 41:09.883
He definitely has the right skill set.

41:10.045 --> 41:11.035
Motive?

41:11.205 --> 41:13.765
He always resented
that I called him a psychopath...

41:13.925 --> 41:17.396
and he threatened to hurt me
if ever I told anyone that he was.

41:22.645 --> 41:25.114
- Morgan.
- You need to get down to the station.

41:25.765 --> 41:28.360
- I'm a little busy.
- Your sister just confessed...

41:28.525 --> 41:30.244
- ... to killing LaGuerta.
- What?

41:30.405 --> 41:33.125
<i>She's drunk, high, fucked up—
I put her in a room...</i>

41:33.285 --> 41:35.720
<i>- ... so nobody could see her.</i>
- Make sure she stays.

41:35.885 --> 41:37.524
- I'm on my way.
<i>- All right.</i>

41:40.085 --> 41:41.485
Is everything okay?

41:42.445 --> 41:43.925
It's Debra.

41:45.565 --> 41:48.000
I need you to come
to the station with me.

41:48.445 --> 41:50.641
- Has something happened?
- Yes.

41:54.885 --> 41:56.797
I can't believe she actually confessed.

41:57.245 --> 41:59.840
I thought I got her to see
that she's a good person.

42:00.005 --> 42:03.396
This could have been the only way
she could relieve herself of the guilt.

42:03.765 --> 42:05.484
Need you to help get her out of this.

42:05.645 --> 42:08.160
Give your expert opinion
that she's having a breakdown.

42:08.565 --> 42:09.794
Are you sure?

42:10.005 --> 42:11.758
This could be the best thing for her.

42:11.965 --> 42:14.116
Spending the rest of her life in prison?

42:14.285 --> 42:17.119
- That's the last thing Deb needs.
- Or the last thing you need.

42:17.285 --> 42:19.754
If Debra goes away,
odds are, you'll join her.

42:20.245 --> 42:23.761
Admit it, Dexter.
You're mostly worried about yourself.

42:24.085 --> 42:25.519
That's not true.

42:26.325 --> 42:28.078
I told you, I love her.

42:28.245 --> 42:29.725
Not the same way she loves you.

42:29.885 --> 42:33.435
When Debra killed LaGuerta,
it was real, selfless love.

42:33.725 --> 42:37.036
She sacrificed
everything she believed in for you.

42:38.085 --> 42:39.963
Can you see that?

42:41.245 --> 42:45.285
Your sister needs professional help.
There's nothing more you can do.

42:46.885 --> 42:49.002
Well, I can't just give up on her.

42:50.645 --> 42:52.318
I can't.

43:09.485 --> 43:11.636
Dex, hey. Dr. Vogel.

43:11.845 --> 43:15.043
She's an old friend of Deb's and Dad,
so I figured she could help.

43:15.205 --> 43:17.401
- Is she still in the interrogation room?
- Yeah.

43:17.565 --> 43:20.683
- Have you told anyone what she said?
- Course not. It's crazy, right?

43:20.845 --> 43:21.995
She's going through something.

43:22.205 --> 43:24.925
She's likely suffering
from posttraumatic stress disorder...

43:25.125 --> 43:27.799
- ... after Captain LaGuerta's death.
- She wasn't even there.

43:28.005 --> 43:30.679
One of the most common components
is survivor's guilt...

43:30.845 --> 43:34.361
the belief that she could have
somehow prevented what happened.

43:34.525 --> 43:37.802
- That's what I was telling her.
- Not an uncommon response.

43:37.965 --> 43:40.241
We have to get her out of here.

43:42.765 --> 43:44.882
What the fuck are you doing here?

43:45.045 --> 43:46.365
Watch the hallway.

43:47.245 --> 43:49.601
Deb, this is Dr. Vogel.
She was a friend of Dad's.

43:49.765 --> 43:51.245
You can trust her. She can help.

43:51.605 --> 43:53.756
- Hello, Debra.
- I don't give a fuck who you are.

43:53.925 --> 43:55.154
Get the fuck out.

43:55.525 --> 43:57.881
Debra, I know how much pain
you must be feeling.

43:58.045 --> 44:02.039
But we need to talk about this before
you do something you might regret.

44:02.245 --> 44:03.361
Regret?

44:03.525 --> 44:06.165
The thing that I regret
happened six months ago.

44:06.325 --> 44:09.204
I'm confessing everything.
I'm telling the whole fucking truth!

44:09.365 --> 44:11.163
There's nothing you can do
to stop me!

44:11.325 --> 44:13.123
- Deb, please, let us—
- Quinn, let me—

44:15.045 --> 44:17.355
- That was interesting.
- Here. Hold this.

44:21.805 --> 44:23.000
She passed out.

44:24.725 --> 44:26.444
We must take her home to rest.

44:27.045 --> 44:28.240
Let's get her out of here.

44:33.925 --> 44:35.598
Is she gonna be okay?

44:35.805 --> 44:37.239
Absolutely.

44:37.525 --> 44:40.120
There may be some work to do,
but I promise...

44:40.325 --> 44:42.521
Debra's gonna get through this.

44:44.485 --> 44:46.954
- Is there anything else you need?
- Not right now.

44:47.165 --> 44:49.725
Thanks for calling.
You did the right thing.

44:55.045 --> 44:56.399
What the fuck?

45:11.845 --> 45:15.156
Are you sure she'll be all right,
with everything she has in her system?

45:15.325 --> 45:18.159
Physically, she's fine.
It was a very low dose.

45:18.885 --> 45:20.558
But emotionally...

45:25.125 --> 45:26.559
This is all my fault.

45:27.365 --> 45:28.685
Go easy on yourself.

45:29.725 --> 45:31.956
I should have listened to you.

45:33.045 --> 45:36.004
I thought I could fix this,
but you're right. I can't.

45:37.005 --> 45:39.998
I don't want to just keep
making her worse.

45:48.085 --> 45:49.997
Do you really think you can help her?

45:52.805 --> 45:54.239
Yes.

46:01.045 --> 46:02.399
Okay.

46:04.485 --> 46:05.919
Go now.

46:06.885 --> 46:08.239
Let me do what I do.

46:10.005 --> 46:11.564
Wait.

46:26.205 --> 46:27.559
Dexter, what are you doing?

46:28.165 --> 46:30.725
She's gonna be pissed
when she wakes up...

46:32.325 --> 46:34.999
- ... maybe even violent.
- I can handle her.

46:36.405 --> 46:37.680
You don't know my sister.

46:43.445 --> 46:44.879
Thanks.

46:50.085 --> 46:51.565
<i>Vogel was right.</i>

46:52.525 --> 46:54.164
<i>I am perfect.</i>

46:59.285 --> 47:01.038
<i>But only at one thing.</i>

47:16.165 --> 47:17.963
You disgusting...

47:18.325 --> 47:19.475
cannibal.

47:20.685 --> 47:23.564
Consumer of human flesh.

47:27.045 --> 47:31.039
There was a time when I couldn't
imagine anyone being what you are...

47:31.885 --> 47:33.877
and doing what you do.

47:35.885 --> 47:38.195
But now I realise I'm just like you.

47:44.565 --> 47:47.205
I consume everyone I love.
