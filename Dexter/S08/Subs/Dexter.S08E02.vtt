00:09.565 --> 00:10.919
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:11.125 --> 00:12.639
How is Deb? She's better?

00:12.845 --> 00:13.881
Yeah, she's great.

00:14.085 --> 00:17.283
What case is she working on?
Briggs. Andrew Briggs.

00:17.485 --> 00:18.521
Deb, what's going on?

00:18.725 --> 00:21.365
I'm getting close to Briggs
so I can get the jewellery

00:21.565 --> 00:22.715
before he fences it.

00:22.965 --> 00:25.764
You haven't talked to me in weeks.
You made me compromise

00:26.005 --> 00:28.520
everything about myself
that I care about.

00:28.725 --> 00:30.762
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

00:32.245 --> 00:33.804
Don't stop. Don't stop.

00:34.005 --> 00:36.361
The chance that someone
might find out our secret

00:36.565 --> 00:37.965
makes it even more fun.

00:38.165 --> 00:42.045
You're all sweaty.
Yup. Just doing a little cardio.

00:43.285 --> 00:44.844
Whoa.
Looks like a piece of it

00:45.005 --> 00:48.203
has been scooped out.
That's the anterior insular cortex,

00:48.445 --> 00:51.563
the portion of the brain
that processes empathy.

00:51.765 --> 00:54.883
This is Dr. Evelyn Vogel.
Evelyn is a neuropsychiatrist.

00:55.085 --> 00:58.556
I hear the FBI calls her
the psychopath whisperer.

00:58.765 --> 00:59.915
What was he like?
Who?

01:00.165 --> 01:01.394
The Bay Harbor Butcher.

01:02.365 --> 01:05.403
I look forward to working with you,
Dexter Morgan.

01:06.045 --> 01:08.355
Can you look into someone
named El Sapo for me?

01:08.565 --> 01:10.318
<i>- Who is he?</i>
- He's a fucking fence.

01:10.525 --> 01:12.244
El Sapo isn't a fence.
He's a hit man.

01:12.445 --> 01:14.357
He's gonna get the jewels
and kill Briggs.

01:14.565 --> 01:16.761
I'm trying to keep you from
getting shot along with him.

01:16.925 --> 01:19.121
Aah!
I came here to save you.

01:19.325 --> 01:21.840
Deb, look at yourself. You're lost.

01:22.045 --> 01:24.879
You are lost.

01:25.365 --> 01:28.483
Dexter. I was hoping
to share something with you.

01:34.525 --> 01:35.675
What is it you want?

01:35.885 --> 01:37.717
You can't kill me.

01:38.965 --> 01:40.558
Why?

01:40.965 --> 01:44.003
Because I don't fit Harry's code.

01:45.005 --> 01:51.079
FaceTime with British Models 24/7
www. saucytime. com

03:42.325 --> 03:44.123
<i>We're recording.</i>

03:47.525 --> 03:49.403
<i>So to review where we are,</i>

03:49.605 --> 03:52.325
<i>two weeks ago, you told me
that your son Dexter</i>

03:52.525 --> 03:55.916
<i>had asked to see the actual scene
of a homicide.</i>

03:56.125 --> 03:58.117
<i>You also said that you opposed
this request.</i>

03:58.325 --> 04:00.635
<i>Yes. Because he's only 10 years old.</i>

04:00.885 --> 04:02.922
<i>So why are you here today?</i>

04:03.125 --> 04:05.356
<i>He kept asking and asking</i>

04:05.605 --> 04:08.040
<i>so I decided to give him
what he wanted.</i>

04:08.245 --> 04:11.761
<i>I even started to hope it might
shock him out of this...</i>

04:13.045 --> 04:14.764
<i>condition.</i>

04:15.005 --> 04:16.997
<i>Tell me what happened.</i>

04:17.885 --> 04:19.956
<i>I got a call about a homicide
in Coral Gables.</i>

04:20.165 --> 04:24.637
<i>A woman had shot her ex-husband as
he was trying to break into the house.</i>

04:24.845 --> 04:26.996
<i>I waited until the forensic guys
cleared out</i>

04:27.245 --> 04:29.635
<i>and then I snuck Dexter
onto the scene.</i>

04:31.365 --> 04:34.005
<i>The victim had fallen
through a sliding glass door</i>

04:34.205 --> 04:35.719
<i>so there was blood everywhere.</i>

04:35.965 --> 04:37.524
<i>And it didn't seem to faze Dexter.</i>

04:37.685 --> 04:39.165
<i>And he wasn't bothered at all?</i>

04:39.365 --> 04:41.834
<i>If anything, he was fascinated.</i>

04:44.125 --> 04:47.038
<i>He just stood there, staring.</i>

04:51.085 --> 04:53.042
<i>Like he was admiring a painting.</i>

04:53.245 --> 04:56.443
<i>I remember that day.
It was like a painting.</i>

04:56.645 --> 04:58.364
<i>And I wanted to be the artist.</i>

04:58.565 --> 05:02.718
<i>We didn't stay long, and when we were
driving home, I noticed that...</i>

05:03.605 --> 05:06.518
<i>Dexter was holding something
in his hand.</i>

05:08.285 --> 05:10.641
<i>He'd stolen it from the crime scene.</i>

05:11.365 --> 05:13.084
<i>A trophy.</i>

05:17.765 --> 05:20.234
<i>I'm right about Dex, aren't I?</i>

05:22.245 --> 05:24.237
<i>There's something wrong with him.</i>

05:24.485 --> 05:27.239
<i>One could put it that way,
but I do agree</i>

05:27.445 --> 05:30.119
<i>that Dexter is exactly
what you suspect him to be.</i>

05:30.725 --> 05:34.924
<i>Trust me when I say that there's
a place in this world for your son.</i>

05:35.125 --> 05:37.799
<i>I don't know what it is
or what form it will take</i>

05:38.005 --> 05:40.645
<i>but we're gonna find it together.</i>

05:42.325 --> 05:46.763
You were only 10 years old
when your father first sought my help.

05:48.085 --> 05:50.805
I know almost everything
about you, Dexter.

05:51.965 --> 05:54.434
Not just because I heard it
from your father

05:54.645 --> 05:56.955
but because I helped create you.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.715
Create me?
You sound like Dr. Frankenstein.

06:00.965 --> 06:04.117
Don't mean to.
Don't know how else to put it.

06:04.325 --> 06:06.715
I mean, it was obvious
that you not only showed

06:06.925 --> 06:09.997
all the classic traits
of a psychopath

06:10.205 --> 06:13.357
but that you would eventually
become a killer.

06:14.245 --> 06:18.159
So we were faced with a little dilemma:
what to do with you.

06:19.045 --> 06:23.039
It was me who convinced Harry
that your urges couldn't be stopped

06:23.245 --> 06:25.476
but they could be focused.

06:26.925 --> 06:31.442
Eventually we realised that hunting
animals wasn't going to satiate you

06:31.645 --> 06:37.357
so we decided that you could be
taught to kill other kinds of animals.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.955
People who truly deserve to die.

06:40.165 --> 06:42.760
You're saying you came up
with the code?

06:43.005 --> 06:44.883
Harry had a big hand in the details.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.557
His law enforcement background
was certainly an asset

06:48.805 --> 06:51.639
but he was operating
under my guidance.

06:54.565 --> 07:01.483
I can't help but think of myself
as your spiritual mother.

07:01.965 --> 07:05.163
I know we've only just met
face to face

07:05.405 --> 07:08.045
but this is kind of like a reunion.
Heh.

07:08.285 --> 07:10.481
I should have chilled
some champagne.

07:11.085 --> 07:14.123
You experimented on me.
That's what mothers do?

07:15.005 --> 07:17.804
I developed a framework
for your survival.

07:18.045 --> 07:19.684
That's what mothers do.

07:20.725 --> 07:22.921
You made me what I am.
Heh.

07:23.925 --> 07:26.963
You'd have preferred an institution?
Death row?

07:27.165 --> 07:30.442
I could have turned my back on you.
I could have let Harry do the same.

07:30.685 --> 07:33.723
I could have even
notified the authorities.

07:33.925 --> 07:34.995
Why didn't you?

07:38.605 --> 07:42.235
Well, let's just say
you got under my skin.

07:43.285 --> 07:46.198
I came to care for you, Dexter.

07:46.445 --> 07:47.959
I still do.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.036
Why are you telling me this?

07:55.885 --> 07:57.922
I saved your life.

07:58.805 --> 08:01.798
And I'm afraid I need
to call in the favour.

08:08.165 --> 08:10.202
I'm sure you recognise this.

08:11.205 --> 08:13.765
It's a section of the human brain.

08:13.965 --> 08:15.797
Anterior insular cortex.

08:16.005 --> 08:19.794
A murder victim was missing
the same piece of tissue.

08:20.005 --> 08:21.883
And this is it. In the flesh.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.805
I found it on my doorstep
wrapped in butcher paper.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.565
Unfortunately,
there was no return address.

08:27.765 --> 08:31.361
Why would the killer send this to you?
A message.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.836
I've come to believe
that the killer could be

08:34.045 --> 08:36.799
one of my former patients.

08:37.405 --> 08:40.125
This would be the perfect
explanation for this little gift.

08:40.325 --> 08:44.001
You think it's a threat.
Hm. A brain on a doorstep.

08:44.405 --> 08:46.476
Hardly a love letter.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.362
Sooner or later,

08:58.605 --> 09:02.076
someone's going to be holding
a piece of my brain in a jar.

09:05.325 --> 09:09.319
I want you to find him, Dexter.

09:10.365 --> 09:14.803
And I want you to do
what Harry and I taught you to do.

09:16.165 --> 09:18.805
I don't take requests.

09:19.925 --> 09:22.759
You have contacts at the FBI.
You're working with Miami Metro.

09:23.005 --> 09:25.520
Why don't you go to them?
I wish I could.

09:25.725 --> 09:27.796
What's stopping you?

09:28.045 --> 09:30.719
You're not the first psychopath
I've treated.

09:30.965 --> 09:33.082
You taught other people the code?

09:33.285 --> 09:35.436
No. You're special.

09:35.685 --> 09:38.200
But I've used other
unorthodox methods,

09:39.325 --> 09:42.796
some of which might be
considered illegal.

09:44.005 --> 09:47.476
So if the police track down this killer
and it's someone I treatedâ€”

09:47.685 --> 09:49.802
Your unorthodox methods
might be exposed

09:50.005 --> 09:51.883
and your career would be ruined.

09:52.085 --> 09:54.077
You might even go to jail.

09:54.325 --> 09:55.839
You see my problem.

09:56.045 --> 09:57.957
I see that it's your problem.

10:08.565 --> 10:11.922
This will help put things
into perspective.

10:15.285 --> 10:19.564
Don't tell me you're gonna pass up
on another piece of your history.

10:26.165 --> 10:28.885
Think about it,
but don't take too long.

10:29.685 --> 10:31.165
Killer's out there, Dexter,

10:31.365 --> 10:35.325
and I don't mind admitting
I'm afraid of what's coming next.

10:49.045 --> 10:51.685
You don't deserve this,
but I don't have a choice.

10:51.925 --> 10:55.202
I have to. I'm sorry.

10:57.525 --> 10:59.881
<i>Dexter killed someone else
last night.</i>

11:00.045 --> 11:01.240
<i>Who?</i>

11:01.725 --> 11:03.284
<i>A drug dealer.</i>

11:04.925 --> 11:08.521
<i>Guy robbed and killed two
of his clients. College kids.</i>

11:08.725 --> 11:10.682
<i>At least Dexter is following
the programme.</i>

11:12.885 --> 11:16.435
<i>He told me something new that he did
to the drug dealer before he killed him.</i>

11:16.645 --> 11:18.364
<i>And that was?</i>

11:18.605 --> 11:20.676
<i>He made him look at photos
of his victims.</i>

11:22.485 --> 11:24.078
<i>Interesting.</i>

11:24.285 --> 11:25.605
<i>Did you ask him why?</i>

11:27.445 --> 11:30.643
<i>He said it was something
he felt he needed to do.</i>

11:35.165 --> 11:36.485
<i>What do you think it means?</i>

11:37.205 --> 11:39.401
<i>Humans are born with
an innate sense of justice.</i>

11:39.605 --> 11:43.440
<i>Maybe Dexter is discovering this.</i>

11:44.445 --> 11:46.437
<i>The important thing is,
after three kills,</i>

11:46.685 --> 11:48.722
<i>he's embracing the process.</i>

11:50.005 --> 11:52.395
<i>It's gonna work out for him, Harry.</i>

11:54.405 --> 11:55.885
<i>I hope so.</i>

12:00.925 --> 12:04.805
She believed in you
at a time when I was in doubt.

12:06.765 --> 12:10.679
Vogel gave me this DVD to make me
feel as if I owe her something.

12:11.245 --> 12:12.395
Don't you?

12:12.965 --> 12:14.763
If she's responsible for creating me,

12:15.005 --> 12:18.157
she's responsible
for what I've done to Deb.

12:18.925 --> 12:21.315
Maybe Vogel can help you.

12:21.885 --> 12:23.558
Help me how?

12:23.885 --> 12:25.285
With Deb.

12:26.485 --> 12:29.205
You must have told Vogel
a lot about Deb.

12:29.405 --> 12:31.283
She was part of your life.

12:31.525 --> 12:33.039
I wish she still was.

12:33.845 --> 12:36.041
Deb said she hated me,

12:36.245 --> 12:39.363
that she should have killed me
inside that shipping container

12:39.565 --> 12:43.764
instead of LaGuerta. Maybe I should
just listen to you, stay away from her.

12:43.965 --> 12:47.675
All I'm saying is that Vogel
might open up some possibilities.

12:48.645 --> 12:52.161
At the very least, she's a window
to your past that you just can't ignore.

12:52.365 --> 12:54.755
I don't trust Vogel. I can't.

12:55.005 --> 12:58.077
All the more reason
to keep her close.

13:04.125 --> 13:07.482
Okay, just so we're on the same page,
you're supposed to locate Briggs

13:07.725 --> 13:10.445
and take him into custody.
It's that simple, right?

13:11.405 --> 13:14.842
I was also supposed to find
the stolen jewellery, right?

13:15.525 --> 13:18.404
Recover the goods,
collect 20 percent?

13:19.805 --> 13:22.843
Am I supposed to believe that's what
you were doing for two weeks?

13:23.045 --> 13:26.482
Just looking for the jewellery?
Yes, Elway.

13:28.125 --> 13:31.482
He wasn't gonna just give it to me.
It wasn't lying around the apartment.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.324
I had to play him.

13:40.565 --> 13:42.796
What is that shit?
It looks like horse piss.

13:43.005 --> 13:45.042
It's electrolyte replenishment
formula.

13:45.245 --> 13:48.079
You look dehydrated.
It impairs your judgement.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.322
Probably fuelling that bad attitude.

13:53.885 --> 13:55.319
So tell me,

13:55.565 --> 13:59.798
where does it say undercover work
in your job description?

14:01.405 --> 14:02.998
I was improvising.

14:03.205 --> 14:05.083
Well, you put one of my assets
at risk.

14:05.325 --> 14:06.918
Namely yourself.

14:07.925 --> 14:09.279
That's my call.

14:09.485 --> 14:11.556
Well, your asset is just fine.

14:11.765 --> 14:13.916
I wish I could say the same thing
about Briggs.

14:14.165 --> 14:16.441
That again?
I told you I don't know what happened.

14:16.645 --> 14:18.796
I came back to our room
and he was dead.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.559
"Our room"?

14:21.765 --> 14:25.395
So you two were intimate?

14:28.165 --> 14:30.316
First of all, who says "intimate"?

14:32.485 --> 14:35.683
And second, what does it even matter?
What was I supposed to do, say:

14:35.885 --> 14:38.116
"Hey, can I have that jewellery
that you stole

14:38.325 --> 14:41.045
because I'd love to get
the finder's fee on that too"?

14:42.285 --> 14:43.401
I was doing my job.

14:43.605 --> 14:46.439
If you were, we wouldn't be here
with nothing to show for it.

14:46.645 --> 14:50.355
We don't have nothing to show for it.
I found these on Briggs.

14:50.565 --> 14:53.285
This looks like a key
to a storage unit.

14:53.485 --> 14:55.477
I bet that's where
he stashed the jewellery.

14:55.685 --> 14:57.722
Why didn't you tell me that
in the beginning?

14:57.965 --> 15:00.321
Because it's more fun
to watch you eat crow.

15:01.165 --> 15:04.203
Take a bite.
We haven't found the jewellery yet.

15:04.405 --> 15:06.317
You could be wrong.
But what if I'm not?

15:06.525 --> 15:10.485
Then we recover 20 percent.
Right. And you'll love me for that.

15:13.965 --> 15:16.434
<i>Another morning, another body.</i>

15:16.685 --> 15:20.156
<i>Miami makes more corpses
than sunburns.</i>

15:20.365 --> 15:22.277
<i>And I'm thankful.</i>

15:22.525 --> 15:24.562
<i>A crime scene might be
the only place left</i>

15:24.765 --> 15:27.485
<i>where I can still control the chaos.</i>

15:29.845 --> 15:30.881
Fuck me.

15:31.085 --> 15:33.600
What does this guy think,
he's a fucking brain surgeon?

15:33.805 --> 15:35.239
The Brain Surgeon.

15:36.845 --> 15:40.725
Anterior insular cortex is missing,
just like the last one.

15:40.965 --> 15:43.082
So we have a serial?

15:43.885 --> 15:45.877
Vogel was right.

15:47.525 --> 15:49.118
Judging from the lack of blood,

15:49.325 --> 15:52.318
I'd say this one was done
post-mortem too.

15:54.285 --> 15:56.436
No entry wounds.

16:01.685 --> 16:03.802
Ah. Petechial haemorrhaging
around the eyes.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.803
Bruising around the throat.

16:06.005 --> 16:07.325
Asphyxiation.

16:07.525 --> 16:10.040
So the last time,
the killer left the murder weapon

16:10.285 --> 16:11.719
somewhere near the body.

16:12.365 --> 16:14.277
Maybe he did it again.

16:14.485 --> 16:19.241
So, what are we looking for?
Ropes, nylons, giant pillow.

16:19.445 --> 16:21.323
Okay, everyone spread out.

16:29.645 --> 16:31.637
<i>A plastic bag?</i>

16:38.285 --> 16:41.483
<i>Not the worst way
to asphyxiate someone.</i>

16:45.805 --> 16:49.321
Blood?
I think I've got a murder weapon.

16:50.445 --> 16:52.118
Let's hope he left a print.

17:08.685 --> 17:10.517
I got another delivery today.

17:10.725 --> 17:12.159
Like the other?

17:12.365 --> 17:14.277
Same section of the brain.

17:14.485 --> 17:17.717
If it is one of my patients
who's doing this, I...

17:18.045 --> 17:20.276
I have to wonder
if I could have prevented it.

17:22.085 --> 17:24.680
You never felt guilty
about what I was doing?

17:25.445 --> 17:26.879
No.

17:27.565 --> 17:29.841
All I ever felt was pride.

17:31.445 --> 17:32.959
Pride?
Mm.

17:33.925 --> 17:35.962
You're not evil, Dexter.

17:36.485 --> 17:39.319
You're actually making
the world a better place.

17:41.125 --> 17:42.639
Not for everyone.

17:43.325 --> 17:45.123
What do you mean by that?

17:50.485 --> 17:52.124
I'm going back to the lab.

17:52.325 --> 17:56.717
We might have a print,
which gives us a head start.

17:57.205 --> 17:58.525
So you're going to help me.

17:58.765 --> 18:00.961
You don't seem surprised.

18:01.125 --> 18:03.560
Like I said,
even though I've just met you,

18:03.765 --> 18:05.722
I know you, Dexter.

18:06.525 --> 18:08.676
Better even than I knew Harry.

18:09.645 --> 18:11.637
Why did he come to you

18:11.845 --> 18:13.723
about me?

18:13.925 --> 18:17.077
I was an expert witness
on a series of homicides

18:17.325 --> 18:19.476
that he was working on,

18:20.525 --> 18:22.005
and we became friends.

18:23.525 --> 18:25.244
It's a long way from being friends

18:25.445 --> 18:27.721
to "I think my son
might be a serial killer."

18:30.765 --> 18:33.280
Harry was aware of my work
on young psychopaths.

18:33.485 --> 18:36.922
And he also knew
that I didn't approach the subject

18:37.125 --> 18:40.004
in terms of black and white,

18:40.645 --> 18:43.160
unlike my colleagues at the time.

18:43.365 --> 18:45.960
And so he just told you everything.

18:46.965 --> 18:50.276
You have to understand
that he had no one else to talk to.

18:52.365 --> 18:55.358
Not Doris.
Certainly no one in the force.

18:55.565 --> 19:01.482
And there never was
any judgement on my part.

19:02.405 --> 19:04.681
Unlike you towards me.

19:05.285 --> 19:07.163
I'm not judging you.

19:07.365 --> 19:09.163
But you don't trust me.

19:11.805 --> 19:13.842
Which you should have expected.

19:14.045 --> 19:16.162
Since you know me so well.

19:27.525 --> 19:29.118
You nervous?

19:29.685 --> 19:31.995
About breaking and entering?
Absolutely.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.242
Prison would put a real crimp
in my business model.

19:36.005 --> 19:37.962
See, we're not breaking.

19:38.165 --> 19:39.918
We're just entering.

20:09.085 --> 20:11.077
You really had sex with this guy?

20:17.085 --> 20:18.644
Shit.

20:19.685 --> 20:21.483
What? What is it?

20:22.325 --> 20:23.725
If...

20:24.205 --> 20:26.436
If I hadn't stayed
to try to get the jewellery,

20:26.645 --> 20:29.558
if I just brought him in,
he'd still be alive.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.484
Don't beat yourself up about it.

20:32.685 --> 20:35.757
After all, it's a criminal
we're talking about, right?

20:36.165 --> 20:38.202
He was actually all right
to hang out with.

20:38.405 --> 20:41.716
He made me forget about
my shitty life for five minutes.

20:43.445 --> 20:45.516
And what exactly is so shitty
about your life?

20:45.765 --> 20:48.075
Other than working for you?
Excuse me.

20:48.285 --> 20:50.800
You left Miami Metro
to come and work for me.

20:51.005 --> 20:54.282
Wise career choice, I might add.

20:54.525 --> 20:57.404
If you accepted more cases,
you may get paid what you're worth.

20:57.605 --> 20:59.597
I left Miami Metro
because I was burned out.

20:59.765 --> 21:03.554
Oh. Right.
Look, I know that's a party line.

21:03.765 --> 21:06.155
Everybody knows Maria LaGuerta
was a pain in the ass.

21:06.325 --> 21:08.078
I understand if you wanted
to dip your toesâ€”

21:08.285 --> 21:10.595
What the fuck
are you even talking about?

21:12.285 --> 21:15.915
LaGuerta was a good cop.
She was a good fucking person.

21:16.765 --> 21:19.724
Well, note to self: Never talk about
anyone Debra Morgan knows.

21:19.965 --> 21:21.115
Understood. Got it.

21:23.005 --> 21:25.998
Why don't you just be really grateful
that I work for you?

21:26.205 --> 21:28.800
Because I'm about to make you
a fuck-ton of money.

21:29.885 --> 21:32.354
It's an unopened bill
from a storage facility.

21:32.605 --> 21:36.519
Why didn't F.L.P.D. find this?
Because it just arrived today.

21:36.725 --> 21:38.557
Found a match for our key.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.040
Okay. Buster's Self Storage.

21:40.245 --> 21:42.077
All right.
Let's go.

21:42.325 --> 21:44.715
I can't. I've got a new client
meeting at the office.

21:44.925 --> 21:47.235
All right, then I'll go alone.
Sh...

21:48.725 --> 21:51.559
Okay. Could you hang on?
Justâ€” Hey.

21:55.045 --> 21:56.479
Hey.

21:58.605 --> 22:00.198
Hey.

22:00.765 --> 22:02.916
Just do me a favour, all right?

22:03.125 --> 22:04.798
Just be careful.

22:06.365 --> 22:09.676
If I fuck up, you can always ply me
with that electro-shite solution.

22:25.445 --> 22:28.722
I'm running the prints from the plastic
bag through AFIS right now.

22:28.925 --> 22:29.961
Any hits?

22:30.205 --> 22:32.674
Not yet, but if the killer's
on the list you gave me,

22:32.885 --> 22:36.401
there's a good chance he's already
in the system. It shouldn't take long.

22:39.165 --> 22:41.157
Why don't I remember you?

22:41.525 --> 22:46.122
According to you, I was 10
when you started seeing Harry.

22:46.325 --> 22:48.123
I should remember you.

22:48.325 --> 22:51.045
You never met me in person.

22:51.525 --> 22:53.756
Harry forbid it.
Why?

22:53.965 --> 22:56.719
He didn't want you to feel
like you wereâ€”

22:56.925 --> 22:59.360
Like you were sick.
He was trying to protect you.

22:59.605 --> 23:03.679
And I respected his wishes,
even after he died.

23:04.325 --> 23:06.965
I could have used someone
to talk to after Harry was gone.

23:07.165 --> 23:09.077
Someone who knew
what I was going through.

23:09.325 --> 23:11.521
You wanted to talk about it?

23:13.445 --> 23:15.755
I was young and I was all alone.

23:18.325 --> 23:19.964
Here it is.

23:21.085 --> 23:24.078
Lyle Sussman?
Sussman?

23:24.285 --> 23:28.245
He wasn't on the list I gave you.
I don't know anyone with that name.

23:28.445 --> 23:30.198
That doesn't mean
he doesn't know you.

23:30.405 --> 23:32.362
You're a published author.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.638
But why would he be targeting me?

23:34.845 --> 23:38.680
Maybe he has an issue with something
you said in one of your books.

23:39.925 --> 23:43.043
Arrested for drunk and disorderly
in 1992.

23:43.245 --> 23:47.205
Single. Has a house on Messina.

23:47.485 --> 23:48.999
Doesn't make sense.

23:49.245 --> 23:51.680
Well, Sussman's print's
on the murder weapon.

23:51.885 --> 23:54.275
Forensics don't lie.

23:55.285 --> 23:56.878
Mm. Look on the bright side.

23:57.125 --> 24:00.801
Maybe this means you did a better job
with your patients than you thought.

24:03.165 --> 24:04.485
Oh. Heh.

24:04.645 --> 24:07.479
Two great minds
at work here. Heh, heh.

24:07.685 --> 24:09.199
Am I interrupting?

24:09.405 --> 24:10.555
No. What's up, Vince?

24:10.765 --> 24:13.280
Well, guess who found
a bloody fingerprint

24:13.485 --> 24:16.125
on the duct tape that was
covering the victim's mouth.

24:17.245 --> 24:18.395
You?

24:18.645 --> 24:20.557
And guess who
it might belong to.

24:20.765 --> 24:23.075
The victim?
Our killer.

24:23.285 --> 24:25.641
It's a partial,
so it could take some time.

24:25.845 --> 24:28.565
How about you?
Anything on the murder weapon?

24:28.765 --> 24:29.881
Partial.

24:30.725 --> 24:33.365
Well, okay. I guess the race is on.

24:37.285 --> 24:38.958
Shit.

24:44.285 --> 24:46.242
Why was it strange

24:46.445 --> 24:49.085
that I needed someone
to talk to when Harry died?

24:49.685 --> 24:53.679
People like you don't usually seek
an emotional connection.

24:55.045 --> 24:56.638
Good luck.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.438
<i>It all looks innocent.</i>

25:15.645 --> 25:17.876
<i>Just like my apartment.</i>

25:22.645 --> 25:24.079
<i>Nah.</i>

25:42.245 --> 25:46.637
<i>Either Sussman lost his green thumb
or he hasn't been here in a while.</i>

25:47.285 --> 25:50.198
<i>Could he be hiding out
at his next kill site?</i>

25:56.805 --> 25:58.159
<i>A hunting cabin?</i>

25:58.365 --> 26:01.836
<i>Isolated. The perfect place for a kill.</i>

26:02.565 --> 26:06.002
<i>Lake Nona. It's a large lake,
but at least it's a starting place.</i>

26:40.005 --> 26:41.724
Well, fuck.

27:17.365 --> 27:19.084
You found my jewellery.

27:19.525 --> 27:21.403
Really made my life easier.

27:21.925 --> 27:23.359
Thank you for that.

27:29.205 --> 27:30.639
What the hell's
your problem?

27:35.085 --> 27:36.565
Bitch. Fucking nuts.

27:36.805 --> 27:39.161
Yeah, I'm fucking nuts.

27:42.805 --> 27:45.240
Stay down.

28:01.565 --> 28:04.364
You're lucky I don't kill people
unless I'm paid to.

28:44.045 --> 28:46.640
Ah. Ow!

28:51.205 --> 28:54.482
I hope Sussman does a better job
keeping in touch with his mother

28:54.685 --> 28:55.801
than I do with mine.

28:56.045 --> 28:59.834
Any reason why you haven't
taken the sergeant's exam?

29:00.365 --> 29:03.437
Uhâ€” Just haven't
gotten around to it. Why?

29:03.685 --> 29:06.245
Matthews is riding my ass,
keeps pushing people on me.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.199
Sanchez, Whitney.
I'd rather have you.

29:10.205 --> 29:11.400
I didn't know you cared.

29:13.685 --> 29:16.280
You better start taking
your career more seriously, bro.

29:16.525 --> 29:19.085
Especially if you're gonna be
dating my sister.

29:20.925 --> 29:24.123
How'd you know?
Because I'm a good detective.

29:24.645 --> 29:26.204
Why'd you try to hide it from me?

29:26.725 --> 29:30.639
Uh... I thought
your head would explode.

29:31.405 --> 29:33.556
Just get your act together.

29:34.405 --> 29:37.637
If you want me to be okay
with you and Jamie, earn it.

29:37.885 --> 29:40.878
Man up. Take the test.

29:45.885 --> 29:48.605
Do you have any idea where your
son might be, Mrs. Sussman?

29:48.805 --> 29:51.081
It's very important
that we speak with him.

29:51.565 --> 29:53.875
I haven't seen him for days.

29:54.085 --> 29:55.519
Is that normal?

29:55.725 --> 29:57.523
Well, it's not out of the ordinary.

29:58.005 --> 30:00.679
He's probably off hunting
for the weekend.

30:01.005 --> 30:02.758
So he likes to hunt?

30:02.965 --> 30:04.718
Oh, he practically lives for it.

30:05.725 --> 30:11.198
He always brings back
something for the quilt.

30:12.165 --> 30:13.679
Isn't this something?

30:14.245 --> 30:16.157
It sure is.

30:21.405 --> 30:23.601
Where does he go
on these hunting trips?

30:23.845 --> 30:27.361
He has a cabin somewhere
outside the city.

30:27.605 --> 30:28.834
Do you know the address?

30:29.245 --> 30:31.965
No. Sorry. That's all I know.

30:32.165 --> 30:33.884
What did you say this was about?

30:34.085 --> 30:37.123
We just want to ask him a few
questions. That's all, Mrs. Sussman.

30:37.325 --> 30:40.284
I wish I could help you,
but I don't know what else to tell you.

30:40.525 --> 30:43.916
Oh, you need some more. Ha, ha.
Oh.

30:44.125 --> 30:45.684
Excuse me.

30:50.605 --> 30:53.245
Can we go? That fucking quilt
is freaking me out.

30:53.445 --> 30:55.914
It's like a nightmare in fur.

31:00.685 --> 31:02.438
It's Dispatch.

31:03.405 --> 31:04.441
Damn.

31:05.325 --> 31:07.601
<i>Lake Nona will have to wait.</i>

31:07.845 --> 31:10.121
<i>Hopefully not for long.</i>

31:18.685 --> 31:20.199
What's the word, Vince?

31:20.445 --> 31:23.802
Borborygmus. The sound of gas
rumbling through your intestines.

31:24.005 --> 31:28.045
As in, seriously regretting having that
super-green passion fruit smoothie

31:28.245 --> 31:30.476
right about now. Unh.

31:30.925 --> 31:32.279
Gunshot to the head.

31:32.485 --> 31:34.283
I call and raise you
one to the chest.

31:34.485 --> 31:36.920
One in the dash
and one in the headrest.

31:37.165 --> 31:38.645
Either the killer was panicky,

31:38.845 --> 31:41.121
or he really needs some time
at the gun range.

31:41.325 --> 31:42.998
Car's registered
to a Javier Guzman.

31:43.205 --> 31:44.241
You think that's him?

31:44.445 --> 31:46.721
Based on Guzman's rap sheet,
be my guess.

31:46.965 --> 31:49.434
Small-time enforcing, murder.

31:50.045 --> 31:53.197
Went by the street name
of El Sapo.

31:57.645 --> 32:00.479
<i>El Sapo was the hit man
sent to kill Briggs.</i>

32:01.645 --> 32:03.523
<i>If he's been killed...</i>

32:05.565 --> 32:07.716
<i>is Deb in danger?</i>

32:11.525 --> 32:13.357
Dexter Morgan.

32:13.565 --> 32:16.478
Dexter Morgan.
Want to get with the programme?

32:16.685 --> 32:18.165
Dex?

32:18.365 --> 32:20.675
How do you think this went down,
Morgan?

32:21.525 --> 32:23.881
Uhâ€” Yeah, sorry.

32:24.925 --> 32:27.963
Driver pulls to a stop,
the assailant approaches the car,

32:28.165 --> 32:30.600
most likely gun already drawn.

32:30.845 --> 32:34.043
The vic sees the shooter,
pulls his weapon,

32:34.245 --> 32:36.999
clears the holster,
but it's too late.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.275
The gunman opens fire.

32:39.885 --> 32:41.524
I got a second gun in the glove.

32:41.725 --> 32:43.637
Bag it and tag it.

32:47.765 --> 32:50.405
<i>El Sapo's blood is confined
to the inside of his car.</i>

32:50.605 --> 32:52.198
<i>This can't be his.</i>

32:52.405 --> 32:55.523
<i>The killer might have been reaching
into the car and cut himself.</i>

32:55.725 --> 32:57.318
Dex.

33:01.445 --> 33:04.199
El Sapo. Deb was involved
with these guys.

33:04.405 --> 33:08.604
If someone's taking them outâ€”
I know. I'm on it.

33:08.845 --> 33:12.236
I don't understand, Dexter. You think
you know where Sussman's cabin is

33:12.445 --> 33:15.199
<i>but you're not going after him.</i>
I have to do something.

33:15.405 --> 33:18.204
What's more important
than stopping this killer?

33:18.405 --> 33:20.203
<i>My sister.</i>

33:20.605 --> 33:22.836
Debra's in trouble?
<i>Yes.</i>

33:23.085 --> 33:25.645
Ah. That's what's
been eating at you.

33:25.845 --> 33:29.236
I'm coming up on her house.
I have to hang up.

33:52.165 --> 33:53.838
Jesus, Deb.

34:12.805 --> 34:15.115
What the fuck are you doing here?

34:18.085 --> 34:20.122
Deb.
I don't want you around.

34:20.325 --> 34:23.443
I thought I made that
really fucking clear.

34:24.605 --> 34:26.676
El Sapo is dead.

34:30.005 --> 34:31.075
El Sapo?

34:31.285 --> 34:33.117
The man who was sent
to take out Briggs.

34:33.325 --> 34:35.282
I know who the fuck that is.

34:36.565 --> 34:39.922
Well, someone shot him in his car.
It looked like an execution.

34:40.125 --> 34:42.082
Do you know anything
about this?

34:44.205 --> 34:47.721
All I know is what my head
feels like right now.

34:50.885 --> 34:53.878
I tried calling.
I was worried about you.

34:54.085 --> 34:55.917
That's touching.

34:57.565 --> 34:59.397
I'm fine.

34:59.605 --> 35:02.643
Fine isn't the first word
that comes to mind.

35:03.525 --> 35:05.881
And anybody could have
walked in here.

35:06.405 --> 35:10.319
The door wouldn't close
so I had to get creative.

35:12.885 --> 35:14.365
What happened?

35:17.845 --> 35:19.962
Deb, what happened
to your side?

35:22.645 --> 35:26.321
El Sapo followed me
to the storage unit,

35:27.285 --> 35:30.357
where Briggs kept his stash,
you know.

35:32.285 --> 35:35.084
We tussled, he got the stuff,
end of story.

35:35.325 --> 35:38.443
Except it's not the end of the story.
El Sapo's dead.

35:38.645 --> 35:41.717
It's a better fucking ending.
He deserved it.

35:41.925 --> 35:44.360
And if whoever killed El Sapo
comes after you?

35:44.565 --> 35:46.682
Nobody's coming after me, Dexter.

35:46.885 --> 35:48.080
How do you know that?

35:51.645 --> 35:53.921
Will you not do this, please?

35:55.365 --> 35:56.845
What?

35:58.845 --> 36:00.564
Give a shit.

36:05.405 --> 36:07.840
Deb, I'm your brother.
You can hate me if you want,

36:08.045 --> 36:10.765
but it doesn't change the fact
that I care about you.

36:18.605 --> 36:20.915
I didn't want to hate you.

36:24.805 --> 36:27.195
I wanted the opposite.

36:32.725 --> 36:34.398
But it didn't work out that way.

36:37.445 --> 36:40.882
I can't change the way I feel, so...

36:41.085 --> 36:43.077
Will you go, please?

36:43.285 --> 36:45.083
I'm not leaving you.

36:47.405 --> 36:50.682
Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter,
get the fuck out.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.804
Go.

37:08.725 --> 37:13.481
<i>Deb doesn't want my help,
and Vogel is demanding it.</i>

37:18.925 --> 37:22.043
<i>This is it. Sussman's cabin.</i>

37:25.565 --> 37:28.603
<i>At least I'm staying ahead
of Miami Metro.</i>

37:51.685 --> 37:54.200
<i>Sussman's no stranger
to blood and death.</i>

37:54.405 --> 37:57.318
<i>Vogel is wrong.
Everything points to him as the killer.</i>

38:29.925 --> 38:31.678
<i>Except this.</i>

38:31.885 --> 38:34.639
Maybe Sussman had an accomplice
who decided to take him out.

38:34.845 --> 38:37.644
A killer like Sussman
doesn't use an accomplice.

38:37.845 --> 38:39.882
They're rogues.
He could be the exception.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.475
Yeah, or just the innocent victim
like the first two.

38:42.685 --> 38:45.644
Sussman's prints were on the weapon.
He must have been involved.

38:45.885 --> 38:47.205
Sit down, Dexter.

38:47.805 --> 38:49.478
You're getting agitated.

38:49.925 --> 38:52.440
I'm just trying to figure this out.

38:53.285 --> 38:56.483
You have a hard time admitting
that you're wrong, but it's all right.

38:56.685 --> 39:00.281
People like you have
an inherent need to be right,

39:00.525 --> 39:02.801
to feel superior.

39:03.005 --> 39:06.999
You keep talking about me like
I'm some kind of alternate species.

39:08.485 --> 39:10.283
Like I'm less than human.

39:10.485 --> 39:12.238
On the contrary.

39:13.405 --> 39:15.397
Have you read any of my books?

39:15.845 --> 39:17.677
I haven't gotten around to it.

39:17.885 --> 39:20.081
Well, if you had,
you'd know that I believe

39:20.285 --> 39:24.882
that psychopaths are not
a mistake of nature.

39:25.085 --> 39:26.644
They're a gift.

39:27.165 --> 39:28.804
A gift?

39:29.005 --> 39:30.883
They're alpha wolves

39:31.085 --> 39:36.035
who helped the human race survive
long enough to become civilised.

39:36.685 --> 39:40.076
An indispensable demographic.

39:51.725 --> 39:53.318
You believe that?

39:53.885 --> 39:56.525
Did you know that
psychopathic traits

39:56.725 --> 39:59.479
can be found
in the most successful CEOs?

39:59.685 --> 40:02.359
In the most effective politicians?

40:02.805 --> 40:08.085
Without psychopaths,
mankind wouldn't exist today.

40:10.125 --> 40:13.436
Well, there's a lot of mankind
that doesn't exist because of them.

40:14.965 --> 40:17.196
Every silver lining...

40:25.965 --> 40:31.120
Well, one of your indispensable
demographics is still out there, killing.

40:31.925 --> 40:33.996
And we're back to zero.

40:34.245 --> 40:36.396
You'll find him, Dexter.

40:37.565 --> 40:39.682
I have faith in you.

40:44.365 --> 40:48.518
So, um,
what's going on with Debra?

40:50.085 --> 40:51.963
That's between me and her.

40:52.165 --> 40:53.884
It's affecting you.

40:54.085 --> 40:57.237
So it makes it a problem for me too.

40:58.125 --> 41:01.243
We're not going to talk about Deb.

41:02.565 --> 41:04.443
Whatever you want.

41:18.685 --> 41:21.644
Should I come back later?
Sorry.

41:21.845 --> 41:25.634
I was just checking
to see if Dexter called.

41:25.885 --> 41:28.525
He was looking in on Deb.

41:28.845 --> 41:30.199
Deb?

41:30.405 --> 41:31.441
Yeah.

41:31.645 --> 41:34.479
Wow, we're a whole 10 seconds
into the date.

41:34.725 --> 41:36.876
I thought we were gonna
make it to one minute

41:37.085 --> 41:39.395
before you mentioned
your old fiancÃ©e.

41:39.645 --> 41:41.398
What are you talking about?

41:41.645 --> 41:45.355
Joey, you're always checking in on her
or talking about her.

41:45.605 --> 41:47.961
Since we've been together,
you're on Deb patrol.

41:48.165 --> 41:49.997
No, I'm not.

41:50.205 --> 41:54.040
Okay. We'll do an experiment.
Let's see if you can go one whole day

41:54.285 --> 41:56.004
without mentioning Debra Morgan.

41:56.605 --> 41:59.404
What is it with you people? I meanâ€”

41:59.605 --> 42:00.721
What people?

42:00.925 --> 42:03.759
I got your brother on my ass
about taking the sergeant's test.

42:04.005 --> 42:05.405
You're on my ass about Deb.

42:05.605 --> 42:07.517
Like, what is this,
a fucking Cuban thing?

42:07.725 --> 42:10.638
What does Angel have to do with this?
He knows we're seeing each other.

42:10.885 --> 42:13.480
He's on my ass about
making something out of my life.

42:13.645 --> 42:17.321
"Man up. Take the sergeant's test."
You know what? Maybe I don't want to.

42:17.525 --> 42:20.040
Wait, how does Angel know
that we're seeing each other?

42:20.245 --> 42:22.202
And what's wrong about
trying to better yourself?

42:22.405 --> 42:24.761
See? That's what I'm talking about.

42:25.725 --> 42:28.194
You know what? Screw this, okay?

42:28.445 --> 42:31.563
I did not get dressed up
to argue with you.

42:31.765 --> 42:33.358
Go drink by yourself.

42:34.565 --> 42:35.919
Jaâ€”

42:44.325 --> 42:47.079
Why the hell can't you stay
out of my personal life?

42:47.285 --> 42:49.925
What'd I do?
Angel, you know exactly what you did.

42:50.125 --> 42:52.162
Okay, you're putting pressure
on Quinn.

42:52.365 --> 42:54.357
We just had a giant argument
because of you.

42:54.565 --> 42:56.955
Wait a second.
You know what, I hope you're happy.

43:00.325 --> 43:03.397
It's like, mind your own
fucking business, Angel.

43:08.125 --> 43:12.005
<i>If this finds El Sapo's killer,
it'll keep Deb safe.</i>

43:30.245 --> 43:32.282
<i>It's Deb's blood.</i>

43:35.805 --> 43:38.240
<i>She killed El Sapo.</i>

43:39.605 --> 43:41.881
<i>Shot him in his car.</i>

43:43.605 --> 43:45.164
Deb.

43:46.925 --> 43:48.564
Deb.

43:50.165 --> 43:51.838
<i>What is she doing here?</i>

43:53.405 --> 43:54.964
Morgan.

43:56.805 --> 43:57.921
Sir.

43:58.085 --> 44:00.759
I never got a chance to tell you
how disappointed I was

44:00.965 --> 44:02.240
that you left the force.

44:02.445 --> 44:05.199
From running Homicide
to chasing down bail jumpers.

44:05.405 --> 44:07.636
It's a hell of a career trajectory.

44:08.845 --> 44:10.757
It's not what you think.

44:11.005 --> 44:13.236
Well, I hope it was worth it.

44:18.085 --> 44:19.314
Debra Morgan?

44:19.525 --> 44:21.915
As I live and breathe.

44:24.805 --> 44:27.957
If I were to cop a feel now, it wouldn't
be sexual harassment anymore.

44:29.645 --> 44:31.204
Hey, stranger.
Hey.

44:31.445 --> 44:33.084
What brings you around?

44:33.245 --> 44:37.364
Um, Quinn had some questions
about a case, so...

44:37.805 --> 44:39.683
<i>Is this about El Sapo?</i>

44:39.885 --> 44:42.195
Well, he's probably
grabbing some coffee.

44:46.965 --> 44:49.560
Every morning when I come in,
I walk past it.

44:49.765 --> 44:54.282
I have to turn around, because
I still think of it as Deb's office.

44:54.485 --> 44:57.398
No, you probably should have
gotten it first, you know.

44:57.605 --> 44:59.961
I never really belonged there.

45:00.645 --> 45:02.364
You know that's BS.

45:02.565 --> 45:04.841
This place ain't the same without you.

45:06.085 --> 45:09.283
We're having some drinks
at Papa's tonight.

45:09.525 --> 45:10.561
You should come.

45:10.765 --> 45:12.961
Yeah, I'll try to make it.

45:14.845 --> 45:16.279
Hey.

45:16.645 --> 45:18.159
Thanks for coming in.

45:18.405 --> 45:19.805
Come on.

45:29.725 --> 45:33.116
I would have used
the briefing room, but it's taken.

45:33.325 --> 45:34.964
I mean, this is fine though, right?

45:35.165 --> 45:37.600
Otherwise fucking everybody'd
still be hugging you.

45:37.765 --> 45:39.119
Um...

45:39.285 --> 45:42.403
Do you wanna go to the coffee truck?
No, let's justâ€” Let's do this.

45:42.605 --> 45:44.164
Okay.

45:50.165 --> 45:52.157
El Sapo and Briggs.

45:52.885 --> 45:54.444
What do you want to know?

45:56.205 --> 45:58.436
Basically, we've hit a wall.

45:58.645 --> 46:01.114
I was hoping you could open up
some leads for us.

46:01.365 --> 46:02.515
What can you tell me?

46:03.605 --> 46:05.198
Um...

46:05.365 --> 46:08.756
I was doing a skip-trace on Briggs.
He robbed a jewellery store

46:08.965 --> 46:11.958
and made off with like
a half-million dollars in merchandise.

46:12.205 --> 46:14.242
I got a tip that he was
in Fort Lauderdale,

46:14.445 --> 46:17.279
and I was staking him out
and overheard

46:17.485 --> 46:19.636
that he was gonna fence
the stuff to El Sapo.

46:19.885 --> 46:21.444
Isn't a skip-trace one of those

46:21.645 --> 46:24.080
locate-and-bring-them-back
type of things?

46:25.365 --> 46:28.199
Yeah, I was also trying
to get a fix on the goods.

46:30.485 --> 46:32.795
What happened the night
Briggs was killed?

46:33.045 --> 46:34.525
Um...

46:36.645 --> 46:39.638
He was supposed to meet El Sapo
that same night.

46:40.645 --> 46:42.602
I thought they were gonna
be a few hours

46:42.805 --> 46:46.321
so I went to get a sandwich,
and when I came back,

46:46.845 --> 46:49.838
F.L.P.D. was on the scene,
and, uh,

46:51.205 --> 46:54.164
Briggs had a fucking hole
in his chest.

46:54.365 --> 46:56.755
<i>Is she lying to protect me
or to protect herself?</i>

46:57.005 --> 46:58.564
<i>I can't tell anymore.</i>

46:59.165 --> 47:02.124
I was just wondering if you could
take a look at what we've got.

47:02.325 --> 47:04.157
Maybe we could
put our heads together,

47:04.365 --> 47:07.437
push this thing down the field,
you know? Like old times.

47:08.925 --> 47:11.156
Heh. Um...

47:11.365 --> 47:14.403
So, what we think is

47:14.645 --> 47:18.559
the shooter approached
the vehicle from behind,

47:21.085 --> 47:25.045
and then El Sapo drew his gun.

47:28.445 --> 47:30.198
And then the shooter...

47:37.605 --> 47:38.721
Hey, are you all right?

47:39.925 --> 47:43.236
Sorry. Family emergency.
I gotta borrow my sister.

47:43.445 --> 47:44.799
Sure.

47:51.405 --> 47:52.839
Thanks.

48:04.565 --> 48:06.522
What, Dexter?

48:07.365 --> 48:09.800
I know you killed El Sapo.

48:11.965 --> 48:14.605
I found your blood
at the crime scene.

48:20.645 --> 48:22.364
Fuck.

48:22.565 --> 48:24.363
Tell me what happened.

48:29.525 --> 48:30.561
Talk to me, Deb.

48:30.805 --> 48:34.719
I don't know what happened, all right?
I'm a little fucking fuzzy on it.

48:37.765 --> 48:41.122
I was angry.
I wanted the jewels back.

48:42.485 --> 48:46.115
And the next thing I know,
I'm standing over a dead body.

48:46.365 --> 48:49.597
You shot at him four times.
You don't remember any of it?

48:49.805 --> 48:53.401
He'd just beaten the shit out of me.
I was a little fucked up.

48:55.005 --> 48:57.361
Why didn't you call the police?

49:00.845 --> 49:02.564
I didn't know what I could tell them.

49:03.565 --> 49:05.557
You could have called me.

49:06.365 --> 49:09.517
You get me into trouble, not out of it.
Is that why you lied to me?

49:09.765 --> 49:12.405
All of a sudden we have
a problem with lying?

49:21.085 --> 49:25.204
We found a gun in El Sapo's
glove box. Is it yours?

49:29.485 --> 49:31.636
Shit, it might be, yeah.

49:33.005 --> 49:36.362
He took it off of me
before he beat me up.

49:37.885 --> 49:41.322
It'll be traced to you.
How will you explain that?

49:44.325 --> 49:46.317
You could switch it out.

49:46.965 --> 49:48.763
Get rid of it.

49:53.725 --> 49:56.240
What if I weren't here
to cover your ass?

49:59.845 --> 50:02.235
You really want to play
the "what if" game?

50:04.045 --> 50:06.514
What if you weren't a serial killer?

50:08.285 --> 50:10.800
What if Harry had left you
in that shipping container?

50:11.005 --> 50:14.077
That's enough.
El Sapo's not the first person I shot.

50:14.325 --> 50:16.282
And he may not be the fucking last.

50:16.485 --> 50:18.283
What's that supposed to mean?

50:18.485 --> 50:22.035
Anything can happen in this hellhole
that is now my life.

50:22.245 --> 50:24.555
Your gift to me, Dexter.

50:24.765 --> 50:28.042
<i>She's right. Whoever Deb was
before killing LaGuerta,</i>

50:28.245 --> 50:30.396
<i>that person is dead.</i>

50:31.005 --> 50:33.964
<i>I just wish I knew
what's taken her place.</i>

50:39.085 --> 50:40.644
Busy day?

50:40.845 --> 50:41.915
Crazy busy.

50:42.125 --> 50:44.321
<i>Then maybe they haven't
tested Deb's gun yet.</i>

50:59.605 --> 51:03.599
<i>I've covered evidence for myself
more times than I can remember.</i>

51:05.565 --> 51:07.955
<i>But I'll never get used to
doing this for Deb.</i>

51:32.605 --> 51:35.677
You and Jamie patch things up?
How did you know we were fighting?

51:35.885 --> 51:38.002
Because I'm a goodâ€”
Detective, right.

51:39.525 --> 51:42.882
Yeah. Uh, the sergeant's test?

51:43.125 --> 51:45.959
Yeah?
I'm gonna start studying for it.

51:47.325 --> 51:49.760
Damn. Eh,

51:49.965 --> 51:51.763
you gonna make an okay sergeant.

51:52.005 --> 51:54.281
If not, I'll demote your ass.

52:35.845 --> 52:39.236
<i>Dr. Vogel says that psychopaths
are not a mistake of nature.</i>

52:39.445 --> 52:41.323
<i>They're a gift.</i>

52:42.365 --> 52:46.154
<i>But what kind of gift
destroys everything it cares about?</i>

52:53.285 --> 52:54.321
Hello?

52:54.565 --> 52:57.319
Dexter, I think there's someone
inside my house.

52:57.525 --> 52:58.925
<i>How do you know?</i>

52:59.445 --> 53:02.005
Well, I just walked up,
and the front door is open.

53:02.245 --> 53:04.680
Get in your car and stay there.

53:24.005 --> 53:27.203
If someone was inside
when I called, he's still in there.

53:27.405 --> 53:29.237
I haven't seen anyone leave.

53:30.965 --> 53:32.285
Wait here.

53:32.525 --> 53:33.959
Thank you, Dexter.

53:45.405 --> 53:47.601
Are you sure
there's no one inside?

53:48.005 --> 53:50.076
I checked the entire house.
I'm sure.

53:52.045 --> 53:53.638
That DVD, it's not mine.

53:56.965 --> 53:58.001
Put it in.

54:22.765 --> 54:24.324
He was coerced.

54:26.645 --> 54:28.523
And now he's dead.

54:35.085 --> 54:36.804
I was wrong all along.

54:37.285 --> 54:39.004
You were right.

54:40.325 --> 54:44.285
Sussman was never a real killer.
He's just another victim.

54:46.405 --> 54:48.237
I should have listened to you.

54:48.445 --> 54:51.517
You were only doing
what you thought was right.

54:51.765 --> 54:53.279
We had no idea thatâ€”

54:53.525 --> 54:56.279
You should have no idea.
You've never done this before.

54:56.525 --> 54:58.198
Me, it's what I do.

55:01.085 --> 55:03.600
The one thing
I've always been good at.

55:05.445 --> 55:08.483
Vetting, stalking, and killing people.

55:12.165 --> 55:14.634
I can't even do that anymore.

55:20.285 --> 55:25.440
What you're feeling now,
it's not because of the killer.

55:29.445 --> 55:31.118
I've...

55:33.085 --> 55:35.919
destroyed Deb.

55:38.325 --> 55:40.078
She's gone.

55:45.165 --> 55:47.475
You were wrong about me.

55:49.205 --> 55:50.605
I'm a mistake.

55:52.045 --> 55:56.198
You're exactly what you
need to be, Dexter.

56:05.925 --> 56:08.042
You're perfect.
