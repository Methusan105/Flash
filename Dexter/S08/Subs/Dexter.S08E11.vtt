00:10.525 --> 00:11.754
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:11.925 --> 00:14.315
Harrison and I are
leaving Miami with Hannah.

00:14.485 --> 00:16.317
You act like this
doesn't even affect me.

00:16.525 --> 00:17.561
You can visit.

00:17.725 --> 00:20.081
I'll look you up
the next time I'm in Argentina.

00:20.245 --> 00:23.079
So you any closer
in your search for Saxon?

00:23.285 --> 00:25.595
I wish we could just leave.

00:25.765 --> 00:27.165
I still have feelings for you.

00:27.325 --> 00:28.964
I used to feel like something
was holding me back.

00:29.125 --> 00:30.639
- Now?
- Now, I—

00:32.325 --> 00:34.760
I want you to help me
like you helped Dexter.

00:34.925 --> 00:37.485
- I'll find a way.
- What about Dexter? He's still after me.

00:37.685 --> 00:38.721
I'll talk to Dexter.

00:38.885 --> 00:40.365
You don't think he likes killing.

00:40.565 --> 00:42.955
Let me show you how much
he doesn't like killing.

00:43.125 --> 00:44.798
<i>No!</i>

00:44.965 --> 00:47.082
That's Zach's head
he's sawing into.

00:47.245 --> 00:49.362
I'd like to be a part of the team
on this one.

00:49.525 --> 00:52.404
Thanks, but the Marshal Service
doesn't take on partners.

00:52.565 --> 00:54.284
Looking for a new forensic tech?

00:54.445 --> 00:56.880
- Dexter's moving on.
- Really?

00:57.045 --> 00:59.514
It just struck me as odd
that he's leaving town...

00:59.685 --> 01:02.325
at the same time
Hannah McKay is rumoured to be here.

01:02.485 --> 01:05.239
If Dexter were dating Hannah McKay,
I would know about it.

01:05.405 --> 01:07.681
Deputy Marshal Clayton
thinks Dexter's hiding you.

01:07.885 --> 01:09.319
Oh, God.

01:09.485 --> 01:11.397
- What happened?
- He fell and hit his chin.

01:11.565 --> 01:13.636
It's a deep cut.
It won't stop bleeding.

01:16.805 --> 01:19.877
Hello, Dexter.
Mother chose the wrong son.

01:24.725 --> 01:26.603
Evelyn?

03:32.845 --> 03:36.634
<i>Vogel warned me
I've been straddling two worlds...</i>

03:37.805 --> 03:40.081
<i>and I ignored her.</i>

03:40.285 --> 03:43.483
<i>For that, she paid the price
with her life.</i>

03:45.325 --> 03:49.035
<i>Now I have to remove myself
from her life.</i>

04:12.765 --> 04:16.839
<i>I never imagined the last homicide
I'd work would be one I'm now a part of.</i>

04:18.365 --> 04:20.755
<i>I have to call this in.</i>

04:21.845 --> 04:24.883
<i>I can't be seen
leaving the scene of the crime.</i>

04:36.165 --> 04:38.555
<i>The last time I was in a pool
of my mother's blood...</i>

04:38.725 --> 04:41.081
<i>I was too young
to do anything about it.</i>

04:41.245 --> 04:43.123
<i>But I'm no longer a child.</i>

04:47.045 --> 04:50.925
She didn't say
why she wanted me to stop by.

04:51.085 --> 04:54.317
The two of you were friends?
Your father knew her, right?

04:54.525 --> 04:57.199
Yeah, she reached out
to both Deb and me.

04:57.405 --> 04:59.044
She was a good person.

04:59.205 --> 05:00.958
So you pull up to the house.

05:01.125 --> 05:04.323
- You see the door kicked in—
- And I ran in. That's when I found her.

05:04.485 --> 05:05.475
You moved the body?

05:06.805 --> 05:08.762
Yes.

05:08.925 --> 05:11.759
I tried to stem the bleeding,
but she was already gone.

05:11.925 --> 05:13.484
Did you see anybody suspicious?

05:13.645 --> 05:15.557
Miller was talking to the neighbours.

05:15.725 --> 05:18.285
One of them saw a white male
in his 40s take off...

05:18.445 --> 05:21.404
in a white or grey pickup.

05:21.565 --> 05:23.124
- Which is it?
- It was dark.

05:23.285 --> 05:25.436
That's the best
they could make out.

05:26.565 --> 05:29.399
Give Miller a hand,
and canvass the whole block.

05:29.565 --> 05:32.763
Updates every half hour.
The media's gonna be all over this.

05:32.925 --> 05:34.439
Okay.

05:34.645 --> 05:36.204
- You should go.
- No, I can help.

05:36.365 --> 05:38.038
Dex.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.798
As much as I could use
the hand...

05:39.965 --> 05:41.160
a defence attorney
would have a field day...

05:41.365 --> 05:44.164
with a forensic tech
who not only found a murder...

05:44.365 --> 05:45.958
but knew the victim
and then worked it.

05:46.125 --> 05:48.481
We gotta protect the case here.

05:50.485 --> 05:52.681
So I'll see you first thing
in the morning.

05:53.125 --> 05:55.082
Last day on the job.

05:55.405 --> 05:57.124
Last day.

05:57.285 --> 05:58.844
- I should—
- Go. We got this.

05:59.045 --> 06:00.081
All right.

06:00.245 --> 06:03.397
<i>Saxon may have a head start,
but I intend to catch up.</i>

06:09.245 --> 06:11.919
Jesus, what are you doing here
so early?

06:12.125 --> 06:13.320
Is Harrison with Hannah?

06:13.485 --> 06:15.681
Yeah, she's helping him
get dressed in my room.

06:15.845 --> 06:17.996
That kid wakes
before the fucking sun.

06:21.605 --> 06:23.198
You all right?

06:23.765 --> 06:26.041
Evelyn's dead.

06:26.685 --> 06:29.598
Saxon killed her last night
in front of me.

06:30.045 --> 06:32.355
He got away.

06:33.085 --> 06:34.963
- Fuck.
- I wanted you to hear it from me.

06:35.165 --> 06:39.125
Miami Metro is working the case.
It's all over the news.

06:39.845 --> 06:41.882
Jesus Christ. You all right?

06:47.765 --> 06:50.041
- Evelyn was...
- I know.

06:54.005 --> 06:55.200
If it weren't for her—

06:55.365 --> 06:57.800
We might not have found
our way back to each other.

07:03.245 --> 07:04.645
If Saxon's out there...

07:04.805 --> 07:08.401
Harrison needs to be with Jamie.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.883
She's back at Batista's.
He'll be safe there.

07:12.365 --> 07:15.005
Are you gonna go after Saxon?

07:15.445 --> 07:17.277
Yes.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.036
Then I will too. I'll call Batista.

07:20.205 --> 07:21.639
I'll go back to work today.

07:22.805 --> 07:24.398
She was important to me too, Dex.

07:24.565 --> 07:27.956
You're putting yourself in the same
position you've been trying to avoid.

07:28.125 --> 07:32.563
Understand this: if I get Saxon my way,
I'm not handing him over to you.

07:36.725 --> 07:39.604
Daddy, I combed my hair.

07:39.965 --> 07:41.684
I see that.

07:41.845 --> 07:43.120
He insisted.

07:43.285 --> 07:46.801
I think Jamie's gonna be really
impressed. Go grab your backpack.

07:46.965 --> 07:50.322
- She's waiting for us at the apartment.
- I'll help you.

07:52.765 --> 07:55.599
Don't tell her
I already had a doughnut.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.757
- What's this?
- I booked our itinerary.

07:59.925 --> 08:02.645
The three of us fly to Rio.
When we get to South America...

08:02.805 --> 08:05.240
we catch a flight to Buenos Aires.

08:05.405 --> 08:07.522
And no one can trace us.

08:07.685 --> 08:10.041
That's still the plan, right?

08:10.965 --> 08:12.399
Yeah.

08:12.565 --> 08:14.682
- But...
- What?

08:15.765 --> 08:18.997
Dr. Vogel's dead.
Saxon killed her.

08:19.165 --> 08:22.476
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

08:22.645 --> 08:24.318
This doesn't change anything
for us...

08:24.525 --> 08:27.359
but I need to make sure
it's taken care of before we leave.

08:27.525 --> 08:30.165
You think you can
take care of it that fast?

08:30.965 --> 08:33.002
Yes.

08:38.565 --> 08:40.841
<i>Two days left in Miami.</i>

08:41.045 --> 08:43.082
<i>Two days to find Saxon.</i>

08:43.245 --> 08:45.521
<i>Two days until I start
a new life with Hannah.</i>

08:45.685 --> 08:47.483
Good news.

08:47.645 --> 08:51.434
I already have five people
coming by to see your place today.

08:51.605 --> 08:52.800
That was fast.

08:52.965 --> 08:56.003
Market's coming back.
And with a location like yours...

08:56.165 --> 08:59.078
I wouldn't be surprised
if we end up with five offers.

08:59.245 --> 09:02.636
I really appreciate you taking
the listing on such short notice, Syl.

09:02.805 --> 09:05.923
Course.
I was happy to get the call.

09:06.365 --> 09:09.358
Oh, Harrison's gotten so big.

09:09.525 --> 09:11.164
Yeah.

09:12.725 --> 09:14.478
So why the sudden move?

09:19.405 --> 09:21.636
Too many memories.

09:22.205 --> 09:23.400
I understand.

09:23.565 --> 09:25.636
After Miguel...

09:26.525 --> 09:30.075
I downsized.
Focused on the kids.

09:31.325 --> 09:34.284
Oh, make that six people
coming by.

09:34.485 --> 09:35.601
I should take this.

09:35.805 --> 09:37.364
Okay.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.799
You put monkey in a box.

09:45.965 --> 09:47.797
Oh, sorry about that.

09:47.965 --> 09:53.643
God, seeing your place all boxed up
is making this so real.

09:54.845 --> 09:57.235
You guys are really going.

09:57.405 --> 09:59.636
Harrison is gonna miss you.

09:59.805 --> 10:02.320
Monkey's gonna miss you too.

10:02.485 --> 10:04.841
Hey, why don't you take
Harrison overnight?

10:05.045 --> 10:08.243
Deb's place is so cramped, and people
are gonna be in and out of here.

10:08.405 --> 10:09.634
And that way, you can—

10:09.805 --> 10:13.242
Hug my favourite person
in the whole wide world all night long!

10:13.405 --> 10:14.964
Stop!

10:16.845 --> 10:17.995
All right.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.441
- This one.
- This one, oh.

10:22.645 --> 10:25.604
Oh, yeah. Looks pretty.

10:25.765 --> 10:29.554
I'd like to get her inland
before Laura hits.

10:29.725 --> 10:32.081
- Laura?
- Tropical Storm Laura.

10:32.245 --> 10:35.363
They say she'll make landfall
in a few days.

10:39.965 --> 10:43.561
She's a 2001 Century 2901
centre console.

10:43.725 --> 10:45.921
I had this custom rail put in.

10:46.125 --> 10:47.605
New paint.

10:47.765 --> 10:52.476
Has a radar, GPS,
fish-finder, autopilot...

10:52.645 --> 10:54.557
emergency life raft.

10:54.725 --> 10:59.356
And I had these twin Yamaha 250
four-stroke motors put in.

10:59.525 --> 11:01.482
They got just over 400 hours...

11:01.685 --> 11:05.395
and when you open them up
and you're out there...

11:06.845 --> 11:08.723
There's nothing like it.

11:11.485 --> 11:14.398
Hoping she'd have
a bigger beer cooler.

11:16.965 --> 11:19.639
Well, maybe she's not
the boat for you.

11:26.845 --> 11:28.996
<i>Saxon moves from city to city...</i>

11:29.165 --> 11:30.485
<i>but his job never changes.</i>

11:30.645 --> 11:33.365
<i>He inspects buildings.
It's a place to start.</i>

11:35.685 --> 11:37.597
- Good morning.
- Easy for you to say.

11:37.805 --> 11:39.922
You didn't spend the night
scouring Vogel's place...

11:40.085 --> 11:42.554
with nothing to show for it
except a big goose egg.

11:42.965 --> 11:44.160
Nothing?

11:44.325 --> 11:46.601
See for yourself.

11:50.325 --> 11:52.840
No prints, no trace.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.964
Oh, man, I could go for some hookers
and some blow right now.

11:56.125 --> 11:59.641
But since this isn't the '90s,
caffeine it is.

11:59.805 --> 12:01.842
- Want anything?
- No, I'm good.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.483
<i>This hospital, closed for years.</i>

12:12.005 --> 12:15.760
<i>Saxon issued a demolition permit,
but it's still standing.</i>

12:16.685 --> 12:19.678
<i>The perfect place to cut
into your victims' skulls.</i>

12:21.085 --> 12:23.236
Hey, Dexter,
Quinn is looking for you.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.198
- Because?
- Oh, yeah.

12:27.525 --> 12:30.085
The swab thing
in the interrogation room.

12:30.565 --> 12:32.045
Okay.

12:38.085 --> 12:39.758
Dex, come in.

12:41.645 --> 12:43.318
Hi, Dexter.

12:46.605 --> 12:50.076
He came in to clear his name
on the Cassie case.

12:50.245 --> 12:51.645
I see.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.525
I had no idea I was a suspect.

12:54.845 --> 12:58.122
We got to your apartment,
and it was totally cleaned out.

12:58.285 --> 13:01.357
You can appreciate how that looks.

13:02.405 --> 13:04.362
I couldn't stay at my old place.

13:05.845 --> 13:07.837
I spent so much time there
with Cassie.

13:09.525 --> 13:12.199
Everywhere I looked,
something reminded me of her.

13:12.365 --> 13:14.243
You can understand that.

13:14.405 --> 13:16.965
You knew Cassie.
She was a great person.

13:17.925 --> 13:19.678
Yes, she was.

13:21.125 --> 13:23.082
For a while...

13:23.805 --> 13:26.525
I was even thinking
of leaving Miami.

13:27.365 --> 13:30.517
But my business is here...

13:30.685 --> 13:33.484
my friends, family.

13:35.765 --> 13:39.122
When I heard there was
an alert out for me, I...

13:41.285 --> 13:44.756
I couldn't believe it.
I thought we already resolved this.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.359
We appreciate you coming in.

13:46.525 --> 13:48.721
Like you said,
I just wanna clear my name.

13:48.885 --> 13:52.322
Good. This will help towards that.

13:52.485 --> 13:53.601
What's this?

13:53.765 --> 13:56.155
- DNA sample.
- Is that really necessary?

13:56.565 --> 13:59.399
- You said you wanted to cooperate.
- Open.

14:13.005 --> 14:15.679
Thanks. We're done here for now.

14:20.085 --> 14:22.998
Hey, you plan on any more moves—

14:23.165 --> 14:26.158
- I'll be sure to let you know.
- Good.

14:39.365 --> 14:42.722
Saxon was just here, trying to
clear his name for Cassie's murder.

14:42.885 --> 14:45.639
He had an answer for everything
Quinn threw at him.

14:45.805 --> 14:48.081
Well, he's got balls, I'll give him that.

14:48.285 --> 14:50.754
Masuka find anything to tie him
to Vogel's crime scene?

14:50.925 --> 14:52.757
He came up empty, but...

14:52.925 --> 14:54.325
What?

14:54.485 --> 14:57.319
- Saxon agreed to a standard.
- Well, so what?

14:57.485 --> 14:59.954
It's not gonna tie him
to Cassie's murder.

15:02.285 --> 15:05.119
But it'll give us a matri-fucking-lineal
match to his mother.

15:05.285 --> 15:07.277
Yeah, suddenly he's no longer
Oliver Saxon.

15:07.445 --> 15:10.085
He's Daniel Vogel,
Dr. Vogel's psychopathic son...

15:10.245 --> 15:13.317
who died in a fire
at a psychiatric hospital.

15:13.485 --> 15:16.284
Let him try to explain that away
with my boot up his ass.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.956
Let me ask you a question.

15:22.925 --> 15:25.599
Why are you helping us get Saxon?

15:26.485 --> 15:28.317
Don't you want him for yourself?

15:28.645 --> 15:31.035
I just want him taken care of.

15:34.125 --> 15:36.845
Well, that's new coming from you.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.483
I'm gonna go get started on this.

15:40.645 --> 15:43.160
I'm gonna go find some pens.

15:56.525 --> 15:57.959
Hi.

15:59.525 --> 16:02.165
Your Thin Mints are
in the bottom drawer.

16:02.325 --> 16:05.602
It takes supply requisition
like a week to come through, so...

16:05.765 --> 16:06.801
- Right.
- You mind?

16:07.005 --> 16:08.519
By all means, go ahead.

16:08.685 --> 16:10.563
Thanks.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.876
What the fuck is this?

16:20.845 --> 16:24.361
I kept it around
just in case I decided...

16:24.525 --> 16:26.323
to marry somebody else from work.

16:28.485 --> 16:31.319
You've had this in here
the whole time?

16:36.565 --> 16:40.002
Keep my stapler away from Soderquist.
Guy's a fucking klepto.

17:00.445 --> 17:04.644
<i>Is this old hospital
Saxon's private sanatorium?</i>

18:26.925 --> 18:28.917
Saxon's kill room.

18:32.205 --> 18:33.719
Zach died here.

18:33.925 --> 18:36.121
And who knows how many others?

18:37.085 --> 18:39.680
Doesn't look like
Saxon's been living here.

18:39.845 --> 18:41.404
But he'll be back.

18:41.565 --> 18:43.602
This is clearly a special place
for him.

18:43.765 --> 18:46.200
You can stake out the building,
wait for him.

18:46.365 --> 18:48.084
I don't have time to wait.

18:48.245 --> 18:50.077
Hannah and I
don't have time to wait.

18:50.245 --> 18:52.714
- I want him dead.
- By your hand.

18:52.885 --> 18:55.116
Anyone's hand,
as long as he's dead.

18:55.325 --> 18:58.796
That doesn't sound
like the old Dexter.

18:59.885 --> 19:02.400
Maybe I'm not the old Dexter.

19:23.925 --> 19:26.759
Everything Saxon downloaded
about me from Vogel's computer...

19:26.925 --> 19:29.076
is on this.

19:36.365 --> 19:38.800
He recorded all his kills.

19:39.125 --> 19:41.003
They're all here.

19:41.205 --> 19:43.959
But you still don't know
where he is.

19:45.965 --> 19:48.799
Maybe this is exactly what I need.

19:49.325 --> 19:51.442
I can bring him to me.

19:51.605 --> 19:53.403
Hey.

19:53.565 --> 19:56.364
You calling it quits soon?

19:56.525 --> 19:57.959
Yeah, I will soon.

19:58.125 --> 20:00.276
I just wanna get up to speed
on a couple things.

20:00.445 --> 20:02.243
Going to Dr. Vogel's memorial
tomorrow?

20:02.405 --> 20:03.964
I know she helped you
get through a lot.

20:04.125 --> 20:07.323
- Yeah, I'll be there.
- Need a ride, let me know.

20:15.005 --> 20:18.362
Swung by Elway's.
He said you were back on the force.

20:18.525 --> 20:21.404
Yeah. It's my first day back.
I'm kind of swamped.

20:21.565 --> 20:23.397
What can I help you with,
deputy marshal?

20:23.565 --> 20:25.841
I was hoping you could
clear something up for me.

20:26.005 --> 20:28.236
- I'm just following up on a lead.
- Shoot.

20:28.405 --> 20:31.125
A blond woman matching
Hannah McKay's description...

20:31.285 --> 20:34.483
walked into urgent care with
a young boy named Harrison Morgan...

20:34.645 --> 20:36.318
said she was his mother.

20:36.485 --> 20:39.796
The weird part is
she gave your name and address.

20:42.005 --> 20:43.598
My nephew's been staying with me...

20:43.805 --> 20:45.797
since Dexter put his condo
on the market.

20:45.965 --> 20:49.675
He busted his chin, and I took him in
to get him stitched up.

20:49.845 --> 20:51.757
So you took him to urgent care?

20:51.925 --> 20:55.316
I told the woman at the desk I was
his aunt, but maybe she didn't hear me.

20:55.525 --> 20:57.676
Still, she looked at my photo
of Hannah McKay...

20:57.845 --> 20:59.518
and swore
that's who brought him in.

20:59.685 --> 21:01.916
Then she needs to get
her fucking eyes checked...

21:02.085 --> 21:06.443
because I haven't been blond
since a very bad freshman year.

21:06.605 --> 21:09.200
Right, okay.
Well, look, you know what it's like.

21:09.365 --> 21:12.164
I gotta check out all the leads,
even the crazy ones, right?

21:12.325 --> 21:13.554
Sure.

21:14.085 --> 21:16.805
All right, welcome back, detective.
I'll be in touch.

21:17.645 --> 21:19.682
I'll be here.

21:29.925 --> 21:32.918
Not much turnout. I guess
she didn't have many family or friends.

21:33.085 --> 21:35.236
Yeah, just the son
who slit her throat.

21:35.765 --> 21:37.324
Think Saxon's watching?

21:37.525 --> 21:39.517
I would be.

21:40.805 --> 21:43.445
Thank you, everyone, for coming.
I know most of you...

21:43.605 --> 21:46.723
didn't know Evelyn very well, but...

21:46.885 --> 21:49.525
- It was a nice service.
- Yeah.

21:49.685 --> 21:51.677
It's important to remember
those no longer with us.

21:51.845 --> 21:53.359
Yeah.

21:54.285 --> 21:56.481
Now, who wants a drink?

22:06.045 --> 22:08.799
Christ. I'll be right back.

22:17.685 --> 22:20.519
You know they're really
gonna miss you, right?

22:21.005 --> 22:22.997
I know.

22:23.725 --> 22:27.082
Maybe you should go in there and
pretend you're gonna miss them too.

22:27.285 --> 22:29.754
It's your last day, you know?

22:30.405 --> 22:31.885
<i>It's no longer pretend.</i>

22:32.045 --> 22:35.595
Well, gain a Morgan,
lose a Morgan.

22:36.565 --> 22:38.636
Harry would have been proud
of the two of you.

22:39.245 --> 22:41.157
Thank you, sir.

22:41.325 --> 22:45.956
I want you to know both of you
have been like family to me.

22:46.125 --> 22:50.961
And, Dexter, if you ever need anything
or decide you wanna come back...

22:51.125 --> 22:52.684
this will always be your home.

22:53.605 --> 22:55.676
I appreciate that.

22:56.205 --> 22:58.037
So let me buy you another round.

22:58.205 --> 23:01.323
- I should probably get going.
- Oh, nonsense.

23:01.525 --> 23:03.881
For the next six hours,
you're still working for me.

23:04.045 --> 23:07.004
You're not going anywhere.
That's an order. Come on.

23:07.205 --> 23:09.800
Okay, missy, what's your poison?

23:10.845 --> 23:13.155
I'll have a Diet Coke.

23:13.325 --> 23:15.203
A beer for me. Thanks.

23:15.365 --> 23:18.836
Well, that's a little tame.

23:19.045 --> 23:21.276
Really? Are you gonna go there?

23:21.445 --> 23:23.323
Well, if you put it that way, no.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.045
Okay, you were all up in my shit
about a bong rip...

23:26.205 --> 23:29.323
but I don't know if you've noticed,
but we're in a bar.

23:29.485 --> 23:31.397
Look, I'm sorry
about the whole pot thing.

23:31.565 --> 23:35.115
You know, this whole father-daughter
thing is still kind of new, you know?

23:36.285 --> 23:38.402
Yeah, I know. It's cool.

23:40.045 --> 23:43.436
Everybody's really excited about
your sister being back on the force.

23:44.885 --> 23:47.844
Yeah, she told me
that you two might be...

23:48.005 --> 23:49.724
back in each other's lives.

23:50.525 --> 23:52.323
You okay with that?

23:53.845 --> 23:57.156
Deb likes you, and with me gone...

23:59.125 --> 24:01.879
I don't want her to be alone.

24:02.085 --> 24:06.682
I want her to be with someone
who makes her happy.

24:08.565 --> 24:11.080
That's all I ever wanted to do.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.157
I'm okay with that.

24:19.085 --> 24:20.997
I gotta take this.

24:22.325 --> 24:24.920
- Hey, Syl, what's up?
- Dex, I'm so glad I caught you.

24:25.085 --> 24:28.601
I know it's last-minute but I've got
somebody who wants to see the place...

24:28.765 --> 24:33.794
<i>wants to meet the seller,
and he's ready to make an offer, cash.</i>

24:34.965 --> 24:37.799
- Give me half an hour.
<i>- Perfect.</i>

24:42.365 --> 24:45.085
You remember
the first case we worked?

24:46.005 --> 24:48.076
Husband, wife, lots of blood.

24:48.245 --> 24:50.043
I'd never seen anything like it.

24:50.205 --> 24:53.198
The strings. The look on your face.

24:53.365 --> 24:55.038
You were like a pig in shit.

24:56.685 --> 24:58.438
Thanks, I think.

25:00.125 --> 25:03.118
Not sure what this place
is gonna be like without you.

25:06.765 --> 25:08.757
You're a good friend, Angel.

25:08.925 --> 25:11.645
I'm glad to hear you say that.

25:11.805 --> 25:13.637
So you'll forgive me for this.

25:13.805 --> 25:16.525
All right, everybody!
Everybody, come on, gather around.

25:16.685 --> 25:21.965
Gather around. I know that
this is a solemn occasion.

25:22.165 --> 25:25.954
But since somebody didn't
let me throw him a party...

25:26.845 --> 25:29.155
let's let this be it.

25:29.725 --> 25:34.925
Dexter Morgan may be leaving
the Miami Metro <i>familia...</i>

25:35.325 --> 25:39.114
but he will always be
right here in our hearts.

25:39.845 --> 25:41.837
To Dexter.

25:42.325 --> 25:46.683
We wish you and Harrison luck
in whatever comes next.

25:46.845 --> 25:49.041
- To Dexter.
- To Dexter.

25:49.205 --> 25:52.516
Thank you. Thank you.

25:59.365 --> 26:01.561
I'll miss you guys too.

26:09.965 --> 26:11.922
Dexter.

26:12.605 --> 26:14.403
This is Oliver Saxon.

26:15.245 --> 26:16.599
<i>Again.</i>

26:16.885 --> 26:20.561
He responded to the listing and was
hoping to take a look at the place.

26:20.765 --> 26:22.961
- Pleasure.
- Likewise.

26:23.125 --> 26:24.605
You'll have to excuse the mess.

26:24.765 --> 26:27.599
No problem. They say moving's
one of the big causes of stress.

26:27.765 --> 26:30.234
Almost as much as divorce.
And death.

26:31.845 --> 26:33.962
Why don't you follow me?

26:34.405 --> 26:37.603
So it's a one bedroom, one bathroom,
but it has an attached—

26:37.805 --> 26:41.321
Would you mind if Dexter showed me?
I like to hear directly from the owner.

26:41.485 --> 26:43.124
No sales pitch.

26:44.685 --> 26:45.914
Sure.

26:46.125 --> 26:49.641
I have a few phone calls to return.
I'll be outside.

26:54.685 --> 26:56.517
I always did like this place.

26:57.565 --> 26:59.443
You have the same view Cassie did.

26:59.605 --> 27:01.562
What are you doing here?

27:01.765 --> 27:03.677
I have a proposal.

27:03.845 --> 27:06.838
Figured the safest way
to deliver it was to bring a referee.

27:08.125 --> 27:10.003
I'm listening.

27:10.165 --> 27:11.997
We walk away.

27:12.165 --> 27:14.839
- Walk away?
- Both of us.

27:15.565 --> 27:17.284
From each other.

27:17.445 --> 27:20.005
Go our separate paths,
live our separate lives.

27:20.205 --> 27:22.242
I forget about you.

27:22.405 --> 27:23.919
You forget about me.

27:25.405 --> 27:28.239
You went out of your way
to kill your mother in front of me...

27:28.405 --> 27:30.158
and you just expect me to forget?

27:30.325 --> 27:32.237
May have been
a little bit over-the-top...

27:32.405 --> 27:34.283
but I was only trying
to make a point.

27:35.285 --> 27:37.242
I missed the point.

27:37.405 --> 27:41.558
It was a test to see if,
given the chance...

27:41.765 --> 27:43.961
she would finally choose me.

27:44.125 --> 27:48.244
Well, we both know
how that turned out.

27:48.605 --> 27:51.598
Yeah, so naturally,
you had to cut her throat.

27:51.765 --> 27:54.883
You know what it's like. The kill.

27:55.805 --> 27:58.684
It can be cathartic.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.723
And it was.

28:00.885 --> 28:03.354
That's why
I'm giving you a choice.

28:03.525 --> 28:06.404
Go on with your life,
or come after me.

28:08.045 --> 28:11.641
But choose poorly, like Mom...

28:12.245 --> 28:14.157
and you will lose.

28:15.885 --> 28:18.320
You seem pretty sure of yourself.

28:20.445 --> 28:23.597
You have a lot more to lose
than I do.

28:24.125 --> 28:26.082
You've created the perfect cover life.

28:27.445 --> 28:30.836
Cute little son, your sister.

28:31.365 --> 28:33.516
Stepkids even.

28:33.685 --> 28:38.919
And now you have a girlfriend.
It's Hannah, right?

28:40.485 --> 28:42.795
<i>They're not a cover.
They're real to me.</i>

28:42.965 --> 28:44.718
<i>Something Saxon can't understand.</i>

28:44.885 --> 28:48.196
All very lovely.

28:48.365 --> 28:51.802
And all very easy
to remove from your life.

28:52.485 --> 28:55.478
I mean, you've already had
one wife murdered.

28:55.645 --> 28:57.682
That must be an interesting story.

29:01.285 --> 29:03.720
But it's gonna put you
in a very awkward position...

29:03.885 --> 29:07.401
if everyone else starts
disappearing from your life.

29:08.965 --> 29:10.877
The choice is yours.

29:17.685 --> 29:20.200
Yeah, I think I can live with that.

29:23.485 --> 29:27.559
I'll let Mrs. Prado know
I've put an offer on the table.

29:33.725 --> 29:35.762
<i>He wants me to walk away
without realising...</i>

29:35.965 --> 29:38.685
<i>he's just reminded me why I can't.</i>

29:41.165 --> 29:44.158
So, what's so urgent?

29:44.325 --> 29:48.638
I've got a line on Hannah McKay, but
I'm gonna need your help reeling her in.

29:48.805 --> 29:52.003
- I thought you didn't want my help.
- Been looking at the wrong Morgan.

29:52.205 --> 29:55.323
I think your former employee
has her holed up in her place.

29:56.205 --> 29:57.639
Deb is no fan of Hannah McKay.

29:57.805 --> 30:00.195
Yeah, but you said she'd
do anything for her brother.

30:00.405 --> 30:02.124
Helping McKay is helping him.

30:02.325 --> 30:05.363
I just need you to talk to her,
take a look around.

30:08.485 --> 30:11.364
Look, Deb and I didn't exactly part
on the best of terms.

30:11.525 --> 30:13.676
If you're still interested
in that reward...

30:13.845 --> 30:16.724
I suggest you find a way
to patch things up with her.

30:25.245 --> 30:26.235
Hey.

30:26.445 --> 30:30.803
Just trying to make our last
few days in Miami special, you know?

30:30.965 --> 30:33.196
I hope you like dolmas.

30:33.725 --> 30:36.194
I'm just trying to keep myself busy.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.957
You should go on one
of those cooking shows.

30:39.125 --> 30:41.356
The competition ones. You'd win.

30:41.525 --> 30:43.915
Oh, I'd make sure that I did.

30:52.005 --> 30:54.520
- It's Elway.
- Bedroom.

31:02.285 --> 31:03.435
What's up, Elway?

31:03.605 --> 31:07.076
Security left a couple of your
personal items back in the office.

31:07.245 --> 31:09.476
Just a couple pictures and a hat.

31:09.685 --> 31:12.757
You didn't have to bring them
over here. I could've picked them up.

31:12.925 --> 31:15.235
Well, I actually wanted
to talk to you.

31:15.405 --> 31:18.523
- May I?
- Actually, now is not a very good time.

31:18.685 --> 31:20.517
It'll just take a minute.

31:20.685 --> 31:24.565
I wanted to apologise
about the way I behaved when you left.

31:24.725 --> 31:26.284
Don't worry about it.

31:26.445 --> 31:28.243
No, no, I was a real asshole.

31:28.405 --> 31:31.716
I let my ego get the best of me,
and I don't want to leave it like that.

31:31.885 --> 31:34.195
I— Well, I want us
to be friends, you know?

31:34.365 --> 31:36.322
Great. Well, then we're good.

31:36.485 --> 31:37.805
Now you're back on the force.

31:38.005 --> 31:40.565
Maybe you and I can do
each other the occasional favour.

31:40.725 --> 31:42.444
Yeah, we'll keep in touch.

31:43.205 --> 31:44.525
You—

31:44.685 --> 31:46.119
You expecting company?

31:46.285 --> 31:48.595
I sure am, and I actually need
to get ready. So...

31:51.205 --> 31:53.515
I guess the police department is
paying better than I remember.

31:53.725 --> 31:57.355
Hey, Elway, I really appreciate that
apology, but I've got a lot of shit to do.

31:57.565 --> 31:59.682
Could you kindly get
the fuck out of my house?

31:59.845 --> 32:01.677
Yeah.

32:10.885 --> 32:13.764
- He's gone, but he's onto you.
- Oh, shit.

32:13.925 --> 32:16.963
The deputy marshal won't be far
behind. You've gotta move fast.

32:23.805 --> 32:25.205
Hello?

32:25.365 --> 32:27.880
Dex, we have a problem.
Elway was just here.

32:28.125 --> 32:30.685
- Elway?
<i>- He was dropping by to talk with Deb...</i>

32:30.885 --> 32:34.674
but she's sure he was looking for me.
She thinks that he knows that I'm here.

32:35.765 --> 32:36.755
Stay there.

32:36.965 --> 32:38.445
Okay.

32:46.885 --> 32:50.162
I tried to get an earlier flight,
but it's booked because of the storm.

32:50.365 --> 32:51.958
I'm getting out of here right now.

32:52.125 --> 32:54.037
She's gonna stay at a hotel
near the airport until your flight.

32:54.245 --> 32:57.761
- Saxon came to my apartment.
- What? Why the fuck didn't you call me?

32:57.925 --> 33:01.362
It happened very fast.
He said he wanted to offer me a truce.

33:01.525 --> 33:04.120
- A truce?
- Really it was just a veiled threat.

33:04.285 --> 33:07.437
He threatened you, Harrison,
Astor and Cody, and you.

33:07.605 --> 33:09.517
I can handle
whatever he throws at me.

33:09.685 --> 33:11.563
- You should go with Hannah.
- Yes.

33:11.805 --> 33:14.718
I deposited my money into an offshore
account. We can access it immediately.

33:14.885 --> 33:17.275
The storm coming
is gonna ground all the flights.

33:17.445 --> 33:20.244
- Saxon isn't gonna follow us.
- What if he does?

33:21.605 --> 33:24.803
I get it. I get that this is something
you feel like you have to do...

33:24.965 --> 33:27.036
- ... this is who you are—
- It's not who I wanna be.

33:27.325 --> 33:29.999
I have to do this first.
There's no other way.

33:30.165 --> 33:31.838
I will be there.

33:45.365 --> 33:47.596
I guess this is goodbye.

33:48.325 --> 33:50.078
For now.

33:51.165 --> 33:54.636
I can't not see
my brother and my nephew.

33:55.285 --> 33:57.880
Now you're a part of that package.

33:58.405 --> 34:01.603
Well, not anything I ever saw coming.

34:02.605 --> 34:06.121
For what it's worth, I think Dexter's
making a mistake going after Saxon.

34:06.285 --> 34:08.800
I think he should be here
with you now.

34:10.245 --> 34:12.555
Have you ever known him
to be able to walk away...

34:12.725 --> 34:14.876
from something
once he's started it?

34:15.805 --> 34:18.718
That's life with Dexter.
That's who he is.

34:19.565 --> 34:22.797
It's like having a whole other
person in the relationship.

34:23.365 --> 34:26.358
I must really love this man.

34:27.445 --> 34:29.277
Me too.

34:30.565 --> 34:32.875
Even when I don't want to.

34:35.445 --> 34:37.482
Take care of them.

34:38.205 --> 34:40.276
Yeah, I will.

34:59.205 --> 35:02.243
<i>Saxon wants to make Miami
his home.</i>

35:02.405 --> 35:04.920
<i>Little does he know
how hot the summers can get.</i>

35:12.205 --> 35:16.358
<i>And once everyone sees the footage
of him as the Brain Surgeon...</i>

35:16.525 --> 35:18.164
<i>the heat will be unbearable.</i>

35:18.325 --> 35:20.999
You know, he's not just gonna
walk away from that.

35:21.165 --> 35:22.804
Exactly.

35:22.965 --> 35:25.082
I'm drawing him to me.

35:25.245 --> 35:27.919
So I guess you're not gonna
accept his offer.

35:28.605 --> 35:32.884
Did you believe him,
that he's willing to disengage?

35:33.045 --> 35:35.082
You clearly don't.

35:35.245 --> 35:38.556
He came into my house
and threatened my family.

35:39.525 --> 35:42.723
Now you're sounding like
the old Dexter again.

35:44.325 --> 35:45.998
No, this is a different kind of kill.

35:46.205 --> 35:48.401
Dead is dead, Dex.

35:49.565 --> 35:51.716
It didn't used to matter
who was on my table...

35:51.925 --> 35:53.917
as long as someone was, but now—

35:54.085 --> 35:55.121
It's personal.

35:56.805 --> 35:59.684
It's been personal for a long time.

36:01.165 --> 36:03.680
And that need you used to feel?

36:04.885 --> 36:08.276
It's still there, somewhere.

36:09.565 --> 36:11.716
But since Hannah came into my life...

36:11.885 --> 36:14.525
it's lessened.

36:14.685 --> 36:16.642
What I need...

36:17.125 --> 36:19.037
is her.

36:19.965 --> 36:23.754
So when you get to Argentina,
what happens?

36:24.805 --> 36:26.159
I don't know.

36:27.285 --> 36:29.720
But I can't wait to find out.

36:32.765 --> 36:36.236
Sorry. Dad said you were
waiting for this DNA stuff?

36:37.405 --> 36:38.805
Tell your dad thanks.

36:38.965 --> 36:41.241
It's so weird Masuka's your father.

36:41.565 --> 36:43.397
Weird awesome.

36:45.725 --> 36:48.365
You're not gonna fucking
believe this.

36:48.965 --> 36:52.197
Saxon is related to Vogel.
He's her son.

36:53.005 --> 36:54.564
You're kidding me.

36:54.725 --> 36:56.284
I thought all her family was dead.

36:56.925 --> 37:00.601
You think this fucker killed
his mother along with Cassie?

37:05.045 --> 37:06.195
What are you doing here?

37:06.365 --> 37:07.845
Starving.

37:09.125 --> 37:13.244
Saxon's DNA came back,
so they put out a warrant for his arrest.

37:13.405 --> 37:15.761
Miami Metro knows
that Saxon is Vogel's son...

37:15.965 --> 37:19.356
and Elway and Clayton have
no idea where Hannah is.

37:19.605 --> 37:22.916
This is your last night in Miami,
and we are having dinner together.

37:23.805 --> 37:26.081
Even though you've already
packed up your kitchen.

37:26.245 --> 37:28.282
You wanna help me find
a plate and some pans?

37:28.445 --> 37:30.914
- I'm really not hungry.
- The next time we do this...

37:31.085 --> 37:33.759
it's gonna be
fucking tacos and tequila.

37:33.925 --> 37:36.042
Or whatever the fuck they eat
in Argentina.

37:36.205 --> 37:39.801
Yeah, it'll probably be steaks.
It's Argentina, not Mexico.

37:39.965 --> 37:41.638
Deb, you shouldn't be here.

37:41.805 --> 37:44.036
Bullshit. Do you remember
where you put the pans?

37:44.245 --> 37:45.884
Listen to me. You can't be here.

37:47.565 --> 37:48.555
Why?

37:51.485 --> 37:55.115
- What the fuck is going on?
- I'm expecting company.

37:58.365 --> 38:00.084
Saxon.

38:01.525 --> 38:05.314
Just leave him to me.
And I mean leave.

38:05.485 --> 38:06.885
After everything you've been through,
I don't want—

38:07.045 --> 38:08.479
Listen to me.

38:08.685 --> 38:12.201
Nothing, and I mean nothing...

38:12.365 --> 38:16.325
is gonna stand in the way of me
having one more night with my brother.

38:19.205 --> 38:22.835
Now, are you gonna help me
find that fucking skillet or what?

38:46.085 --> 38:47.644
This place has been wiped clean.

38:47.845 --> 38:50.235
Almost clean. Look at this.

38:50.405 --> 38:54.035
The last site someone visited on this
computer was for an Aero Sudamerica.

38:54.205 --> 38:56.959
Any specific details?
Did she book a flight?

38:57.125 --> 39:00.243
If she did, it's not here.
But I'll tell you what I can do.

39:00.445 --> 39:02.801
Access manifests for flights
in the next few days...

39:02.965 --> 39:05.116
cross-check those names
with passport photos.

39:05.325 --> 39:07.476
- Not exactly legal.
- Are you saying don't do it?

39:07.645 --> 39:10.638
I'm not saying anything. While you do
whatever you're gonna do...

39:10.805 --> 39:13.365
I'm gonna tail the Morgans,
see if they'll lead me to her.

39:13.525 --> 39:15.357
Done and done.

39:16.605 --> 39:19.803
How are Astor and Cody
doing with the move?

39:20.005 --> 39:23.965
They're better now that I told them
they could come down for Christmas...

39:24.125 --> 39:27.038
and that Astor could have my SUV.

39:27.205 --> 39:31.279
You think you could drive it up to her?
She asked about you.

39:31.445 --> 39:34.802
Yeah, as soon as the storm passes.

39:34.965 --> 39:37.355
They're saying it might
turn into a hurricane.

39:37.565 --> 39:40.876
It's one of the few things
I won't miss about Florida.

39:42.205 --> 39:45.243
God, this is such a mindfuck.

39:46.045 --> 39:49.561
After tomorrow, you're not gonna be
here. What the fuck does that look like?

39:51.325 --> 39:54.363
We both start over.

39:54.805 --> 39:57.036
Is that even possible?

39:58.285 --> 40:01.005
Yeah, I think so.

40:01.565 --> 40:03.158
Don't you?

40:04.085 --> 40:08.398
It's just every fucked up—

40:12.925 --> 40:16.885
Every time I've been a complete mess,
you've been there for me.

40:18.285 --> 40:20.845
Even when it was your fault
that I was fucked up...

40:21.005 --> 40:23.122
you've never given up on me.

40:24.045 --> 40:26.514
So if I can't make this work...

40:27.845 --> 40:31.236
going back to being a cop again,
then who the fuck is gonna help me...

40:31.405 --> 40:33.397
pick up the pieces of that?

40:33.565 --> 40:36.125
You're not that person anymore.

40:36.285 --> 40:38.117
You're stronger than that.

40:38.285 --> 40:40.720
You're stronger than I'll ever be.

40:40.885 --> 40:42.763
I'm not.

40:44.245 --> 40:46.396
Deb, Dad and Vogel
gave me the code...

40:46.565 --> 40:49.683
so I'd know the right thing to do,
but you've always...

40:50.885 --> 40:53.161
just known.

40:54.245 --> 40:57.317
It's the compass
I always wished I had.

40:57.485 --> 41:00.205
And as long as you listen to that...

41:01.365 --> 41:03.322
you won't need me.

41:04.445 --> 41:06.118
You'll be fine.

41:08.685 --> 41:10.324
Maybe.

41:13.405 --> 41:15.795
But don't ever think
that it was the code...

41:15.965 --> 41:18.355
that made you a good brother.

41:19.325 --> 41:22.079
There's a human being in there.

41:23.845 --> 41:26.360
There always has been.

41:29.485 --> 41:32.205
Even if you can't see it.

41:34.125 --> 41:38.085
<i>Miami Metro is seeking the public's help
in locating a local man, Oliver Saxon...</i>

41:38.245 --> 41:40.760
<i>in connection with a string
of grisly recordings...</i>

41:40.925 --> 41:43.281
<i>that were recently obtained
by Channel 8 News.</i>

41:43.445 --> 41:44.515
<i>Miami—</i>

41:47.925 --> 41:51.999
Did you help them
recently obtain that footage?

41:52.765 --> 41:57.044
I needed him to be a wanted man
and force his hand.

41:57.245 --> 42:00.921
If he wants to take a last stab at me,
now he has to do it tonight.

42:02.725 --> 42:06.605
Which I why I need you
to get out of here, Deb.

42:06.765 --> 42:08.358
Please.

42:12.125 --> 42:16.324
<i>Bringing him in for questioning
is still the department's top priority.</i>

42:16.485 --> 42:18.716

Fucking Dexter.

43:27.285 --> 43:29.595
Freeze, motherfucker.

43:35.725 --> 43:37.205
I'll take it from here.

43:38.805 --> 43:40.125
Thanks, Deb.

43:55.325 --> 43:57.317
Welcome home.

43:58.845 --> 44:02.395
I guess this means you've
decided against the truce.

44:02.565 --> 44:04.921
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

44:05.125 --> 44:07.321
It's your own fault.

44:07.485 --> 44:10.523
You should've walked away,
left Miami when you could.

44:11.325 --> 44:15.205
I like this place. Miami's a great city.

44:15.365 --> 44:18.915
I love the Cuban food.
Nice weather.

44:19.085 --> 44:22.044
Murder solve rate
at about 20 percent.

44:23.045 --> 44:24.923
Yeah.

44:25.405 --> 44:27.442
I understand.

44:29.845 --> 44:32.121
There was a time
I wasn't willing to leave either.

44:32.285 --> 44:34.402
I didn't wanna give up anything.

44:36.925 --> 44:39.394
Sounds like something's changed.

44:40.765 --> 44:42.404
It has.

44:42.565 --> 44:44.682
Your girlfriend?

44:45.365 --> 44:46.481
Yeah, that's part of it.

44:48.245 --> 44:50.680
I've never been good
at relationships.

44:50.845 --> 44:54.316
Longest was a couple of weeks
and she was chained to my radiator...

44:54.485 --> 44:58.115
- ... so I guess that doesn't much count.
- Not really, no.

44:58.285 --> 45:01.278
Too much anger towards women,
I suppose.

45:01.925 --> 45:04.156
I can thank my mother for that.

45:04.325 --> 45:06.920
No, that's all on you.

45:14.005 --> 45:16.520
Well, I wish you luck.

45:16.685 --> 45:19.723
Hope you don't stab her
in the heart while she sleeps.

45:19.885 --> 45:24.277
No, Oliver, I like her.

45:26.405 --> 45:28.442
I love her.

45:29.445 --> 45:31.880
I think about her all the time.

45:32.325 --> 45:34.635
I'm thinking about her right now.

45:36.405 --> 45:40.445
How I'd rather be with her
than here with you.

45:43.005 --> 45:44.724
What?

45:48.845 --> 45:51.041
This is usually
my favourite moment...

45:51.485 --> 45:53.556
the kill.

45:54.285 --> 45:56.561
The moment before the kill,
the kill itself...

45:56.725 --> 45:58.762
the moment right after.

46:03.205 --> 46:06.243
But now I don't even wanna be here.

46:08.525 --> 46:11.518
I'm feeling a much stronger pull.

46:17.405 --> 46:19.761
I don't need to kill you.

46:23.805 --> 46:25.922
Then don't.

46:26.085 --> 46:28.042
Walk away.

46:30.285 --> 46:31.958
I will.

46:34.325 --> 46:36.396
I guess I'll live to see another day.

46:36.605 --> 46:39.074
Oh, no, you're still gonna die.

46:39.685 --> 46:43.361
Just gonna be in the electric chair.

46:52.325 --> 46:54.476
Hey, Deb, change of plans.

47:26.045 --> 47:27.274
Dex.

47:27.445 --> 47:29.516
Saxon's in here.

47:29.685 --> 47:31.642
Arrest him. Take him in.

47:31.805 --> 47:34.240
Arrest him? He's still alive?

47:35.725 --> 47:39.321
Say you were looking into the buildings
he was inspecting. You subdued him.

47:39.485 --> 47:42.045
You'll be the hero of Miami Metro.

47:43.045 --> 47:44.764
I guess I fucking will.

47:48.125 --> 47:49.764
What about your knives?

47:49.925 --> 47:52.281
I've got a plane to catch.

47:54.405 --> 47:56.317
Do you want me
to send them to you?

47:56.485 --> 48:00.001
Leave them as evidence.
Say you found them in the cabinet.

48:00.165 --> 48:02.885
- People will think they're Saxon's.
- Let them.

48:03.045 --> 48:05.685
Give him even more credit
than he deserves.

48:05.845 --> 48:08.917
Once I get settled, I'm gonna figure
out a way to get in touch.

48:09.085 --> 48:10.758
- Dexter—
- My car, I'll leave it at the airport.

48:10.925 --> 48:13.315
- Dexter.
- And—

48:14.405 --> 48:16.124
What?

48:17.645 --> 48:20.001
You could at least fucking hug me.

48:27.525 --> 48:29.994
This is just for right now.
It's not forever.

48:31.045 --> 48:33.401
I know that, fuckface.

48:39.325 --> 48:40.759
Go get on a plane.

48:42.285 --> 48:43.878
I will.

48:49.965 --> 48:52.480
Are you sure about this, Dexter?

48:54.805 --> 48:56.717
I am.

48:57.725 --> 49:00.194
I never thought this day would come.

49:04.485 --> 49:06.556
You don't need me anymore.

49:29.725 --> 49:31.603
This is Debra Morgan
requesting backup...

49:31.765 --> 49:34.917
at the Rendell Psychiatric Hospital
in Allapattah.

49:47.165 --> 49:49.521
What the fuck is going on here?

49:51.565 --> 49:53.158
Help me, please!

49:53.325 --> 49:55.362
I was abducted by the man
who was just here.

49:55.525 --> 49:57.357
- Did you see him?
- I didn't see anybody.

49:57.525 --> 50:00.120
Get me out of here, please,
before he comes back.

50:03.645 --> 50:05.762
I thought I was gonna die.

50:06.125 --> 50:07.957
Thank God you came here.

50:12.645 --> 50:14.079
Don't move.

50:33.685 --> 50:37.474
This is Detective Debra Morgan.
I've been shot.

50:38.165 --> 50:40.725
Please send help.

50:48.205 --> 50:51.039
<i>I used to live my life at night.</i>

50:52.485 --> 50:55.603
<i>In the shadow of my dark passenger.</i>

50:56.365 --> 50:59.358
<i>I lived in shadows for so long...</i>

50:59.525 --> 51:02.518
<i>until the dark became my world.</i>

51:03.965 --> 51:06.685
<i>But over time, the people in my life...</i>

51:06.845 --> 51:08.518
<i>flipped on a light.</i>

51:11.245 --> 51:14.841
<i>At first I was blinded,
it was so bright.</i>

51:19.525 --> 51:21.915
<i>But over the years,
my eyes adjusted...</i>

51:22.085 --> 51:24.156
<i>and I could see.</i>

51:25.605 --> 51:28.404
<i>And now what's in focus
is my future.</i>

51:28.605 --> 51:30.278
<i>Bright.</i>

51:30.485 --> 51:33.284
<i>Brighter than it's ever been.</i>
