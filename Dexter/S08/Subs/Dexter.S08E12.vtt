00:10.125 --> 00:11.764
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:11.925 --> 00:13.041
You can't kill me.

00:13.245 --> 00:14.440
Why?

00:14.605 --> 00:16.562
Because I don't fit Harry's code.

00:16.725 --> 00:20.162
<i>Trust me when I say that there's
a place in this world for your son.</i>

00:20.325 --> 00:21.475
You're perfect.

00:21.645 --> 00:24.638
How can you still say that when
you know what I've done to Deb?

00:24.805 --> 00:26.558
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

00:28.085 --> 00:30.475
Why did you save me?
Why didn't you let me drown?

00:30.645 --> 00:32.876
I couldn't imagine my life
without you in it.

00:33.045 --> 00:36.197
I'm glad that you have managed to
find your way back to each other.

00:36.365 --> 00:37.879
The family that kills together...

00:38.045 --> 00:39.638
Zach's killer is related to you.

00:39.805 --> 00:42.525
The Brain Surgeon is related to you.
Daniel.

00:42.685 --> 00:44.483
He's going by the name Oliver Saxon.

00:44.645 --> 00:45.681
What are you going to do?

00:45.845 --> 00:47.916
What do you think?
He's my son.

00:48.085 --> 00:50.202
I still have feelings for you.
No, I just—

00:51.725 --> 00:53.921
Remember me?
Where do you think you'll go?

00:54.085 --> 00:56.520
I haven't decided.
Argentina.

00:59.925 --> 01:02.804
Me, you and Harrison
are gonna move to Argentina.

01:03.285 --> 01:06.801
I've got a line on Hannah McKay,
but I'm gonna need help reeling her in.

01:07.005 --> 01:08.564
He's onto you. Move fast.

01:08.725 --> 01:11.684
I tried to get an earlier flight,
but it's booked solid.

01:11.885 --> 01:13.956
I have a proposal.
We walk away.

01:14.125 --> 01:17.835
You kill your mother in front of me,
and you just expect me to forget?

01:18.005 --> 01:19.485
Evelyn?

01:19.885 --> 01:22.480
This is usually
my favourite moment, the kill.

01:22.685 --> 01:24.278
Now I don't even wanna be here.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.204
Hey, Deb, change of plans.

01:26.365 --> 01:27.435
Go get on a plane.

01:28.965 --> 01:32.754
Last site someone visited on this
computer was Aero Sudamerica.

01:32.925 --> 01:35.156
I'm gonna tail the Morgans,
see if they'll lead me to her.

01:36.605 --> 01:38.437
What the fuck is going on here?
Help me, please.

01:41.045 --> 01:43.116
Unh!
Don't move.

01:44.245 --> 01:48.159
<i>I used to live my life at night,
in the shadow of my dark passenger.</i>

01:48.325 --> 01:52.239
<i>But over the years, my eyes adjusted,
and I could see.</i>

01:52.405 --> 01:55.284
<i>And now what's in focus is my future.</i>

01:55.445 --> 01:58.995
<i>Bright. Brighter than it's ever been.</i>

01:59.165 --> 02:01.919
This is Detective Debra Morgan.
I've been shot.

02:03.005 --> 02:09.079
FaceTime with British Models 24/7
www. saucytime. com

03:56.685 --> 03:57.960
Are we almost there?

03:58.125 --> 04:00.196
It's, uh, Gate 209. Just a couple more.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.925
I want some Oreos.
There'll be food on the plane.

04:03.085 --> 04:04.883
Come on, you promised
to help me count.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.604
Two hundred ten.
There you go.

04:06.765 --> 04:10.202
<i>I always thought if I ever left Miami,
I'd be running for my life,</i>

04:12.005 --> 04:13.564
<i>not running towards a new one.</i>

04:13.725 --> 04:16.081
Two hundred and eleven.
Heh.

04:17.085 --> 04:18.678
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

04:18.845 --> 04:22.521
we'll begin boarding Flight 691
to Rio de Janeiro in a few moments.

04:22.685 --> 04:27.601
<i>We ask that you have your tickets
and passports ready for the attendant.</i>

04:28.645 --> 04:30.443
Where's Hannah?

04:34.245 --> 04:36.441
Hannah?
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

04:36.605 --> 04:39.279
I'm at the gate. Where are you?
I'm in the ladies' room.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.004
Elway is in the boarding area.

04:43.605 --> 04:45.119
Come here, buddy.

04:46.005 --> 04:47.564
<i>Attention, passengers:</i>

04:47.765 --> 04:50.963
<i>We will begin pre-boarding for Aero
Sudamerica Flight 691 to Rio de Janeiro.</i>

04:51.125 --> 04:54.004
He didn't see me. Did he see you?
I don't think so.

04:54.165 --> 04:57.636
He's got a clear view of the Jetway.
He must have bought a ticket.

04:57.805 --> 05:00.161
We won't be able to board
without being spotted.

05:00.365 --> 05:02.436
And he's right between you
and the exit.

05:02.605 --> 05:05.643
Dex, I just heard them.
Our plane is boarding right now.

05:10.845 --> 05:14.316
Stay where you are. I'll call you back.
Okay.

05:14.485 --> 05:16.920
Hey. You want some Oreos?

05:17.085 --> 05:18.121
Yay!

05:18.325 --> 05:20.282
Come on.

05:24.125 --> 05:26.117
Why don't you grab something
for the flight?

05:26.285 --> 05:28.800
Nothing too big.
Okay.

05:31.725 --> 05:33.523
The storm is coming fast.

05:42.205 --> 05:43.798
<i>We'll now be boarding</i>

05:43.965 --> 05:45.399
<i>all passengers in business class.</i>

05:45.565 --> 05:49.081
<i>All passengers in business class,
please make your way toward the gate.</i>

05:52.365 --> 05:55.881
Hey, excuse me.
Hi. I have, uh, tickets on this flight.

05:56.085 --> 05:58.964
I'm a forensic analyst, Miami Metro.
Yes?

05:59.125 --> 06:03.005
I don't wanna tell you how
to do your job, but I just saw a guy

06:03.165 --> 06:06.522
drop that bag under that chair
and then just walk away.

06:06.725 --> 06:10.321
I thought he forgot it, but it really
looked like he left it there on purpose.

06:10.485 --> 06:11.839
Did you see where he went?

06:12.005 --> 06:14.474
Yeah, he's right over there,
on the phone.

06:15.845 --> 06:18.155
I know it's probably nothing,
but like they say:

06:18.325 --> 06:20.396
"If you see something,
say something."

06:20.565 --> 06:22.158
Thanks.

06:22.365 --> 06:24.322
Security, this is Casey
at Gate 211.

06:24.485 --> 06:27.444
There's a Caucasian male
who just came in with a backpack...

06:27.605 --> 06:30.325
Deputy marshal, it's Elway again.
I'm still at the airport.

06:30.485 --> 06:33.125
I still think Hannah McKay's trying
to leave the country.

06:33.285 --> 06:35.163
Call me as soon as you can.
Thank you.

06:35.605 --> 06:39.519
Sir. Airport security.
Need you to come with us, please.

06:39.685 --> 06:42.359
What? What happened?
Just gotta ask you a few questions.

06:42.525 --> 06:46.280
What is this about? I'll miss my flight.
Sir, I need you to do what I ask.

06:46.445 --> 06:47.879
This way.

06:48.045 --> 06:50.605
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

06:52.965 --> 06:55.036
Hey.
Hey, the coast is clear.

06:55.205 --> 06:56.195
<i>Elway's gone.</i>
Okay.

06:56.365 --> 06:58.038
<i>Due to a security concern...</i>

06:58.205 --> 07:00.037
Let's go see Hannah.

07:00.205 --> 07:02.117
<i>it is necessary at this time</i>

07:02.285 --> 07:04.641
<i>for all passengers
to exit the boarding area...</i>

07:04.805 --> 07:06.683
Clear this area right now.

07:13.165 --> 07:16.237
What did you do?
Put Elway on the no-fly list.

07:16.885 --> 07:19.400
Unfortunately,
now we're not flying either.

07:19.565 --> 07:20.885
Come on, bud.

07:29.525 --> 07:31.756
All right, let's move her.

07:32.365 --> 07:35.199
Stabbed in the heart. Pretty quick.
Unh.

07:35.365 --> 07:39.279
His gun is missing too.
We can assume Saxon still has it.

07:40.165 --> 07:41.315
I'm calling your brother.

07:41.525 --> 07:44.597
No, he's leaving with Harrison.
If you tell him, he'll stay.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.199
Deb—
I swear to God,

07:46.405 --> 07:48.636
I'm not getting on that ambulance
if you call.

07:48.805 --> 07:50.159
Okay.

07:51.005 --> 07:53.315
Can I ride with you to the hospital?
No problem.

07:53.485 --> 07:55.681
Do not argue with me.
I'm in the ambulance.

07:55.845 --> 07:58.440
You're such a fucking asshole.
Yeah, he signed it.

07:58.605 --> 08:01.723
I'll meet you at the hospital.
I'm right behind you.

08:14.685 --> 08:17.120
Miami Central,
this is Rescue 6 for transport...

08:18.645 --> 08:22.002
You're all right.
Hurts like a motherfucker.

08:22.165 --> 08:23.679
Ohh...

08:24.245 --> 08:27.795
You know, I really hate getting shot.
You need to stop that.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.445
Unh.

08:32.845 --> 08:35.519
I really thought that was it.
I thought I was gonna die, heh.

08:35.685 --> 08:37.404
No. You're gonna live forever.

08:40.485 --> 08:42.636
I thought maybe I was
getting what I deserved.

08:42.805 --> 08:44.797
What you deserve?

08:45.005 --> 08:47.236
Why would you think that?

08:53.845 --> 08:56.485
I've done shit I'm not proud of.

08:58.485 --> 09:00.477
Stuff I can't take back.

09:00.685 --> 09:02.881
Think I haven't done shit
I'm not proud of?

09:03.045 --> 09:04.843
No.

09:06.845 --> 09:08.404
It's not the same.

09:08.565 --> 09:11.080
I know.
You went through a bad time.

09:11.245 --> 09:15.444
But I fucked up too, Deb. A lot.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.678
But I think we get
to make up for it, you know?

09:22.805 --> 09:24.125
How?

09:24.285 --> 09:29.041
You do enough good in the world,
it sort of cancels out the bad.

09:29.725 --> 09:33.685
I think I would need to save
a busload of nuns or something.

09:33.885 --> 09:35.763
You're a good person.

09:35.925 --> 09:37.837
A lot better than most.

09:38.005 --> 09:39.678
Now that you're back on the force,

09:39.845 --> 09:42.405
you're gonna have a million chances
to do good.

09:42.605 --> 09:45.882
Maybe even save
that busload of nuns.

09:46.605 --> 09:49.757
If they're like the ones
I had in school, let them go.

09:50.245 --> 09:51.884
Come here.

09:55.965 --> 09:57.445
Hey.

09:57.925 --> 09:59.917
I'm gonna be right here, okay?

10:00.125 --> 10:02.720
We both are.
Her vitals are stable.

10:02.885 --> 10:05.354
Let's get her into surgery.
I love you, Joey.

10:06.325 --> 10:08.078
What's that?

10:15.845 --> 10:17.325
So?

10:17.485 --> 10:20.125
She's on her way to surgery now.
She took one in the gut.

10:20.285 --> 10:22.402
We don't know how bad it is yet.

10:22.605 --> 10:25.120
Where's Dexter?
Deb asked us not to call him.

10:25.285 --> 10:27.117
She what?
He's on a trip with Harrison.

10:27.285 --> 10:29.595
She didn't wanna worry him.
But he's gotta know.

10:29.765 --> 10:31.245
Damn right he's gotta know.

10:35.085 --> 10:37.554
<i>Due to a possible security concern,</i>

10:37.725 --> 10:39.000
<i>we are evacuating the terminal.</i>

10:44.765 --> 10:46.802
It's Matthews.

10:47.005 --> 10:48.041
Hello?

10:48.205 --> 10:51.403
<i>Dexter, Saxon escaped
after shooting Debra.</i>

10:52.365 --> 10:56.041
No. Well, thank you for telling me.
I'll be right there.

10:56.965 --> 10:58.763
What's wrong?

10:58.925 --> 11:00.803
It's Debra.

11:00.965 --> 11:02.445
What?

11:02.965 --> 11:04.684
Come on, bud.

11:07.165 --> 11:09.236
Saxon shot her and got away.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.037
Is she okay?

11:13.685 --> 11:17.315
She's in the hospital
getting ready to go into surgery.

11:17.485 --> 11:19.875
Is Aunt Deb sick?
Just a little.

11:20.045 --> 11:22.162
But the doctors are
fixing her up right now.

11:22.325 --> 11:24.556
You need to go to her.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.556
I'll take you back to the hotel.

11:27.725 --> 11:29.842
We should fly
into a different country.

11:30.045 --> 11:31.718
They're only gonna
hold Elway so long.

11:31.925 --> 11:35.236
He's gonna hit all the flights to Rio.
There may not be more flights.

11:35.405 --> 11:38.204
I heard they were gonna close
the airport to wait out the storm.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.880
Leave from another city.
See what you can find online.

11:41.045 --> 11:43.037
What about you?
I'll join you when I can.

11:43.205 --> 11:46.039
But—
Don't worry. We'll make this work.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.685
One bag of ice
and one gallon of water.

11:58.845 --> 12:01.440
- Can I get one more?
- Only one bag.

12:26.965 --> 12:30.800
Hi, Jamie.
Hey, Harrison.

12:30.965 --> 12:33.161
So tell me
all about your adventures...

12:33.325 --> 12:35.965
How is she?
Still in surgery.

12:36.725 --> 12:40.685
Yeah, we weren't able to speak
to the doctor before she went in.

12:41.285 --> 12:44.915
Your sister's tough.
Just like your old man was.

12:45.085 --> 12:47.475
Yeah, Dex.
She's gonna pull through.

12:50.965 --> 12:52.160
<i>Due to severe weather...</i>

12:52.325 --> 12:54.556
<i>This is Deputy U.S. Marshal Clayton.</i>

12:54.725 --> 12:56.079
<i>Please leave
your name and number.</i>

12:56.245 --> 12:58.362
Clayton, it's Elway. Again.

12:58.525 --> 13:01.962
I don't know where you are, but I'll
tell you this: McKay's still in town.

13:02.125 --> 13:05.402
With the flights cancelled, I'm sure
she's looking for another way out.

13:05.565 --> 13:08.797
I put the word out to my contacts,
and with what I pay these people,

13:08.965 --> 13:11.844
if she walks through a hotel,
a car-rental agency, a bus,

13:12.005 --> 13:14.122
I'm gonna hear about that shit.

13:14.805 --> 13:18.162
All right. I'll try you at your field office,
see if I can get you there.

13:24.085 --> 13:26.554
<i>U.S. Marshals Service.
How may I direct your call?</i>

13:26.725 --> 13:28.239
Yeah, this is Jacob Elway.

13:28.405 --> 13:30.556
I've been working
with Deputy Marshal Clayton.

13:30.725 --> 13:33.763
I've been trying like hell—
<i>I guess you haven't heard the news.</i>

13:33.925 --> 13:36.645
What?
<i>Clayton was involved in a shooting.</i>

13:36.805 --> 13:39.036
<i>I'm afraid he was killed
in the line of duty.</i>

13:54.845 --> 13:56.484
Why aren't you in Argentina?

13:59.125 --> 14:01.037
Why do you think?

14:04.525 --> 14:08.917
I told them not to call you.
Well, I'm glad they did.

14:14.085 --> 14:17.715
How come we never went hiking
when we were kids?

14:17.885 --> 14:19.763
Hiking?

14:20.765 --> 14:22.882
Climbing...

14:24.565 --> 14:26.522
mountains.

14:27.085 --> 14:28.758
Hiking.
I don't know.

14:28.925 --> 14:31.645
Because it's hard to find
a mountain in Florida?

14:35.285 --> 14:38.756
There are mountains
in South America.

14:39.805 --> 14:41.842
All over the place.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.884
Why are you looking at me
like that?

14:53.485 --> 14:55.636
Or is that just your face?

14:58.405 --> 15:01.557
I should never have
left Saxon alive.

15:02.085 --> 15:03.963
It's not your fault.

15:06.805 --> 15:08.762
Clayton fucked everything up.

15:09.925 --> 15:11.757
Bad luck.

15:11.925 --> 15:14.201
No, it's more than that.

15:14.845 --> 15:17.644
Ever since you found out
who I am...

15:26.205 --> 15:28.765
I've screwed up your life, Deb.

15:28.925 --> 15:32.714
It's not yours to screw up, Dexter.

15:34.125 --> 15:37.675
I am responsible for my life.
Do you hear me?

15:40.165 --> 15:42.999
I don't want you to feel guilty
about this.

15:44.005 --> 15:46.725
I don't want you to feel guilty
about anything. You hear me?

15:49.845 --> 15:54.158
You were meant to be happy,
so you need to go fucking be happy.

15:55.885 --> 15:57.558
Okay.

15:58.845 --> 16:00.996
Hello there.

16:01.165 --> 16:03.885
Dr. Kruper.
Dexter. I'm Debra's brother.

16:04.045 --> 16:05.445
Oh, nice to meet you.

16:06.205 --> 16:08.640
Okay, I'm just gonna
check your stomach.

16:10.445 --> 16:13.483
So how are you feeling
otherwise?

16:13.645 --> 16:15.682
I wanna go hiking.

16:15.845 --> 16:17.165
I wouldn't recommend that

16:17.325 --> 16:19.317
for at least a few hours.

16:19.845 --> 16:21.120
How is she?

16:21.285 --> 16:23.720
That bullet bounced around
quite a bit.

16:23.925 --> 16:26.156
But it missed
hitting anything important.

16:26.325 --> 16:27.600
You are very lucky.

16:28.085 --> 16:29.644
So she's gonna be all right?

16:29.845 --> 16:33.236
There is a lot of recovery time ahead.

16:33.885 --> 16:37.356
But I'd say we're looking pretty good.
I'm optimistic.

16:37.845 --> 16:39.404
Thank you.
Mm-hm.

16:47.445 --> 16:50.244
I bet Hannah loves Argentina.

16:51.965 --> 16:54.480
Pretty blond, lots of attention.

16:54.645 --> 16:56.398
Just her thing.

16:57.205 --> 16:59.674
Hannah didn't make the flight.

17:00.725 --> 17:04.355
Elway was there,
and we had to lose him.

17:06.085 --> 17:08.725
That's my fault, Dex.
I put him on her.

17:08.925 --> 17:12.157
That rat-face fuck.

17:13.005 --> 17:16.043
I'm sorry.
No, don't start blaming yourself.

17:16.205 --> 17:19.676
Coming from
Mr. "I screwed up your life, Deb."

17:23.805 --> 17:27.765
I need to find another way
for Hannah to get out of the country.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.356
I'm thinking of sending Harrison
with her now

17:33.525 --> 17:35.721
and meeting up with them
after you get out

17:35.885 --> 17:38.320
and Saxon is taken care of.

17:39.045 --> 17:42.243
You heard the doctor. I'm fine.
You should go. We'll get Saxon.

17:42.405 --> 17:44.397
No.
Dex, we'll get him.

17:44.565 --> 17:47.125
Your life is waiting on you.
You should leave.

17:47.645 --> 17:48.761
Deb...

17:48.965 --> 17:51.525
The next word
I wanna hear you say is "goodbye."

17:54.285 --> 17:58.996
Say it already, or I'll crawl out
of this bed and kick your fucking ass.

18:01.485 --> 18:03.363
Goodbye.

18:04.925 --> 18:06.837
I'll see you soon.

18:24.525 --> 18:28.201
How's Aunt Deb? Can I see her?
Oh, she needs to rest.

18:28.365 --> 18:31.403
But she's gonna come visit us
real soon.

18:34.005 --> 18:37.840
Hey, did you know that this
is the hospital where you were born?

18:38.885 --> 18:41.002
Really?
Yeah. Right down there.

18:41.165 --> 18:43.634
It was the first time I saw you.

18:44.725 --> 18:46.842
I was with Aunt Deb.

18:51.445 --> 18:53.914
Holy fucking shit.
There's another Morgan now.

18:54.085 --> 18:57.157
Yeah.
Congratulations.

18:57.365 --> 18:58.515
You're a father.

18:59.005 --> 19:01.725
Yeah, and you're an aunt.
Jesus.

19:01.885 --> 19:03.478
Did you and Rita land
on a name yet?

19:03.645 --> 19:04.761
Harrison.

19:06.885 --> 19:09.559
Dad would love that. Harrison.

19:10.725 --> 19:13.035
I wanna hold him.

19:16.645 --> 19:19.240
Which one is yours?
I, um...

19:19.405 --> 19:21.317
That's your son.

19:28.285 --> 19:30.481
Do you wanna hold him?
Yeah, I wanna hold him.

19:30.645 --> 19:31.874
He's sleeping.
Let him sleep.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.514
He has his whole fucking life
to sleep.

19:39.005 --> 19:42.965
He's so small.
Don't worry. He'll grow.

19:43.965 --> 19:46.241
How does it feel to be a father?

19:46.405 --> 19:48.362
I have no idea.
Heh.

19:48.525 --> 19:50.960
Everything's gonna be different now.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.443
I know.

20:00.125 --> 20:01.764
Hey, thanks for your call.

20:01.925 --> 20:03.678
No problem.

20:05.485 --> 20:07.602
How's Debra?
The doctor's optimistic.

20:07.765 --> 20:09.802
That's good to hear.

20:09.965 --> 20:11.843
Dexter, if there's anything
I can do...

20:12.005 --> 20:16.158
Well, I'm probably being paranoid,
but Saxon is still out there.

20:16.365 --> 20:18.482
Think you could put a couple unis
on her room?

20:18.645 --> 20:19.761
I'm already on it.

20:21.925 --> 20:23.075
Thanks.
No problem.

20:26.765 --> 20:30.395
Hey. Hey, I just heard about Deb.
What happened?

20:30.565 --> 20:33.399
Uh, it's a long story.
I don't really have time to go into it.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.034
In a hurry to get back
to Hannah McKay?

20:36.485 --> 20:39.478
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's why Clayton was following Deb.

20:39.645 --> 20:42.285
Figured she was helping you
and Hannah leave the country.

20:42.445 --> 20:44.562
You're partially responsible
for his death.

20:44.765 --> 20:48.361
Just stay away from me.
Storm's coming, buddy.

20:48.885 --> 20:51.354
And it's gonna be real hard
to find a way out.

20:54.165 --> 20:56.236
Don't go down with her,
Dexter.

20:58.285 --> 20:59.685
Son of a bitch.

21:04.245 --> 21:06.680
<i>The National Hurricane Centre
is reporting</i>

21:06.845 --> 21:08.837
<i>that Laura is now just east
of Cuba</i>

21:09.005 --> 21:11.361
<i>with sustained winds
topping 100 miles per hour.</i>

21:11.525 --> 21:15.678
<i>If it keeps on this current course,
it could hit the Keys by sundown.</i>

21:18.885 --> 21:20.080
Shh. It's okay.

21:20.245 --> 21:22.805
<i>Hurricane Laura shows
no signs of slowing down.</i>

21:23.005 --> 21:25.395
Hey. It's okay. It's okay.

21:25.565 --> 21:26.601
Hey, we're closed.

21:26.805 --> 21:29.525
Only reason I'm here
is to keep the animals calm to—

21:29.725 --> 21:31.682
Stitch me up.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.598
Okay.

21:34.765 --> 21:37.405
Okay, I'll do whatever you need.

21:38.485 --> 21:40.556
Miami's entire coast
is being evacuated,

21:40.725 --> 21:44.275
so we can use the craziness to get
out of here without being spotted.

21:44.445 --> 21:47.643
They're lining up evacuation buses.
The bus?

21:47.805 --> 21:48.955
The highways are parking lots.

21:49.165 --> 21:50.485
Buses have their own lanes.

21:50.645 --> 21:54.241
We can take one all the way up
to Jacksonville and fly out from there.

21:55.285 --> 21:59.199
We'd better leave for the bus station
soon if we're gonna make it on time.

22:01.885 --> 22:03.239
What is it?

22:03.405 --> 22:06.239
Nothing. It's a good plan.

22:08.125 --> 22:10.845
You're still worried
about Deb, aren't you?

22:12.245 --> 22:14.999
The doctor said
she's out of danger.

22:15.885 --> 22:18.002
Hey, we can, uh...

22:18.165 --> 22:21.237
We can stick around, you know,
ride out the storm here.

22:21.445 --> 22:23.118
It's not safe with Elway on the hunt.

22:23.325 --> 22:26.875
You need to get out of here,
the faster the better.

22:27.365 --> 22:29.880
Well, I could leave now
and you could meet me there.

22:30.045 --> 22:32.560
I could even take
Harrison with me.

22:34.805 --> 22:37.877
Or I could, um, go alone.

22:38.085 --> 22:40.042
I have no problem
with you taking Harrison.

22:40.205 --> 22:42.765
I'd be happy to know
that he's with you.

22:44.445 --> 22:47.119
It's that I don't wanna
lose you again.

22:47.845 --> 22:50.883
Even if it's just
for a couple of days.

22:56.005 --> 22:58.315
<i>—as well as Cuba
and Grand Cayman Island.</i>

22:58.525 --> 23:01.165
<i>We're staying with you through
the morning and into the night...</i>

23:01.325 --> 23:02.964
Hurry up.

23:03.125 --> 23:05.117
<i>Tropical Storm Laura
is picking up speed...</i>

23:05.325 --> 23:07.123
Almost finished.

23:07.325 --> 23:08.395
One more stitch.

23:08.565 --> 23:11.763
<i>The storm is threatening the coast
sometime in the next few days,</i>

23:11.925 --> 23:13.996
<i>according to
the National Hurricane Centre.</i>

23:14.205 --> 23:16.879
<i>Many local residents are
already preparing for the storm.</i>

23:17.085 --> 23:18.201
<i>As the storm comes in,</i>

23:18.365 --> 23:21.961
<i>it's important that people stay
in their homes and off the highways.</i>

23:22.125 --> 23:24.276
<i>There's going to be a lot of wind
and rain.</i>

23:24.445 --> 23:27.199
<i>It's going to be over the next few...</i>
Please.

23:27.365 --> 23:30.403
Just go.
I won't say anything to anyone.

23:30.565 --> 23:34.878
<i>—for this special report about
one of Miami's finest, Debra Morgan.</i>

23:35.045 --> 23:37.355
That's her.
<i>I'm here at Miami Central Hospital,</i>

23:37.565 --> 23:39.363
<i>where a detective
with Miami Metro</i>

23:39.565 --> 23:42.125
<i>is recovering from surgery
after having been shot.</i>

23:42.285 --> 23:44.880
<i>We have learned that
a deputy marshal died on the scene.</i>

<i>The suspect, Oliver Saxon,
is still at large,</i>

23:47.565 --> 23:50.239
<i>and may have carjacked
a blue pickup truck.</i>

23:50.405 --> 23:52.203
<i>If you have any information about...</i>

23:52.365 --> 23:54.960
Get your car keys.
We're taking a drive.

23:55.165 --> 23:56.679
Can't you just let me go?

23:56.845 --> 23:58.916
Do what I said,

23:59.125 --> 24:01.196
and you won't get hurt.

24:02.285 --> 24:04.800
<i>Mockingbird Bus 24
from Miami to Tallahassee...</i>

24:05.005 --> 24:07.156
All right, keep it moving.
No pushing.

24:07.325 --> 24:09.442
WOMAN
Oh, no, it's okay.

24:13.685 --> 24:15.165
Wait.

24:15.725 --> 24:17.318
Come here.

24:17.485 --> 24:19.761
All right, everyone,
please keep moving the line.

24:19.925 --> 24:23.316
It's Saxon. He's still out there.
I can't leave until he's caught,

24:23.525 --> 24:25.756
until Debra is safe.

24:25.925 --> 24:27.837
I'm sorry.
You need to get back in line.

24:28.005 --> 24:29.724
It's okay. I understand.

24:31.125 --> 24:35.199
Here. Take Harrison.
I'll meet you down there.

24:36.205 --> 24:38.879
You sure?
Yeah. He'll be safer with you.

24:40.365 --> 24:44.917
Take this. It's just water,
snacks. A few essentials.

24:46.765 --> 24:50.475
Call me from the airport as soon as
you know that you made your flight.

24:51.885 --> 24:53.160
I will.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.920
<i>No one will be allowed
to board without a ticket.</i>

24:56.085 --> 24:58.441
Harrison, you're gonna leave
with Hannah.

24:58.645 --> 25:01.797
You're not coming with us?
No, of course I am.

25:01.965 --> 25:04.719
I just forgot a few things
I need to take care of.

25:04.885 --> 25:08.003
As soon as I do,
I'll meet you there, I promise.

25:09.045 --> 25:11.355
I'm gonna miss you.

25:12.805 --> 25:15.081
It's just for a little while.
It'll be fun.

25:15.285 --> 25:19.438
We're all going to this cool place,
and you're gonna get there first, okay?

25:19.605 --> 25:23.076
Now, I want you to mind Hannah.
You do what she says.

25:27.885 --> 25:31.162
You know what, Daddy?
What?

25:32.005 --> 25:34.122
I love Hannah.

25:37.645 --> 25:39.443
So do I.

25:44.285 --> 25:46.117
I'll see you in Buenos Aires.

25:46.765 --> 25:48.040
We'll be waiting.

25:54.485 --> 25:56.602
<i>This is the final boarding call</i>

25:56.765 --> 26:00.122
<i>for Mockingbird Bus 24 to Tallahassee.</i>

26:07.845 --> 26:08.915
Come on, Harrison.

26:24.565 --> 26:27.717
<i>I'll check on Deb,
and then I'll deal with Saxon.</i>

26:39.365 --> 26:40.958
This is the hospital.

26:42.005 --> 26:44.395
I've done everything
you've asked.

26:44.565 --> 26:46.238
I just wanna go home.

26:47.685 --> 26:49.677
So this is it.

26:50.365 --> 26:53.995
I promise,
I won't say a word to anyone.

26:54.165 --> 26:56.043
No, I know.

27:06.165 --> 27:08.521
We need a doctor over here!

27:13.045 --> 27:14.525
Let me get that.

27:18.485 --> 27:20.238
He's choking.
I need a suction canister.

27:20.405 --> 27:21.680
Right away.

27:29.205 --> 27:31.845
- Doctor?
- Jesus.

27:32.045 --> 27:34.605
His tongue, it's been cut out.
Let's get him to the OR.

27:35.165 --> 27:37.964
My God, why would anyone
cut his tongue out?

27:39.965 --> 27:43.959
<i>All eyes on the victim.
The perfect distraction.</i>

27:44.125 --> 27:45.878
<i>Saxon.</i>

27:48.165 --> 27:50.043
<i>In order to conserve power,</i>

27:50.205 --> 27:51.605
<i>the south wing has been closed.</i>

27:51.765 --> 27:53.643
<i>At this time, we ask all visitors</i>

27:53.805 --> 27:56.684
<i>to make their way towards the exit
in the north wing.</i>

27:56.845 --> 28:00.156
<i>All surgical staff are to report
to their current assignments.</i>

28:23.805 --> 28:25.558
Drop it.

28:25.765 --> 28:27.085
Drop it.

28:31.925 --> 28:33.644
We got this, Dex.

28:56.365 --> 28:57.958
Quinn?

28:59.285 --> 29:01.197
Dex, I...

29:01.365 --> 29:04.836
Where's Deb?
I don't know. Something went wrong.

29:05.005 --> 29:09.284
There was a problem,
and they rushed her to the ICU.

29:10.805 --> 29:11.841
What happened?

29:12.605 --> 29:14.642
They're working on her now. Um...

29:14.805 --> 29:16.034
She stopped breathing.

29:28.565 --> 29:32.354
Mr. Morgan, I'm afraid
I don't have good news.

29:32.525 --> 29:35.165
There were complications.

29:36.965 --> 29:39.161
What kind of complications?

29:39.325 --> 29:42.921
We think a clot formed during surgery
that triggered a major stroke.

29:43.085 --> 29:45.759
Debra's brain was deprived
of oxygen for a period of time.

29:45.925 --> 29:48.156
What do you mean?
You said she was gonna be fine.

29:48.325 --> 29:50.601
I had hoped so.

29:50.765 --> 29:52.882
I'm very sorry.

29:56.525 --> 29:57.959
Is she going to recover?

29:58.125 --> 30:00.685
It's possible that
she could breathe on her own,

30:00.845 --> 30:03.485
but she won't be able to eat
without a feeding tube,

30:03.645 --> 30:08.561
and according to the brain scans,
she won't be able to think, reason,

30:08.725 --> 30:11.399
or even know that you're there.

30:12.725 --> 30:16.878
Now, we've intubated her, and
I've lowered her body temperature

30:17.085 --> 30:20.761
so that we can preserve as much
brain function as possible.

30:21.765 --> 30:25.076
You don't know Deb. She'll—
She'll pull through this.

30:25.245 --> 30:28.443
You hear about
miracles all the time.

30:28.605 --> 30:33.600
Well, that's just it, I'm afraid.
It would be a miracle.

30:37.485 --> 30:40.239
I've never seen a miracle.

30:43.445 --> 30:46.802
Hello, Harrison.

30:47.005 --> 30:48.405
Wow.

30:50.165 --> 30:52.202
He's so fucking small.

30:57.605 --> 31:00.757
I'll have to watch what I say
around you, little man. Heh.

31:02.365 --> 31:04.721
Don't you wanna
hold your son?

31:07.525 --> 31:09.039
You won't break him.
Heh.

31:09.205 --> 31:10.844
Okay.

31:17.325 --> 31:19.282
Talk to him.

31:22.645 --> 31:24.876
Hello, Harrison.

31:27.525 --> 31:29.676
See? He knows you.

31:31.805 --> 31:34.718
I don't know how to do this.
Just keep his head up.

31:34.885 --> 31:36.842
No, I mean everything.

31:37.045 --> 31:39.480
How to be a father,
how to take care of him.

31:39.645 --> 31:42.319
You'll be great.
How do you know?

31:42.485 --> 31:44.716
Because you've always
taken care of me.

31:44.925 --> 31:46.200
I have?

31:46.365 --> 31:48.641
Ever since we were little.

31:49.765 --> 31:51.882
Don't you remember
the monsters?

31:53.245 --> 31:54.361
Uh, no.

31:54.525 --> 31:57.996
Every time Mom turned off the lights,
they'd be running all over the walls.

31:58.165 --> 31:59.645
I couldn't fucking go to sleep.

31:59.805 --> 32:02.001
I thought they were gonna
eat me or something.

32:02.165 --> 32:05.442
I don't remember.
They were the shadows.

32:06.605 --> 32:09.165
You came in and explained it
in your dorky little voice.

32:09.365 --> 32:12.517
"Oh, it's just the absence
of light, Deb." Heh.

32:14.165 --> 32:17.522
I don't even know
why I remember that, but I do.

32:18.805 --> 32:24.119
And even then, you stayed in my room
and slept on the floor by my bed.

32:26.245 --> 32:28.396
You made me feel so fucking safe.

32:30.445 --> 32:33.563
You were always taking care of me.
You're gonna be a great father,

32:33.765 --> 32:36.599
because you've always been
a great big brother.

32:36.765 --> 32:38.722
You really believe that?

32:38.885 --> 32:41.081
With all my heart.

32:49.925 --> 32:52.485
<i>You were so wrong, Deb.</i>

33:01.245 --> 33:03.282
Tell me about Argentina.

33:04.765 --> 33:09.157
Well, uh, they have their own
special kind of cowboys.

33:09.325 --> 33:12.796
They're called gauchos.
Maybe you'll get to meet one.

33:12.965 --> 33:15.082
You know what else they have?

33:15.245 --> 33:17.635
Penguins.
I like penguins.

33:17.805 --> 33:19.000
They're not just in a zoo.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.680
They're wild ones,
kind of roaming around

33:21.845 --> 33:26.715
because Argentina is close
to the South Pole,

33:26.885 --> 33:30.720
which is where Santa Claus
has his summer home, and...

33:33.485 --> 33:37.035
And because he's on vacation,
he's always in a good mood,

33:37.245 --> 33:39.999
so he says yes to everything.

33:40.205 --> 33:42.959
Who knew you'd be
so good with kids, huh?

33:43.645 --> 33:45.364
How did you find me?

33:45.525 --> 33:48.040
One of my contacts
finally came through.

33:48.805 --> 33:52.321
Look, let's be civil about this, all right?
No need to upset Harrison.

33:53.605 --> 33:56.245
All right, please take your seats.
We're pulling out now.

33:56.405 --> 33:58.078
Next stop, Daytona.

34:00.365 --> 34:02.596
So this is what's gonna happen.

34:03.165 --> 34:05.805
We're gonna sit here quietly
until we get to Daytona.

34:05.965 --> 34:08.719
Then we're gonna
very calmly get off the bus.

34:08.885 --> 34:11.161
I'm gonna drive us
to the marshals field office,

34:11.365 --> 34:15.405
turn you in and hand Harrison over
to Child Protective Services.

34:16.765 --> 34:22.636
And I'm gonna collect what's turning
out to be a very hard-earned reward.

34:33.245 --> 34:36.875
Dex, we're gonna nail
this asshole to the wall,

34:37.045 --> 34:39.082
I promise you.

34:39.525 --> 34:40.561
For Deb.

34:46.005 --> 34:47.280
Oliver Saxon.

34:47.965 --> 34:52.005
Or would you prefer to be called
by your given name, Daniel Vogel?

34:54.125 --> 34:56.515
You know, there are
several ways we can do this.

34:56.685 --> 34:59.325
Given that we have footage
of you killing other people,

34:59.485 --> 35:02.239
it would be in your best interest
to cooperate.

35:02.405 --> 35:04.317
It's up to my lawyer
how cooperative I am.

35:04.485 --> 35:06.522
Are you sure?
Because if you have any hope

35:06.685 --> 35:08.324
of staying out of the electric chair,

35:08.485 --> 35:10.204
you should
probably start talking.

35:10.365 --> 35:11.594
Just fucking admit it.

35:11.765 --> 35:14.439
You killed Cassie,
you killed Clayton,

35:15.325 --> 35:16.520
and you shot Deb.

35:18.085 --> 35:19.314
How did you hurt your arm?

35:20.525 --> 35:22.721
This? It's just a scratch.

35:23.165 --> 35:24.315
No.

35:26.005 --> 35:27.359
Deb's a good shot.

35:28.605 --> 35:29.641
Who's Deb?

35:31.885 --> 35:32.875
Fuck you!

35:33.045 --> 35:36.038
You fucking shot her!
And you left her there to die!

35:36.205 --> 35:38.720
Just like you killed your mother
and left her to die,

35:38.885 --> 35:40.285
you fucking piece of shit!

35:40.445 --> 35:41.799
Quinn. Out.

35:45.445 --> 35:49.041
I'd like to, uh, speak
to my attorney, please.

35:58.965 --> 36:01.002
You know,
he was right about one thing.

36:02.765 --> 36:05.075
You are a fucking piece of shit.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.681
<i>Batista and Quinn will be able
to make a case against Saxon.</i>

36:10.845 --> 36:16.716
<i>I could leave now for Argentina
and let the state of Florida kill him.</i>

36:17.445 --> 36:20.597
Folks, we will be arriving
at the Daytona station momentarily.

36:20.765 --> 36:23.917
After a short stop,
we will proceed on to Tallahassee.

36:24.085 --> 36:26.600
Anyone making a connection
to Jacksonville

36:26.765 --> 36:30.361
should disembark
and proceed to Boarding Bay 3.

36:30.525 --> 36:31.561
Hey, hey.

36:31.725 --> 36:33.921
I'm just getting some tea.

36:47.045 --> 36:49.719
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you want some?

36:52.925 --> 36:55.838
How stupid do you think I am?

37:00.125 --> 37:01.525
Here's what's gonna happen.

37:01.685 --> 37:05.395
The horse tranquilliser I just gave you
is gonna kick in in eight seconds.

37:05.565 --> 37:08.034
You're gonna fall asleep
and wake up in Tallahassee

37:08.245 --> 37:11.363
with a slight headache,
feeling humiliated and cranky.

37:12.805 --> 37:14.205
Come on, sweetie.

37:15.525 --> 37:17.403
It's time to go. Let's go.

37:17.565 --> 37:19.238
Come on.

37:29.965 --> 37:34.005
Hi. I'm here to do a GSR test
on Oliver Saxon?

37:34.165 --> 37:36.043
Sign in, please.

37:40.845 --> 37:43.519
Would you like an officer with you?
No, I'm good.

37:43.685 --> 37:47.281
Okay. Hit this button if you need us.
Got it.

38:35.405 --> 38:38.318
I wish I could blame you
for everything.

38:39.925 --> 38:42.645
For what you did to my sister.

38:44.365 --> 38:47.085
But I know it's all my fault.

38:51.085 --> 38:52.405
Should have walked away.

38:55.045 --> 38:57.560
You know, what you've actually done
is opened my eyes.

39:00.445 --> 39:02.880
Forced me to look at myself.

39:04.165 --> 39:05.201
And what do you see?

39:07.605 --> 39:10.677
A trail of blood and body parts.

39:13.565 --> 39:15.238
What a pretty picture.

39:20.045 --> 39:24.039
In one sharp moment,
you took away

39:24.205 --> 39:27.118
this foolish dream
that I could have a happy life.

39:29.045 --> 39:31.116
Is that why you're here?

39:31.805 --> 39:32.875
To tell me all this?

39:33.045 --> 39:35.719
No, I'm here to kill you with that pen.

40:15.685 --> 40:18.041
In here.
You all right?

40:22.005 --> 40:24.122
He tried to kill me.

40:52.885 --> 40:54.683
Dexter...

40:55.725 --> 40:56.761
help me out here.

40:56.925 --> 41:00.919
What were you doing with Saxon?
I went in to do a GSR test.

41:01.085 --> 41:04.556
But you don't even work here anymore.
How are we gonna explain this?

41:04.725 --> 41:07.923
I'm officially here
till the end of the week.

41:09.165 --> 41:12.237
Okay, but why would you
personally do this test?

41:12.725 --> 41:14.205
After what he did to Deb—

41:14.365 --> 41:17.961
It's exactly because of what he did
to Deb that I went in there.

41:18.165 --> 41:21.363
I wanted to make sure everything
was handled perfectly, by the book,

41:21.525 --> 41:23.198
no mistakes.

41:26.485 --> 41:29.159
And I wanted to look him in the eye.

41:37.925 --> 41:39.678
Okay.

41:39.845 --> 41:41.199
I get that.

41:42.565 --> 41:44.875
It's obviously self-defence.

41:48.325 --> 41:49.918
Yeah.

41:51.445 --> 41:53.198
We got everything we need.

41:55.645 --> 41:57.318
I'm glad he's dead.

41:57.485 --> 41:59.795
I wish I could have done it myself.

42:07.965 --> 42:09.035
You should go, Dex.

42:09.205 --> 42:11.640
I know that you have
a lot to deal with.

42:14.605 --> 42:16.198
Yes.

42:18.965 --> 42:20.445
Hey.

42:24.165 --> 42:25.997
I'm praying for her.

42:36.525 --> 42:39.165
<i>As much as I may have
pretended otherwise,</i>

42:39.325 --> 42:42.955
<i>for so long, all I wanted
was to be like other people,</i>

42:43.165 --> 42:45.680
<i>to feel what they felt.</i>

42:48.125 --> 42:51.197
<i>But now that I do,
I just want it to stop.</i>

43:26.725 --> 43:29.115
<i>Attention, all staff
and hospital personnel:</i>

43:29.285 --> 43:32.005
<i>The National Hurricane Centre
estimates the current...</i>

43:32.165 --> 43:34.999
Just so you know, patients
in the south wing are being moved.

43:35.165 --> 43:36.963
We have to consolidate
space and power.

43:37.125 --> 43:39.117
<i>—at 150 miles per hour.</i>

43:39.285 --> 43:42.437
<i>It has been elevated to Category 3.</i>

43:42.645 --> 43:46.275
<i>At this time, all staff must report
to their preassigned stations.</i>

44:09.805 --> 44:12.559
I would change everything
if I could.

44:21.925 --> 44:25.157
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

44:39.365 --> 44:41.800
But I can't leave you like this.

44:46.765 --> 44:48.404
I'm your big brother.

46:20.965 --> 46:23.036
I love you, Deb.

48:40.885 --> 48:43.719
<i>Dexter.</i>
Hey, where are you?

48:43.885 --> 48:46.525
At the airport, about to board.
We're gonna make it.

48:46.685 --> 48:48.438
That's great.

48:48.605 --> 48:50.358
<i>Where are you?</i>

48:50.525 --> 48:52.596
I'm still in Miami.

48:52.765 --> 48:54.438
But I'm gonna be leaving soon.

48:54.605 --> 48:56.676
<i>I can't believe
this is actually gonna happen.</i>

48:56.845 --> 48:59.440
<i>Once we get there,
we should start making our way south.</i>

48:59.605 --> 49:01.198
<i>They have 3000 miles of coastline.</i>

49:01.365 --> 49:04.597
We can just keep going
until we find the perfect spot,

49:04.765 --> 49:07.405
or maybe some penguins.

49:07.565 --> 49:08.885
That sounds great.

49:09.045 --> 49:13.164
I am so happy right now, Dex.

49:14.845 --> 49:18.236
Me too.
<i>Do you wanna talk to Harrison?</i>

49:18.725 --> 49:20.079
Please.

49:20.245 --> 49:21.645
<i>Okay, here.</i>

49:24.005 --> 49:26.804
Hi, Daddy.
<i>Hi, Harrison.</i>

49:26.965 --> 49:29.002
I just wanna tell you one last time
that I love you.

49:29.765 --> 49:31.324
I love you too.

49:32.045 --> 49:35.243
I want you to remember that
every single day until I see you again.

49:35.405 --> 49:36.885
Daddy loves you.

49:37.045 --> 49:39.321
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

51:34.645 --> 51:37.558
<i>I destroy everyone I love.</i>

51:38.365 --> 51:42.757
<i>And I can't let that happen to Hannah,
to Harrison.</i>

51:43.845 --> 51:46.917
<i>I have to protect them from me.</i>

52:02.125 --> 52:03.559
<i>Good morning, Miami.</i>

52:03.765 --> 52:06.200
<i>Hurricane Laura has passed.
Everything is going back to normal.</i>

52:06.365 --> 52:08.721
<i>There is no longer any threat.</i>

52:09.045 --> 52:11.879
<i>Hurricane Laura is slowly dissipating
over the Atlantic.</i>

52:12.045 --> 52:14.799
<i>The majority of destruction
is along the harbour.</i>

52:14.965 --> 52:17.685
<i>There have been some reports...
The cleanup has begun</i>

52:17.845 --> 52:19.484
<i>as the city returns to normal,</i>

52:19.645 --> 52:22.638
<i>with Coast Guard teams going
as far north as Daytona Beach...</i>

52:22.805 --> 52:25.400
<i>Cutter 6, go ahead
and turn to your 1 o'clock.</i>

52:25.565 --> 52:27.602
<i>There's something there.
I can't make it out.</i>

52:28.165 --> 52:30.202
<i>We're stopping in five seconds.</i>

52:30.365 --> 52:32.925
<i>- Okay, I think we got a visual.
- Copy that.</i>

52:33.085 --> 52:34.997
<i>Turning northwest.</i>

52:37.685 --> 52:39.085
<i>We've surveyed the wreckage.</i>

52:39.245 --> 52:41.714
<i>There doesn't appear
to be any survivors.</i>

52:41.885 --> 52:43.683
<i>We're heading back.</i>

52:49.005 --> 52:51.474
Batista.
<i>This is the U.S. Coast Guard.</i>

52:51.645 --> 52:54.956
<i>We just wanted to call and report
the wreckage of Dexter Morgan's boat.</i>

52:55.125 --> 52:56.878
Dexter?

53:30.965 --> 53:33.685
Hey, how about we go
get some ice cream, yeah?

53:33.845 --> 53:35.245
Okay.
Yeah. Come on.
