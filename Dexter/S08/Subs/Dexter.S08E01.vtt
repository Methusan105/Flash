<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:11.725 --> 00:13.603
Oh, my God.
Dexter, what the fuck?

00:13.805 --> 00:15.285
Travis was here. He came at me.

00:15.485 --> 00:19.001
When I thought about everything he did,
I wanted him dead, so I killed him.

00:19.245 --> 00:22.397
I have to call this in.
Maybe we should get rid of the body.

00:22.605 --> 00:26.679
Gasoline, fire, it'll erase any trace
that we were ever here.

00:26.925 --> 00:29.076
I never wanted her
to go through this, Dex.

00:29.285 --> 00:30.435
Neither did I.

00:31.285 --> 00:35.359
I found a blood slide exactly like
the ones we found in Doakes' car.

00:35.565 --> 00:37.204
Bad people are still going missing,
and Doakes—

00:37.405 --> 00:39.601
Was the Bay Harbor Butcher,
end of story.

00:39.845 --> 00:41.404
I have to keep my secret safe.

00:41.645 --> 00:45.525
Otherwise my life, her life,
will never be the same.

00:47.565 --> 00:48.840
Are you a serial killer?

00:49.045 --> 00:51.196
I only kill certain kinds of people.
Oh, God.

00:51.445 --> 00:54.916
Are you the Bay Harbor Butcher?
Dad taught me. He gave me a code.

00:55.125 --> 00:56.195
Dad knew?

00:56.405 --> 00:59.637
You're like a magnet.
Bad shit is gonna find you.

00:59.845 --> 01:02.041
Dexter is a blood-spatter analyst

01:02.245 --> 01:04.885
and Doakes always thought
something was off about him.

01:05.125 --> 01:07.082
What if Doakes was on to him?

01:07.525 --> 01:10.359
The Bay Harbor Butcher.
Maria thinks it might be you.

01:10.605 --> 01:11.641
Me?

01:11.965 --> 01:14.400
Hannah McKay.
She stabbed a woman five times.

01:14.605 --> 01:17.439
All I can think about
is giving her what she deserves.

01:17.685 --> 01:18.960
Do what you gotta do.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.601
Dexter...

01:25.805 --> 01:29.082
You're the only person
I don't have to hide anything from.

01:29.285 --> 01:33.199
Maybe you understand me
a little better than I understand myself.

01:33.445 --> 01:36.119
I love you.
It's because she's a serial killer?

01:36.365 --> 01:40.518
If you love me, you'll accept this.
If I love you? I'm in love with you!

01:40.725 --> 01:41.875
Wha—?

01:42.445 --> 01:45.643
Debra's been in a car accident.
You poisoned Debra.

01:45.845 --> 01:48.724
You were supposed to choose me.
She's my sister.

01:48.965 --> 01:50.240
Goodbye, Dexter.

01:50.445 --> 01:52.835
Security footage
from before the fire department

01:53.045 --> 01:54.957
got the call on the burning church.

01:55.125 --> 01:58.323
What were you doing there, lieutenant?
Are we really that fucked?

01:58.525 --> 02:00.756
If all she's got is that DVD,
I can handle this.

02:00.925 --> 02:03.360
LaGuerta's an innocent.
She doesn't even meet the code.

02:03.565 --> 02:04.999
It's the only option.

02:05.165 --> 02:09.159
Hector Estrada. I was three years old
when you murdered my mother.

02:09.365 --> 02:11.038
You're Dickie Moser!

02:11.245 --> 02:12.520
Dexter Moser.

02:13.445 --> 02:16.244
- I have another kill I have to do.
- It's not so easy.

02:16.485 --> 02:18.363
I can't let Deb go down
for what I did.

02:18.565 --> 02:21.160
It's Deb. Whatever you're thinking,
please don't do it.

02:21.365 --> 02:22.401
So, what's the plan?

02:22.605 --> 02:25.200
I use her gun to shoot Estrada
in his puncture wound.

02:25.405 --> 02:27.840
Use Estrada's gun
to shoot LaGuerta.

02:28.085 --> 02:29.678
Deb.
Dexter?

02:30.005 --> 02:34.204
You shouldn't be here.
Why shouldn't I be here?

02:34.405 --> 02:35.634
Shoot him, Debra.

02:36.885 --> 02:40.356
You have to end this. Shoot him.

02:40.565 --> 02:43.125
Stop!
Do it, Debra. Shoot him.

02:45.085 --> 02:46.678
Do it! Shoot him!

02:46.885 --> 02:48.842
This is not who you are.

02:49.285 --> 02:52.005
You're a good person.
You're not like him.

02:53.405 --> 02:54.998
Put him down!

02:55.205 --> 02:57.561
It's true.
Everything she said.

02:57.805 --> 02:58.921
You're a good person.

03:03.565 --> 03:05.158
Do what you gotta do.

<i>There's nothing like a crisis
to help define who you are.</i>

05:38.165 --> 05:41.158
<i>A better person would feel bad
about LaGuerta's death.</i>

05:45.045 --> 05:48.436
<i>But the truth is
it solved all my problems.</i>

05:50.685 --> 05:52.756

06:08.325 --> 06:10.476

<i>made some new friends.</i>

06:29.845 --> 06:31.882
<i>I'm a survivor.</i>

06:35.285 --> 06:37.322
She chose a career
in law enforcement.

06:37.525 --> 06:41.758
And I know for a fact that she
never regretted one day of service.

06:42.245 --> 06:45.044
It's a choice
that none of us take lightly.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.003
Is Aunt Deb gonna be here?

06:47.205 --> 06:50.243
I don't think so, but we'll get together
with her real soon.

06:50.565 --> 06:52.557
Maria was very important to me.

06:52.765 --> 06:55.803
She was a good cop.
She was my boss.

06:56.245 --> 06:57.759
Very briefly my wife.

06:59.765 --> 07:01.996
But mostly she was a friend.

07:04.485 --> 07:06.556
I miss you, Maria.

07:06.725 --> 07:08.239
We all do.

07:18.925 --> 07:20.757
Thank you, Lieutenant Batista.

07:21.125 --> 07:25.995
At this time, we would like to dedicate
this beautiful memorial in her honour.

07:26.885 --> 07:29.275
Ladies and gentlemen,
fellow officers,

07:29.525 --> 07:33.235
I present to you
the Captain Maria LaGuerta bench.

07:41.485 --> 07:43.158
Okay, well, we're off to swim class.

07:43.405 --> 07:45.283
Say goodbye to Daddy.
Bye, Daddy.

07:45.605 --> 07:48.882
See you after work, Harrison.
Okay.

07:51.885 --> 07:54.639
A bench. Why a bench?

07:55.165 --> 07:58.158
She deserves more than a place
where people park their butts.

07:58.365 --> 07:59.481
It's a nice bench.

07:59.685 --> 08:02.644
It's concrete, very sturdy.

08:02.805 --> 08:06.003
You can buy them at the parking lot
at Home Depot.

08:06.165 --> 08:10.000
I'm sorry. Was that insensitive?
No, that's exactly my point.

08:10.205 --> 08:13.596
This all feels so cold.

08:15.165 --> 08:17.600
You're still hurting, I can tell.
All right,

08:17.805 --> 08:20.843
look, first of all, it's weird
when you try to speak Spanish.

08:21.005 --> 08:23.236
Second, don't ever touch me.
It's been six months.

08:23.445 --> 08:25.277
You're having a tough time moving on.

08:25.485 --> 08:27.044
How am I supposed to move on?

08:27.245 --> 08:29.760
My dining room is filled
with boxes of her stuff.

08:30.005 --> 08:32.156
He's right, you know?
It's been six months.

08:32.445 --> 08:37.042
Maybe you should just get rid of it.
And then what? She just disappears?

08:37.325 --> 08:39.920
Hey, Dex, I was kind of hoping
your sister would stop by.

08:40.165 --> 08:41.565
Yeah, how is Deb?

08:41.765 --> 08:45.156
She really wanted to be here,
but she's working long hours.

08:45.365 --> 08:46.799
She's better?

08:47.045 --> 08:48.240
Oh, yeah, she's great.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.720
That's good to know.

08:50.205 --> 08:53.516
Yeah, she took LaGuerta's death
kind of hard,

08:53.725 --> 08:55.876
even though
they didn't seem all that close.

08:56.085 --> 08:58.316
There's no telling
how you're gonna react.

08:58.485 --> 09:01.000
You know,
when Mike Anderson was killed,

09:01.205 --> 09:03.640
I just wanted to get away
from all this.

09:03.845 --> 09:07.077
It took Maria's death
to turn me back.

09:07.485 --> 09:11.445
It made me want to do nothing
but chase bad guys.

09:11.645 --> 09:14.922
I can't tell you how many times
all I wanted to do is what Deb did,

09:15.125 --> 09:17.879
walk out of here at lunch
and never come back.

09:18.085 --> 09:21.965
Yeah, Deb can be impulsive
sometimes.

09:22.165 --> 09:23.565
Tell her to drop by sometime.

09:23.805 --> 09:26.001
Place isn't the same without her.

09:26.525 --> 09:30.405
For a while, I heard from her every
other day, asking for some favour,

09:30.605 --> 09:33.518
but I haven't spoken to her
in a couple weeks now.

09:33.845 --> 09:35.643
Why is that?

09:35.885 --> 09:37.444
She's out of town.

09:37.605 --> 09:39.437
Right. The Keys.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.398
No, Fort Lauderdale.

09:41.645 --> 09:43.284
Right. Fort Lauderdale.

09:43.605 --> 09:45.836
Well, when she gets back,
let's set something up.

09:46.045 --> 09:48.037
It'd be good to see her.
Yeah, it would.

09:48.245 --> 09:50.077
I mean, I'll tell her.

09:58.245 --> 10:00.237
<i>It's Deb. Leave a message.</i>

10:00.445 --> 10:02.323
<i>The user's mailbox is full.</i>

10:02.645 --> 10:05.877
Hey, Vince.
Can you cover for me this morning?

10:06.125 --> 10:08.037
I always do.

10:09.005 --> 10:11.236
<i>Deb's working through this
in her own way.</i>

10:11.405 --> 10:13.965
<i>I just wish
she'd talk to me once in a while.</i>

10:18.165 --> 10:20.043
Ooh-aah.

10:21.365 --> 10:23.925
Supposed to be for both of us.

10:24.085 --> 10:29.479
Mm. I'm sorry.
I guess I got carried away.

10:31.925 --> 10:34.201
You're gonna have to share.

10:46.765 --> 10:49.803
Gotta take this. Business.
Okay.

10:50.485 --> 10:51.680
Yeah.

10:52.325 --> 10:55.204
No, I'm not splitting it up.
All or nothing.

10:55.645 --> 10:58.160
That is my best price.

10:58.325 --> 11:02.239
You've never worked with me before,
but you know it's a fair deal.

11:03.725 --> 11:05.284
It's 11:47 a.m.

11:05.485 --> 11:08.125
You have till tomorrow
at this exact time.

11:08.285 --> 11:11.437
Fucking amateurs.
What happened to your normal guys?

11:11.645 --> 11:13.364
I don't know.
They disappeared on me.

11:13.565 --> 11:16.797
Funny thing, being a fence doesn't
seem to be a long-term occupation.

11:17.445 --> 11:19.596
What about this guy?
Can you trust him?

11:19.845 --> 11:21.199
Can you trust anybody?

11:22.005 --> 11:23.678
Uh-uh.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.163
Maybe if you want,
I can back you up.

11:27.325 --> 11:28.725
I don't want you involved.

11:28.885 --> 11:30.842
Yeah, but I'm really—
Debbie.

11:31.285 --> 11:32.514
I appreciate it...

11:32.685 --> 11:34.756
Ha-ha.
but I got it covered.

11:35.085 --> 11:37.077
Ahh. What do you want to do today?

11:37.285 --> 11:39.402
Preferably something
that involves you in a bikini.

11:39.605 --> 11:41.562
Why don't we rent a boat?

11:41.765 --> 11:45.475
Like a pontoon, little thing,
we could go out, relax on the water.

11:45.725 --> 11:48.524
No, get something fast.
Let's get a speedboat.

11:48.725 --> 11:50.398
We can buzz the cruise ships.

11:50.605 --> 11:53.279
You like causing trouble,
don't you?

11:53.565 --> 11:54.715
I can't help it.

11:59.165 --> 12:01.122
It's funny how these things work,
isn't it?

12:01.325 --> 12:02.918
What do you mean?

12:03.085 --> 12:05.998
Like when I met you, I'd been
in that bar for almost an hour.

12:06.245 --> 12:07.918
I was about to leave.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.923
Then you walked in.
Yeah, I did.

12:10.165 --> 12:13.237
It's funny how something so simple

12:13.445 --> 12:16.279
as you walking in the door
at the exact right moment

12:16.485 --> 12:18.283
can suddenly change everything.

12:19.965 --> 12:21.763
Yeah.

12:46.445 --> 12:48.004
What are you doing here, Dexter?

12:48.245 --> 12:49.759
She could be inside.

12:49.965 --> 12:52.480
You know what she's been
going through. She could've

12:52.645 --> 12:54.398
done something.

12:57.165 --> 12:58.679
Deb.

13:02.325 --> 13:04.282
Deb, you in here?

13:13.925 --> 13:16.076
She's not here, Dexter.

13:16.245 --> 13:18.202
She asked you to leave her alone.

13:18.485 --> 13:19.965
For how long?

13:20.165 --> 13:21.997
I haven't talked to her
in over a month.

13:22.205 --> 13:24.640
I haven't seen her in two months.

13:26.005 --> 13:27.200
She's disappeared.

13:27.405 --> 13:29.556
She's disappeared
from you, Dexter.

13:29.725 --> 13:30.795
And that's her choice.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.477
What is this?

13:33.645 --> 13:35.079
Xanax.

13:35.645 --> 13:36.840
Paxil.

13:37.085 --> 13:38.235
Adderall.

13:38.445 --> 13:41.324
More Xanax.
All from different doctors.

13:42.525 --> 13:43.595
And pot.

13:43.845 --> 13:46.360
Great, she's mixing all this shit.

13:46.525 --> 13:47.959
I have to find her.

13:48.165 --> 13:50.600
Dexter, you're the problem,
not the solution.

13:50.805 --> 13:53.639
The best thing you can do for Debra
is to stay away from her.

13:53.805 --> 13:55.637
I'm the only one
who knows what happened.

13:55.805 --> 13:58.525
I'm the only one who can help her.
She needs me.

14:01.605 --> 14:03.517
<i>It's Deb. Leave a message.</i>

14:03.685 --> 14:05.404
<i>The user's mailbox is full.</i>

14:09.045 --> 14:11.037
I have to find her.

14:24.085 --> 14:25.155
Hi.
Hi.

14:25.325 --> 14:26.361
Can I help you?

14:26.565 --> 14:29.125
Yeah, I'm—
Dexter Morgan.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.516
Elway. Nice place.

14:31.765 --> 14:32.835
Thank you.

14:33.045 --> 14:36.880
Yeah, yeah, it's a big step up from
my robbery desk at Miami Metro, huh?

14:37.325 --> 14:39.442
And it's a good change for Deb
as well.

14:39.605 --> 14:42.803
Very smart of her, making a move
to the private sector, I'll tell you.

14:43.005 --> 14:45.315
She here?
She is not.

14:46.005 --> 14:47.485
You know when she'll be back?

14:47.685 --> 14:49.642
Not a clue.

14:49.965 --> 14:52.400
She's got a big problem
of disappearing on me.

14:52.605 --> 14:54.244
What does that mean?

14:55.005 --> 14:57.315
She don't like to check in
when she's supposed to.

14:57.525 --> 14:59.596
When's the last you heard from her?

15:00.125 --> 15:02.356
Been a couple of weeks,
at least.

15:02.725 --> 15:06.162
And that's normal for her?
Of course not normal. Debra Morgan.

15:06.365 --> 15:09.358
There's no "normal" for her.
That was the deal when I hired her.

15:09.565 --> 15:12.637
She's her own agent, she chooses
the cases she wants to work on,

15:12.845 --> 15:14.837
and she calls in
when she feels like it.

15:15.365 --> 15:17.834
But...
But what?

15:18.765 --> 15:21.325
She's never waited two weeks
to call me back.

15:23.885 --> 15:25.717
What case is she working on?

15:25.925 --> 15:29.043
Some smash-and-grab.
Guy skipped out on bail.

15:29.645 --> 15:33.082
Uh... Name is...

15:33.725 --> 15:35.956
Briggs. Andrew Briggs.

15:36.205 --> 15:38.720
Skip tracing, bounty hunting?
Isn't that beneath her?

15:38.925 --> 15:39.995
Tell me about it.

15:40.205 --> 15:42.845
I try to give her bigger clients,
higher-profile cases,

15:43.085 --> 15:46.044
but she seems to like
the down and dirty stuff.

15:46.205 --> 15:48.640
Your sister's a bit of a thrill seeker.
Really?

15:48.845 --> 15:52.395
Easy money for her. Gets a percentage
of everybody she brings in, so...

15:53.925 --> 15:56.076
Well, what else can you tell me
about the case?

15:56.285 --> 15:58.402
Not much more to it.
Find him, bring him back.

15:58.605 --> 16:00.722
If she brings the jewellery,
she gets a cut.

16:00.885 --> 16:02.558
That's all you know?
Like I said

16:02.725 --> 16:04.239
she's not big on checking in, so...

16:10.325 --> 16:11.520
I gotta go.

16:12.085 --> 16:13.758
If you hear from her, call me,
all right?

16:23.285 --> 16:25.959
<i>Is this how I'm going to find Deb?</i>

16:26.405 --> 16:27.441
<i>Dead and alone?</i>

16:35.525 --> 16:37.835
Are you looking at my ass?
No.

16:38.045 --> 16:40.435
I mean, yes.
What size do you wear?

16:40.685 --> 16:42.244
None of your damn business.

16:42.485 --> 16:46.115
It's just that I have all of Maria's
clothes, and I just thought maybe...

16:46.285 --> 16:47.560
Oh.
Yeah, no, it's—

16:47.725 --> 16:48.795
It's not your style. I get it.

16:49.005 --> 16:51.474
She was a very colourful woman.

16:55.125 --> 16:56.878
Hey, what do we have?

16:57.285 --> 17:01.040
Robert Bailey, 42 years old,
Miami resident.

17:01.205 --> 17:04.323
Killed by a single gunshot wound
to the chest,

17:04.525 --> 17:05.675
right above the heart.

17:05.925 --> 17:09.760
Judging from the stippling
on the wound, it looks like the muzzle

17:10.005 --> 17:12.156
was in contact
with the chest when fired.

17:12.405 --> 17:13.441
Suicide?

17:13.765 --> 17:16.837
No, the victim was killed elsewhere
and dumped here.

17:22.085 --> 17:23.439
Whoa.

17:26.165 --> 17:29.636
Parietal and occipital bone
sliced through.

17:30.605 --> 17:32.562
Back of the cranium removed.

17:32.805 --> 17:34.364
Okay, that's weird.

17:35.605 --> 17:37.005
And...

17:37.605 --> 17:40.165
looks like a piece of it
has been scooped out,

17:40.365 --> 17:42.004
like with a melon baller.

17:42.485 --> 17:44.044
Just got weirder.
We have a gun.

17:45.005 --> 17:47.315
So someone shoots this guy,

17:47.525 --> 17:49.960
cuts his head open,
and messes with his brain.

17:50.245 --> 17:54.603
He takes the body and the weapon
and brings them all the way out here.

17:54.925 --> 17:56.279
Why?

17:57.405 --> 17:58.885
People are crazy.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.684
I think we're done here.

18:01.885 --> 18:04.923
Okay, process the gun
for DNA and prints.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.839
With the rain...
Yeah, do it anyway.

18:08.005 --> 18:09.439
Dexter, follow up on the body.

18:09.645 --> 18:11.204
Will do.

18:24.325 --> 18:26.157
<i>It's Deb. Leave a message.</i>

18:26.365 --> 18:29.119
<i>The user's mailbox is full.</i>

18:30.245 --> 18:32.123
<i>Where the hell are you, Deb?</i>

18:35.565 --> 18:36.999
<i>Andrew Briggs.</i>

18:37.565 --> 18:39.682
<i>The man Deb was looking for.</i>

18:44.125 --> 18:47.562
<i>Clubbed a security guard over the head,
robbed a high-end jewellery store.</i>

18:47.925 --> 18:51.999
<i>Got away with over a half a million
in unrecovered merchandise.</i>

18:52.165 --> 18:55.795
<i>Skipped on his bail,
been on the run ever since.</i>

18:58.285 --> 19:00.117
<i>Arrested three times for assault.</i>

19:00.365 --> 19:02.960
<i>Sent one guy to the hospital
with a broken jaw.</i>

19:04.125 --> 19:05.718
<i>This guy is dangerous.</i>

19:09.245 --> 19:11.635
<i>Did Debra get in over her head?</i>

19:24.045 --> 19:25.320
<i>"Password"?</i>

19:29.725 --> 19:31.045
<i>Nope.</i>

19:34.685 --> 19:35.755
<i>"Fucking password."</i>

19:40.085 --> 19:41.280
<i>Here we go.</i>

19:42.205 --> 19:45.596
<i>All of her charges for three weeks
have been in Fort Lauderdale.</i>

19:45.765 --> 19:49.202
<i>And mostly at El Mercado
on East 4th Street.</i>

19:49.365 --> 19:51.357
<i>She was there yesterday afternoon.</i>

19:51.565 --> 19:53.921
<i>I can be there in half an hour.</i>

20:11.725 --> 20:14.115
<i>That's the guy
she's supposed to bring in.</i>

20:22.725 --> 20:24.398
What kind of tequila you like?

20:24.565 --> 20:26.841
The kind that makes you fall down.

20:27.005 --> 20:28.917
I'll see what I can do.

20:30.765 --> 20:32.165
Hmm.

20:46.365 --> 20:47.879
What the fuck?

20:48.725 --> 20:50.159
Deb, what's going on?

20:51.885 --> 20:54.036
I'm working a case.
You should get the fuck out.

20:54.205 --> 20:56.197
You found your guy.
Why haven't you brought him in?

20:56.405 --> 20:59.523
How do you know what I'm doing?
I talked to Elway.

21:00.645 --> 21:01.965
You talked to Elway?

21:02.165 --> 21:05.044
He said you hadn't checked in.
I was scared something happened.

21:05.285 --> 21:06.799
I'm fine. You should get out.

21:07.005 --> 21:10.681
Deb, you haven't talked to me in weeks.
You haven't returned any of my calls.

21:10.925 --> 21:13.121
You completely missed
LaGuerta's memorial.

21:13.325 --> 21:14.884
Jesus Christ, I wonder why.

21:15.125 --> 21:17.799
And would you please erase
the messages on your phone?

21:18.045 --> 21:19.240
No one has heard from you.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.437
Yeah,
I'm fucking getting close to Briggs

21:21.605 --> 21:24.643
so that I can get the jewellery
before he fences it, all right?

21:24.845 --> 21:26.404
I'm a professional working a case.

21:26.565 --> 21:28.124
Why don't you get out of here
before you ruin it?

21:28.285 --> 21:31.084
You having sex with that guy?
What the fuck?

21:31.965 --> 21:34.355
My life is none of your business.

21:37.605 --> 21:38.959
Go.

21:40.245 --> 21:41.599
No, I'm not leaving.

21:42.005 --> 21:43.724
Fuck you.

21:43.925 --> 21:47.202
Do you wanna know why
I'm not returning your phone calls?

21:47.365 --> 21:49.038
Because I don't wanna talk to you.

21:49.565 --> 21:51.682
And I really don't wanna
fucking see you.

21:51.965 --> 21:54.799
Why?
Why?

21:55.565 --> 21:57.079
Um...

21:57.445 --> 22:01.678
Because you made me compromise
everything about myself I care about.

22:03.725 --> 22:06.081
And I hate you for it.

22:06.565 --> 22:07.681
No, you don't.

22:08.445 --> 22:11.597
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

22:15.805 --> 22:17.762
Who's this guy?

22:20.285 --> 22:21.799
Just some loser.

22:22.205 --> 22:24.037
Is there a problem?

22:26.085 --> 22:27.599
Let's go.

22:37.965 --> 22:41.322
She doesn't hate me.
She's messed up. She doesn't
know what she's doing.

22:41.485 --> 22:42.965
It's none of your business.

22:43.125 --> 22:45.845
She's using this job
as a way to escape.

22:46.965 --> 22:49.924
She can't deal with everything
that's happened. She's lost, Dad.

22:50.125 --> 22:53.357
You've done this to her.
Don't make it worse. Leave her alone.

22:53.605 --> 22:55.597
Motherfucker cut me off.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.997
Dexter, what are you doing?

23:05.445 --> 23:07.038
Hey, what's going on?

23:07.605 --> 23:11.440
You cut me off.
I'm sorry. I didn't—

23:22.645 --> 23:25.285
You lost control out there, Dexter.

23:25.445 --> 23:27.084
He knows what he did.

23:27.285 --> 23:29.163
Go home, son.

23:38.765 --> 23:40.802
Right there...

23:40.965 --> 23:42.319
Oh.

23:42.525 --> 23:43.561
Stop.

23:44.925 --> 23:46.075
Don't stop. Don't stop.

23:47.485 --> 23:48.919
Don't stop.
Jamie, I'm home.

23:49.085 --> 23:51.475
Oh, God— You stopped.
Someone just came in.

23:51.685 --> 23:53.961
It's just Angel.
Yeah, what?

23:54.205 --> 23:55.275
What?

23:55.485 --> 23:58.239
I'm sorry, I can't have sex
with my lieutenant 20 feet away.

23:58.445 --> 23:59.595
I'm not having a problem.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.717
That's because you're
fucking superhuman.

24:01.965 --> 24:03.558
Oh, come on.

24:03.765 --> 24:07.361
Joey, the chance that someone
might find out our little secret...

24:07.565 --> 24:08.885
I know. Not gonna happen.

24:09.085 --> 24:11.475
makes it even more fun.
It's not gonna happen.

24:14.765 --> 24:18.679
Come to my place
tomorrow morning,
we can finish where we left off.

24:18.885 --> 24:20.877
I can't. I have to be
at Dexter's by 7.

24:21.085 --> 24:22.121
What?

24:25.925 --> 24:28.565
Fuck. Mm.
Mm.

24:28.725 --> 24:30.125
Do me a favour?

24:30.365 --> 24:32.641
Distract him so I can
go out the side door, okay?

24:32.845 --> 24:34.279
How am I supposed
to do that?

24:34.485 --> 24:36.841
Throw some fucking
pork rinds on the floor.

24:37.045 --> 24:38.115
You owe me.

24:40.605 --> 24:42.005
Hey.

24:42.205 --> 24:44.003
You're all sweaty.

24:44.365 --> 24:45.765
Uh... Yeah.

24:46.005 --> 24:47.644
It's good that you're working out.

24:47.845 --> 24:50.485
Yeah, just doing a little cardio.

24:52.445 --> 24:54.914
What are you gonna do
with Maria's stuff?

24:55.165 --> 24:58.317
Don't worry. It'll be gone by tomorrow.
Where?

24:58.525 --> 25:01.882
Charity workers are coming in
first thing in the morning.

25:02.045 --> 25:04.002
Feels sad, though.

25:04.245 --> 25:08.637
An entire life
just packed up in a bunch of boxes.

25:10.565 --> 25:12.397
You know, maybe...

25:13.125 --> 25:16.914
you should pick out
some things to keep.

25:17.085 --> 25:20.715
Come on. I think it'll be good.
You're right. You're right. You're right.

25:27.765 --> 25:29.484
Warrants...

25:30.285 --> 25:33.278
to trace Dexter's and Deb's phone.

25:34.765 --> 25:37.360
Right to the end,
she couldn't let it go.

25:38.285 --> 25:41.995
Tracking down Estrada by herself,
that's what got her killed.

25:42.285 --> 25:44.322
Yeah, well,
that's just who she was, Angel.

25:44.565 --> 25:46.682
Yeah.
A cop.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.405
That's who she was.

26:03.405 --> 26:06.239
<i>Deb should be up there
leading this briefing.</i>

26:07.165 --> 26:09.396
<i>I have to find a way
to get through to her.</i>

26:10.405 --> 26:13.318
This doesn't look good.
Who do you think she is?

26:13.685 --> 26:17.201
Methinks a riddle,
wrapped in Dolce & Gabbana
inside a—

26:17.365 --> 26:19.675
Can't you ever talk
like a normal person?

26:19.845 --> 26:23.839
Everyone, your attention, please.
As you can see, we have a guest.

26:24.605 --> 26:26.722
This is Dr. Evelyn Vogel.

26:26.885 --> 26:29.525
She and I first met
when she consulted on a case.

26:29.725 --> 26:31.444
When most of you were
in high school.

26:31.645 --> 26:34.285
Dr. Vogel's been away from Miami
for a number of years

26:34.485 --> 26:36.636
but she's back
and has graciously offered

26:36.845 --> 26:38.802
her expertise
with our recent body dump.

26:39.005 --> 26:41.679
But we're only a day
into our investigation.

26:41.965 --> 26:44.400
I'm not here to step on
anyone's toes, lieutenant.

26:44.605 --> 26:45.675
It's off the books.

26:45.885 --> 26:47.558
Evelyn is a neuropsychiatrist.

26:47.765 --> 26:52.203
She's served as a consultant
on high-profile cases over the years.

26:52.765 --> 26:56.281
And she has written the definitive
textbook on the brains of psychopaths.

26:56.485 --> 26:59.239
That's how I know you.
Your work on profiling is classic.

26:59.445 --> 27:00.595
Thank you.

27:00.845 --> 27:03.838
I wouldn't normally
insert myself into an investigation.

27:04.045 --> 27:05.240
She said "insert herself."

27:05.445 --> 27:07.357
When I read about the body
in the paper,

27:07.605 --> 27:11.679
there was one aspect of this murder
that I found particularly intriguing.

27:11.885 --> 27:14.684
Vince, bring up that x-ray
the M.E. sent over.

27:19.525 --> 27:20.800
Thank you.

27:21.085 --> 27:22.439
You see this part here?

27:22.645 --> 27:25.001
That's the anterior insular cortex,

27:25.245 --> 27:28.477
the portion of the brain
that processes empathy.

27:28.685 --> 27:31.245
And the hallmark of a psychopath is...

27:31.485 --> 27:33.477
<i>They have no empathy.</i>

27:33.645 --> 27:35.443
they have no empathy.

27:36.605 --> 27:38.676
Now, it's possible
this is mere coincidence

27:38.925 --> 27:40.757
but if someone goes
to the trouble

27:40.965 --> 27:43.560
of carefully extracting
a core from the brain,

27:43.805 --> 27:47.242
I think they'll give some thought
to what part of the brain he's taking.

27:47.445 --> 27:48.959
So why do you think
he did this?

27:49.165 --> 27:52.442
It's too early to say, but maybe
he wanted to perform an experiment,

27:52.645 --> 27:54.523
or maybe this was
simply a message.

27:54.685 --> 27:56.244
He wouldn't be the first killer

27:56.445 --> 27:58.562
to attempt to communicate
through a victim.

28:00.525 --> 28:04.041
Who was the victim?
Robert Bailey. Mechanic.

28:04.285 --> 28:06.754
According to his wife,
been missing for nearly a week.

28:06.965 --> 28:10.481
Was the brain drilled into
while the victim was still alive?

28:12.485 --> 28:14.124
Dexter?

28:14.325 --> 28:17.557
The ME indicated
it was done post-mortem.

28:17.725 --> 28:22.163
The preliminary autopsy also showed
bruising on the knuckles and knees,

28:22.325 --> 28:26.239
which could indicate the victim
was held captive in an enclosed space.

28:26.445 --> 28:28.960
There were no contents
in the victim's stomach.

28:29.165 --> 28:30.679
Signs of dehydration.

28:30.885 --> 28:33.923
The victim was missing for five days.

28:34.085 --> 28:38.443
That suggests a pretty elaborate
pre-kill ritual for a serial killer.

28:40.085 --> 28:41.280
This was just one body.

28:41.485 --> 28:45.479
How do you know it's a serial killer?
Oh, I doubt that this is his first kill.

28:45.685 --> 28:47.563
Those are usually more spontaneous.

28:47.765 --> 28:50.724
This was planned ahead of time.
A lot of thought went into it.

28:51.205 --> 28:54.801
I'm thinking we're looking for someone
at least in their 30s.

28:55.045 --> 28:57.002
Intelligent, organised.

28:57.165 --> 28:59.077
Takes great pride in his work.

28:59.285 --> 29:02.437
I think he'd enjoy the fact
that we're talking about him right now.

29:02.645 --> 29:03.999
You think there will be more?

29:04.205 --> 29:06.640
I'd be surprised if there are not.
Any suspects?

29:06.845 --> 29:09.997
No prints on the gun.
It sat in the rain all night.

29:10.205 --> 29:12.674
Same story with the body.
We're still combing for DNA.

29:12.885 --> 29:17.164
Okay, let's widen our interviews with
friends and co-workers of the victim.

29:17.405 --> 29:19.840
We need to find
where he intersected with the killer.

29:20.045 --> 29:22.435
Masuka, when ballistics comes in—
On your desk.

29:22.645 --> 29:23.795
Dexter, stay on the DNA.

29:24.725 --> 29:26.159
Thank you.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.038
Thank you.
Thank you.

29:31.405 --> 29:34.523
I hear the FBI calls her
the Psychopath Whisperer.

29:34.725 --> 29:36.398
How lucky are we
she's on this case?

29:36.605 --> 29:37.925
Yeah.

29:38.125 --> 29:39.241
How lucky.

29:42.285 --> 29:47.599
<i>Dr. Evelyn Vogel, neuropsychiatrist,
lecturer, just published her third book.</i>

29:48.165 --> 29:51.602
<i>And the last person I need
looking in my direction right now.</i>

29:56.445 --> 29:58.038
What do you think?

29:58.325 --> 30:00.157
It's nice, right?

30:01.005 --> 30:02.075
I guess so.

30:02.325 --> 30:04.078
Maria always had it in her office.

30:05.325 --> 30:07.681
I want you to have it
to remember her by.

30:10.605 --> 30:13.279
Oh, thanks. That's nice.

30:15.765 --> 30:18.644
You still haven't forgiven her?
It's complicated.

30:18.845 --> 30:20.757
It's all right. I understand.

30:21.005 --> 30:25.079
But if you can't accept it from Maria,
accept it from me.

30:25.245 --> 30:27.965
It'll make me feel better.

30:28.125 --> 30:32.165
Now, I know things were awkward
between the two of you

30:32.365 --> 30:34.641
before Maria so tragically died.

30:34.845 --> 30:35.915
So tragically died—

30:36.125 --> 30:38.924
She died because
she wouldn't leave things alone.

30:43.365 --> 30:46.517
I don't know why I said that. Sorry.

30:50.965 --> 30:54.515
I hope you
find it in your heart to forgive her.

31:02.685 --> 31:03.914
Yo, Dex-bot.

31:04.125 --> 31:07.004
Vogel wants your presence
in the morgue.

31:08.045 --> 31:09.365
Great.

31:27.005 --> 31:28.325
El Sapo.

31:32.245 --> 31:33.998
Hello, Mr. Toad.

31:36.725 --> 31:38.762
You stay in here.
I'm gonna meet him outside.

31:39.005 --> 31:40.280
Are you selling the stuff?

31:40.485 --> 31:44.399
Well, I don't have it on me,
but I'm gonna give him a little show.

32:04.805 --> 32:07.115
Deb, hey.
Been a while. How are you?

32:07.365 --> 32:09.880
I'm working on a case.
Andrew Briggs.

32:10.365 --> 32:13.039
All business, huh?
I only have a fucking second, okay?

32:13.285 --> 32:15.959
So can you look into someone
named "El Sapo" for me?

32:16.525 --> 32:17.925
Hold on.

32:19.725 --> 32:21.796
<i>Who is he?</i>
He's a fucking fence.

32:22.005 --> 32:24.361
I'll run it by the guys in Robbery
as soon as I get—

32:28.005 --> 32:29.564
You're welcome.

32:30.885 --> 32:33.798
How'd it go?
I'm gonna be rich.

32:42.685 --> 32:43.721
Dr. Vogel?

32:45.405 --> 32:47.078
I got a message
you wanted to see me.

32:47.405 --> 32:50.000
Yes. Thank you for coming.

32:50.165 --> 32:53.317
I was wondering if you'd had any luck
with finding DNA on the body.

32:53.525 --> 32:56.836
No. We found a few hairs,
but they all belong to the victim.

32:57.005 --> 33:00.965
Ah. So the killer
will have to be found
the old-fashioned way.

33:01.205 --> 33:02.924
Boots to the ground.

33:03.125 --> 33:04.479
Yeah, I suppose.

33:05.245 --> 33:06.804
Quinn and Batista having any luck?

33:07.045 --> 33:08.161
Not as far as I know.

33:08.365 --> 33:11.358
The victim led a quiet life.
No enemies.

33:11.565 --> 33:13.875
Serial killers don't have enemies.

33:14.045 --> 33:15.718
Everyone's a potential victim.

33:20.045 --> 33:22.640
Well, if you need anything else,
just pick up the phone.

33:22.845 --> 33:24.325
Anybody at the lab can help you.

33:24.565 --> 33:28.241
I was interested
to have your take on this case.

33:31.325 --> 33:32.645
Me?

33:32.885 --> 33:34.399
Why? I'm the blood guy.

33:36.045 --> 33:37.718
The blood guy.

33:37.925 --> 33:39.279
How did you end up here?

33:40.645 --> 33:42.637
My dad was a cop.

33:42.845 --> 33:44.996
He kind of steered me away
from that.

33:45.205 --> 33:48.164
This seemed like a better fit.

33:48.765 --> 33:51.405
I was drawn to forensics too.

33:51.565 --> 33:53.841
But I chose to focus
on neuroscience.

33:54.045 --> 33:55.764
Psychopaths.

33:56.445 --> 33:58.562
We both chose murder.

33:59.005 --> 34:00.724
Maybe we're both a little crazy.

34:02.565 --> 34:04.124
Maybe.

34:04.805 --> 34:08.879
Mad scientists trained
to look at this as a biological mass.

34:09.085 --> 34:10.838
A body part.

34:11.525 --> 34:15.565
Yet somehow,
from all those firings of neurons,

34:15.765 --> 34:18.234
something intangible emerges.

34:18.445 --> 34:20.323
Emotions.

34:21.405 --> 34:24.364
Trust, morality, love.

34:24.765 --> 34:26.119
Unless you're a psychopath.

34:27.205 --> 34:31.245
But even then,
belief systems emerge.

34:32.245 --> 34:36.558
As with the Bay Harbor Butcher.

34:37.405 --> 34:39.203
What was he like?

34:42.165 --> 34:45.078
Who?
The Bay Harbor Butcher.

34:45.565 --> 34:46.601
James Doakes.

34:47.725 --> 34:52.880
If I'm not mistaken,
he worked with you
here in Miami Metro.

34:54.245 --> 34:57.283
He was angry. Had a short fuse.

34:57.485 --> 34:59.602
Well, that doesn't
sound right to me.

34:59.805 --> 35:02.843
As a psychopath, he would be
disassociated from his feelings,

35:03.045 --> 35:05.560
not quick to anger.
Maybe he wasn't a psychopath.

35:05.765 --> 35:08.644
Oh, yes, the Bay Harbor Butcher
was definitely a psychopath.

35:08.845 --> 35:11.644
He'd have to be
to masquerade the way he did.

35:14.805 --> 35:16.797
But he was an odd one,
that's for sure.

35:20.125 --> 35:21.445
You're the expert.

35:22.285 --> 35:24.436
Just the way he picked his victims,

35:24.685 --> 35:27.883
persons who, on the whole, had
some sort of criminal background

35:28.085 --> 35:29.883
speaks to a strong belief system.

35:30.085 --> 35:35.399
Almost as if he operated
with some sort of moral guidelines.

35:38.725 --> 35:39.795
Guidelines.

35:40.005 --> 35:44.045
Yet clearly it wasn't a moral choice,
as psychopaths have no conscience.

35:44.605 --> 35:46.881
So why else would he kill that way?

35:50.725 --> 35:52.842
So he could

35:53.045 --> 35:55.276
get away with it as long as he did?

35:55.485 --> 35:58.683
People are less likely
to miss criminals when they disappear.

35:58.925 --> 36:01.440
Doakes was Special Ops.
Maybe he picked that up there.

36:01.685 --> 36:03.005
Maybe he did.

36:03.885 --> 36:06.116
Makes an interesting case study.

36:07.085 --> 36:09.281
I wish I could have interviewed him.

36:09.805 --> 36:11.285
Sorry.

36:15.285 --> 36:17.880
I look forward to working with you,
Dexter Morgan.

36:31.805 --> 36:32.795
Yeah?

36:33.005 --> 36:34.598
Oh, Dexter.
Hi.

36:35.165 --> 36:38.078
Come on in. Come on in.
Thanks.

36:38.245 --> 36:41.397
This Evelyn Vogel—
Quite a looker, that one.

36:41.565 --> 36:44.524
Heh. You know her?
Yeah, I know her.

36:44.765 --> 36:47.837
She consulted for us on
a couple cases when
I was a captain.

36:48.165 --> 36:50.122
Last I heard,
she'd moved back to England.

36:50.325 --> 36:53.841
I hadn't talked to her in years.
And she's here now...

36:54.045 --> 36:56.879
Why? Because a killer took
a part of a victim's brain?

36:57.085 --> 37:00.476
She called me up out of the blue, said
she'd moved back about a year ago.

37:00.685 --> 37:03.519
She asked was I free for lunch,
I filled her in on the case,

37:03.725 --> 37:06.524
she offered to help.
Why, is she being a pain in the ass?

37:06.725 --> 37:10.321
No. I'm just trying to figure out
if she's an asset or not.

37:10.525 --> 37:13.757
Oh. Well, she's smart.

37:14.005 --> 37:15.758
So use her to your advantage.

37:16.005 --> 37:17.519
Will do.

37:18.485 --> 37:23.116
Why do you think she called now?
Like you said, out of the blue?

37:23.525 --> 37:25.244
Maybe the stars aligned.

37:25.445 --> 37:28.882
Maybe Mercury is in retrograde. I don't
really care the reason she called.

37:29.085 --> 37:32.761
All I know is this is law enforcement.
You take whatever free help
you can get.

37:32.965 --> 37:36.242
So keep her in the loop, Dexter.

37:37.645 --> 37:39.079
Will do.

37:42.845 --> 37:45.076
<i>What if I'm the reason she's here?</i>

37:46.125 --> 37:50.165
Hey, when you talk to your sister, can
you tell her to check her messages?

37:50.365 --> 37:52.960
She asked me for some help,
and now I can't reach her.

37:53.205 --> 37:54.480
Will do.

37:54.685 --> 37:56.597
Is this about, uh, Briggs?

37:57.325 --> 38:00.682
No, she asked me to look into
this fence named El Sapo.

38:00.925 --> 38:03.076
Nobody in Robbery's heard
of the guy.

38:03.285 --> 38:06.357
All I know is
Briggs robbed the wrong store.

38:06.565 --> 38:07.919
It belonged to some mob guy.

38:08.125 --> 38:12.881
Now nobody's willing to buy what
he's selling except this El Sapo guy.

38:13.165 --> 38:14.360
All right.

38:15.725 --> 38:16.920
<i>El Sapo.</i>

38:17.125 --> 38:18.639
Daddy.

38:18.805 --> 38:20.762
Harrison, hey.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.240
What a nice surprise.

38:22.485 --> 38:25.159
No, not a surprise. We discussed this.
We did?

38:25.845 --> 38:29.316
Dex, you know I love
working for you, but I need
an occasional night off.

38:29.565 --> 38:32.319
Right. We discussed it.
Okay, I've got his dinner in here.

38:32.525 --> 38:35.836
Spaghetti and meatballs,
green beans, chocolate pudding.

38:36.085 --> 38:39.601
Yeah, about tonight, maybe we could—
Harrison, those are Daddy's things.

38:39.805 --> 38:41.842
What's this?
Bye.

38:42.045 --> 38:46.483
It's a very expensive centrifuge.

38:46.725 --> 38:49.445
Come on,
let's get your dinner set up.

38:49.605 --> 38:51.119
Pudding!
After dinner.

38:51.325 --> 38:52.441
Pudding!

39:09.365 --> 39:10.879
Hello?

39:11.845 --> 39:13.040
I thought I made it clear.

39:13.285 --> 39:16.323
You meet me here with the money,
and I take you to the stuff.

39:16.525 --> 39:18.323
Yeah, I'll be alone.

39:19.045 --> 39:21.765
Fucking El Sapo is "El Idiot."

39:21.965 --> 39:24.321
When he comes here,
you keep yourself hidden, okay?

39:24.525 --> 39:25.561
Why?

39:25.805 --> 39:27.683
Because I don't know him.
Might be freaky.

39:27.925 --> 39:30.121
I wanna go with you.
We talked about this.

39:30.285 --> 39:34.882
I'm not doing anything
that might get you hurt.
I'll meet him outside.

39:36.645 --> 39:38.284
You stay in here.

39:42.605 --> 39:44.881
I love this guy.
I love that guy.

39:54.405 --> 39:55.634
<i>El Sapo.</i>

39:55.845 --> 39:58.280
<i>Real name: Javier Guzman.</i>

40:02.605 --> 40:05.165
Harrison, please.

40:06.565 --> 40:10.844
<i>Robbery didn't know the name El Sapo
because he's not a fence.</i>

40:12.285 --> 40:14.277
<i>He's a hit man.</i>

40:18.205 --> 40:19.719
Jesus, Harrison!

40:19.965 --> 40:21.524
Look at what you did!

40:25.405 --> 40:27.874
Uh, I'm sorry.

40:28.085 --> 40:30.316
It's okay. I'm sorry I yelled.

40:30.525 --> 40:32.323
It's okay.

40:32.525 --> 40:34.403
Just give me a second.

40:41.565 --> 40:43.397
<i>It's Deb. Leave a message.</i>

40:43.605 --> 40:46.245
<i>The user's mailbox is full.</i>

40:50.565 --> 40:53.239
Come on. We're going.

40:59.405 --> 41:01.601
<i>If Deb is with Briggs
when El Sapo shows up,</i>

41:01.765 --> 41:02.915
<i>he might take her out as well.</i>

41:04.285 --> 41:06.880
<i>It's Joey Quinn. Thrill me.</i>

41:07.045 --> 41:09.037
Quinn, it's Dexter. Call me.

41:20.925 --> 41:22.564
The fuck!

41:24.125 --> 41:26.082
Yeah! I'm coming!

41:28.445 --> 41:30.004
The fuck?

41:33.005 --> 41:34.644
Hey. You brought the kid.

41:35.485 --> 41:38.000
What's going on?
You didn't answer your phone.

41:38.205 --> 41:42.404
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Well, I need to get ahold of Deb.

41:42.605 --> 41:45.359
And you need me for that, why?

41:46.045 --> 41:47.320
I don't know where she is.

41:47.685 --> 41:50.519
What do you mean, you don't know?
I just don't.

41:50.725 --> 41:54.116
Look, I know she's in Fort Lauderdale.
I need to know where she's staying.

41:54.365 --> 41:56.322
She talks to you.
Do you know where she is?

41:56.525 --> 41:59.802
Yeah, the last she mentioned
she was at this place, the Pink Motel.

42:00.005 --> 42:03.203
Some dump.
Thanks. Come on.

42:05.085 --> 42:07.042
Was that Dexter?

42:07.205 --> 42:08.798
Yeah. He was looking for Deb.

42:09.045 --> 42:10.399
Fucking strange.

42:10.605 --> 42:11.925
Hmm.

42:12.445 --> 42:15.165
I don't want to talk about that.
Come here.

42:16.285 --> 42:17.321
Mm.

42:19.045 --> 42:21.640
Oh, my God. Why is the
whole world against us?

42:21.845 --> 42:23.359
Ignore it.

42:31.285 --> 42:33.402
<i>This is Jamie Batista.
Please leave a message.</i>

42:33.565 --> 42:34.715
Jesus.

42:34.885 --> 42:38.037
Doesn't anybody answer
their fucking phone?

42:38.245 --> 42:42.205
We're going for a drive.
Okay, Daddy.

43:22.525 --> 43:24.482
<i>It's Deb. Leave a message.</i>

43:24.685 --> 43:27.120
<i>The user's mailbox is full.</i>

44:03.205 --> 44:05.640
What the fuck?
I told you to stay away from here.

44:05.845 --> 44:07.484
I know, but you're in danger.

44:07.685 --> 44:09.199
Someone is gonna kill Briggs.

44:09.405 --> 44:10.725
You need to come with me now.

44:10.885 --> 44:14.242
The fuck I do.
Briggs is about to meet his fence.
I'm gonna make a fuckload of money.

44:14.405 --> 44:17.000
That's who's gonna shoot him. I'm
trying to keep you from getting shot too.

44:17.205 --> 44:19.276
That's bullshit.
No, it's not.

44:19.485 --> 44:21.044
El Sapo isn't a fence. He's a hit man.

44:21.205 --> 44:23.117
He's gonna get the jewels
and kill Briggs.

44:23.285 --> 44:25.720
I know you don't wanna see me,
but I had to tell you.

44:25.925 --> 44:28.042
All right, you told me.
It's very dangerous.

44:28.245 --> 44:30.043
I get that.
You need to come with me.

44:30.245 --> 44:32.680
You could die here.
I don't fucking care!

44:33.805 --> 44:35.285
Deb.

44:36.005 --> 44:37.439
What?

44:38.805 --> 44:42.560
What, aren't you the one always saying
that bad people deserve to die?

44:43.085 --> 44:45.520
You're not a bad person.
I killed LaGuerta.

44:45.725 --> 44:47.523
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter?

44:47.725 --> 44:49.956
Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter,
it doesn't matter!

44:50.205 --> 44:52.276
That's not what I meant! Come on!

44:52.485 --> 44:54.841
Deb, it's been months of this.

44:55.085 --> 44:56.724
You can't keep me away forever.

44:58.525 --> 45:00.994
You don't understand anything,
do you?

45:03.365 --> 45:04.515
I wake up every day,

45:04.765 --> 45:08.042
thinking of every bad decision
that I ever made because of you.

45:08.245 --> 45:11.443
And it kills me
that I can't take any of it back.

45:12.965 --> 45:14.001
I'm sorry.

45:14.205 --> 45:16.879
Don't fucking make that face
and say "I'm sorry" to me.

45:19.085 --> 45:22.283
Even if it were fucking true,
it wouldn't make any difference.

45:22.565 --> 45:24.796
Because we can't undo any of it.

45:25.125 --> 45:28.675
So why don't you go back to your little
life and pretend everything's fine

45:28.845 --> 45:32.475
but I can't do that
because I am not fucking like you!

45:34.125 --> 45:35.275
We can talk about this later,

45:35.445 --> 45:37.437
but you need to come—
No, we fucking can't.

45:45.605 --> 45:47.403
You again?

45:51.885 --> 45:55.435
Let's go.
Asshole, get your hands off her.

45:56.165 --> 45:57.315
What the fuck?

46:08.365 --> 46:10.118
What did you do?

46:18.645 --> 46:21.240
I felt okay around him.

46:21.925 --> 46:23.405
You didn't belong with him.

46:23.645 --> 46:26.114
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!
Deb—

46:26.405 --> 46:28.681
Will you fucking go? Will you go?

46:28.885 --> 46:30.285
Please go.

46:30.485 --> 46:31.760
I came here to save you.

46:31.965 --> 46:33.285
No...

46:33.805 --> 46:36.798
Deb, look at yourself. You're lost.

46:37.045 --> 46:39.844
I am not lost.

46:43.125 --> 46:44.639
I know exactly where I am.

46:44.845 --> 46:48.282
I am in some shitty fucking hell,
which is exactly what I deserve.

46:48.485 --> 46:49.965
But you...

46:50.325 --> 46:53.557
You are lost.

46:57.245 --> 46:59.965
All my life, I thought I needed you.

47:00.125 --> 47:03.516
That I couldn't survive without you.
Fuck. Fuck.

47:03.725 --> 47:06.035
It was the other fucking way around.

47:07.245 --> 47:09.441
It was the other way around.

47:11.485 --> 47:14.239
Deb—
Fucking go.

47:15.245 --> 47:17.043
Don't— I'll get rid of the body.

47:17.245 --> 47:20.716
No, don't you fucking do anything,
all right? I'm gonna handle this.

47:21.565 --> 47:24.558
But if El Sapo comes, he's a hit man—
He has no clue who I am.

47:24.765 --> 47:26.882
If he comes and sees—
Would you fucking go?

47:27.085 --> 47:28.758
I'm gonna call this in.

47:29.045 --> 47:31.480
The police?
Yes.

47:34.685 --> 47:36.483
You should go.

47:37.405 --> 47:40.682
I'd like to report
a suspected homicide.

47:42.485 --> 47:44.124
Go.

47:44.725 --> 47:47.240
The Pink Motel in Broward.

47:51.325 --> 47:53.715
Oh, fuck.

48:17.125 --> 48:19.117
Harrison? Harrison?

48:20.405 --> 48:22.556
Harrison! Harrison!

48:24.045 --> 48:25.320
Daddy?

48:27.925 --> 48:30.884
Come here, buddy. Oh.

48:32.005 --> 48:34.042
I couldn't find you.

48:34.725 --> 48:37.035
I'm here, buddy. I'm right here.

48:37.965 --> 48:40.321
Where are we, Daddy?

48:42.325 --> 48:43.964
<i>Lost.</i>

48:47.645 --> 48:50.001
So you work
for Elway Investigations.

48:50.205 --> 48:53.323
Did a skip trace on Briggs,
you went out for a sandwich,

48:53.525 --> 48:56.279
and you found him dead
when you got back.

48:56.445 --> 48:57.640
That's it.

48:57.845 --> 49:00.076
Any idea who
might want to kill him?

49:01.485 --> 49:02.885
No.

49:03.725 --> 49:06.320
We'll call you
if we have any more questions.

49:22.165 --> 49:25.841
Elway, I've got a good news,
bad news situation here.

49:26.085 --> 49:29.601
Briggs is dead, but I think I have a lead
on where the jewellery might be

49:29.765 --> 49:31.996
so we might have a shot
at coming out ahead

49:32.205 --> 49:35.642
but I'm gonna talk to you about it
when I get to the office, okay? Bye.

49:59.285 --> 50:00.844
Mm.

50:10.125 --> 50:13.197
<i>Debra was right. I was wrong.</i>

50:13.405 --> 50:15.317
<i>It's me who's lost.</i>

50:15.965 --> 50:18.878
<i>A better person would let her go.
But I don't know how.</i>

50:24.285 --> 50:28.484
<i>Without her,
I don't know who I am anymore.</i>

50:46.005 --> 50:47.724
Dexter?

50:50.245 --> 50:52.362
This isn't a good time.

50:54.365 --> 50:57.278
I was hoping
to share something with you.

50:57.525 --> 51:00.597
I told you I'm not in the mood
for this.

51:00.765 --> 51:03.883
Well, then maybe I can
just leave this with you.

51:38.645 --> 51:41.160
Dexter, please.
What is it you want?

51:41.325 --> 51:43.635
Please let go.

51:45.645 --> 51:47.876
You can't kill me.

51:49.005 --> 51:50.439
Why?

51:50.645 --> 51:53.797
Because I don't fit Harry's code.
