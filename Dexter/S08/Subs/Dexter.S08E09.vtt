<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:12.085 --> 00:15.044
<i>I should be focused on
who bludgeoned Cassie and why.</i>

00:15.285 --> 00:19.837
<i>But instead, since Hannah came back
into my orbit, she's all I can think about.</i>

00:21.085 --> 00:23.042
Have you seen that kid
around Cassie?

00:23.725 --> 00:25.921
I don't know him. I'm sorry.

00:26.085 --> 00:28.281
Joey, my friend was murdered.

00:28.485 --> 00:31.922
Once I catch the killer, you won't
have to be scared anymore.

00:32.125 --> 00:35.243
If Deb were asking you to stay,
you wouldn't put up a fight.

00:35.445 --> 00:37.516
She'd want to catch
the killer as bad as I do.

00:37.765 --> 00:39.324
Sorry I'm not Deb.

00:39.485 --> 00:42.603
I think Hannah McKay
is back in Miami.
Are you interested?

00:42.765 --> 00:45.155
Very.
What are you doing here?

00:45.365 --> 00:47.163
I came here for her.

00:47.965 --> 00:51.083
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

00:51.325 --> 00:53.794
I don't wanna know. I don't want
to know anything else ever.

00:53.965 --> 00:57.561
She's your problem now.
I can't go to jail, Hannah.

00:58.165 --> 01:02.159
Lose my kids again? I couldn't take it.
We've always stuck together.

01:02.925 --> 01:04.882
That's not gonna change now,
is it?

01:05.765 --> 01:09.156
I found your blood
underneath Cassie's fingernails.

01:09.365 --> 01:11.357
Zach had nothing to do
with Cassie's murder.

01:11.525 --> 01:14.643
How did my blood end up there?
Your plane leaves at 8:00.

01:14.845 --> 01:17.405
Twenty-seven minutes later,
you'll land in Nassau.

01:17.565 --> 01:19.602
From there,
where you go is up to you.

01:19.805 --> 01:23.116
Where do you think you'll go?
I haven't decided.

01:23.325 --> 01:25.078
Argentina?

01:31.125 --> 01:33.276
<i>Every contact leaves a trace.</i>

01:33.565 --> 01:36.956
<i>But the changes,
they're never what we anticipate.</i>

01:37.205 --> 01:41.245
I believe Hannah McKay
was just in Miami under
the alias of Maggie Castner.

01:41.445 --> 01:43.118
Stay with me.

03:50.565 --> 03:53.125
I just want to stay here with you.

03:53.285 --> 03:55.402
I know, but you can't.

03:59.965 --> 04:03.322
Dexter, I'm so sorry about Zach.
I know how much he meant to you.

04:03.725 --> 04:07.765
I need to see Dr. Vogel
and figure out our next move.

04:09.365 --> 04:12.324
You should stay here,
inside, out of view.

04:12.525 --> 04:15.279
I have to see Arlene
this afternoon after her shift.

04:15.525 --> 04:17.960
Why?
It's not safe for me to draw money

04:18.125 --> 04:20.481
out of Maggie Castner's
account anymore.

04:20.645 --> 04:24.924
The only money I have is what I've been
sending away to Arlene to hold for me.

04:25.085 --> 04:29.682
And I'm gonna need that money
to start a new life.

04:31.365 --> 04:33.197
Okay.

04:33.525 --> 04:35.562
"Be careful." I know.

04:40.725 --> 04:43.524
Actually, I was gonna say,
"I love you."

04:46.245 --> 04:48.157
I love you too.

04:54.765 --> 04:56.199
Poor child.

04:57.245 --> 05:00.079
I'm gonna have to find a way
to let the family know.

05:01.005 --> 05:05.124
Just give me a little time
before Miami Metro
gets brought in.

05:05.325 --> 05:06.725
I will.

05:07.725 --> 05:11.321
This is the song that was playing
when I found Zach's body.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.758
[MAMA CASS ELLIOT'S "MAKE YOUR
OWN KIND OF MUSIC" PLAYING

05:17.005 --> 05:18.598
Do you know it?
Of course.

05:18.765 --> 05:21.439
I used to play it all the time.
Still do.

05:21.925 --> 05:26.124
Does it mean anything?
It was just a pleasant song.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.561
Possibly my patients
heard me playing it.

05:28.805 --> 05:30.239
<i>♪ They may try and tell ya ♪♪</i>

05:35.005 --> 05:37.804
There are some signs of a struggle.

05:40.365 --> 05:43.722
They fought here.
This table is out of place.

05:44.965 --> 05:48.561
But whoever did this cleaned up
after himself. There's no blood.

05:50.445 --> 05:52.960
I wish I could understand
what this is all about.

05:53.325 --> 05:55.078
Why he's doing this.

05:55.525 --> 05:57.994
I mean, it's clearly not simply
to frighten me.

05:58.165 --> 06:00.475
He's trying to send a message.
But what is it?

06:00.645 --> 06:02.955
I don't care what his message is.
He killed Zach.

06:03.125 --> 06:05.515
He broke into my apartment
and dumped his body there.

06:05.685 --> 06:07.722
What if Harrison
had been home?

06:07.885 --> 06:11.242
I will find who did this,
and I will kill him.

06:11.445 --> 06:13.323
I'm sure you will, Dexter.

06:13.725 --> 06:15.842
But you need to remain focused.

06:16.965 --> 06:18.558
I am focused.

06:25.165 --> 06:28.237
Blood. He missed it.

06:28.405 --> 06:32.957
And a few hairs pulled out
by the roots.

06:34.845 --> 06:39.124
There's a big fingerprint
in the middle of it all.

06:39.285 --> 06:41.402
Zach's, most likely.

06:41.725 --> 06:45.162
Almost like
it was put there deliberately.

06:46.845 --> 06:48.837
Zach learned from me.

06:49.325 --> 06:53.160
He knew the importance of DNA. It's
possible that he ripped these hairs

06:53.325 --> 06:56.602
from whoever attacked him
and stuck them there for me to find.

06:56.805 --> 06:59.877
If this is a clue, as you said,

07:00.045 --> 07:04.483
then Zach acted with
extraordinary calm, rational thought.

07:05.205 --> 07:06.241
Yes.

07:07.965 --> 07:10.799
Something I'm not sure
you're doing right now,
Dexter.

07:10.965 --> 07:14.754
What?
Your desire to avenge Zach's death,

07:15.565 --> 07:17.284
that's an emotional response,

07:18.085 --> 07:21.965
possibly fuelled by having
to say goodbye to Hannah.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.681
I didn't say goodbye to her.

07:24.885 --> 07:26.717
How do you mean?

07:26.925 --> 07:29.156
We're going to make a life together.

07:30.245 --> 07:31.918
Dexter, how?

07:32.525 --> 07:35.120
I don't know. We'll figure it out.

07:40.365 --> 07:42.322
Over the time I've spent with you,

07:42.525 --> 07:44.721
I've come to realise
that you're not

07:44.885 --> 07:47.605
the perfect psychopath
I thought you were.

07:49.365 --> 07:52.517
You have a depth of emotion
I never thought possible.

07:55.205 --> 07:56.639
It's true.

07:57.085 --> 08:00.715
I'll find the Brain Surgeon
and I'll kill him.

08:01.525 --> 08:05.519
But once I do, I'm gonna focus
on a life with Hannah.

08:09.005 --> 08:11.395
I think you misunderstood my point.

08:11.605 --> 08:15.281
Straddling two worlds as you are,
it's dangerous.

08:15.485 --> 08:18.683
Killers cannot have
a full emotional life.

08:19.445 --> 08:21.835
I think you underestimate me.

08:28.485 --> 08:31.683
So this is Maggie Castner's
passport photo.

08:32.365 --> 08:34.834
That's Hannah McKay's.
I won't ask how you got those.

08:35.005 --> 08:36.724
Good. Please don't.

08:36.925 --> 08:38.757
They look pretty much
the same.

08:38.965 --> 08:41.161
Have you had contact?
I have not.

08:41.325 --> 08:45.114
Her boat left for St. Kitt's yesterday,
but I don't think she was on it.

08:45.285 --> 08:48.995
What makes you think that?
Just a hunch.

08:49.165 --> 08:50.997
A lot of good that does me.
Her husband?

08:51.165 --> 08:54.124
Supposedly in New York City,
but no record of his jet landing

08:54.285 --> 08:58.916
or taking off from here. Don't know.
All right, then. I'll look into this.

08:59.085 --> 09:03.125
There's one more thing.
I'd actually like to be
a part of the team on this.

09:03.325 --> 09:07.285
Heh. Thanks, but the marshal service
doesn't take on partners.

09:07.525 --> 09:09.357
I understand—
If I do find her,

09:09.525 --> 09:11.403
you'll get your reward money.

09:13.685 --> 09:15.802
Fair enough.
All right.

09:20.285 --> 09:21.765
Deb.

09:22.125 --> 09:23.525
Hey.

09:27.245 --> 09:30.443
I saw you from my car
and I had this moment

09:30.605 --> 09:32.642
where it was just like old times.

09:33.445 --> 09:35.402
Tell me you're here to see me.

09:36.125 --> 09:37.844
Quinn, actually.

09:38.005 --> 09:39.758
I meant what I said the other day.

09:40.085 --> 09:43.681
We'd love you to come back with us.
I don't think Matthews would go for it.

09:43.845 --> 09:47.043
He was pissed that I left so abruptly.
You never know, Deb.

09:48.205 --> 09:50.083
I'll leave you two be.

09:52.605 --> 09:55.996
Thanks for coming.
I need to ask you for a favour.

09:56.165 --> 09:59.203
Yeah. Anything.
I think I know who Cassie's killer is,

09:59.365 --> 10:02.802
but Matthews asked me to lay off.
The guy's from this rich family.

10:02.965 --> 10:06.197
Could you look into him for me?
Sure. This all you have?

10:06.365 --> 10:08.357
Yup. His info.

10:08.965 --> 10:12.242
Social, address,
his name's Zach Hamilton.

10:13.645 --> 10:15.602
Kid's a serial killer
in the making.

10:15.805 --> 10:18.240
I think Cassie's
the second person he killed.

10:19.805 --> 10:22.001
Yeah, I'll get right on it.

10:22.965 --> 10:24.638
I'm gonna go say hello to Dexter.

10:28.325 --> 10:32.524
<i>The sooner I can identify Zach's killer,
the sooner I can be done with all this</i>

10:32.685 --> 10:34.085
<i>and get back to Hannah.</i>

10:38.365 --> 10:41.403
You can't go in there. Sorry.
Who the fuck are you?

10:41.605 --> 10:43.198
Hey, hey, hold it.

10:43.365 --> 10:46.563
Deb, uh,
this is my daughter, Niki.

10:46.765 --> 10:50.076
Niki, this is former lieutenant
Debra Morgan.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.881
Oh, shit. Sorry.

10:53.085 --> 10:56.078
My dad says you're a total rock star.
Why'd you leave?

10:56.965 --> 10:59.036
She's a curious one.

10:59.205 --> 11:02.277
Let's go see some files over here.
Nice to meet you!

11:07.165 --> 11:09.760
What the fuck are you doing
with Zach Hamilton?

11:10.005 --> 11:12.645
Quinn called.
He thinks Zach killed Cassie.

11:16.365 --> 11:19.324
I thought so too,
but I checked it out.

11:19.885 --> 11:21.399
Zach didn't.

11:22.005 --> 11:24.725
What was Zach doing
with you and Hannah in the Keys?

11:25.925 --> 11:28.394
Serial killers convention?

11:29.325 --> 11:31.556
I was helping Dr. Vogel out.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.765
I don't know why I even
ask you these questions.

11:39.085 --> 11:41.077
No one else knows.

11:43.085 --> 11:44.997
Zach's dead.

11:49.645 --> 11:51.637
Now I know.

11:53.205 --> 11:56.642
I don't want to know, because now
I have to explain how I know.

11:56.845 --> 11:58.598
Kind of, yes.

11:59.765 --> 12:02.280
I was thinking
about coming back here.

12:03.525 --> 12:07.314
About being a detective again,
doing something good for a change.

12:10.165 --> 12:11.485
But...

12:12.045 --> 12:15.277
It'll just lead me into another
fucked up situation, won't it?

12:33.045 --> 12:35.162
<i>A familial match...</i>

12:36.725 --> 12:39.081
<i>to Dr. Evelyn Vogel?</i>

12:42.365 --> 12:45.722
What?
The hairs we found in Zach's studio.

12:45.885 --> 12:49.276
I ran a mitochondrial DNA match on
them. It tests a person's mother line.

12:49.445 --> 12:53.121
Yeah, I'm aware of those tests.
Well, it's a direct match to you.

12:54.765 --> 12:56.563
Zach's killer is related to you.

12:56.765 --> 12:59.837
The Brain Surgeon is related to you.

13:00.645 --> 13:02.921
How is that possible?
I have no family.

13:04.725 --> 13:07.445
Well, not anymore.
Anymore.

13:07.685 --> 13:10.200
Well, I was married
and I had two sons.

13:10.885 --> 13:13.036
Daniel and Richard.
And now?

13:13.605 --> 13:16.484
They're gone.
What happened to them?

13:19.805 --> 13:23.003
One day, I found Richard,
he was my youngest,

13:23.325 --> 13:25.760
at the bottom
of our swimming pool, dead.

13:25.965 --> 13:27.957
At first I thought it was
an accident.

13:28.165 --> 13:29.884
He wasn't a strong swimmer.

13:30.045 --> 13:32.276
But then I realised the truth.

13:32.485 --> 13:35.364
My older son, Daniel...

13:36.725 --> 13:38.159
he...

13:39.485 --> 13:42.523
He killed Richard.
Yes.

13:43.365 --> 13:46.358
Daniel was—
Daniel was highly intelligent.

13:47.245 --> 13:50.124
But he was also very troubled.

13:51.285 --> 13:53.880
No, it was much more than that.

13:54.725 --> 13:57.115
He was devoid of empathy,

13:57.685 --> 14:01.395
had a complete lack of fear
or the sense of right and wrong.

14:04.005 --> 14:05.997
He was a psychopath.

14:06.245 --> 14:09.158
Realising this and wanting to...

14:10.045 --> 14:12.605
find a way to help Daniel
led me into this field.

14:22.285 --> 14:24.595
I failed Daniel. I...

14:25.045 --> 14:27.640
I was never able to treat him.

14:28.925 --> 14:31.838
Maybe that's one reason
I was so determined to help you.

14:33.925 --> 14:35.518
This is Daniel.

14:35.725 --> 14:39.002
My husband and I covered up
his involvement in Richard's death.

14:39.165 --> 14:41.555
Said it was an accident

14:42.245 --> 14:45.556
and then we put Daniel
into a mental health institute.

14:45.725 --> 14:47.444
He was only 14.

14:48.245 --> 14:49.918
Here in Miami?
No.

14:50.085 --> 14:51.997
No, I sent him back to England.

14:54.005 --> 14:56.122
Three years later, he was dead.

14:57.485 --> 14:58.885
How?

14:59.165 --> 15:02.602
A fire broke out in the wing
where Daniel was living.

15:02.765 --> 15:06.520
Some idiot nurse had left
the door locked to take
a coffee break.

15:07.125 --> 15:08.718
The children couldn't get out.

15:08.885 --> 15:10.285
Seven of them perished.

15:10.485 --> 15:12.636
One of them was Daniel.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.964
Did you see the body?

15:15.445 --> 15:18.085
No. My husband did.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.677
He was horribly burned.

15:22.725 --> 15:24.603
If it was his body.

15:24.805 --> 15:28.355
That's preposterous, Dexter.
He can't be alive.

15:28.565 --> 15:32.241
You said yourself
he's highly intelligent.
Could've faked his death.

15:32.405 --> 15:34.317
But after all these years,

15:34.525 --> 15:37.324
why would he do
these terrible things now?

15:37.965 --> 15:39.797
The brain cores.

15:40.765 --> 15:43.325
Do they mean anything to you?

15:44.245 --> 15:45.884
Well...

15:46.525 --> 15:49.245
Well, even as a child, Daniel was

15:50.045 --> 15:53.880
aware that he lacked empathy

15:54.645 --> 15:57.160
and how I felt about it.

15:58.005 --> 16:01.203
It's possible he boxed some up...

16:02.645 --> 16:04.398
and left it at my door.

16:16.485 --> 16:19.125
<i>Daniel Vogel would be in his mid-40s.</i>

16:31.485 --> 16:34.159
Anybody. Nobody.

16:47.685 --> 16:51.565
<i>That guy Cassie was dating.
He was interviewed that night.</i>

16:57.685 --> 16:59.244
<i>Oliver Saxon.</i>

17:10.085 --> 17:12.919
<i>Is it possible this is Vogel's son?</i>

17:22.965 --> 17:26.481
<i>Daniel Vogel is Oliver Saxon.</i>

17:26.685 --> 17:30.042
You created half a dozen fake IDs.
He could've done the same.

17:30.245 --> 17:35.036
The easiest way is to assume
the identity of a dead person.

17:37.605 --> 17:40.245
Oliver Saxon,
death certificate.

17:40.445 --> 17:43.836
The guy's a fake. Doesn't mean
he's your brain surgeon.

17:44.085 --> 17:46.839
I need to get a DNA sample
from him.

17:49.365 --> 17:53.644
Dexter, this is
Deputy Marshal Clayton.

17:53.845 --> 17:57.282
He's here on a tip that
Hannah McKay is back in Miami.

17:58.005 --> 18:01.521
Uh, sorry if I don't
seem glad to meet you,
this is kind of a shock.

18:01.725 --> 18:03.603
I guess you haven't talked to her.

18:03.805 --> 18:06.957
Why would I?
I told him that you dated Hannah

18:07.165 --> 18:10.078
before you turned her in
for the Sal Price murders.

18:10.285 --> 18:13.005
Wasn't the smoothest breakup.
I guess not.

18:13.165 --> 18:14.679
And that makes you a target.

18:16.365 --> 18:19.244
Frankly, the Hannah McKay I knew

18:19.845 --> 18:22.405
would be too smart to risk
coming back to Miami.

18:22.565 --> 18:26.161
Could be. Look, I got no
definite information she's here.

18:26.325 --> 18:29.602
I'm just following up on a tip.
But until we know for sure,

18:29.765 --> 18:32.439
we should put unis
on you till this plays out.

18:32.605 --> 18:35.598
<i>That's the last thing I need
trying to help Hannah hide.</i>

18:35.805 --> 18:39.958
<i>On the other hand, the Brain Surgeon's
still out there. He knows where I live.</i>

18:40.125 --> 18:41.923
I don't need unis to watch me,

18:42.085 --> 18:44.805
just my apartment
and my son when he goes to school.

18:44.965 --> 18:47.321
Don't worry,
we'll watch Harrison like a hawk.

18:47.525 --> 18:52.395
Deputy Marshal Clayton,
how do you plan to find Hannah
even if she is here?

18:52.605 --> 18:56.076
Getting her picture out
with local media, asking anyone
to call if they spot her.

18:56.285 --> 18:57.685
Okay.

18:57.845 --> 19:02.078
But if by some chance she decides
you two need to talk things over,

19:02.805 --> 19:04.797
be sure and give me a call,
won't you?

19:04.965 --> 19:07.799
Of course. I want her behind bars
as much as you do.

19:08.045 --> 19:09.798
Okay.

19:16.845 --> 19:19.360
This is exactly
what Vogel warned you about.

19:19.525 --> 19:21.596
Trying to straddle both worlds.

19:21.805 --> 19:24.718
You should be following up
on Saxon right now.

19:25.085 --> 19:28.044
Let Hannah handle her own problems.
I can do both.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.082
Hey.
<i>Have you gone to see Arlene yet?</i>

19:36.245 --> 19:37.838
No, I was just about to leave.

19:38.045 --> 19:40.605
Don't. I just had
a federal marshal in my office.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.923
<i>They know you're here.</i>
Oh, God.

19:44.165 --> 19:46.316
You can't go to Arlene's. Lay low.

19:46.525 --> 19:48.801
I can't start a new life
without that money.

19:49.005 --> 19:51.679
<i>I can give you money.</i>
Half a million dollars?

19:53.805 --> 19:55.285
Well, no.

19:57.005 --> 19:59.440
I'll drive you.
I'm not letting you go by yourself.

19:59.645 --> 20:01.079
Okay, but hurry.

20:13.045 --> 20:16.721
This marshal changes everything.
We can never be together here.

20:16.925 --> 20:18.484
I know.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.199
What are we gonna do?

20:20.445 --> 20:22.402
Let's get your money,
figure it out later.

20:27.525 --> 20:31.519
You were right, the hotel manager
in Key West positively ID'd Zach.

20:31.685 --> 20:35.076
He was down there
when she was killed. Where do
you get your information?

20:35.765 --> 20:37.916
I have my sources.

20:38.245 --> 20:41.602
Wish I had your sources.
Thought I had this one nailed.

20:42.365 --> 20:45.676
Well, you're at square one. You've
been there before. You'll close it.

20:45.845 --> 20:49.361
Just after the whole
sergeant dick dance, you know,

20:49.565 --> 20:52.034
I got something to prove.
You're a good cop.

20:52.245 --> 20:53.918
You don't have to prove anything.

20:55.085 --> 20:59.204
Then there's Jamie, you know,
I'd kind of like to solve it for her.

20:59.965 --> 21:02.844
She was really close to Cassie.
Yeah.

21:03.045 --> 21:05.276
I just haven't
been there for her lately.

21:05.485 --> 21:09.764
I thought she moved in.
I mean, like, emotionally.

21:09.925 --> 21:13.043
Heh. Since when are you Mr. Sensitive?
Fuck you.

21:14.445 --> 21:16.118
It pours right out of you.

21:18.005 --> 21:23.034
You know, she's always accusing me
of comparing you to her.

21:23.485 --> 21:25.522
Oh. Um...

21:27.365 --> 21:30.085
Well, I mean, I can't really
advise you on that.

21:30.725 --> 21:32.762
Puts me in an awkward position.
Why?

21:32.965 --> 21:37.005
Because of our history, asshole.
I mean, history is history, right?

21:40.165 --> 21:42.680
Jamie knew Cassie
better than anyone.

21:43.205 --> 21:45.674
Question her again
Maybe something'll turn up.

21:45.845 --> 21:50.556
She's been a wreck, it's hard walking
the line between boyfriend and cop.

21:50.805 --> 21:52.239
I'll talk to her.

21:52.445 --> 21:55.279
Really?
Yeah. Be fun to play cop again.

21:55.485 --> 21:57.078
That'd be great. Thanks.

21:57.285 --> 22:00.676
You can buy me lunch.
And two fucking desserts.

22:13.125 --> 22:15.515
Nice place.
Found that when you're a fugitive,

22:15.685 --> 22:19.235
asking somebody to hold half
a million dollars, incentives help.

22:19.445 --> 22:20.845
So Arlene gets a cut?

22:21.045 --> 22:23.685
She gets what she needs
to keep the kids off welfare,
I get—

22:23.885 --> 22:26.002
The bank of Arlene.
Exactly.

22:26.445 --> 22:28.357
Hey, babe.
Hey, Arlene.

22:29.605 --> 22:30.755
Huh.

22:30.965 --> 22:34.083
You're the asshole who turned her in.
That would be me.

22:34.245 --> 22:35.645
Long story.

22:36.445 --> 22:38.198
Can we come in?
Yeah.

22:41.725 --> 22:44.194
So now we're
back together, huh?

22:44.405 --> 22:46.158
How's that gonna work out?

22:47.245 --> 22:48.759
We're figuring it out.

22:49.245 --> 22:52.761
I told the kids
there's snakes in here
so they wouldn't go near it.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.559
There you go.

22:56.885 --> 22:58.478
Ah, shit.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.924
Who's that?
Federal marshal.

23:02.605 --> 23:04.722
Stay here. I'll handle this.

23:04.885 --> 23:06.797
You answer the door.
Come with me.

23:11.205 --> 23:13.003
Like you've got nothing
to hide.

23:24.285 --> 23:26.163
Can I help you?
I'm Deputy Marshal Clayton.

23:26.365 --> 23:28.402
You mind if I ask you
a few questions?

23:28.845 --> 23:31.679
- Uh, Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:34.485 --> 23:36.078
Dexter Morgan.

23:37.165 --> 23:38.724
What are you doing here?

23:39.485 --> 23:42.956
Arlene's a friend.
We met through Hannah.

23:43.805 --> 23:45.717
Really now?
Yeah, I stopped by

23:45.925 --> 23:48.645
to tell her what you said,
Hannah might be in Miami.

23:49.045 --> 23:51.719
Yeah, I gotta keep
an extra eye on the kids.

23:53.885 --> 23:56.241
Looks like you recently
changed your address.

23:56.405 --> 23:59.318
Seems like a step up.
Better school district.

23:59.685 --> 24:02.598
Says here you work part-time
waiting tables at Denny's.

24:02.765 --> 24:05.405
That's right.
That won't buy you a doll's house,

24:05.565 --> 24:07.796
let alone pay rent on this.

24:07.965 --> 24:10.355
You sure
you haven't gotten help
from Hannah McKay,

24:10.525 --> 24:14.075
who just happened
to have married a man worth
over half a billion dollars?

24:14.245 --> 24:17.636
Didn't even know she was married.
Says here you got a record.

24:17.805 --> 24:20.001
Do you have any idea
how many years

24:20.205 --> 24:23.881
aiding and abetting a fugitive buys?
I'm the one who's been...

24:26.765 --> 24:28.597
helping out Arlene.

24:31.325 --> 24:34.477
Heh. Now I see what you two
really bonded over.

24:36.205 --> 24:37.639
You sure can pick them.

24:38.965 --> 24:40.399
Listen, do me a favour.

24:40.565 --> 24:43.399
Either of you hear from
your old friend, Hannah McKay,

24:43.565 --> 24:45.363
you give me a call.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.005
Of course.
Yeah, we will.

25:03.725 --> 25:06.604
Hey, Deb. Dexter's not here.
I know, I was driving by.

25:06.765 --> 25:08.757
Wanted to say hello
to the little man.

25:09.205 --> 25:11.356
Oh.
Look, Aunt Deb, I can write my name.

25:11.525 --> 25:12.925
That's awesome.

25:16.645 --> 25:19.717
I am so sorry about Cassie.

25:20.485 --> 25:23.125
You doing okay working here
and everything?

25:23.805 --> 25:26.559
Honestly, no. Not really.

25:27.045 --> 25:29.435
The cops are watching
the place, which helps.

25:29.605 --> 25:31.244
She have a lot of friends?

25:31.645 --> 25:34.035
Yeah. She's pretty popular.

25:35.245 --> 25:39.034
Everyone's just in shock,
you know? Especially Oliver.

25:39.405 --> 25:42.364
Who's that?
This guy Cassie was dating.

25:44.365 --> 25:46.163
Were they dating for a long time?

25:46.325 --> 25:48.396
Just a couple weeks.

25:48.605 --> 25:51.484
I guess it was love at first sight.
At least for him.

25:52.125 --> 25:54.435
What do you mean "for him"?
Between us,

25:54.605 --> 25:57.200
I think Cassie was gonna
break it off with Oliver.

25:57.365 --> 26:00.199
Then he was all,
"Let's go to the Bahamas for a week."

26:00.365 --> 26:03.642
After two weeks of dating?
He kept pushing her into it.

26:03.805 --> 26:07.594
He wouldn't take "no" for an answer.
You weren't a fan, I take it.

26:07.765 --> 26:09.802
I thought he could be
a little clingy.

26:10.325 --> 26:12.442
But he was great to Cassie.

26:13.805 --> 26:17.162
Hey, we should all have someone
who worships us like that, right?

26:18.085 --> 26:19.519
Hm.

26:20.565 --> 26:22.921
When was the trip
supposed to happen?

26:24.045 --> 26:25.445
This week, I think.

26:28.805 --> 26:30.205
Hey.

26:32.565 --> 26:36.479
Quinn, it's me. I just talked
to Jamie. We need
to revisit the boyfriend.

26:36.645 --> 26:38.443
Oliver Saxon.

26:42.845 --> 26:45.314
So you think Clayton
bought your little story?

26:45.485 --> 26:46.885
I'm not sure.

26:47.085 --> 26:51.318
Either way, he's got your
photo all over Miami.
It's not safe to go to the hotel.

26:51.485 --> 26:54.284
You need something private.
Yeah, but where?

26:54.805 --> 26:56.922
I do know of one place.

26:57.525 --> 26:59.801
Something tells me it's
the last place I'll want to go.

27:00.005 --> 27:02.042
Debra's, if I can talk her into it.

27:03.765 --> 27:05.279
I was right.

27:05.605 --> 27:08.074
I can't think of a better option,
can you?

27:08.365 --> 27:10.641
Unfortunately, I can't.

27:18.405 --> 27:22.399
Answering more questions?
Anything I can do to help find

27:22.565 --> 27:25.080
who did this to Cassie.
This must be hard on you.

27:25.245 --> 27:27.760
The last few days
have been a nightmare.

27:27.925 --> 27:29.996
I still can't even believe it.

27:31.005 --> 27:33.804
I just wish I had time to breathe,
I'm so busy at work.

27:34.005 --> 27:36.998
I'm already late for an appointment.
Won't take long.

27:37.165 --> 27:40.044
What is it you do, exactly?
Building inspections.

27:40.205 --> 27:42.765
Where you were when Cassie died?
Yes.

27:42.925 --> 27:46.043
You're welcome to look
at my workbook,
I was in Sunny Isles

27:46.205 --> 27:49.198
inspecting a new condo.
- Just a few minutes from here

27:49.365 --> 27:52.244
Yes.
You must be pretty busy, huh?

27:52.445 --> 27:55.005
I'm booked wall-to-wall
for the next few weeks.

27:55.165 --> 27:59.603
Oh, really? I thought you and Cassie
were planning a trip to the Bahamas.

28:00.605 --> 28:02.278
How were you gonna
work that in?

28:03.805 --> 28:07.116
I guess that was a little crazy.

28:07.885 --> 28:10.764
Cassie kept pushing,
I didn't want to disappoint her.

28:10.925 --> 28:14.362
Oh, it was her idea?
Yeah. She wanted a romantic getaway.

28:14.525 --> 28:16.437
Seems a little fast, don't you think?

28:16.605 --> 28:18.676
After a few weeks of dating.

28:19.285 --> 28:22.039
I know it's hard
for most people to understand,

28:22.205 --> 28:25.198
but we had something special.
And we both knew it.

28:29.725 --> 28:32.638
Look, I'm really sorry, you guys.
I've got to get going.

28:32.805 --> 28:35.195
Maybe we can pick this up later?
Yeah, no.

28:35.405 --> 28:39.160
We'll come back another time.
That would be great. Thanks.

28:47.485 --> 28:50.080
He lied to us.
About what?

28:50.285 --> 28:52.800
Jamie said
that whole Bahamas
thing was his idea.

28:53.005 --> 28:55.076
A way for Cassie
not to dump him.

28:55.245 --> 28:57.396
That doesn't mean he's a killer,
you know.

28:57.565 --> 28:59.921
He just could be
fucking obsessed with her.

29:00.085 --> 29:01.838
It wouldn't hurt to look
into it.

29:02.005 --> 29:04.998
Look a little deeper into his alibi.
I'll get on that.

29:05.765 --> 29:07.165
Feel that?

29:08.805 --> 29:10.922
What?
Us, you know,

29:11.085 --> 29:14.123
working together again.
It's nice, you know?

29:15.685 --> 29:19.235
Yeah, it's a lot better than
doing background checks for Elway.

29:19.445 --> 29:22.279
Yeah.
I forgot how much I like it.

29:29.845 --> 29:33.156
Shit. Uh... I'm sorry.

29:33.525 --> 29:35.357
I don't know why I did that.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.196
Let's just pretend you didn't.

29:41.885 --> 29:44.275
Okay.
Okay.

29:54.405 --> 29:57.204
What the fuck?
Sorry, we let ourselves in.

29:58.525 --> 30:00.517
You two should talk alone.

30:17.285 --> 30:19.880
I need a place
where Hannah can stay.

30:22.085 --> 30:24.475
And you want that to be my place?

30:26.525 --> 30:29.438
There's a federal marshal
after her.

30:29.965 --> 30:31.797
He knows she's in Miami.

30:31.965 --> 30:34.844
He's gonna do everything
he can to find her.

30:35.005 --> 30:36.962
It's the only move I could think of.

30:37.565 --> 30:40.125
To bring Hannah to my house?
I know.

30:41.485 --> 30:44.239
It's only for a couple of nights.

30:44.525 --> 30:46.881
Just until I can get her out of Miami.

30:48.925 --> 30:50.359
Please?

30:56.925 --> 30:59.042
A couple of nights, that's it.

31:00.005 --> 31:01.519
Thank you.

31:01.685 --> 31:04.803
You could also thank me
for getting Quinn off Zach's trail.

31:05.805 --> 31:07.239
How?

31:08.885 --> 31:11.639
Simple. Get him
to focus on the boyfriend.

31:12.645 --> 31:14.716
Oliver Saxon.

31:15.845 --> 31:19.759
Saxon? You think he did it?
Well, he's a damn good suspect.

31:20.845 --> 31:22.564
Quinn and I talked to him today.

31:22.725 --> 31:26.401
<i>If Saxon thinks the police are onto him,
he'll know that I'm onto him.</i>

31:26.565 --> 31:28.477
You should stay away
from Saxon, Deb.

31:28.645 --> 31:30.921
He could be more dangerous
than you think.

31:31.965 --> 31:35.322
What are you talking about?
I can't go into it right now,

31:35.485 --> 31:39.115
but please, just do as I ask.

31:46.405 --> 31:50.035
I knew going back
to the force would put me
in a fucked up situation.

31:51.325 --> 31:53.885
Here it is, ahead of schedule.

31:57.205 --> 31:58.958
He's all yours.

32:15.925 --> 32:17.723
You'll be okay here?

32:19.285 --> 32:20.924
Sure.

32:21.685 --> 32:23.563
We'll just hang.

32:25.605 --> 32:27.039
Heh.

32:31.405 --> 32:35.684
<i>If Deb and Quinn did anything
to spook Saxon, I have to act fast.</i>

32:42.045 --> 32:45.322
<i>I'm too late.
He's already moved out.</i>

33:04.725 --> 33:06.956
<i>But if this has his DNA</i>

33:07.285 --> 33:10.596
<i>I can check it against the hairs
I found at Zach's studio.</i>

33:12.645 --> 33:14.079
Here you go.

33:16.525 --> 33:18.915
Are we going to see Hannah?

33:19.725 --> 33:22.081
Hannah? Why?
I saw her on TV.

33:22.245 --> 33:25.317
They said people are looking
for her. Is she in trouble?

33:26.605 --> 33:30.565
No, she's fine.
Hannah's just popular.

33:32.845 --> 33:37.681
You miss her?
Yeah. I liked playing with her.

33:37.845 --> 33:39.598
She was nice.

33:39.765 --> 33:41.722
I wish she could be my mom.

34:10.525 --> 34:14.155
<i>It's a match. Saxon is Vogel's son.</i>

34:22.725 --> 34:26.196
Daniel.
He's going by the name Oliver Saxon.

34:26.405 --> 34:28.636
He dated my neighbour
until he killed her

34:28.805 --> 34:31.161
in her apartment
two doors down from mine.

34:31.325 --> 34:33.044
Do you have any idea where he is?

34:33.205 --> 34:35.162
No, he cleared out
of his place.

34:35.685 --> 34:38.075
He could be anywhere
right now.

34:38.245 --> 34:40.521
Suppose you do find him,
Dexter.

34:40.965 --> 34:43.116
What are you going to do?
What do you think?

34:44.245 --> 34:46.521
I don't know how I feel about that.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.677
He's murdered
four innocent people

34:48.845 --> 34:50.837
and he killed Zach Hamilton.

34:53.045 --> 34:55.799
He's my son.
There's nothing you can do for him.

34:57.125 --> 35:01.005
I can try putting him
back into a safe facility

35:01.205 --> 35:03.401
where he can't hurt himself
or anyone else.

35:03.565 --> 35:06.239
I'm not going to let you kill him.
I'm sorry.

35:06.445 --> 35:10.121
You brought me into this.
I didn't know who he was then.

35:10.285 --> 35:13.164
Try and understand,
my youngest son is gone forever.

35:14.885 --> 35:17.764
Maybe I have a second chance
with Daniel.

35:18.325 --> 35:21.682
You really believe that?
You have a son.

35:21.845 --> 35:23.723
Wouldn't you believe it?

35:24.605 --> 35:27.404
<i>This second chance she wants
could get us both killed.</i>

35:27.605 --> 35:30.723
<i>For her own sake, I have to tell her
what she wants to hear.</i>

35:30.885 --> 35:33.161
Fine, we'll do it your way. Just...

35:34.245 --> 35:37.317
Help me find him.
Is there a way to reach out to him?

35:38.005 --> 35:39.644
I don't know.

35:40.605 --> 35:42.039
Think.

35:43.805 --> 35:46.923
The Mama Cass song that he left
playing in your apartment...

35:47.165 --> 35:48.884
What about it?
One of the few

35:49.085 --> 35:52.601
happy memories I have with Daniel
as a boy was, every Saturday,

35:52.765 --> 35:55.564
I'd take him to
the King's Bay Cafe in the marina.

35:56.005 --> 35:58.156
There was a juke box there.

35:59.085 --> 36:02.044
And Daniel would
always play that song.

36:02.925 --> 36:06.965
Maybe it's more than a happy memory.
Maybe it's an invitation.

36:07.845 --> 36:10.041
King's Bay Cafe. It's still there.

36:13.605 --> 36:17.599
Saxon's been one step
ahead of us this whole time.

36:17.765 --> 36:20.963
We know he stole
your computer files.

36:21.805 --> 36:25.799
But how could he have known about
Zach Hamilton? We met him after that.

36:26.605 --> 36:28.756
The detailed notes
you keep on your computer...

36:28.925 --> 36:30.359
Yes?

36:30.525 --> 36:33.643
I think Saxon's
been monitoring your laptop.

36:33.845 --> 36:35.279
It wouldn't be hard.

36:35.965 --> 36:37.718
You just need the right spyware.

36:37.925 --> 36:41.441
We can use this. Write an entry
in your journal saying you're going

36:41.605 --> 36:45.565
to King's Bay Cafe tomorrow morning.
You think he'll read it and go?

36:45.765 --> 36:48.758
You said yourself he's been
trying to send you a message.

36:48.925 --> 36:50.882
He wants to see you.

37:06.605 --> 37:11.282
<i>I don't like deceiving Vogel,
but if it's the only way to get to Saxon...</i>

37:14.565 --> 37:17.797
You had no choice, Dex.
You had to lie to her.

37:18.685 --> 37:22.440
I just can't believe Vogel
still thinks her son can be helped.

37:22.605 --> 37:25.120
Well, it's not that crazy.

37:26.045 --> 37:27.877
After everything he's done.

37:28.605 --> 37:30.995
You would
want to help Harrison,
wouldn't you?

37:32.565 --> 37:34.761
Vogel pretty much
made the same point.

37:34.925 --> 37:38.760
She's right. I mean, look at what
your own father did to protect you.

37:44.565 --> 37:47.285
Right or not,
Saxon needs to be stopped.

37:48.445 --> 37:50.482
I'm putting him on my table.

37:51.365 --> 37:53.755
And how is Vogel
going to feel about that?

37:54.565 --> 37:58.195
I can't worry about it now.
At least she'll be alive.

38:02.045 --> 38:04.321
Well, you'll figure it out.

38:07.365 --> 38:09.322
I'm glad you're here.

38:12.445 --> 38:16.519
I wanna be able to keep
being here for you, Dex.

38:20.645 --> 38:22.204
But?

38:23.085 --> 38:26.635
But there's no life for me here
in Florida, we both know it.

38:31.205 --> 38:34.482
I can have a life somewhere else
far away from here.

38:35.085 --> 38:37.077
In Argentina.

38:38.605 --> 38:40.676
Maybe we all can.

38:42.245 --> 38:46.080
You and Harrison could
meet me there.
We can start over.

38:49.405 --> 38:52.125
It would be hard on Harrison,
uproot his whole life.

38:52.285 --> 38:55.403
At first, it might be,
but sometimes change
is a good thing.

38:55.605 --> 38:57.836
Sometimes it can—
Yes.

39:03.925 --> 39:05.803
Me, you, and Harrison.

39:07.485 --> 39:09.681
We're gonna move to Argentina.

39:09.845 --> 39:11.723
We'll make it work, Dex.

39:11.885 --> 39:15.276
I can give my notice
at Miami Metro,
say I'm burnt out.

39:16.125 --> 39:19.084
I'm taking Harrison
to travel for a while.

39:23.445 --> 39:26.244
Only Debra will know the truth.

39:34.525 --> 39:35.959
Lieutenant.

39:37.165 --> 39:40.556
Have you heard anything on
the whereabouts
of Zach Hamilton?

39:40.765 --> 39:44.805
Zach Hamilton? You made it pretty
clear that we back away from him.

39:45.005 --> 39:48.885
I just got a call from his parents.
They haven't heard from him in days.

39:49.645 --> 39:51.637
Did they file
a missing persons report?

39:51.805 --> 39:53.444
They just did.

39:54.165 --> 39:57.476
Look, in case he does turn up,

39:58.165 --> 40:01.158
I wanna be the first to know.
I'll make sure of it.

40:07.805 --> 40:11.560
Deb, thanks for coming in.
Yeah. What's up?

40:19.045 --> 40:21.605
Welcome back
to Homicide, detective.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.682
You'll earn your way back up.

40:30.845 --> 40:35.317
You don't know how happy
this makes me. Like the family
coming together again.

40:35.765 --> 40:37.563
We gotta celebrate.

40:38.525 --> 40:39.925
Yeah.

40:44.165 --> 40:45.565
What?

40:46.245 --> 40:48.714
It's all happening so fast.

40:49.125 --> 40:52.323
And? Would you rather
it happened slow?

40:52.485 --> 40:56.798
I just need some time
to think about it.

40:56.965 --> 40:59.799
What's to think about?
Thought this is what you wanted?

40:59.965 --> 41:01.365
It is.

41:02.645 --> 41:04.762
I mean, I thought it was.

41:06.405 --> 41:07.919
I don't get it.

41:09.445 --> 41:12.244
I just need a little time, you know?

41:14.525 --> 41:16.244
Take all the time you need.

41:21.685 --> 41:23.085
Hey.

41:25.645 --> 41:27.238
Hold on to this.

41:48.205 --> 41:50.561
Hey.
Heh.

41:51.925 --> 41:54.918
I, uh, tried getting in touch
with Saxon,

41:55.085 --> 41:57.361
but he's not answering his phone.

41:57.965 --> 41:59.843
Went by his place. He cleared out.

42:00.485 --> 42:02.795
Shit.
Yeah.

42:03.525 --> 42:05.403
At least we're on the right track.

42:05.565 --> 42:07.363
Yeah.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.198
Good luck with that.

42:10.365 --> 42:12.004
Deb.

42:12.885 --> 42:16.083
I, uh, wouldn't have
gotten this far without you.

42:17.285 --> 42:19.516
I'm glad I could help.

42:34.045 --> 42:37.322
You cleaned.
A little.

42:41.565 --> 42:44.319
Well, I hope I can still find shit.

42:45.085 --> 42:46.883
I used to know where everything was.

42:51.525 --> 42:54.279
Hungry?
Are you kidding?

42:56.165 --> 42:57.804
Totally fair.

42:58.485 --> 43:02.195
Well, I am gonna eat,
and I made enough for you too.

43:05.565 --> 43:06.965
You going back?

43:10.965 --> 43:12.957
How the fuck can I go back?

43:15.125 --> 43:17.003
My brother's a serial killer.

43:18.125 --> 43:21.801
And I have another one
hiding out in my house, eating salad.

43:23.325 --> 43:24.998
Sorry.

43:29.725 --> 43:32.160
It was stupid to think
that I could go back.

43:40.805 --> 43:44.355
Well, I know a lot about
wanting things that you can't have.

43:44.525 --> 43:47.757
I wish somewhere I'd learned
to take "no" for an answer.

43:48.245 --> 43:50.123
Would have made my life
a lot easier.

43:51.365 --> 43:52.958
But you didn't.

43:53.125 --> 43:55.003
I'll take that one.

43:55.845 --> 43:57.438
Right.

43:59.445 --> 44:02.279
Well, it's just who I am.
And, uh...

44:02.445 --> 44:04.914
Something tells me
you might be the same way.

44:07.765 --> 44:11.042
Maybe that's the one thing
we have in common.

44:24.725 --> 44:27.081
Heh. I can't believe
I'm eating food you made.

44:27.485 --> 44:29.317
It's not bad, though, right?

44:30.045 --> 44:31.479
No.

44:40.005 --> 44:43.396
All right,
two-minute warning, Harrison.
Swim lessons are calling.

44:43.565 --> 44:44.965
Almost done.

44:47.845 --> 44:50.679
Sorry about this
police-protection business.

44:51.405 --> 44:53.715
No, it's good.

44:53.925 --> 44:55.723
I'm actually glad
that they're here.

44:55.925 --> 44:59.714
If Hannah were to stop by,
poor Harrison would probably
run right to her.

44:59.925 --> 45:01.439
<i>He's not the only one.</i>

45:04.205 --> 45:06.481
Dexter,
hope I'm not intruding.

45:06.685 --> 45:10.076
No, not at all. Come in.
All right.

45:11.725 --> 45:13.125
What can I do for you?

45:13.285 --> 45:15.675
Checking in,
making sure
everything's okay.

45:16.005 --> 45:18.520
Yeah, everything's fine.
Well, good to hear.

45:19.005 --> 45:22.601
I'm thinking the Hannah McKay threat
has pretty much died down.

45:22.805 --> 45:24.842
Oh, yeah?
I mean, if she was here

45:25.005 --> 45:28.965
I'm sure she's gone.
I'll recommend we pull off
your protective detail.

45:31.045 --> 45:33.321
Okay.
All right.

45:34.965 --> 45:36.604
And what's your name?

45:36.765 --> 45:38.996
Harrison.
Harrison.

45:40.645 --> 45:43.035
Huh. Is this your family?
Mm-hm.

45:45.805 --> 45:47.478
Is this your daddy?

45:47.685 --> 45:49.278
That's you, right?
Mm-hm.

45:50.485 --> 45:52.556
Now, who's the pretty lady?

45:57.125 --> 46:00.357
That's my mom.
Your mom?

46:00.525 --> 46:04.678
Hey, why don't you go
grab your towel, bud.
Swim time.

46:04.845 --> 46:06.962
Come on, let's go,
little shark man.

46:12.085 --> 46:16.204
He lost his mother when he was a baby,
drawing her helps him feel closer to her.

46:16.365 --> 46:18.277
Sure.

46:18.445 --> 46:21.563
Well, we really do need
to get going.

46:22.605 --> 46:25.803
Thanks for checking in.
All right, take care.

46:32.885 --> 46:35.764
Hey, you got a sec?
Sure.

46:40.165 --> 46:42.680
Closing the door.
That's never a good sign.

46:43.525 --> 46:45.164
Hannah McKay dated your brother?

46:47.005 --> 46:49.440
You didn't think to mention
that to me at all?

46:49.605 --> 46:52.404
Never crossed your mind?
I didn't think it was important.

46:53.325 --> 46:54.964
What else are you not telling me?

46:55.165 --> 46:59.045
I don't know, but if I told you—
Drop the bullshit, Morgan.

46:59.205 --> 47:00.764
What happened in the Keys?

47:00.965 --> 47:02.445
You see her?

47:03.245 --> 47:04.918
No.

47:05.685 --> 47:09.201
I don't believe you.
You either saw her or your
brother told you to lay off.

47:09.365 --> 47:11.038
What if he did?
What does it matter?

47:11.205 --> 47:14.721
I'll give you 250,000 reasons why. But
clearly we have different priorities.

47:14.885 --> 47:17.684
My brother? We do.
After all I've done for you,

47:17.845 --> 47:20.121
I find it hard to believe
you could do this.

47:20.645 --> 47:24.195
And maybe you need
to ask yourself if this is
the right job for you.

47:24.645 --> 47:27.001
And if not, why don't you
get the fuck out.

47:27.165 --> 47:30.715
Because I could use the office space
for somebody that gives a shit.

47:38.965 --> 47:40.479
Oh, Dexter.

47:41.045 --> 47:43.355
Sorry, I know I'm early.

47:44.325 --> 47:46.442
I'd make you coffee,
but I only have tea.

47:46.605 --> 47:48.198
That'll do.

47:56.485 --> 47:59.000
I warn you,
it's strong.

47:59.725 --> 48:01.682
I need all the help
I can get this morning.

48:01.845 --> 48:03.564
Thanks.

48:06.085 --> 48:09.317
Just so we're clear,
I'm meeting up with Daniel

48:09.485 --> 48:13.240
and I'll lead him out of the cafe,
where you will sedate him.

48:13.405 --> 48:16.557
And then we'll take him to a facility.

48:29.405 --> 48:33.718
Every time I close my eyes,
I still see his face.

48:34.925 --> 48:36.598
Daniel.
Yes.

48:36.765 --> 48:40.759
Now to learn that he's alive
is so difficult to accept.

48:41.645 --> 48:43.204
It is hard to believe.

48:43.645 --> 48:45.876
But another part of me
knows it's true.

48:47.565 --> 48:49.443
And I'm going to see him.

48:52.885 --> 48:54.319
My son.

48:55.965 --> 48:57.718
My little boy.

49:00.765 --> 49:02.882
He still exists.

49:03.205 --> 49:06.596
No matter what he's done. Unh.

49:34.285 --> 49:37.642
Can I get a cup of coffee please?
I'll bring that right over.

Here you go.

sent you, Dexter.

Evelyn!

You drugged me.
You have every right to be upset,

Where's Daniel?

52:38.485 --> 52:40.795
He got away. That's why
I'm here, to warn you.

52:41.005 --> 52:42.883
Well, I consider myself warned.

52:43.045 --> 52:46.516
And I think it best from here on out
that I handle this myself.

this morning, Dexter,

53:07.005 --> 53:08.644
how can I trust you?

53:13.045 --> 53:16.436
Well, trust me or not,
I'm going to take care of Daniel.

53:16.605 --> 53:18.722
Your safety and mine depend on it.

And after that,
I'm on my way with Hannah.

On your way?
Leaving Miami with her.
