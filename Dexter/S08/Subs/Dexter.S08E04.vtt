00:10.565 --> 00:11.794
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:12.005 --> 00:15.885
<i>I've come to believe that the killer
could be one of my former patients.</i>

00:16.125 --> 00:17.844
He sent both packages to you.

00:18.085 --> 00:20.725
He doesn't know how to find me.
Yet.

00:20.925 --> 00:23.565
Well, I need to get to him
before he gets to me.

00:23.765 --> 00:27.281
I've got my eye on Joey Quinn.
Quinn? There's no way he can pass

00:27.485 --> 00:29.283
that sergeant exam.
He'll pass.

00:29.485 --> 00:33.081
I stuck my neck out on the line for you,
and you better not fuck this up.

00:33.245 --> 00:34.361
Lieutenant Morgan?

00:34.525 --> 00:36.084
Is there a problem, officer?

00:36.285 --> 00:38.845
Well, yes. You're in a car,
drunk, with an open container.

00:40.405 --> 00:42.158
Quinn.
Why did she call you?

00:42.365 --> 00:45.915
She's a friend. I couldn't say no.
Come on, you used to fuck her.

00:46.125 --> 00:49.084
There is nothing going on
between me and Deb.

00:49.285 --> 00:52.961
I wanna know if there was anything
unusual about my father's death.

00:53.165 --> 00:54.394
He killed himself, Dexter.

00:54.605 --> 00:57.677
<i>Harry walked in on what he created.</i>

00:57.885 --> 00:59.478
<i>And he couldn't live with himself.</i>

00:59.685 --> 01:00.721
<i>Trust me when I say</i>

01:00.885 --> 01:02.877
<i>that there's a place
in this world for your son.</i>

01:03.125 --> 01:04.559
I told you, you're perfect.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.155
How can you say that when
you know what I've done to Deb?

01:07.805 --> 01:08.875
Unh!

01:09.045 --> 01:11.037
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.202
Your sister confessed
to killing LaGuerta.

01:13.405 --> 01:15.761
What?
I'm telling the whole fucking truth!

01:15.965 --> 01:17.922
There's nothing you can do
to stop me!

01:18.445 --> 01:21.244
I thought I could fix this,
but you're right, I can't.

01:21.445 --> 01:23.880
I just keep making her worse.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.238
Do you really think
you can help her?

01:29.005 --> 01:30.485
Yes.

01:32.005 --> 01:38.079
FaceTime with British Models 24/7
www. saucytime. com

03:23.805 --> 03:25.000
Stop!

03:26.845 --> 03:28.404
Do it, Debra. Shoot him.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.600
This is not who you are.

03:34.445 --> 03:36.323
You are a good cop.

03:36.725 --> 03:39.115
You're a good person.
You're not like him.

03:41.925 --> 03:43.075
Put him down!

03:44.965 --> 03:46.445
It's true.

03:46.645 --> 03:47.840
Everything she said.

03:49.085 --> 03:50.485
You're a good person.

03:53.165 --> 03:55.236
It's okay. Do what you gotta do.

03:57.525 --> 03:59.005
Dex.

04:24.245 --> 04:26.077
Tell me what you saw.

04:26.885 --> 04:28.444
I don't wanna talk about it.

04:28.645 --> 04:31.114
I brought you here so we
can strip away the power

04:31.325 --> 04:32.554
this place holds.

04:32.725 --> 04:34.284
Talking's not gonna
change anything.

04:34.485 --> 04:37.319
Neither is continuing to repress
what happened here.

04:39.125 --> 04:42.004
I'm not repressing shit.

04:44.725 --> 04:47.797
And I don't need you to remind me
about what happened here.

04:48.005 --> 04:52.158
You know, Dexter's need to kill was
born in a container much like this one.

04:52.365 --> 04:54.925
And he's been trapped
inside its walls ever since.

04:55.125 --> 04:57.321
As a psychopath,
he will never break free.

04:57.565 --> 05:01.957
But you can, by reliving the events
of that night over and over.

05:02.165 --> 05:03.235
I killed him.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.965
I shot Dexter instead of LaGuerta.
That's what I saw.

05:08.325 --> 05:10.965
Unless you're gonna handcuff
me, I'd really like to go.

05:11.205 --> 05:13.356
When you shot Dexter,
how'd it make you feel?

05:13.565 --> 05:16.239
Better. Worse.
I don't fucking know.

05:17.365 --> 05:19.960
What does it even matter?
LaGuerta is still dead.

05:20.165 --> 05:22.236
What else could you have done?
Arrest him.

05:22.445 --> 05:24.198
Now your brother's on death row.

05:24.405 --> 05:26.283
We could have run.
Only to be caught.

05:26.485 --> 05:29.080
You go to jail, Dexter gets
the death penalty again.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.880
You've become obsessed
with the life you've taken.

05:32.085 --> 05:35.157
You've forgotten the life you saved.
Of course you defend him.

05:35.365 --> 05:38.597
You created him. You're using
him to track a serial killer.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.762
This isn't about Dexter
or me.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.763
This is about you getting better.

05:42.965 --> 05:45.480
Maybe I don't wanna get better.
I don't believe that.

05:45.685 --> 05:50.965
Why the fuck should I even trust you?
Why the motherfuck do you even care?

05:51.645 --> 05:52.920
Are you upset?

05:55.605 --> 05:58.040
Yes, I am.

05:58.365 --> 05:59.401
Good.

05:59.605 --> 06:02.484
At least you're no longer
avoiding your feelings.

06:03.845 --> 06:05.279
We're done for now.

06:06.205 --> 06:07.844
For today.

06:22.645 --> 06:23.965
<i>There are countless ways</i>

06:24.165 --> 06:26.760
<i>to inflict physical trauma
on the human body,</i>

06:26.965 --> 06:31.084
<i>and sometimes the deadliest wounds
are the ones we barely see.</i>

06:31.325 --> 06:33.317
<i>They run deep,</i>

06:33.525 --> 06:36.085
<i>like the ones I've inflicted on Deb.</i>

06:36.285 --> 06:37.435
What are we looking at?

06:39.005 --> 06:41.395
Well, most of the blows
are to her face.

06:41.605 --> 06:44.120
There's some bruising
around the neck.

06:44.725 --> 06:46.796
It doesn't look like
there was a struggle.

06:47.005 --> 06:48.917
No signs of a break-in.

06:49.365 --> 06:51.436
Yeah, given the lack
of defensive wounds

06:51.685 --> 06:54.996
and the close proximity
of her attacker,

06:55.205 --> 06:58.118
I'd say you're looking
for someone she knew.

06:58.325 --> 07:00.556
We have a name?
Norma Rivera.

07:00.765 --> 07:02.836
Landlord said she lived here
by herself.

07:03.045 --> 07:06.595
Got off the phone with the employer.
Housekeeper in Biscayne Bay.

07:06.805 --> 07:08.637
Nice zip code.
Yeah.

07:08.845 --> 07:12.282
Um, they said she had an ex in and
out of her life, Roberto Sagastume.

07:12.485 --> 07:16.161
Me and Miller can swing by his place.
He had a record.

07:16.445 --> 07:18.038
It's good to see you taking initiative,

07:18.205 --> 07:19.878
like any good sergeant should.

07:20.485 --> 07:21.965
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yo.

07:22.805 --> 07:24.524
You got my test back?

07:24.725 --> 07:26.000
You nailed it, bro.

07:26.485 --> 07:27.919
Oh.

07:28.645 --> 07:31.285
Wipe that grin off your face
before Miller sees it.

07:31.485 --> 07:36.196
Yeah, I've just never been this happy
to get back a positive test, you know?

07:36.405 --> 07:39.045
What does my sister see in you?
Before I forget

07:39.245 --> 07:41.965
there was this hottie
asking for you at the station.

07:42.165 --> 07:44.680
And you seem surprised,
why?

07:44.885 --> 07:47.764
Said she'd come by later.
They always come back for more.

07:47.965 --> 07:51.356
Hey. Any word on Deb?

07:51.565 --> 07:54.797
Yeah, Dr. Vogel says
she's still day-to-day.

07:55.005 --> 07:58.316
Let her know I was thinking about her.
I will.

07:59.205 --> 08:01.242
She's gonna be okay.

08:05.565 --> 08:09.081
<i>Opening shop. A run.</i>

08:09.365 --> 08:11.960
<i>Caffeine. All morning routines.</i>

08:12.165 --> 08:14.202
<i>But lately, mine consists
of coming here,</i>

08:14.405 --> 08:16.681
<i>waiting for the woman
I left my sister with</i>

08:16.885 --> 08:19.081
<i>to do what I couldn't,
make Deb whole again.</i>

08:19.285 --> 08:21.402
Thank you.
How is she?

08:21.645 --> 08:25.195
Well, you still remain the focal
point of your sister's pain.

08:25.445 --> 08:26.481
I wanna see her.

08:26.685 --> 08:27.835
I think it's better

08:28.005 --> 08:29.359
you keep your distance
for now.

08:29.565 --> 08:32.717
It's been almost a week.
Dexter, I am still not sure

08:32.925 --> 08:36.202
if your sister
has hit rock bottom yet.

08:40.725 --> 08:42.284
What is it?

08:42.685 --> 08:45.041
I just want you to prepare
for the possibility

08:45.245 --> 08:48.363
that Debra may never be able
to have you back in her life.

08:49.525 --> 08:50.720
No.

08:50.965 --> 08:54.402
I won't just let her go.

09:08.525 --> 09:11.962
So have you had better luck
with our killer?

09:13.725 --> 09:16.320
I crossed off three more
former patients from your book.

09:16.525 --> 09:17.845
Who's next on the list?

09:18.045 --> 09:19.115
Chapter seven.

09:19.285 --> 09:20.765
A.J. Yates.

09:22.365 --> 09:24.755
I'll check back in
once I check him out.

09:29.245 --> 09:30.964
<i>A.J. Yates.</i>

09:32.845 --> 09:35.360
<i>According to Vogel's book,
he attacked a classmate</i>

09:35.565 --> 09:37.477
<i>with a chair at 12.</i>

09:37.725 --> 09:40.684
<i>Institutionalised at 15.</i>

09:41.325 --> 09:43.999
<i>Seems Vogel tried to channel
his violent tendencies</i>

09:44.205 --> 09:45.605
<i>but he was beyond her help.</i>

09:45.805 --> 09:48.559
<i>Eventually, he was transferred
to another hospital.</i>

09:49.125 --> 09:52.197
<i>Now Yates seems to be
a productive member of society.</i>

09:52.445 --> 09:55.244
<i>He's a bundler.
Cable, phone, Internet.</i>

09:56.565 --> 09:59.842
<i>But I need to know if murder
is part of the package.</i>

10:11.725 --> 10:13.045
<i>There's nothing here.</i>

10:13.245 --> 10:16.636
<i>Nothing in Vogel's notes
about brain surgery.</i>

10:16.925 --> 10:18.439
<i>His scar.</i>

10:20.205 --> 10:23.004
<i>Is that the mark of one of her
unconventional methods?</i>

10:39.405 --> 10:42.239
Thanks for letting me use the treadmill.
Better you than me.

10:42.445 --> 10:44.118
I'm not much for running in place.

10:46.325 --> 10:49.204
Is that your shrink way
of saying that I have been?

10:49.405 --> 10:52.603
Is it? Care for some tea?

10:54.205 --> 10:56.276
How about something stronger?

10:58.325 --> 11:01.557
Come on, I just ran four miles.
What's one beer?

11:03.365 --> 11:05.880
The drinks and the drugs
were keeping you numb,

11:06.085 --> 11:08.919
making the symptoms
of your PTSD worse.

11:09.125 --> 11:11.242
Ass off the table.

11:16.525 --> 11:19.643
How long are you
expecting me to stay here?

11:21.725 --> 11:23.478
I see a lot of your father in you.

11:28.325 --> 11:31.762
Harry wrestled with the same
doubts regarding Dexter.

11:33.405 --> 11:36.045
You're not as alone
as you might think.

11:39.525 --> 11:41.642
<i>Honestly, I don't see
what the problem is.</i>

11:41.885 --> 11:44.400
<i>He had everything laid out
on his bedroom floor.</i>

11:44.645 --> 11:47.877
<i>Dexter saw in the paper how this
guy got off on a technicality</i>

11:48.085 --> 11:49.997
<i>so he was stalking him,
vetting him.</i>

11:50.205 --> 11:53.277
<i>Even found a kill room in
an abandoned house near the park.</i>

11:53.525 --> 11:54.845
<i>Just how we taught him.</i>

11:55.045 --> 11:56.559
<i>What did you tell Dexter?</i>

11:56.765 --> 11:59.485
<i>That this guy was too high-profile,
he'd be missed,</i>

11:59.685 --> 12:01.836
<i>and that Dexter
would have to wait.</i>

12:02.045 --> 12:04.196
<i>He went along with my decision.</i>

12:04.405 --> 12:05.600
<i>For now.</i>

12:06.285 --> 12:09.722
<i>Is this ever gonna be right?
What we've done?</i>

12:09.925 --> 12:14.124
<i>I mean, Dexter isn't a kid anymore.
He's becoming a man.</i>

12:14.845 --> 12:16.279
<i>He's gonna kill.</i>

12:16.485 --> 12:18.636
<i>We knew that day was coming.</i>

12:19.885 --> 12:22.525
<i>But what happens
when I finally tell him it's okay?</i>

12:23.765 --> 12:27.918
<i>When he finally knows what it's like
to take another person's life?</i>

12:28.125 --> 12:30.720
<i>The code will do
what it was designed to do.</i>

12:31.085 --> 12:33.202
<i>Allow Dexter to be
who he was meant to be.</i>

12:33.445 --> 12:34.925
<i>But what if it doesn't?</i>

12:35.125 --> 12:38.277
<i>What if the code doesn't keep him
in check? What then?</i>

12:38.525 --> 12:41.165
<i>What if this has all been
some horrible mistake?</i>

12:41.405 --> 12:43.715
Obviously, Harry
came around when he realised

12:43.925 --> 12:46.042
what else could he have done?

12:46.285 --> 12:48.880
Locked Dexter away
in an institution?

12:49.125 --> 12:51.799
Or do nothing
until he took an innocent life?

12:52.805 --> 12:55.081
Or protect your brother,

12:55.565 --> 12:57.761
giving him the tools
that he would need

12:58.005 --> 13:00.281
to channel his urges.

13:00.845 --> 13:04.805
The same way you protected
Dexter in that container.

13:05.005 --> 13:06.598
It's not the same. You're wrong.

13:06.845 --> 13:09.121
Deb.
I can't just accept it.

13:09.885 --> 13:13.515
I'm not like him. I'm not like you.

13:13.725 --> 13:17.162
Dexter— Dex—
Dexter is fucking Dexter.

13:17.405 --> 13:21.843
Debra, Harry did not make a
mistake saving Dexter's life,

13:22.045 --> 13:23.195
and neither did you.

13:23.405 --> 13:24.964
That night
in the container

13:25.205 --> 13:27.959
Dexter was being exactly
who he was meant to be

13:28.205 --> 13:30.674
and so were you, the loving sister.

13:33.525 --> 13:36.404
I—
Will get through this.

13:44.645 --> 13:47.683
Can I keep that tape?
Yes.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.879
<i>He had everything
laid out on his bedroom floor.</i>

14:04.085 --> 14:07.476
<i>Dexter saw in the paper how this
guy got off on a technicality...</i>

14:12.605 --> 14:14.164
Dexter, you shouldn't be here.

14:14.365 --> 14:15.765
I was vetting Yates.

14:16.005 --> 14:18.201
What did you do to him?
What are you on about?

14:18.405 --> 14:20.920
He has a scar on his head
exactly where your killer

14:21.125 --> 14:23.321
has been harvesting
brain fragments.

14:23.525 --> 14:25.881
Is he another one
of your little experiments?

14:26.365 --> 14:30.200
We can talk about this, but not here.
Not with Debra in the other room.

14:35.605 --> 14:39.838
An x-ray revealed a lesion
on Yates' brain.

14:40.205 --> 14:43.164
I suspected it was contributing
to his violent behaviour,

14:43.405 --> 14:44.885
so I...

14:45.125 --> 14:47.959
I suggested the new hospital
remove it.

14:48.165 --> 14:50.634
I never knew whether
they performed the surgery.

14:50.845 --> 14:53.041
When I do what I do,
I have to know everything.

14:54.245 --> 14:56.316
Sorry for the oversight.

14:57.125 --> 14:59.515
Why don't you tell me
the real reason you're here?

14:59.725 --> 15:02.684
You could have just called
for the scar.

15:04.085 --> 15:07.283
Is it regarding what I said
about letting your sister go?

15:08.205 --> 15:10.356
Dexter, I assure you

15:10.565 --> 15:13.160
that I'm not judging
your relationship with Debra.

15:13.365 --> 15:16.085
I'm just trying to manage
your expectations.

15:16.805 --> 15:19.525
Why, because she thinks
I'm a monster?

15:20.245 --> 15:23.761
You think I don't know that I'm the one
responsible for the pain she's in?

15:23.965 --> 15:26.525
That's why she's here with you.

15:26.725 --> 15:28.478
You have to get her to forgive me.

15:28.685 --> 15:31.678
Whatever it takes, you have to
find a way. I need her in my life.

15:31.885 --> 15:33.797
You need her?
Yes.

15:34.005 --> 15:36.725
I understand that you love Debra
in your own way.

15:36.925 --> 15:40.316
In my own way.
But why do you think you need her?

15:42.685 --> 15:44.039
I just do.

15:44.245 --> 15:47.079
Deb looks up to you.
Isn't that what you said?

15:48.005 --> 15:49.075
She used to.

15:49.245 --> 15:50.964
And that made you feel good?

15:51.165 --> 15:53.555
Yes.
Well, no wonder you feel so lost.

15:53.805 --> 15:57.196
Debra became a mirror, reflecting
a positive image of yourself

15:57.405 --> 15:59.158
that you used to balance out

15:59.365 --> 16:02.119
with the notion of yourself
as a monster.

16:02.325 --> 16:03.884
Now that mirror is cracked,

16:04.085 --> 16:07.157
and the only reflection you see
is one of darkness.

16:07.405 --> 16:09.920
You make it sound like
that part of me isn't real.

16:10.125 --> 16:11.559
You are no monster.

16:11.725 --> 16:12.841
You never have been.

16:13.045 --> 16:15.401
Anyone on my table would disagree.

16:15.605 --> 16:18.882
Dexter, a monster, by definition,
is outside of nature.

16:19.125 --> 16:21.401
You're a part
of the natural order of things,

16:21.605 --> 16:24.359
with purpose and value,
a right to exist.

16:24.565 --> 16:27.205
When you accept that,
you'll no longer be dependent

16:27.405 --> 16:29.840
on Debra, or anyone's,
validation.

16:30.045 --> 16:31.559
I'll still want her in my life.

16:31.765 --> 16:34.678
Want, but not need.

16:49.045 --> 16:51.480
<i>No van. No Yates.</i>

17:15.685 --> 17:17.278
<i>No one home.</i>

17:40.965 --> 17:43.196
<i>"Monterey Nursing Home.</i>

17:44.805 --> 17:46.524
<i>Dad's 76th birthday."</i>

17:47.925 --> 17:51.316
<i>It seems Yates found a way
to keep his family in his life.</i>

17:51.525 --> 17:53.596
<i>Will I be able to do the same
with Deb?</i>

17:55.125 --> 17:57.037
<i>Vogel says I don't need her.</i>

17:58.245 --> 18:02.478
<i>But if that's true, will I be able to
let her go if that's what she needs?</i>

18:14.045 --> 18:16.355
<i>Women's shoes.</i>

18:58.125 --> 18:59.798
<i>- Hello?</i>
- It's me.

19:00.005 --> 19:01.325
I'm at Yates' house.

19:01.525 --> 19:04.484
<i>Have you found something?</i>
Women's shoes.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.325
Individual shoes, not pairs,

19:07.525 --> 19:08.754
some of them older.

19:09.605 --> 19:11.961
High heels are a far cry
from brains.

19:12.165 --> 19:14.316
It's not exactly your killer's
usual MO.

19:14.525 --> 19:17.643
<i>When this began, I expressed
my doubts that this was the work</i>

19:17.885 --> 19:19.205
<i>of someone new to killing.</i>

19:19.405 --> 19:21.715
<i>Albert wouldn't be the first
to alter his methods.</i>

19:21.925 --> 19:24.884
Yeah, still, something about
it doesn't quite add up.

19:25.085 --> 19:28.396
But just to be safe,
I'm pulling prints off the shoes.

19:28.645 --> 19:31.922
I'll run them through the station's
database for missing persons

19:32.125 --> 19:35.084
and homicide victims.
But they're only partials.

19:35.285 --> 19:37.481
I won't expect anything back
until the morning.

19:37.805 --> 19:39.797
And I have my son tonight.

19:40.005 --> 19:41.439
<i>Understood.</i>

19:41.645 --> 19:43.079
I'll let you know what I find.

20:00.045 --> 20:01.445
Vogel.

20:01.645 --> 20:04.114
She found herself a hero.

20:21.765 --> 20:22.881
Hi.

20:24.285 --> 20:27.244
Hello.
You must be Dexter. I'm Cassie, 4-B.

20:27.445 --> 20:30.404
And you're in my kitchen because?
I'm a friend of Jamie's.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.358
I ran out of detergent.
Daddy!

20:32.565 --> 20:33.840
I see you two have met.

20:34.085 --> 20:36.236
I hope you don't mind.
Who am I to deny

20:36.445 --> 20:39.119
a neighbour clean clothes?
Dinner's in the oven.

20:39.325 --> 20:40.964
I'll see you in the morning?
Sure.

20:41.165 --> 20:42.758
I'll walk you out. Mmm!

20:43.405 --> 20:45.362
Nice to meet you, Dexter.
You too.

20:46.485 --> 20:48.044
Bye.

20:51.965 --> 20:53.399
She's nice.

20:53.965 --> 20:55.922
But does she have a kissy-neck?

21:00.845 --> 21:02.802
I knew you'd pass.
I didn't.

21:03.005 --> 21:04.439
Oh, thank you for that.

21:04.645 --> 21:06.955
This one used to have
to write the combination

21:07.205 --> 21:09.720
of his locker on his wrist
when he first got here.

21:09.925 --> 21:13.202
So what? My memory sucks.
You needed the right encouragement.

21:13.405 --> 21:15.601
I don't even wanna know
what that means.

21:15.805 --> 21:17.159
We're empty.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.958
You know,
I really am so proud of you.

21:22.405 --> 21:24.078
I couldn't have
done it without you.

21:24.285 --> 21:25.844
Who was behind the wheel?

21:26.005 --> 21:28.395
Debra Morgan,
former lieutenant of Homicide,

21:28.645 --> 21:31.763
passed out, piss drunk. Ha, ha, ha!
Come on, let it go.

21:31.925 --> 21:33.678
I don't know
who was fucked up more,

21:33.885 --> 21:36.002
her or the parking metre
she ran over.

21:36.205 --> 21:38.197
Hey. How about
professional discretion?

21:38.445 --> 21:40.755
Yeah, well, I believe
that we're off the clock.

21:40.965 --> 21:43.196
But you could
lower your voice, you know?

21:43.445 --> 21:46.324
Yeah, sure. No problem.
Thanks.

21:46.685 --> 21:48.677
Who was that guy?
I don't know.

21:48.885 --> 21:50.444
He used to bone her or something.

21:50.645 --> 21:53.444
Probably the way Morgan
made lieutenant, on her back.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.641
Fuck.
Hey, hey, hey!

21:59.245 --> 22:00.645
That's enough.

22:00.885 --> 22:03.923
Enough, I said! Enough!

22:10.085 --> 22:12.361
What the hell happened?
Someone was defending

22:12.605 --> 22:15.643
his ex-girlfriend's honour.
Get him out of here.

22:19.045 --> 22:21.116
You know what? It's fine. Let's just go.
I'm sorry.

22:22.885 --> 22:25.036
Hey, how about a round
on the house?

22:25.285 --> 22:27.322
All right, lieutenant.
Fuck.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.920
So we're good?

22:35.445 --> 22:36.799
Mm.

22:42.485 --> 22:43.965
Aah!

22:45.165 --> 22:47.202
Babe. Babe, my ribs.
Yeah?

22:48.645 --> 22:51.001
I'm so sorry.

23:05.245 --> 23:07.476
How many, mister?
Two.

23:07.685 --> 23:08.960
One for me and one for Dan.

23:10.485 --> 23:13.159
Two it is.
Sorry I'm late.

23:15.005 --> 23:16.280
Who's Dan?

23:16.485 --> 23:20.035
Pet elephant. You don't see him?

23:22.365 --> 23:24.561
You want some pancakes, Dan?

23:24.765 --> 23:26.279
Eat up.

23:26.485 --> 23:29.000
Make sure Dan doesn't get
any syrup on the couch.

23:29.205 --> 23:30.764
Okay.

23:30.965 --> 23:34.675
My car died. That "check
engine" light I kept ignoring?

23:34.885 --> 23:37.639
Apparently it means what it says.
How'd you get here?

23:37.845 --> 23:41.634
Angel. But don't worry, my car will
only be in the shop for a few days.

23:41.845 --> 23:45.361
I'm gonna see if Cassie can give
us a lift to Harrison's preschool.

23:46.005 --> 23:49.237
You know, you made quite an
impression on her last night.

23:49.445 --> 23:52.438
Impression?
She's single. Just saying.

23:54.245 --> 23:58.364
Hey, why don't you take the SUV?
It's safer. I'll clear my stuff out.

23:58.565 --> 24:01.603
If you can drop me off, I'll pick
up a car from the motor pool.

24:01.805 --> 24:03.125
Sure you don't mind?

24:03.325 --> 24:05.282
I don't if Dan doesn't.

24:21.845 --> 24:24.076
How did I let you talk
me into this again?

24:24.285 --> 24:26.083
I believe your price
was one beer.

24:28.565 --> 24:30.363
So now what?
You tell me.

24:30.565 --> 24:32.716
Isn't this where you think you belong?
No.

24:32.925 --> 24:35.201
Frankly, I'm quite amazed
that you think you ever left.

24:35.885 --> 24:37.365
Are we really gonna do this?

24:37.565 --> 24:41.002
Debra, you shut yourself inside
these walls for the last six months

24:41.205 --> 24:43.242
doing your damnedest
to shut everything

24:43.445 --> 24:45.437
and everyone out.
So why don't we?

24:48.765 --> 24:50.404
What the fuck are you doing?

24:50.605 --> 24:53.200
I want you to convince
me how killing Dexter

24:53.405 --> 24:56.045
instead of LaGuerta
would be a better choice.

24:56.245 --> 24:59.044
Open the fucking door.
LaGuerta.

24:59.245 --> 25:02.044
She was on her knees,
where those blood stains are,

25:02.205 --> 25:03.241
isn't that right?

25:03.525 --> 25:05.960
She was your co-worker,
your friend.

25:06.165 --> 25:10.557
Why didn't you just stay at the party
and let Dexter take care of everything?

25:10.765 --> 25:15.396
I had to stop him.
But Dexter can't help what he is.

25:15.685 --> 25:17.916
He has no conscience,
unlike you.

25:18.165 --> 25:20.634
You knew the moment
you pointed that gun

25:20.845 --> 25:22.677
at LaGuerta it was wrong,

25:22.885 --> 25:25.002
and still, you pulled the trigger.

25:25.205 --> 25:27.481
You shot a woman in cold blood.

25:27.685 --> 25:32.521
You let her bleed out and did nothing.
You shot an innocent woman

25:32.765 --> 25:35.439
for simply doing her job.
Because of Dexter.

25:35.645 --> 25:37.477
And that's what terrifies you
the most.

25:37.845 --> 25:41.441
You so desperately want to believe
that if you had just shot Dexter,

25:41.685 --> 25:43.563
then you wouldn't have to
face the truth,

25:43.765 --> 25:45.882
that if you had to do it
all over again

25:46.085 --> 25:47.565
you'd still choose him.

25:47.765 --> 25:49.119
Because in your heart,

25:49.365 --> 25:52.756
you know you'll always
choose Dexter.

26:03.205 --> 26:05.276
How do I make it right?

26:07.685 --> 26:10.359
By finally accepting
that you're a good person

26:10.565 --> 26:13.524
who was forced to do
a terrible thing.

26:21.245 --> 26:24.921
And that you made the best
of an impossible situation.

26:27.805 --> 26:31.515
You can walk out that door.
You can move forward.

26:32.725 --> 26:36.560
The choice is yours.
It always has been.

26:46.165 --> 26:47.758
Oh, lieutenant. A word?

26:47.965 --> 26:49.399
Of course.

26:49.725 --> 26:52.604
I was just reviewing
the sergeant's exam results.

26:52.845 --> 26:55.599
And it seems you were right
and I was wrong about Quinn.

26:55.845 --> 26:58.485
Apparently, he can count
past his fingers and toes.

26:58.725 --> 27:01.524
He was in the 85th percentile.
So was Miller.

27:01.765 --> 27:03.802
In the 88th percentile, to be exact.

27:05.165 --> 27:08.397
I want you to strongly consider
making her sergeant.

27:09.005 --> 27:11.600
Angie is good. I like her, a lot.

27:11.805 --> 27:15.924
But I still think Quinn's the smarter—
All I said was "strongly consider."

27:16.125 --> 27:19.004
This is your first departmental
promotion as lieutenant

27:19.245 --> 27:22.682
and will reflect on your command.
That being said

27:22.885 --> 27:26.481
it's your decision and yours alone.

27:40.285 --> 27:43.403
<i>Three hits off
the partials, all reported missing.</i>

27:44.405 --> 27:47.125
<i>Janet Thorton, taken two weeks ago.</i>

27:47.485 --> 27:49.238
<i>Looks like Yates killed these women,</i>

27:49.485 --> 27:52.603
<i>but I still can't be sure
he's the one after Vogel.</i>

27:52.805 --> 27:54.478
<i>Not until he's on my table</i>

27:54.685 --> 27:57.484
<i>and we have a little talk first.</i>

28:07.405 --> 28:09.920
Where are we on Norma Rivera?
We're trying to find—

28:10.165 --> 28:12.282
Miller.
Address for the ex is no good.

28:12.485 --> 28:15.045
Nobody's seen him.
Got back the ME's report.

28:15.245 --> 28:18.158
They found semen.
I'm testing it to see if it's a match.

28:18.365 --> 28:21.597
Would explain why he's off the grid.
She invites him over.

28:21.845 --> 28:24.804
Things get heated, he kills her,
panics and goes on the run.

28:25.005 --> 28:27.520
That's one theory. Find this guy.
We're on it.

28:27.765 --> 28:31.156
Dex-posé. Favour. I need you
to stay away from the lab for a bit.

28:31.365 --> 28:33.834
That hottie who's been
looking for me is coming

28:34.045 --> 28:35.240
and we might need alone time.

28:35.445 --> 28:36.561
<i>No problem.</i>

28:36.765 --> 28:39.963
You would know all about that.
- You're better than that.

28:40.165 --> 28:43.841
Come on, here. There's a 20 in it
for anyone who directs her to my lab

28:44.045 --> 28:45.843
and is cool about it.
Done.

28:46.045 --> 28:47.479
Okay.

28:50.045 --> 28:53.402
<i>I'm on my own. Perfect.</i>

28:55.005 --> 28:56.359
Angel.

28:57.445 --> 28:59.596
I get it, okay?
You're pissed about last night.

28:59.845 --> 29:03.805
I had to run a tab so that asshole
patrolman wouldn't press charges.

29:04.005 --> 29:07.282
If Matthews caught wind of this,
he'd have all the ammo he needed

29:07.485 --> 29:10.000
to shoot down this promotion.
I lost my cool.

29:10.205 --> 29:12.595
I need my sergeant
to be able to keep his.

29:12.805 --> 29:14.000
A bar fight?

29:14.205 --> 29:18.358
Technically, the place is a restaurant.
It's not like you haven't done the same.

29:18.565 --> 29:22.605
You put a guy in the hospital for running
his mouth about LaGuerta using hers.

29:22.805 --> 29:25.923
Allegedly. And the difference is,
I wasn't up for promotion.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.918
I had already made sergeant.

29:28.565 --> 29:31.364
You wanna fix this?
Solve this case.

29:41.645 --> 29:44.080
Excuse me?
Are you Vincent Masuka?

29:46.725 --> 29:49.160
The one, the only.

29:49.365 --> 29:51.357
But you can call me Vince.

29:52.045 --> 29:53.604
Just as long as you call.

29:54.085 --> 29:55.565
Okay. I'm Niki.

29:55.765 --> 29:57.119
I'm a student at U of M.

29:57.325 --> 30:00.124
Oh, yeah. My alma mater. Come in.

30:01.405 --> 30:03.283
You must be majoring in

30:03.485 --> 30:04.760
beautiful.

30:09.085 --> 30:11.395
This is really hard.
I know the feeling.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.477
I think you may be my father.

30:16.325 --> 30:19.636
You were a sperm donor
in college, right?

30:20.485 --> 30:21.601
Mm-hm.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.640
But you have curls.
Yeah, my mom.

30:28.965 --> 30:30.843
Holy...

30:32.445 --> 30:35.165
Oh, fuck.

30:37.405 --> 30:40.443
This was a bad idea. Sorry.

30:42.565 --> 30:44.397
I'm sorry.
It's okay. No, don't worry.

30:44.605 --> 30:48.235
It's okay, don't— Don't— Don't—

30:48.445 --> 30:50.437
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

30:50.845 --> 30:52.199
Oh, my God.

30:52.405 --> 30:56.285
You've got my soulful,
yet haunting eyes.

31:13.165 --> 31:15.475
Night, Marty.
See you tomorrow.

31:15.725 --> 31:17.637
We do have filing cabinets,
you know.

31:19.005 --> 31:20.678
This is kind of my process.

31:20.885 --> 31:23.195
What are you even doing here?

31:23.445 --> 31:25.357
I thought you were taking
time off.

31:25.565 --> 31:29.081
Turns out time off isn't
all it's cracked up to be. Heh.

31:29.325 --> 31:33.114
I just wanted to get a head start on
some of the cases that you left for me.

31:33.605 --> 31:35.676
Well, we're gonna need food.

31:35.885 --> 31:37.638
"We"?
Yeah, we.

31:37.845 --> 31:40.644
You look like you could use
a hand, and I'm starving.

31:46.885 --> 31:48.683
You know, when I need a break,

31:48.885 --> 31:50.717
I've got maybe two days at the most.

31:51.005 --> 31:52.439
And then I go crazy.

31:52.685 --> 31:54.881
I end up right back here.

31:55.605 --> 31:57.324
What about you?

31:58.245 --> 31:59.520
What makes you crazy?

32:02.645 --> 32:04.079
Family shit.

32:04.285 --> 32:05.401
Hm.

32:05.605 --> 32:08.165
Nothing says family like love

32:08.405 --> 32:10.044
and shit.

32:10.325 --> 32:13.045
Unfortunately, my father
was an expert in the latter.

32:13.285 --> 32:15.117
Texas oil.
Texas oil?

32:15.285 --> 32:16.321
Mm.

32:17.485 --> 32:20.125
Fuck, I hope I'm holding
my plastic fork correctly.

32:20.325 --> 32:23.523
Exactly. He was all rules,
all the time.

32:24.325 --> 32:26.362
My moving to Miami to be a cop,

32:26.565 --> 32:29.763
that was the biggest "fuck you"
I could think of at the time.

32:30.965 --> 32:34.879
When I got out of the academy,
I realised it was nothing but rules.

32:35.085 --> 32:38.396
Everybody there was like your father.
You know the worst part?

32:38.645 --> 32:42.480
I knew I'd made a huge fucking
mistake, but there was no way in hell

32:42.685 --> 32:46.042
I was gonna give him the smug
pleasure of knowing he was right.

32:46.245 --> 32:49.204
So I waited until he died,
quit the force.

32:49.765 --> 32:51.597
I opened up this place.

32:52.765 --> 32:54.996
Looks like you're doing
pretty well for yourself.

32:55.245 --> 32:57.521
Trust me,
I'm still the black sheep.

32:57.725 --> 33:01.116
The look on my mother's face every
time she goes into the country club,

33:01.325 --> 33:04.443
has to explain to one of her
friends that her son is a PI?

33:04.645 --> 33:06.364
That's gotta be
pretty close to priceless.

33:06.525 --> 33:08.039
Mm.

33:08.445 --> 33:10.801
My dad was everything to me.

33:12.285 --> 33:13.924
I loved him.

33:16.285 --> 33:19.198
And while he's
not the man I thought he was...

33:21.645 --> 33:23.284
well, I'm...

33:24.125 --> 33:27.197
I'm realising we're
more alike than I thought.

33:31.085 --> 33:33.077
To dead dads.

33:33.325 --> 33:35.521
Long may they haunt us.

33:35.685 --> 33:37.278
Heh.

33:40.965 --> 33:43.275
It's a better toast if you open it.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.117
I'm good.

33:53.125 --> 33:55.765
<i>Vogel says I'm not a monster,</i>

33:56.965 --> 33:58.797
<i>but that's exactly the part of me</i>

33:59.005 --> 34:02.316
<i>she's expecting to
remove Yates as a threat.</i>

34:08.245 --> 34:11.079
<i>A threat that seems to have
left in a hurry</i>

34:11.285 --> 34:14.119
<i>and taken all his shoes.</i>

34:28.605 --> 34:31.757
<i>Does this prove Yates
is who I'm looking for?</i>

34:33.165 --> 34:35.555
<i>The only way to know for sure is...</i>

34:38.005 --> 34:40.076
<i>find where he's hiding.</i>

35:14.445 --> 35:17.995
<i>He saw me here, heard everything.</i>

35:30.765 --> 35:33.758
<i>Bone saw. Specimen jars.</i>

35:36.925 --> 35:39.565
<i>His own cut-by-numbers guide.</i>

35:40.605 --> 35:42.085
<i>Yates is the brain surgeon.</i>

35:42.325 --> 35:44.794
<i>Vogel needs to know.</i>

36:01.045 --> 36:03.401
<i>I know her. I pulled her print.</i>

36:07.885 --> 36:09.604
<i>Yates must have stabbed her,</i>

36:09.805 --> 36:13.401
<i>nicked her left pulmonary artery,
left her for dead.</i>

36:14.325 --> 36:16.157
<i>Unaware cramming her
inside that cart</i>

36:16.405 --> 36:19.523
<i>would put pressure on the wound
and stop it from bleeding.</i>

36:20.285 --> 36:22.516
<i>Now I have to do the same.</i>

36:23.605 --> 36:25.995
<i>It'll hold, but not for long.</i>

36:29.245 --> 36:31.043
Do you think the girl will be all right?

36:31.205 --> 36:32.639
She lost a lot of blood.

36:32.845 --> 36:36.839
I stemmed the bleeding, dropped her
in the ER, got back as fast as I could.

36:37.045 --> 36:38.923
Oh, God, has he been

36:39.165 --> 36:40.315
doing all this because of me?

36:40.525 --> 36:42.084
We can't know until we find him.

36:42.285 --> 36:45.835
Let's hope there's something
on here that'll tell me how.

36:48.245 --> 36:49.804
These are patient files.

36:52.125 --> 36:53.798
Your patient files.

36:54.005 --> 36:56.156
That's not possible.

36:56.405 --> 37:00.081
This one's dated just two weeks ago.
Dexter, don't.

37:06.005 --> 37:07.564
What is this?

37:10.565 --> 37:12.124
You were keeping notes on me?

37:12.325 --> 37:14.601
It's a journal.
I've always had a journal.

37:14.805 --> 37:18.321
You were writing down everything
we did, everything we talked about.

37:18.525 --> 37:20.960
I never used your name.
Yates, nor anyone else

37:21.165 --> 37:24.602
could possibly know who you are.
"Somehow, he's deluded himself

37:24.845 --> 37:27.679
into thinking his feelings
for his sister are genuine,

37:28.485 --> 37:31.637
unaware there are no
real emotions behind them."

37:35.925 --> 37:39.043
Dexter, I— I never meant—

37:39.245 --> 37:41.885
What am I, a subject
for another one of your books?

37:42.085 --> 37:43.883
Is that what these are for?

37:45.285 --> 37:47.561
Answer the question!

37:49.885 --> 37:53.276
My notes, it's how I process—

37:53.485 --> 37:55.841
You were experimenting
on me with Harry

37:56.085 --> 37:58.156
and you still are.

37:59.045 --> 38:02.880
I'm nothing but a lab rat,
just like Yates.

38:03.525 --> 38:05.403
That's not true. You know that.

38:05.605 --> 38:09.201
Is that why you wanna
keep me apart from Deb?

38:09.405 --> 38:11.681
Just another way to isolate
your subject,

38:11.885 --> 38:13.797
see what he'll do?

38:14.565 --> 38:16.761
Dexter...
Don't.

38:20.285 --> 38:24.165
When Yates is dead,
you are out of my life.

38:24.405 --> 38:27.682
It's over. You understand?

38:30.285 --> 38:32.754
Or do you need
to write it down?

38:34.445 --> 38:36.243
I understand.

39:41.885 --> 39:43.877
<i>I walked into the room and—</i>

39:44.085 --> 39:45.883
<i>- Go on, tell me.
- The blood.</i>

39:46.085 --> 39:48.361
<i>Evelyn, there was
so much blood, on plastic.</i>

39:48.565 --> 39:51.444
<i>Dexter had placed it everywhere.
The walls, the ceiling.</i>

39:51.645 --> 39:54.922
<i>There was a table in the middle
of the room. A table with—</i>

39:55.165 --> 39:57.680
<i>- The body?
- Parts of one.</i>

39:57.885 --> 40:00.320
<i>And when Dexter turned,
the look on his face—</i>

40:00.525 --> 40:02.118
<i>He was so proud.</i>

40:02.325 --> 40:04.965
<i>When— The man Dexter killed,
he was a drug dealer.</i>

40:05.165 --> 40:08.203
<i>He murdered your partner.
He was going to get away with it.</i>

40:08.405 --> 40:09.759
<i>But he was a person.</i>

40:09.965 --> 40:12.560
<i>Who, according to the code,
deserved—</i>

40:12.805 --> 40:15.320
<i>No one deserves
to be in pieces.</i>

40:16.365 --> 40:17.924
<i>In bags.</i>

40:18.125 --> 40:21.641
<i>The code is a theory, an idea.</i>

40:21.845 --> 40:25.282
<i>But what I saw,
what Dexter did—</i>

40:25.525 --> 40:27.323
<i>What we did!</i>

40:36.325 --> 40:38.601
<i>I don't think I can live with this.</i>

40:46.365 --> 40:49.085
Fuck, and I'm supposed to?

41:15.165 --> 41:17.634
Hello?
<i>Mr. Yates?</i>

41:17.845 --> 41:19.404
Yeah, that's me.

41:19.605 --> 41:21.358
<i>I'm afraid we have some bad news.</i>

41:21.565 --> 41:23.522
<i>Your father's heart is failing.</i>

41:23.725 --> 41:25.045
How bad is it?

41:25.245 --> 41:28.204
You should come quickly.
He might not have much time.

41:44.645 --> 41:46.159
Dad.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.962
I got here as fast as I could.

41:49.165 --> 41:51.316
I'm right here. Can you hear me?

42:00.445 --> 42:01.481
It was you?

42:01.685 --> 42:03.563
I was counting on you
being the good son.

42:13.045 --> 42:14.923
They'll be here any second.

42:16.725 --> 42:18.557
Room 26, code blue!

42:19.285 --> 42:22.119
We're losing him. We're losing him!
<i>To save his own life,</i>

42:22.325 --> 42:24.920
<i>Yates was willing to take his father's.</i>

42:27.965 --> 42:30.764
<i>Vogel believes I'm just like
all her other experiments,</i>

42:30.965 --> 42:34.117
<i>a psychopath who can't form
real connections.</i>

42:34.365 --> 42:36.004
<i>But she's wrong.</i>

42:36.245 --> 42:39.317
<i>Deb isn't a prop, like Yates' father
was to his son.</i>

42:39.525 --> 42:43.439
<i>She's more than a mirror.
She's family.</i>

42:43.645 --> 42:47.275
<i>If I have a purpose and value
and a right to exist,</i>

42:47.485 --> 42:49.954
<i>so do my feelings for Deb.</i>

42:55.685 --> 42:58.917
<i>This experiment is over.
Vogel can go to hell.</i>

43:01.565 --> 43:03.921
Jamie packing you lunch these days?
It's for you.

43:04.125 --> 43:05.764
Just came back
from Good Samaritan.

43:05.965 --> 43:09.800
Run the blood on the clothes
of a stabbing victim, Janet Thorton.

43:10.005 --> 43:12.076
She still alive?
Still in surgery.

43:12.285 --> 43:15.039
The son of a bitch who stabbed
her broke all of her toes.

43:15.285 --> 43:18.323
How soon do you need this?
Very. On my way to the hospital

43:18.525 --> 43:22.155
to get a statement, soon as docs say
she's out of the woods. Let me know

43:22.365 --> 43:24.675
what comes back on those clothes.
Will do.

43:33.725 --> 43:35.239
Deb.

43:37.205 --> 43:38.241
What the fuck?

43:38.445 --> 43:39.879
Hey.
Hey.

43:40.085 --> 43:41.724
You here to see Dex?

43:41.925 --> 43:43.359
Yeah.

43:43.965 --> 43:46.434
Everything okay?
Because last time I saw you—

43:46.685 --> 43:48.597
Yeah, I am sorry about that.

43:48.805 --> 43:51.365
I'm so sorry I put you
in that position.

43:52.925 --> 43:54.757
Sorry I got mad at you for calling Dex.

43:54.925 --> 43:57.042
No, it's okay. You asked me not to.

43:57.285 --> 43:58.878
I was in a really bad place,

43:59.085 --> 44:03.079
but, you know, you were
just looking out for me,

44:03.325 --> 44:05.237
like you always do.

44:07.485 --> 44:10.080
Things are so easy with you.

44:10.285 --> 44:12.163
I wish it was like that
with Jamie.

44:12.365 --> 44:15.005
I just keep getting
tripped up, you know?

44:15.205 --> 44:18.357
You all all right?
Um, she's jealous.

44:18.565 --> 44:21.524
She thinks there's still
something between us.

44:24.485 --> 44:27.159
Make it work with Jamie. Heh.

44:28.165 --> 44:30.760
I want you happy.

44:33.325 --> 44:35.681
You mean so much to me, Joey.

44:39.005 --> 44:41.395
Don't you fucking forget that.

44:43.285 --> 44:44.958
Thanks.

44:47.445 --> 44:50.756
You sure you're okay?
I gotta go.

44:53.165 --> 44:55.157
Bye, Joey.

44:59.405 --> 45:00.885
<i>Deb.</i>

45:04.405 --> 45:07.637
<i>The body forms scar tissue
to close a wound.</i>

45:09.565 --> 45:12.763
<i>Has my sister begun to do the same?</i>

45:13.005 --> 45:15.474
<i>Eventually, scars fade. Who knows?</i>

45:15.685 --> 45:18.678
<i>With enough time, you may not
even remember how you got them.</i>

45:19.805 --> 45:21.398
Dex.

45:22.765 --> 45:24.677
Hey, Deb. What's up?

45:25.405 --> 45:28.682
We should talk. It's important.

45:28.885 --> 45:30.956
<i>Yates can wait. My sister can't.</i>

45:31.205 --> 45:32.798
Sure, I'd like that.

45:33.845 --> 45:35.484
Just not here.

45:36.405 --> 45:38.158
Can we take a ride?

45:49.285 --> 45:51.163
It's good to see you.

45:52.125 --> 45:54.924
Vogel said it was best
I stay away.

45:55.605 --> 45:57.517
What the fuck
does she know?

46:00.565 --> 46:03.763
If it's any comfort, we're not
on the best of terms anymore.

46:04.885 --> 46:06.797
She doesn't understand us, Dexter.

46:07.005 --> 46:08.598
Exactly.

46:10.165 --> 46:12.555
She said I might lose you,

46:12.885 --> 46:14.444
but we'll always be together, right?

46:22.005 --> 46:24.998
Vogel had these DVDs
of her and Dad.

46:26.125 --> 46:28.003
Did she ever show them to you?

46:28.205 --> 46:30.879
A couple. You?

46:33.405 --> 46:36.523
There was one that was
really interesting. It was, uh,

46:36.805 --> 46:39.559
just before Dad died.
It was his last session with her.

46:49.605 --> 46:51.358
Did Dad kill himself?

46:58.005 --> 46:59.325
Yeah.

47:00.085 --> 47:01.201
A few years back,

47:01.365 --> 47:03.163
Matthews told me the truth.

47:03.725 --> 47:06.877
Harry OD'd
on his heart medication.

47:10.565 --> 47:12.921
Was it because of you?

47:13.125 --> 47:15.685
He thought he'd created a monster.

47:21.805 --> 47:24.161
I think I know how he felt.

47:26.165 --> 47:28.361
Why he killed himself.

47:32.725 --> 47:34.318
But he only got it half right.
