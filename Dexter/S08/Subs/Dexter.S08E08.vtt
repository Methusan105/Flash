00:10.445 --> 00:12.084
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:12.285 --> 00:14.436
Remember me?
What are you doing here?

00:14.605 --> 00:17.165
You should leave
before my husband returns.

00:17.325 --> 00:18.759
Your husband?
Oh, God.

00:18.925 --> 00:21.076
You're still in love with her?
No.

00:21.245 --> 00:23.601
We have got to get her
out of our lives.

00:23.765 --> 00:25.279
What is it you'd like to do?

00:25.445 --> 00:29.041
I would like to take her to Marshal
Services and have her arrested.

00:29.205 --> 00:33.563
When the Brain Surgeon was out there,
I trusted Dexter to solve the problem.

00:33.765 --> 00:35.677
Before you take matters
into your hands,

00:35.845 --> 00:38.440
be sure to consider
all the consequences.

00:38.645 --> 00:41.205
Can I borrow that
high-tech GPS tracker?

00:44.125 --> 00:46.242
Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.

00:46.445 --> 00:49.517
What if you were to teach Zach
the code?

00:50.125 --> 00:52.720
Am I ready to be a spiritual father?

00:53.525 --> 00:55.118
Are you gonna help me be like you?

00:56.805 --> 00:59.639
Hi, Dexter!
Going for a little night swim.

00:59.805 --> 01:02.240
Enjoy.
What the fuck were you thinking?

01:02.405 --> 01:05.364
That asshole is walking around free.
We have nothing.

01:05.525 --> 01:08.359
That's why I was following him.
Let it go. That's an order.

01:08.525 --> 01:10.676
By the way, me and Jamie
are moving in together.

01:10.885 --> 01:12.877
What?
Why did you marry him?

01:13.045 --> 01:14.798
He was there when you weren't.

01:14.965 --> 01:17.275
No, Miles, stop.
You'll never leave this boat.

01:20.965 --> 01:24.402
I told the crew that Miles was
going to New York for a few days.

01:24.605 --> 01:26.915
Please don't leave town
before we talk again.

01:27.605 --> 01:29.198
I won't.

01:33.045 --> 01:37.005
Come on, what the fuck? Dexter!
It looks like he's not home.

01:39.085 --> 01:40.838
Cassie.

01:41.205 --> 01:43.879
Norma Rivera was bludgeoned.

01:44.125 --> 01:46.720
Is it possible Zach did this?

03:49.605 --> 03:51.995
<i>Every contact leaves a trace.</i>

03:52.965 --> 03:56.720
<i>That idea is the foundation
of all crime scene analysis.</i>

04:00.405 --> 04:04.445
<i>I should be focused
on who bludgeoned Cassie and why.</i>

04:05.885 --> 04:07.638
<i>But instead,</i>

04:10.725 --> 04:13.035
<i>ever since Hannah
came back into my orbit,</i>

04:13.205 --> 04:15.197
<i>she's all I can think about.</i>

04:24.845 --> 04:26.677
Manner of death?

04:28.845 --> 04:30.279
Swan.

04:31.445 --> 04:34.438
Killer didn't plan this.
It was impulsive.

04:34.605 --> 04:37.325
<i>This is just how Zach Hamilton
killed Norma Rivera.</i>

04:37.485 --> 04:40.125
She was killed pretty deep
in her apartment.

04:40.285 --> 04:42.356
Like she let the killer in herself.

04:42.525 --> 04:44.278
So she knew him.

04:44.445 --> 04:46.562
That guy she was dating.

04:46.765 --> 04:49.837
You said you were coming here
to pick Cassie up for a date.

04:50.005 --> 04:54.158
Yes, I was late.
Where were you coming from?

04:54.325 --> 04:57.796
I had a— The building inspection.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.161
I'm a structural engineer.

05:00.365 --> 05:04.154
Well, maybe I was wrong.
Maybe it was the repairman
or the delivery guy.

05:04.365 --> 05:05.765
<i>Or Zach Hamilton.</i>

05:05.925 --> 05:08.440
<i>If I'd paid more attention to Zach
instead of being with Hannah,</i>

05:10.565 --> 05:13.205
<i>would Cassie still be alive?</i>

05:21.525 --> 05:23.244
<i>Is that Zach's blood?</i>

05:25.445 --> 05:29.997
<i>Zach knew Cassie.
He met her once, here with me.</i>

05:31.365 --> 05:32.799
Cassie was a good person.

05:32.965 --> 05:36.037
You sure there was no one else
she was having issues with?

05:36.205 --> 05:38.401
I can't think right now.
Will you please—?

05:38.565 --> 05:40.363
It's okay, it's okay.

05:44.525 --> 05:46.437
Hey, Deb. How are you?

05:46.605 --> 05:48.358
I'm okay.
It's good to see you

05:48.525 --> 05:49.515
at a crime scene.

05:49.685 --> 05:51.244
Heh. I'm gonna talk to Dex.

05:51.405 --> 05:52.839
Go ahead.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.636
Harrison's asleep.

06:00.245 --> 06:01.361
Thanks.

06:04.805 --> 06:06.364
That's a break.

06:06.885 --> 06:10.356
Could that be the killer's blood?
Here's hoping.

06:11.525 --> 06:13.357
Are you okay?

06:16.045 --> 06:17.718
Sure.

06:17.885 --> 06:20.445
Why the fuck do I even ask?

06:20.765 --> 06:22.040
What about Hannah?

06:23.125 --> 06:25.594
What about her?
Is she still here?

06:25.765 --> 06:26.881
Hey, Deb.

06:27.045 --> 06:28.923
Hey.

06:29.085 --> 06:32.283
Who would want to kill Cassie?
She owe people money?

06:32.445 --> 06:35.882
We're looking into that.
What about customers or a vendor?

06:37.045 --> 06:40.482
Sorry.
I have no fucking business being here.

06:40.645 --> 06:42.921
Any time you wanna come back,
the door's always open.

06:43.685 --> 06:46.519
Maybe I'll put an application
in the mail.

06:47.685 --> 06:50.245
I'll come back to finish
this conversation, yeah?

06:50.845 --> 06:52.245
Okay.

06:53.405 --> 06:54.885
<i>Can't wait.</i>

06:59.125 --> 07:02.516
<i>I would give everything
to feel nothing again.</i>

07:17.525 --> 07:19.994
We need to get you out of town
as soon as possible.

07:20.485 --> 07:23.205
I need a new passport.
I have a guy that can do that.

07:23.365 --> 07:27.120
I'll find out what he needs.
That's just a phone call.

07:27.525 --> 07:32.600
You could have phoned me, rather
than driving all the way down here.

07:33.205 --> 07:35.436
This was on the way to the lab.

07:36.045 --> 07:39.641
This marina is not
on the way to the lab.

07:42.565 --> 07:44.318
You know, we, um...

07:44.885 --> 07:48.196
We missed a spot of blood
cleaning up.

07:48.645 --> 07:50.762
No, we didn't.
Edge of the whisky bottle.

07:50.925 --> 07:53.042
I noticed it this morning.

07:56.165 --> 08:00.444
I was so glad to see it
because it reminded me of you.

08:03.165 --> 08:05.202
Did you clean it up?

08:05.365 --> 08:06.924
Yes, I cleaned it up.

08:07.365 --> 08:09.834
With bleach?
Yes.

08:13.165 --> 08:15.760
Miami is not the place
for you to be right now.

08:17.125 --> 08:19.481
The sooner we get you out of here,
the better.

08:21.085 --> 08:23.281
I completely agree.

08:40.205 --> 08:43.004
<i>It is Zach's blood
under Cassie's nails.</i>

08:43.165 --> 08:45.725
<i>He killed another innocent woman.</i>

08:46.125 --> 08:49.243
<i>What a waste.
He could have had a great future.</i>

08:50.445 --> 08:54.200
<i>Miami Metro can never know.
It's one small step from Zach to me.</i>

08:54.365 --> 08:55.685
Hey, Dex.

08:55.845 --> 08:58.883
Remember Niki, the apple
that didn't fall too far from my tree?

08:59.045 --> 09:00.445
Hi.
Hi.

09:00.645 --> 09:04.082
Around here we call Dexter
"the king of spatter."

09:04.245 --> 09:07.602
We do?
I do, in private.

09:08.645 --> 09:12.321
Hey, feel free to send
any and all paperwork her way.

09:14.005 --> 09:15.519
Here you go.
Oh, uh,

09:15.685 --> 09:17.995
the blood under Cassie's nails?

09:18.205 --> 09:19.798
No luck. It was hers.

09:19.965 --> 09:23.436
From a transfer
after her head started to bleed.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.996
"The victim collapsed
into a pool of her own blood."

09:27.165 --> 09:29.555
Hey, are you—?
Are you okay with all this?

09:29.725 --> 09:33.765
I mean, I am a little bit worried
about the energy around here.

09:33.925 --> 09:36.724
Well, then maybe we can hang
a crystal in the corner.

09:37.085 --> 09:40.681
Yeah, we should sage the place first.

09:42.325 --> 09:43.918
Could I talk to you for a sec?

09:44.085 --> 09:45.997
Actually, I'm—
Real quick.

09:46.765 --> 09:48.643
You recognise these?

09:49.205 --> 09:51.720
Yeah, I took them.
Yeah, now look at these.

09:51.885 --> 09:54.161
Norma Rivera, Cassie Jollenston.

09:54.365 --> 09:56.402
Are they fucking similar, or what?

09:57.525 --> 10:01.360
They were both bludgeoned.
Bludgeonings can look
pretty fucking similar.

10:01.925 --> 10:04.485
Do you think Zach Hamilton
could have done this?

10:05.365 --> 10:08.437
Zach knew Norma. How could
he have possibly known Cassie?

10:08.605 --> 10:12.394
I know, it's crazy, I—
What's crazy is Batista and Matthews

10:12.565 --> 10:15.319
wanted you to lay off
looking into this Hamilton kid.

10:15.885 --> 10:18.764
This Hamilton kid
is a fucking monster.
You know it too.

10:18.925 --> 10:22.396
Not really.
I think you should drop this.
Think about your career.

10:22.605 --> 10:25.404
It's not like I'm gonna make sergeant.
Do me a favour.

10:25.605 --> 10:28.200
You see any of Zach's DNA
at the crime scene, just let me know.

10:29.125 --> 10:31.003
Absolutely.

10:32.765 --> 10:34.961
He hasn't returned my calls.

10:36.005 --> 10:41.524
I tried to reach him too.
I spoke to his parents,
they haven't seen him.

10:41.685 --> 10:44.917
He could be on the run,
hiding out somewhere.

10:45.125 --> 10:47.560
Were you with that Hannah person?

10:48.645 --> 10:50.637
Is that why this woman is dead?

10:51.525 --> 10:55.519
She's dead because you talked me out
of killing Zach in the first place.

10:56.085 --> 11:00.238
He showed real potential.
You saw that.

11:01.805 --> 11:03.797
I thought you were having
an impact on him.

11:04.805 --> 11:09.721
Zach spoke to me of trying to live up
to your rules, your standards.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.240
I thought he was processing it all.

11:14.445 --> 11:16.721
Yeah, Zach's smart,
but he can't control himself.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.558
We both should have seen that.

11:18.725 --> 11:20.876
Zach's just a boy.

11:23.005 --> 11:25.236
A boy who knows
too much about me,

11:25.605 --> 11:29.281
about you,
who's killed two innocent women.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.684
No, I guess you don't have
many options, do you?

11:34.885 --> 11:36.319
No.

11:38.605 --> 11:44.715
I wonder if it will be different for you,
because of what could have been.

11:45.245 --> 11:48.556
I doubt it.
But surely there have been

11:49.645 --> 11:52.763
people that were
more difficult for you to—

11:52.925 --> 11:56.362
How do you like to say it?
Take care of.

11:56.525 --> 11:59.359
Zach Hamilton is not one of them.

12:02.045 --> 12:04.435
I'm not sure I believe you.

12:13.405 --> 12:15.556
<i>Zach rented a room in Fiesta Key.</i>

12:15.725 --> 12:18.524
<i>He's on the run,
and using his own credit card.</i>

12:18.685 --> 12:21.154
<i>Rookie mistake.</i>

12:27.245 --> 12:30.716
<i>I forget the impact murder has
on real people.</i>

12:37.605 --> 12:39.005
Deb.

12:41.085 --> 12:44.874
Ahem. Any luck?
With what?

12:45.925 --> 12:48.838
Cassie's case?
Is that why you're here?

12:49.005 --> 12:50.439
No.

12:51.925 --> 12:54.759
Hey, Jamie.
How are you doing?

12:54.965 --> 12:57.605
I don't know how you two
do this every day.

12:57.765 --> 12:59.324
I don't.

12:59.885 --> 13:01.319
Right.

13:10.685 --> 13:16.158
On a scale of one to 10,
10 being out of our lives forever,

13:16.525 --> 13:19.040
where the fuck is Hannah?
She's not a threat.

13:19.205 --> 13:21.800
Last time we talked,
you said, "I'm on top of it."

13:21.965 --> 13:25.242
And I am.
Are you on top of it, or on top of her?

13:25.405 --> 13:27.203
Deb—
Is she in Miami?

13:29.885 --> 13:33.481
What the fuck is she doing here?
It has to do with her husband.

13:33.645 --> 13:37.355
The casino guy?
He's abusive, verbally and physically.

13:37.925 --> 13:39.882
They seem perfect.

13:40.045 --> 13:44.119
What about him?
She wanted me to—

13:44.805 --> 13:48.515
Why didn't she do it herself?
Too much scrutiny.

13:50.485 --> 13:52.238
Did you do it?

13:53.205 --> 13:54.639
No.

13:54.805 --> 13:57.161
Well, that must have pissed her off.

13:58.085 --> 14:00.236
What's to keep her
from trying to kill us again?

14:00.445 --> 14:03.324
She didn't try to kill us.
She wanted my attention.

14:03.485 --> 14:06.842
By poisoning me and leaving you
on the side of the fucking road?

14:09.245 --> 14:11.760
You have the fucking altitude
to see all of this,

14:11.925 --> 14:15.282
that she's using you,
and you still want to protect her?

14:17.725 --> 14:20.638
Once she gets her passport,
she'll be out of our lives forever.

14:23.365 --> 14:24.799
You believe that?
I do.

14:24.965 --> 14:28.800
Well, that's the thing
that you can't see,
that you're lying to yourself.

14:29.525 --> 14:31.517
She's a murderer.

14:31.925 --> 14:34.156
She needs to be locked up.
She could talk.

14:34.325 --> 14:37.602
After LaGuerta, I can't afford
another round of questions.

14:38.205 --> 14:43.234
She's a fugitive. She's a poisoner.
She's easily discredited.

14:44.765 --> 14:46.324
Enough already.

14:59.325 --> 15:04.081
We were supposed
to have lunch together,
Cassie and me.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.402
Jamie, I'm sorry.

15:07.245 --> 15:09.714
I can't be here right now.

15:10.365 --> 15:13.005
I can take Harrison with me.

15:13.165 --> 15:14.918
I moved in with Joey.

15:16.285 --> 15:19.005
Oh.
I thought we'd go there,

15:19.165 --> 15:21.600
since you're on the next few days.

15:21.765 --> 15:23.484
I mean, if that's okay with you.

15:23.645 --> 15:25.762
Yeah, that's okay with me.

15:33.925 --> 15:35.723
Don't smile?

15:41.085 --> 15:44.362
Just send this
to the passport guy.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.685
He'll have a new identity

15:47.885 --> 15:50.957
and all the paperwork for you
by tomorrow.

15:51.125 --> 15:53.401
Do I get to pick my name?

15:53.845 --> 15:56.076
I doubt it, but I'll ask.

15:56.325 --> 15:59.045
So does he drop it off, or—?

15:59.205 --> 16:04.883
No, I will.
Okay, so just wait here?

16:06.205 --> 16:08.765
Maybe you should come with me.
Where?

16:08.925 --> 16:12.601
I have to go to the Keys tonight.
The Keys?

16:13.325 --> 16:15.044
It would just be for the night.

16:19.325 --> 16:21.078
Besides, it's not safe for you
to be here.

16:21.765 --> 16:24.519
Safe?
You know, alone.

16:24.685 --> 16:29.316
I sent the crew away for a few hours
because I knew that you were coming.

16:29.485 --> 16:32.000
They can protect me
from almost anything.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.725
It's the "almost" that concerns me.

16:37.245 --> 16:39.237
So, what's in the Keys,

16:39.405 --> 16:41.556
or should I say who is in the Keys?

16:41.725 --> 16:43.876
I'll tell you on the way down.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.605
How would you like to make
a boatload of cash?

16:49.765 --> 16:51.916
I'm assuming that's
a rhetorical question.

16:52.085 --> 16:54.316
U.S. Marshal Service
is offering $25,000

16:54.485 --> 16:57.319
for information leading
to the arrest of Hannah McKay.

16:57.485 --> 17:00.080
Sal Price's publisher is
offering another 125,000,

17:00.245 --> 17:02.805
his family, another hundred.
Put that together—

17:03.005 --> 17:07.397
Two-fifty. Yeah, I can do math.
I think Hannah McKay is back in Miami.

17:08.045 --> 17:11.880
And you think this because...?
Are you interested or not?

17:12.845 --> 17:14.404
Very.

17:19.485 --> 17:23.240
No fucking way. They're gone.

17:23.405 --> 17:25.203
You sure this is the Castner slip?

17:25.365 --> 17:27.880
I'm sure.
You sure McKay was under the alias

17:28.045 --> 17:30.685
of "Maggie Castner"?
Yes.

17:31.685 --> 17:33.563
What, you don't believe me?

17:34.485 --> 17:37.956
Lot of pretty blond girls in Miami.
You sure Hannah McKay was here?

17:38.165 --> 17:41.681
I know for a fucking fact that she was.
How?

17:42.565 --> 17:43.794
I just do.

17:45.525 --> 17:49.804
You really don't like her, do you?
Nope.

17:50.005 --> 17:52.998
I'm just saying, emotions cloud
your judgement, you know?

17:53.165 --> 17:55.999
You keep it about the money,
someday you may have a yacht.

17:56.165 --> 17:58.521
I don't want a fucking yacht.
Well, I do.

17:58.725 --> 18:01.445
So let's keep it
about my money, all right?

18:02.605 --> 18:06.121
So the yacht may be gone,
but we don't know if they were on it.

18:07.805 --> 18:10.274
Maybe the dock master
knows something. I'll see.

18:10.485 --> 18:12.238
I'll meet you back at the office,
all right?

18:16.045 --> 18:20.085
Joey, I don't want to be here alone.

18:20.765 --> 18:22.438
You're not alone, you got the kid.

18:23.285 --> 18:25.595
My name is Harrison.

18:25.765 --> 18:29.679
And a fine name that is.
Don't you got some cartoons to watch?

18:30.725 --> 18:35.197
Joey, I am freaking out.
My friend was murdered.

18:35.565 --> 18:39.605
I— Look, I know,
but once I catch the killer,

18:39.805 --> 18:42.195
you're not gonna have
to be scared anymore, okay?

18:43.685 --> 18:47.235
You know,
if it were Deb asking you to stay,
you wouldn't even put up a fight.

18:48.485 --> 18:50.317
Deb wouldn't ask me to stay.

18:50.525 --> 18:52.881
She'd want to catch the killer
as bad as I do.

18:53.045 --> 18:55.082
Sorry I'm not Deb.

18:58.125 --> 19:00.196
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

19:00.365 --> 19:03.563
You need me to stay here,
I'll stay here, okay?

19:17.805 --> 19:20.365
Motherfuck it.

19:24.365 --> 19:25.799
Hey, Deb, what's up?

19:25.965 --> 19:29.163
<i>Hey, just checking in about Hannah.</i>

19:29.325 --> 19:31.601
I haven't seen her.

19:31.765 --> 19:34.485
<i>Where are you?</i>
Grabbing some dinner.

19:34.645 --> 19:36.841
Oh, yeah? Want company?

19:37.485 --> 19:39.124
No, I'm good.
<i>No, seriously.</i>

19:39.325 --> 19:42.318
I'll join you. Where are you?
<i>Um...</i>

19:43.765 --> 19:45.165
Look at a fucking street sign.

19:46.365 --> 19:48.834
I'm on the highway.
How about tomorrow?

19:50.725 --> 19:52.205
Sure.

19:55.365 --> 19:57.357
Dick for brains.

19:59.525 --> 20:02.165
She's a ray of sunshine, isn't she?

20:08.605 --> 20:10.722
So, what'd you say to the crew?

20:10.885 --> 20:13.116
I told them
to head on to St. Kitts.

20:13.525 --> 20:16.438
It was our next stop
after Miami anyway.

20:17.005 --> 20:20.885
They're paid not to ask questions.
Hm.

20:23.485 --> 20:24.919
So who are you after?

20:25.765 --> 20:27.802
His name is Zach.

20:28.165 --> 20:30.077
What did Zach do?

20:30.645 --> 20:32.762
Disappoint me.

20:33.405 --> 20:36.637
He was someone
Dr. Vogel thought I could, uh,

20:36.805 --> 20:38.000
mentor.

20:38.165 --> 20:40.043
Who's Dr. Vogel?

20:40.205 --> 20:43.721
Dr. Evelyn Vogel.
She studies psychopaths.

20:44.285 --> 20:47.801
My father went to see her about me.

20:47.965 --> 20:50.844
Heh. How did that conversation go?

20:51.005 --> 20:53.884
"Hey, I've got this son
who has these urges."

20:54.045 --> 20:56.002
He was at the end of his rope.

20:58.045 --> 21:01.675
Dr. Vogel's the one who came up
with the idea of the code.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.359
She...

21:04.285 --> 21:05.435
created me.

21:08.205 --> 21:10.640
Wow.
I know.

21:11.245 --> 21:13.635
So how does it feel
to finally meet her,

21:13.805 --> 21:16.001
to find out that she even existed?

21:16.165 --> 21:18.555
Like finding a family member.

21:24.005 --> 21:26.076
Well, she must be very proud of you.

21:29.965 --> 21:33.959
Are there others of you out there?
Just Zach, as far as I know.

21:34.125 --> 21:35.844
She thought he...

21:37.285 --> 21:39.436
She saw a little of me in him,

21:39.605 --> 21:41.562
or who I used to be.

21:41.725 --> 21:43.523
Focused.

21:43.925 --> 21:45.439
Driven.

21:46.525 --> 21:50.280
There's one big difference though.
He'd already killed an innocent woman

21:50.445 --> 21:54.200
when I met him,
and now he's killed another.

21:55.245 --> 21:57.123
So he's a terrible student.

21:58.605 --> 22:01.564
I wasn't exactly a hands-on teacher.

22:04.285 --> 22:05.958
He's fled to the Keys.

22:06.125 --> 22:09.118
I can't have him
out there in the world.

22:09.285 --> 22:11.845
He's a problem
you have to solve.

22:17.285 --> 22:21.245
I was a problem you had to solve too,
and I escaped.

22:23.685 --> 22:26.598
How come you never tried to find me?

22:27.605 --> 22:29.324
And do what?

22:30.365 --> 22:32.561
Solve the problem.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.961
I liked knowing you were out there.

22:49.405 --> 22:50.839
Elway, it's me.

22:51.005 --> 22:52.883
<i>Hey, I was just about to call you.</i>

22:53.045 --> 22:54.843
<i>Dockmaster ends up
being a gabby fuck.</i>

22:55.005 --> 22:57.474
He heard Mr. Castner
flew yesterday to New York

22:57.645 --> 23:01.480
sans Mrs. Castner, who just sent
the yacht to St. Kitts earlier today.

23:01.645 --> 23:04.956
Where she is now is anybody's guess.
I'll venture one, the Keys.

23:05.125 --> 23:07.959
<i>Is this something you just know,
or you have a source?</i>

23:08.125 --> 23:10.481
I'm on my way down there now
to check it out.

23:10.645 --> 23:12.796
You know about her husband
being with her?

23:12.965 --> 23:14.604
<i>You said Castner was in New York.</i>

23:14.765 --> 23:17.485
I checked the airport, the Gulfstream
never left the tarmac, so...

23:20.325 --> 23:23.159
I wonder if she killed him.
<i>Heh-heh-heh. There's a leap.</i>

23:23.325 --> 23:24.839
That's what she fucking does.

23:25.005 --> 23:27.474
She murders people
and she gets away with it.

23:27.645 --> 23:29.955
I cannot wait to fucking find her.

23:30.125 --> 23:32.799
Remember what I said.
No crusaders on the payroll.

23:32.965 --> 23:36.675
<i>Let's find her, let's bring her in,
let's get paid, okay? Thank you.</i>

23:45.805 --> 23:47.239
Shrimp?

23:48.085 --> 23:49.599
Yeah.

23:50.285 --> 23:52.083
Bottom feeders.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.365
Uh-huh.

23:56.445 --> 23:59.199
They eat all the garbage
at the bottom of the ocean.

24:00.085 --> 24:02.805
They take out the trash.
Mm.

24:03.245 --> 24:06.283
Is that what you do?
You take out the trash?

24:07.725 --> 24:09.956
Thought might have crossed my mind.

24:14.405 --> 24:17.682
You have all these clever sayings
inside your head, don't you?

24:17.845 --> 24:20.917
About what you do and who you are.

24:21.085 --> 24:25.159
Yeah, I think a lot.
Mm. I'm sure you do.

24:28.005 --> 24:31.840
So, what brilliant turn of phrase
have you come up with to describe me?

24:33.325 --> 24:35.442
The evil temptress?

24:36.525 --> 24:37.925
Passionate poisoner?

24:38.125 --> 24:39.559
Heh.

24:40.805 --> 24:42.717
Fiendish florist.

24:49.925 --> 24:53.805
Really, when you're lying in bed at night
and I happen to cross your mind,

24:53.965 --> 24:55.684
what do you call me?

24:59.325 --> 25:00.918
Hannah.

25:03.365 --> 25:05.163
You're just Hannah.

25:14.125 --> 25:16.321
You're such a flirt.

25:16.485 --> 25:20.843
No, I'm not. I'm just being honest.
Please, you're the master manipulator.

25:21.045 --> 25:23.560
I am?
Yes, you are.

25:23.725 --> 25:29.039
Is that what you call me?
No, I have a million names for you.

25:29.205 --> 25:31.595
Really? I'd love to hear them.

25:40.645 --> 25:41.874
What can I get you guys?

26:11.565 --> 26:13.875
Are you sure this is the place?

26:23.205 --> 26:25.242
Just wait in the car.

26:48.965 --> 26:50.957
<i>What is all this?</i>

27:13.205 --> 27:15.242
A for effort, huh?

27:15.685 --> 27:17.995
He made a lot of mistakes.

27:18.725 --> 27:21.240
But for a first try, it's not bad.

27:21.525 --> 27:24.802
It's not bad. No.

27:26.765 --> 27:28.916
It's not great either.

27:30.285 --> 27:32.356
Better than your first try.

27:33.965 --> 27:35.763
Do you have to do this?

27:36.845 --> 27:38.643
Yes, I do.

27:42.005 --> 27:44.998
And when I find him,
I'll use this room.

27:51.205 --> 27:54.562
Detective Quinn.
Hey, how are you holding up?

27:55.525 --> 27:57.801
I haven't slept much, to be honest.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.518
We, uh,

28:02.005 --> 28:05.237
talked about a life together,
Cassie and I.

28:05.405 --> 28:08.364
I know it's fast, but—
No, no, no.

28:08.525 --> 28:11.643
I move fast too. Too fast.

28:12.485 --> 28:15.603
Well, when it's right...

28:16.925 --> 28:18.678
You're going through a tough time.

28:18.885 --> 28:22.356
I was wondering if you could
take a look at a photo for me.

28:23.205 --> 28:25.515
Have you seen that kid
around Cassie?

28:25.725 --> 28:27.284
Maybe at her food truck?

28:28.005 --> 28:29.758
Is this who you think killed her?

28:31.525 --> 28:33.118
Just a person of interest.

28:35.205 --> 28:37.037
I don't know him.

28:38.005 --> 28:40.122
He looks familiar, but...

28:40.405 --> 28:41.919
I'm sorry.

28:55.805 --> 28:57.717
What on earth
is your daughter doing?

28:58.205 --> 29:01.243
She's just clearing
the bad murder juju out of the lab.

29:02.005 --> 29:06.522
Does she realise this is a department
founded in bad murder juju?

29:08.445 --> 29:10.914
Where are we on this
Cassie Jollenston murder?

29:11.085 --> 29:13.680
Been working on the customers
from her food truck,

29:13.845 --> 29:18.522
but most of them paid in cash, so...
So they're hard to track down.

29:18.685 --> 29:22.395
Any other leads?
None worth talking about.

29:26.565 --> 29:30.115
I thought you said you weren't
a real hands-on teacher.

29:30.605 --> 29:32.198
I didn't teach him this.

29:32.525 --> 29:34.642
You did this to him?

29:34.805 --> 29:37.957
Yes.
And he escaped.

29:39.085 --> 29:41.077
I let him go.

29:41.805 --> 29:43.398
Like me?

29:45.525 --> 29:47.084
Not quite.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.162
Dexter? What the fuck?

29:52.645 --> 29:54.876
I told you to control yourself,
and what did you do?

29:55.045 --> 29:56.843
You killed Cassie.
Cassie?

29:57.005 --> 29:59.042
Who's Cass—?
Who the fuck is that?

29:59.405 --> 30:01.920
You killed her next door to me,
to my son!

30:02.085 --> 30:04.919
No, no, no!
I went after Shawn Decker.

30:05.085 --> 30:06.963
Shawn Decker, who is that?
Wait.

30:07.125 --> 30:09.924
Aren't you that old guy's wife?
Your ex-girlfriend?

30:10.325 --> 30:11.725
She's with me now.

30:11.885 --> 30:14.764
Nice. Did you take out
her husband?

30:18.365 --> 30:22.245
Who is Shawn Decker?
This asshole I knew in high school.

30:22.405 --> 30:25.796
He offed a girl two years ago
on spring break
then bragged about it.

30:25.965 --> 30:27.797
Is she cool?
Yes.

30:27.965 --> 30:29.797
She's cool.

30:29.965 --> 30:31.399
Where were you two days ago?

30:31.605 --> 30:33.676
I stopped by your place
after you blew me off,

30:33.845 --> 30:37.202
then I came straight here.
I met your neighbour, the hot one.

30:37.365 --> 30:39.038
That was Cassie.

30:40.405 --> 30:42.556
She was alive when I left.

30:42.725 --> 30:45.957
I've been on Shawn the whole time.
I'll show you on my camera.

30:50.165 --> 30:52.634
How did you—?
How did you find me?

30:52.805 --> 30:54.683
I tracked your credit card.

30:54.845 --> 30:56.518
Right.

30:56.765 --> 30:59.200
Shouldn't use my own card,
fuck-up on my part.

30:59.365 --> 31:02.403
What'd you think of the room?
Did you do something to it?

31:02.565 --> 31:04.602
Just show me the pictures.
Sorry.

31:05.725 --> 31:07.682
This is Shawn Decker.

31:08.965 --> 31:10.604
He lives here.

31:12.085 --> 31:15.442
You can see by the time stamp,
I've been hunting him.

31:16.565 --> 31:19.399
So I decided to go after a killer.

31:21.565 --> 31:23.682
Someone who deserves it.

31:24.405 --> 31:27.921
<i>He was following the code
without even knowing it.</i>

31:28.525 --> 31:30.403
Do you have proof
that Shawn killed someone?

31:30.565 --> 31:32.636
Yeah, he pulled me aside at a party,

31:32.805 --> 31:35.957
showed me this video
of this redhead he met in Daytona.

31:36.165 --> 31:40.956
He accidentally strangled her
while they were having sex.

31:41.605 --> 31:46.282
Believe me,
world's better off without him.

31:47.885 --> 31:49.717
Where is Shawn now?

31:56.845 --> 31:58.245
It—

31:58.405 --> 32:02.922
It didn't go exactly as I planned.
I thought I could just knock him out.

32:03.085 --> 32:05.441
You sedated me, didn't you?
What did you use?

32:05.605 --> 32:07.801
What happened?
I hit him over the head,

32:07.965 --> 32:09.399
but it wasn't hard enough.

32:09.565 --> 32:14.720
He barely went down,
so I just kept hitting him,
like, a lot.

32:14.885 --> 32:16.365
Did anyone see you?

32:16.525 --> 32:17.800
No, we were alone.

32:17.965 --> 32:20.400
What were you planning
on doing with the body?

32:20.565 --> 32:21.999
I didn't totally know.

32:22.165 --> 32:24.919
I was gonna come back here,
get my camera, my knives,

32:25.085 --> 32:28.396
I don't know, guess I just thought
drop him in the Everglades—

32:28.565 --> 32:31.717
So you didn't have a plan.
I did. I was gonna do it here.

32:31.885 --> 32:33.922
I mean, this place isn't bad, is it?

32:34.085 --> 32:35.963
You see that second floor?

32:36.125 --> 32:38.640
Anyone could see you
moving a body.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.640
That wasn't on the website.
Pick a different place.

32:41.805 --> 32:43.364
I'd already paid for the room.

32:43.565 --> 32:47.718
You need to have a plan
and a backup plan, always.

32:47.885 --> 32:51.515
Driving with a body in your trunk
in this heat is no plan at all.

32:51.685 --> 32:53.563
You didn't even put plastic
in your car.

32:53.725 --> 32:56.285
Oh, okay, that would've been
a good idea, yeah.

32:57.725 --> 32:59.444
You and I are gonna
deal with this body,

32:59.605 --> 33:03.201
and then scrub the car clean of DNA,
because one drop of blood,

33:03.365 --> 33:07.325
a single hair,
could lead straight back to you.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.636
Then after that,
we're gonna dump the car.

33:09.845 --> 33:12.076
Well, how am I gonna get home?

33:12.245 --> 33:14.077
We'll take you.

33:14.525 --> 33:15.561
Awesome.

33:16.805 --> 33:19.365
Can you deal with the room?
We should be a few hours.

33:19.525 --> 33:21.278
Yeah, drive safe.

33:25.445 --> 33:26.879
Dude.

33:27.045 --> 33:30.641
Do not "dude" me.
Get in the car.

33:30.805 --> 33:32.478
Watch yourself on the handle.

33:32.645 --> 33:35.399
I cut myself on that piece of shit
a few days ago.

33:38.285 --> 33:41.403
Have you cut yourself on this before?
No.

33:42.885 --> 33:48.040
<i>Is that somehow how Zach's blood
ended up under Cassie's nails?</i>

33:49.285 --> 33:51.083
I bled all over the place.

33:52.405 --> 33:53.839
Look.

33:56.925 --> 33:59.076
Fuck me. Gloves!

33:59.245 --> 34:01.441
Just put your seat belt on.

34:18.285 --> 34:20.356
Hannah-fucking-McKay.

34:21.285 --> 34:23.595
Don't even think about it.
Where's Dexter?

34:23.765 --> 34:26.564
Out.
Great, that'll make this a lot easier.

34:26.725 --> 34:28.523
I'm supposed to just put those on?

34:28.685 --> 34:31.564
You're under arrest.
You're not a police officer anymore.

34:31.725 --> 34:33.523
Citizen's arrest.
Oh, right, really?

34:33.685 --> 34:36.484
How about I arrest you
for aiding a serial killer?

34:36.645 --> 34:39.843
You want that information out?
Talk all you fucking like.

34:40.005 --> 34:44.796
No one would fucking believe you.
Better people than you have tried it.

34:44.965 --> 34:46.001
Go ahead.
No!

34:46.165 --> 34:49.636
The only way I'm leaving
is if you shoot me,
and you're not gonna.

34:52.765 --> 34:56.918
I have done terrible things in my past,
but I've come to realise that as people,

34:57.085 --> 34:59.645
we're all horribly flawed,
some more than others.

34:59.805 --> 35:03.196
I'm not interested.
But we all have a will to survive,

35:03.365 --> 35:07.075
and when in extreme situations,
people do extreme things.

35:08.405 --> 35:09.839
That doesn't make it right.

35:10.045 --> 35:12.560
Right or wrong doesn't make it
into the equation.

35:12.725 --> 35:16.514
There are other forces driving us.
What's driving you?

35:17.525 --> 35:19.118
Dexter.

35:27.005 --> 35:28.997
The passing of the torch.

35:30.085 --> 35:32.395
I taught you the code.

35:32.565 --> 35:34.602
Now he's learning it from you.

35:34.765 --> 35:36.518
And look at him.

35:37.925 --> 35:40.645
You used to feel like that after a kill.

35:41.085 --> 35:44.283
At peace.
Life was so simple then.

35:45.445 --> 35:49.564
Killing consumed you,
crept into everything you did.

35:49.725 --> 35:51.717
It was all you had.

35:52.445 --> 35:54.164
But now?

35:54.725 --> 35:57.035
Now I have Harrison.

35:57.365 --> 35:59.800
He isn't a complication.

35:59.965 --> 36:01.763
Hannah is.

36:02.685 --> 36:04.677
She's more of a...

36:05.125 --> 36:06.957
distraction.

36:07.965 --> 36:11.641
Or is it possible
there's a stronger desire in you now?

36:12.005 --> 36:14.281
Stronger than the need to kill?

36:22.885 --> 36:25.002
I don't enjoy killing.

36:25.205 --> 36:26.605
Why do you do it?

36:26.765 --> 36:29.121
Sometimes it's the only way
to solve a problem.

36:29.285 --> 36:32.198
When somebody comes at me
or threatens me, my life—

36:32.365 --> 36:35.005
Like me?
I could've killed you the other day

36:35.165 --> 36:37.725
and it would've made
my life easier, but I didn't.

36:37.925 --> 36:40.599
Why?
Because I love your brother, and I—

36:40.805 --> 36:44.355
I've learned how much
he cares about you.
I didn't want to hurt him.

36:48.005 --> 36:50.679
He loves me too.
Do you really want to hurt him?

36:52.365 --> 36:53.799
Fuck.

36:58.845 --> 37:01.405
My brother screws up everything.

37:12.805 --> 37:15.923
Oh, you're both still breathing.
That's a good sign.

37:16.365 --> 37:19.039
What are you doing here?
I came here for her.

37:19.205 --> 37:21.959
But how did you—?
GPS. I put it under your car.

37:22.125 --> 37:24.481
You what?
I knew you wouldn't stay away.

37:25.565 --> 37:29.525
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

37:32.405 --> 37:35.682
I don't want to know.
I don't want to know anything else ever.

37:35.845 --> 37:37.916
She's your problem now.

37:40.605 --> 37:42.198
Dude.

37:42.645 --> 37:45.797
I'm sorry,
you got girls fighting over you?

37:48.845 --> 37:50.359
Let's get out of here.

38:01.845 --> 38:03.484
Are we there yet?

38:11.005 --> 38:11.995
Zach.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.804
Hey.

38:13.965 --> 38:18.084
Zach, it turns out, is a fast learner.

38:19.965 --> 38:24.323
Well, I'm very relieved to hear that.
Why don't you come in, have dinner?

38:24.485 --> 38:27.125
I'm starving.
I can't.

38:29.165 --> 38:30.679
Who is that in the car?

38:32.085 --> 38:33.883
That's Hannah.

38:34.605 --> 38:36.119
Hannah McKay?

38:37.405 --> 38:39.078
You weren't going
to introduce us?

38:39.245 --> 38:43.239
Well, we've had a really long drive,
and she's leaving early tomorrow.

38:43.405 --> 38:46.125
I think we're tired.
Surely, you must be hungry.

38:46.285 --> 38:47.799
She can join us for dinner.

38:47.965 --> 38:49.524
No, that's not—
I insist.

38:50.085 --> 38:52.645
Either you invite her in or I will.

39:20.845 --> 39:24.122
Dr. Vogel, um, this is Hannah.

39:24.285 --> 39:27.323
Hi, nice to meet you.
Pleasure.

39:27.485 --> 39:29.044
Call me Evelyn.

39:33.005 --> 39:35.076
I trust there are no vegetarians here.

39:36.645 --> 39:38.159
Hand me your plate.

39:40.525 --> 39:41.925
It looks delicious.

39:42.085 --> 39:45.601
An old family recipe.
Hope it holds out.

39:45.765 --> 39:48.121
I can pass it along to you
if you'd like.

39:48.325 --> 39:50.635
I guess you know your way
around the kitchen.

39:50.805 --> 39:52.239
I'm an okay cook.

39:52.405 --> 39:54.362
You're better than okay.

39:55.005 --> 39:56.758
Well, I prefer gardening.

39:57.245 --> 39:59.362
Bringing things to life.

39:59.525 --> 40:01.118
Perfect.

40:02.085 --> 40:06.318
The best hobbies are the ones
that take us furthest
from our primary occupation.

40:08.885 --> 40:10.842
So you have a fascinating field.

40:11.005 --> 40:13.236
How did you get interested in it?

40:15.165 --> 40:18.442
Oh, an incident long ago
that I won't bore you with.

40:20.165 --> 40:24.398
As to what keeps me
interested, well...

40:25.245 --> 40:27.202
look around the table.

40:28.245 --> 40:29.759
Elbows.

40:31.725 --> 40:36.720
I've always maintained
that the greatest obstacle
in life isn't danger,

40:36.885 --> 40:38.001
it's boredom.

40:38.205 --> 40:40.356
Boredom?
Mm. The battle against it

40:40.525 --> 40:43.199
is responsible for most
of the events in the world,

40:43.365 --> 40:46.085
good or ill. I'm convinced of it.

40:46.765 --> 40:49.599
Anyway, my patients
never fail to surprise.

40:49.805 --> 40:53.594
They make life interesting,
thus, worth living.

40:56.485 --> 40:59.637
For example,
I would never have imagined

40:59.805 --> 41:04.243
that the affection you two share
could be possible,

41:04.445 --> 41:06.755
for people like yourselves.

41:07.565 --> 41:10.717
You are obviously
quite taken with each other.

41:11.365 --> 41:14.756
You both have
a healthy blush response.

41:15.965 --> 41:19.436
I'm embarrassing you.
Gee, you think?

41:19.605 --> 41:22.200
The truth is,
you make a good couple.

41:23.725 --> 41:25.364
And probably a bad one too.

41:25.845 --> 41:27.438
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

41:33.205 --> 41:36.516
Mm. There's too much red wine.

41:36.725 --> 41:38.876
Yeah, there is.
No, it's perfect.

41:41.765 --> 41:45.361
Dexter, you haven't said much.
Something on your mind?

41:46.845 --> 41:49.519
It's, uh, Cassie's murder.

41:50.245 --> 41:53.283
I doubt there's anything
this table can't handle.

41:57.085 --> 41:59.475
The scene, it doesn't make sense.

42:01.485 --> 42:03.363
Did you take any pictures?

42:07.325 --> 42:09.157
Whoa.

42:09.365 --> 42:11.596
It's just like Norma Rivera.

42:12.325 --> 42:14.044
Look at the blood.

42:15.245 --> 42:19.285
When someone's
bludgeoned to death,
blood is no longer just blood.

42:19.445 --> 42:23.325
It's cast-off blood,
atomised blood, pooled blood.

42:23.485 --> 42:28.037
Different first names
but same family,

42:28.645 --> 42:30.955
with one story to tell.

42:32.725 --> 42:35.604
I found your blood
underneath Cassie's fingernails.

42:35.765 --> 42:38.405
But Zach had nothing to do
with Cassie's murder.

42:38.565 --> 42:40.443
So how'd my blood end up there?

42:40.605 --> 42:43.279
I'm wondering if it came
from your car door handle.

42:43.445 --> 42:46.563
Think someone could have
done that to your car on purpose?

42:46.725 --> 42:49.160
To set you up for her murder?

42:49.325 --> 42:51.920
If so, they went to
a lot of trouble to frame you.

42:52.085 --> 42:54.077
And why would someone do that?

42:54.245 --> 42:55.838
Money?

42:58.085 --> 43:00.441
You see?
Never a dull moment.

43:04.565 --> 43:08.081
Hey, look at this, full house.

43:09.285 --> 43:11.163
Welcome home.

43:12.445 --> 43:14.118
Hey, buddy, what's that?

43:14.325 --> 43:15.964
A zombie.
Nice.

43:16.125 --> 43:19.801
I hope you don't mind that we're here.
Not at all.

43:19.965 --> 43:21.922
Something happen with Quinn?

43:22.605 --> 43:24.085
No, we're fine, I just—

43:24.245 --> 43:26.680
You're still shaken up
about Cassie.

43:27.165 --> 43:28.884
Is it okay if we stay with you tonight?

43:29.765 --> 43:32.155
You two can stay here
as long as you want.

43:32.325 --> 43:34.920
Thanks.
Especially if you're gonna cook.

43:35.085 --> 43:36.997
Oh...

43:55.005 --> 43:56.519
What happened with our fugitive?

43:57.885 --> 44:00.525
Does it look like
she's handcuffed to my desk?

44:01.245 --> 44:02.964
It does not.

44:03.165 --> 44:07.398
You couldn't find her, so we will—
We'll keep looking.

44:07.565 --> 44:11.161
Oh, fuck that, Hannah's probably
left the country by now.

44:11.325 --> 44:13.157
It's a lost cause.
Heh.

44:13.645 --> 44:16.160
What happened
to Miss Personal Vendetta?

44:16.325 --> 44:19.159
She took your advice and let it go.

44:19.645 --> 44:21.921
There's a lot of money in this.

44:22.325 --> 44:24.362
I don't care about the money.

44:26.005 --> 44:27.724
What the fuck
are you doing here then?

44:30.885 --> 44:33.878
I don't know.
I've been asking myself
the same question.

44:34.045 --> 44:36.640
Okay, is there something
you want to say to me?

44:37.525 --> 44:40.359
I'm not sure I'm cut out
to be a private investigator.

44:40.525 --> 44:43.677
Bullshit. Bullshit.
You're the best
I've ever worked with—

44:43.845 --> 44:47.839
Given the work we do,
I'm not really sure that
I want it on my tombstone.

44:48.005 --> 44:51.157
Fuck, sorry. I don't mean
to offend you or anything.

44:51.325 --> 44:54.284
It's all right, it's all right.
Forget it, forget it.

44:54.445 --> 44:58.997
I want to wake up now and then
and feel like what I do matters
more than a pay cheque.

45:00.165 --> 45:02.999
Gotcha. So, what are you gonna do?
You—? You gonna—?

45:03.165 --> 45:06.078
Gonna go back to being a cop?
That what you're gonna do?

45:07.285 --> 45:09.720
I don't know, maybe. Yeah.

45:09.885 --> 45:12.684
There's a reason
they call it a public servant.

45:12.845 --> 45:16.395
You want to put your life on the line
for slave wages, be my guest.

45:16.565 --> 45:20.878
But I'd advise you to think carefully
about throwing away this opportunity.

45:27.285 --> 45:30.483
Hannah, I wish you the best of luck
with whatever's next.

45:30.645 --> 45:32.796
Thank you.
And thank you for dinner.

45:33.005 --> 45:35.725
It's refreshing to see a girl
who can really eat.

45:37.165 --> 45:38.758
We have to go.

45:38.965 --> 45:42.037
Can you drop Zach off at his home?
Of course.

45:42.205 --> 45:44.117
Can I drive?
Not a chance.

45:44.285 --> 45:46.516
My car's older than you.

45:52.325 --> 45:54.078
It's not too bad.

45:54.245 --> 45:56.282
Yeah, it's nice.

46:05.925 --> 46:08.759
I'll be by at 6 tomorrow to pick you up.
I'll take a cab.

46:08.925 --> 46:11.804
It's no problem.
I don't want to do this again. I—

46:11.965 --> 46:14.924
I can't do this again.

46:15.125 --> 46:17.481
Say goodbye.

46:20.645 --> 46:24.355
You need anything? Are you hungry?
We just ate.

46:26.285 --> 46:30.279
I'm sure if I get hungry
there's room service here.

46:30.445 --> 46:31.515
Probably.

46:32.685 --> 46:36.998
I'm just gonna shower
and go to bed, get up,
go to the dock.

46:39.925 --> 46:43.885
Your plane leaves at 8:00.
Twenty-seven minutes later,
you'll land in Nassau.

46:44.365 --> 46:46.596
Destroy your old passport.

46:46.765 --> 46:48.040
From there,

46:49.445 --> 46:51.596
where you go is up to you.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.364
Where do you think you'll go?

46:57.765 --> 46:59.677
Haven't decided.

47:00.805 --> 47:02.922
Argentina?

47:05.005 --> 47:06.803
Maybe.

47:10.085 --> 47:11.963
Will you let me know?

47:14.125 --> 47:15.878
Yes.

47:18.685 --> 47:20.119
Okay.

47:23.885 --> 47:25.558
I'll wait to hear from you.

47:25.725 --> 47:28.445
Dexter, my passport.

47:28.605 --> 47:30.722
Oh, right.

47:31.725 --> 47:33.637
Almost forgot.

47:41.325 --> 47:43.601
"Claire Thompson."

47:43.765 --> 47:46.121
I guess I look like a Claire.

47:47.005 --> 47:49.315
He assured me it's a name
that won't get flagged.

47:49.485 --> 47:51.044
It's perfect. Thank you.

47:51.205 --> 47:54.004
And here's a "Claire Thompson"
credit card.

47:54.165 --> 47:57.636
I have some cash too, so...
When you land in Nassau,

47:57.805 --> 48:00.764
make your last withdrawal
as Maggie Castner.
Keep it under 10 grand.

48:00.925 --> 48:04.885
I can talk you through how to set up
an international bank account.

48:10.285 --> 48:12.402
You should go.

48:14.765 --> 48:16.199
I should go.

49:42.925 --> 49:46.635
<i>♪ Make your own kind of music ♪</i>

49:46.805 --> 49:50.640
<i>♪ Sing your own special song ♪</i>

49:50.845 --> 49:54.282
<i>♪ Make your own kind of music ♪</i>

49:54.445 --> 50:01.796

50:02.805 --> 50:06.276

50:12.765 --> 50:14.961
<i>Every contact leaves a trace.</i>

50:16.645 --> 50:19.956
<i>Everything and everyone we touch...</i>

50:28.005 --> 50:30.725
<i>is changed in some way.</i>

50:37.685 --> 50:39.836
<i>But the changes...</i>

50:46.965 --> 50:49.924
<i>they're never what we anticipate.</i>

50:54.365 --> 51:00.555
That's right. I believe Hannah McKay
was just in Miami going under
the alias of "Maggie Castner."

51:07.885 --> 51:09.444
Hannah.

51:18.445 --> 51:20.038
Don't go.

51:21.965 --> 51:23.797
Stay with me.
