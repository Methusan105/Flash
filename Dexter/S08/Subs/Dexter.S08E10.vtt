00:10.445 --> 00:11.765
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:11.925 --> 00:15.077
If I do happen to find her,
you'll get your reward money.

00:15.285 --> 00:16.685
Ah, shit.
Who's that?

00:16.845 --> 00:17.881
Federal marshal.

00:18.085 --> 00:20.202
Dexter Morgan, what the hell
are you doing here?

00:20.365 --> 00:21.481
Arlene's a friend.

00:21.645 --> 00:24.035
We met through Hannah.

00:24.205 --> 00:27.039
It's not safe for you
to go back to the hotel.
You need something private.

00:27.205 --> 00:28.400
What the fuck?

00:28.565 --> 00:31.034
It's only for a couple of nights.
Couple of nights? That's it.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.639
Sorry I'm not Deb.

00:32.845 --> 00:35.997
She's always accusing me
of comparing you to her.

00:39.005 --> 00:41.201
Welcome back
to Homicide, detective.

00:41.365 --> 00:44.278
I just need some time
to think about it.

00:44.485 --> 00:45.760
Take all the time you need.

00:45.925 --> 00:47.962
There's no life for me here
in Florida.

00:48.125 --> 00:50.515
I can have a life somewhere else
far away from here—

00:50.685 --> 00:52.995
In Argentina.
Maybe we all can.

00:53.165 --> 00:57.045
Yes. Me, you, and Harrison
are gonna move to Argentina.

00:57.245 --> 01:01.398
Zach's killer is related to you.
The Brain Surgeon is related to you.

01:01.565 --> 01:03.522
I had two sons,
Daniel and Richard.

01:03.685 --> 01:06.803
My older son, Daniel...
He killed Richard.

01:07.005 --> 01:08.962
Then we put Daniel into
a mental health institute.

01:09.125 --> 01:10.684
That guy Cassie was dating...

01:12.205 --> 01:14.436
Daniel Vogel is Oliver Saxon.

01:14.605 --> 01:17.120
Suppose you do find him, Dexter.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.275
What are you going to do?

01:18.445 --> 01:21.563
He's murdered four innocent people,
and he killed Zach Hamilton.

01:21.725 --> 01:23.364
He's my son.

01:25.205 --> 01:27.925
He got away.
That's why I'm here, to warn you.

01:28.085 --> 01:30.919
I think it best, from here on out,
that I handle this myself.

01:31.085 --> 01:34.123
<i>Vogel is on her own, and so am I.</i>

01:34.325 --> 01:37.477
<i>I'll kill Saxon
and leave Miami forever.</i>

01:38.965 --> 01:41.321
So now do you believe me?

01:41.685 --> 01:43.039
Yes.

03:40.405 --> 03:43.045
Feels good to cook
for you again.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.757
It reminds me of what
it was like to be your mother.

03:51.285 --> 03:55.325
You think fixing breakfast
makes you my mother again?

03:56.005 --> 03:57.883
No.
You gave up that privilege

03:58.045 --> 03:59.240
a long time ago.

04:00.125 --> 04:03.118
Daniel, whatever mistakes
I've made in the past,

04:03.285 --> 04:05.800
I want to make it up to you.

04:05.965 --> 04:08.241
I can help you.
Help me how?

04:08.405 --> 04:10.920
I can arrange
for the care you need.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.156
The care I need?

04:13.885 --> 04:17.117
I will never be locked up again.

04:17.285 --> 04:19.163
I have contacts
at the best facilities.

04:19.365 --> 04:21.800
Like the last one
you sent me to?

04:21.965 --> 04:24.480
Do you know what
that was like?

04:24.645 --> 04:27.843
Day after day wondering
when you'd finally come to visit,

04:28.005 --> 04:29.917
only to realise
that the answer was never.

04:30.405 --> 04:32.636
Daniel, I couldn't.

04:33.365 --> 04:34.594
You'd killed Richard.

04:34.765 --> 04:37.519
That was your fault.

04:39.485 --> 04:41.636
You ignored me.

04:42.485 --> 04:46.035
All you ever cared about
was Richard.

04:46.205 --> 04:47.844
You never tried to help me.

04:49.685 --> 04:53.281
I was young, inexperienced.

04:53.485 --> 04:55.602
I didn't know how to help you.

04:55.765 --> 04:59.281
But you sure as hell knew
how to help Dexter Morgan.

04:59.485 --> 05:02.319
You taught him how to deal
with his condition.

05:02.485 --> 05:05.717
You gave him everything
you denied me.

05:05.885 --> 05:09.595
While I was rotting away,
you gave him a life.

05:09.765 --> 05:12.121
I know that. I do.

05:12.285 --> 05:13.560
It was a horrible mistake.

05:14.165 --> 05:15.997
I was your son.

05:17.085 --> 05:18.314
I needed you.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.042
Please...
Please what?

05:21.205 --> 05:24.039
Let me help you.

05:24.205 --> 05:26.356
I'm sorry for everything I've done.

05:26.525 --> 05:29.324
I truly, truly am.

05:32.205 --> 05:34.401
I wish I could believe you.

05:54.725 --> 05:55.715
Hannah.

05:55.885 --> 05:57.842
Hey, Harrison.

05:58.045 --> 06:00.605
Oh, I missed you. Aw.

06:00.765 --> 06:03.439
Hey, soon you'll be able to spend
all the time you want with her,

06:03.605 --> 06:06.279
but right now, Hannah and I need
to have a grown-up talk.

06:06.445 --> 06:08.676
Okay, bud?
Okay.

06:12.845 --> 06:14.199
So...

06:14.365 --> 06:16.322
some potentially good news.
Yeah?

06:16.525 --> 06:18.437
Deputy Marshal Clayton
stopped by my place.

06:18.605 --> 06:21.564
It seems like he's backing off
on his search for you.

06:21.725 --> 06:23.364
Oh, that's a huge relief.

06:23.525 --> 06:27.121
Even so, he managed to get
your face all over the news.
You still need to lay low.

06:27.885 --> 06:30.241
So how am I gonna
get out of Miami?

06:30.965 --> 06:35.278
Well, no one's looking for a woman
travelling with her husband and child.

06:35.445 --> 06:39.200
I'm thinking the three of us
could leave together.

06:40.445 --> 06:41.765
I like the sound of that.

06:45.965 --> 06:47.115
There's still so much to do.

06:47.285 --> 06:52.041
I've gotta tell Batista I'm leaving,
get Harrison out of school,

06:52.205 --> 06:54.276
see Astor and Cody
one last time.

06:54.445 --> 06:57.882
I need to list my condo,
sell my boat, my car.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.881
Deb can help out
with all that stuff.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.514
Wow. Heh, heh.

07:03.685 --> 07:05.039
We're really gonna do it.

07:06.165 --> 07:08.555
Yeah.
We're moving to Argentina.

07:10.365 --> 07:11.799
God, that was always
such a fantasy,

07:11.965 --> 07:14.321
I never thought that
it would actually happen.

07:14.485 --> 07:17.239
Otherwise I would have
learned Spanish.

07:17.405 --> 07:18.759
We'll learn together.

07:18.925 --> 07:21.156
We'll be leaving soon.

07:21.325 --> 07:23.203
I have to kill Saxon first.

07:24.405 --> 07:26.237
Oh, so you are gonna
go through with it.

07:27.285 --> 07:29.481
I have to.

07:29.645 --> 07:31.159
Vogel's not thinking clearly.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.476
She doesn't seem to realise
she's in danger.

07:33.685 --> 07:35.324
I feel like I need to protect her.

07:35.485 --> 07:37.363
You feel like you need to?

07:38.445 --> 07:40.084
Yeah.

07:41.005 --> 07:43.042
What?
Oh, it's just...

07:43.205 --> 07:45.356
when it comes to you
and killing,

07:45.525 --> 07:47.835
feelings never enter
the equation.

07:51.245 --> 07:52.474
She needs me to protect her.

07:56.165 --> 07:58.680
Hey!
Stay off Aunt Deb's treadmill.

07:58.845 --> 08:00.199
But it's fun.

08:00.365 --> 08:02.163
No, it's not for kids.
Hey, come here.

08:02.325 --> 08:04.556
I wanna hear about
what you've been doing
for the last eight months.

08:04.725 --> 08:05.715
Okay.

08:09.245 --> 08:13.034
Hi, Aunt Deb.
Hi.

08:13.925 --> 08:15.325
Come on.

08:15.925 --> 08:17.279
Can we talk?

08:23.365 --> 08:25.925
What the hell is Harrison
doing with Hannah?

08:26.085 --> 08:28.202
Deputy marshal
pulled off the detail.

08:28.405 --> 08:30.601
It's not safe for Harrison
to be at the apartment

08:30.765 --> 08:32.165
as long as Saxon's
still out there.

08:32.365 --> 08:36.075
Okay, then I'll watch him,
but he shouldn't be with her.
That's not fucking fair to him.

08:36.285 --> 08:37.435
I have to tell you something.

08:38.485 --> 08:39.475
What?

08:39.645 --> 08:42.114
Harrison and I are leaving soon.

08:42.845 --> 08:43.881
What do you mean,
you're leaving?

08:44.085 --> 08:46.680
You're leaving where?
Leaving Miami

08:46.885 --> 08:48.365
with Hannah.

08:49.925 --> 08:52.565
What are you talking about?
We're moving to Argentina.

08:54.445 --> 08:56.482
Are you kidding?

08:57.325 --> 08:58.884
You know how stupid
that sounds?

08:59.045 --> 09:01.480
Deb—
You're gonna take your fucking son,

09:01.685 --> 09:03.642
move to another country
with a wanted fugitive?

09:03.805 --> 09:05.558
Have you fucking
thought this through?

09:05.725 --> 09:07.717
Deb, I have.

09:08.285 --> 09:11.198
We wanna have
a life together.

09:11.405 --> 09:13.636
I wish there was a different way,
but there's not.

09:13.805 --> 09:16.877
We need to leave the country
and start someplace new.

09:22.165 --> 09:24.396
You act like this
doesn't even affect me.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.396
I know it does.

09:29.085 --> 09:32.123
Well, then, that's a really
selfish decision on your part.

09:32.285 --> 09:33.605
We'll still see each other.

09:34.245 --> 09:37.443
I'll come up here,
and you can visit.

09:38.725 --> 09:40.956
Okay, I'll look you up
the next time I'm in Argentina.

09:41.125 --> 09:42.844
Deb, I'm sorry.

09:43.965 --> 09:46.799
This is hard for me too.

09:51.885 --> 09:55.674
Hey. How was your day?
Long.

09:56.325 --> 09:57.918
Aww.

09:58.085 --> 09:59.758
Well, I had a really good day.

10:00.485 --> 10:02.636
Not only am I about
to graduate,

10:02.805 --> 10:07.880
but I got a recruitment letter
from Greenwood Academy.

10:08.085 --> 10:10.600
A therapist position.
What's Greenwood Academy?

10:10.765 --> 10:15.396
It's a very well respected
special-needs school in Atlanta.
They want to set up an interview.

10:15.565 --> 10:17.636
That's fucking great.
When you going?

10:18.925 --> 10:19.961
I'm not.

10:21.085 --> 10:22.485
What do you mean? Why not?

10:24.125 --> 10:26.435
Joey, I'm not moving
to Atlanta when you're here.

10:26.645 --> 10:27.920
I'll find something in Miami.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.635
I'm just so flattered
that they're interested.

10:31.805 --> 10:34.400
Jamie, I would feel like shit

10:34.565 --> 10:37.319
if I was the cause of you
missing out on a great opportunity.

10:38.285 --> 10:41.801
You shouldn't.
This is my decision.

10:43.805 --> 10:46.923
All I'm saying is, you know,
you should do what's best
for your career.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.483
What about us?

10:50.045 --> 10:52.435
Don't worry about us,
you know?

10:52.605 --> 10:54.676
We'll make it work.

10:55.565 --> 10:58.239
Be right back.
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

11:08.045 --> 11:10.514
Evelyn.
Tom.

11:10.685 --> 11:11.801
Please.

11:13.565 --> 11:14.715
Everything okay?

11:14.885 --> 11:16.797
Yes, fine.

11:16.965 --> 11:18.638
A little over-worked, so...

11:18.805 --> 11:21.115
Mm. Thanks for coming in
this morning.

11:21.325 --> 11:24.045
As I said, it's kind
of a sensitive matter.

11:24.245 --> 11:26.202
It's about one of your patients.

11:26.365 --> 11:27.481
Zach Hamilton.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.364
As I'm sure you're aware,
he's gone missing.

11:29.525 --> 11:32.165
Yes. I was hoping he'd turned up by now.
He hasn't.

11:32.325 --> 11:36.444
And I promised his parents
that I would look into it personally.

11:36.605 --> 11:38.005
But I'm afraid I've hit a dead end.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.725
Tom, you know that I'm not at liberty
to discuss my patients.

11:40.885 --> 11:42.763
Come on, Evelyn,

11:42.925 --> 11:44.962
I'm trying to help this kid.

11:45.805 --> 11:49.082
Now, he lived at home.
How was his relationship
with his parents?

11:49.245 --> 11:50.725
Like anyone his age.

11:50.885 --> 11:52.956
Did he say anything
about trying to get away?

11:53.125 --> 11:55.640
He talk about any friends,
maybe a special girl?

11:55.805 --> 11:59.116
Was he into drugs? Gambling?

11:59.325 --> 12:01.521
Was he suicidal?
I don't know.

12:01.685 --> 12:04.598
Look, I know you understand
better than anyone

12:04.765 --> 12:06.040
what it's like to lose a child.

12:07.125 --> 12:09.435
Not knowing is even worse.

12:09.605 --> 12:11.756
Imagine how the Hamiltons
must feel.

12:13.445 --> 12:16.438
I wish I could help,
but I just don't know any more.

12:17.165 --> 12:20.158
I'm sorry, but I have
another appointment.

12:30.085 --> 12:33.044
<i>Saxon killed his brother
when he was only 14.</i>

12:33.205 --> 12:36.596
<i>Killed seven more in the fire
when he was 17.</i>

12:36.765 --> 12:38.040
<i>How many more since then?</i>

12:39.485 --> 12:42.478
<i>He's lived in a dozen cities
across two continents.</i>

12:43.045 --> 12:46.197
<i>Never been arrested.
Never leaves a trace.</i>

12:46.605 --> 12:50.155
<i>Is he the perfect psychopath
I once was?</i>

12:55.845 --> 12:58.235
Dr. Vogel.
Dexter.

12:58.405 --> 13:00.681
Can we talk?

13:04.005 --> 13:05.678
What are you doing here?

13:05.845 --> 13:08.838
Tom wanted to question me
about Zach.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.598
Well, of course,
I couldn't tell him anything.

13:11.845 --> 13:13.165
But I feel horrid

13:13.325 --> 13:15.282
keeping Zach's death
from the Hamiltons.

13:15.485 --> 13:17.875
And we both know
that Zach's killer is still out there.

13:20.085 --> 13:22.805
Understand, Evelyn,
you are in danger.

13:23.205 --> 13:26.323
Well, you don't have to worry.

13:26.965 --> 13:28.319
My son isn't gonna harm me.

13:29.525 --> 13:32.279
How do you know that?
I just do.

13:34.205 --> 13:36.481
Have you been
in contact with him?

13:37.685 --> 13:38.675
I saw him.

13:41.725 --> 13:42.795
When?

13:44.045 --> 13:45.479
We had breakfast yesterday.

13:47.565 --> 13:48.635
Where is he now?

13:49.125 --> 13:50.445
I have no idea.

13:51.085 --> 13:52.280
Evelyn...
It's the truth.

13:52.445 --> 13:55.119
He— He was angry and
he stormed out of the house.

13:55.365 --> 13:57.721
I don't know whether
I'll ever see him again.

14:01.925 --> 14:02.915
Why didn't you tell me?

14:03.365 --> 14:06.039
Because you want
to kill him.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.885
And I don't want that
to happen.

14:09.645 --> 14:11.955
I can't turn my back
on him again.

14:12.165 --> 14:14.282
What is there
you can do for him?

14:17.605 --> 14:19.403
Well...

14:20.605 --> 14:23.677
First, I can establish trust.

14:24.805 --> 14:27.923
I wasn't a good mother to him
when he was a child.

14:28.085 --> 14:29.678
I need to win him over.

14:31.485 --> 14:33.078
And then...

14:33.245 --> 14:35.999
Well, eventually, hopefully,

14:36.445 --> 14:37.879
I'll get him back into a facility.

14:38.405 --> 14:41.125
And how many more
innocent people will he kill

14:41.285 --> 14:43.197
before you do that,
before he kills you?

14:43.405 --> 14:46.443
If you won't protect yourself,
I need to do it.

14:48.165 --> 14:49.963
I don't want you
to protect me, Dexter.

14:51.205 --> 14:52.559
I don't want you to be a hero.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.079
Evelyn, I have to—
Please.

14:54.245 --> 14:57.238
Don't use me as an excuse
for killing Daniel.

15:08.485 --> 15:10.442
She doesn't want my help.

15:12.125 --> 15:13.957
So do I just walk away from this?

15:14.125 --> 15:15.923
We could leave
for Argentina tonight.

15:16.085 --> 15:17.963
Dexter, you don't want
to leave this unfinished.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.798
I don't even know
how to find him.

15:19.965 --> 15:21.957
You always find a way.

15:22.125 --> 15:26.756
If you don't kill Saxon,
her life is at risk.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.161
Crime scene.

15:35.925 --> 15:38.235
You can send it back,
you know.

15:40.165 --> 15:42.441
It's not the salad.

15:42.605 --> 15:46.679
So you asked me here
to watch me eat?

15:49.285 --> 15:52.119
You can't tell
anybody this, okay?

15:55.765 --> 15:56.915
Dexter is leaving Miami.

15:57.085 --> 15:58.724
Why? He's quitting?

15:58.885 --> 16:01.320
He and Harrison are gonna take
the rest of the year and travel.

16:01.525 --> 16:05.917
Fucking A. Good for him. Or not.

16:06.485 --> 16:08.556
I don't know if he's ever
coming back, you know.

16:08.725 --> 16:10.603
I mean, I get wanting
a change, but—

16:10.765 --> 16:14.554
Sometimes, you know,
when things don't feel right,

16:14.725 --> 16:17.524
changing it up is better
for everyone involved.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.245
It's not better for me.

16:20.405 --> 16:22.078
He's my brother.
I don't want him to leave.

16:22.245 --> 16:26.285
I understand, but maybe
you should think about
what's best for him.

16:26.885 --> 16:29.719
Look, when I left New York,

16:29.925 --> 16:31.359
it was one of the toughest things
I ever did,

16:31.525 --> 16:33.482
leaving my friends and family.

16:33.685 --> 16:35.916
But as it turns out,
finally being on my own

16:36.085 --> 16:37.724
was the best thing
I ever did for myself.

16:46.885 --> 16:48.638
Batista gave me
my badge back.

16:48.805 --> 16:50.205
Fucking A, that's great.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.315
Or not.

16:55.525 --> 16:56.675
It's good. It's good.

16:56.845 --> 17:00.236
I've wanted to come back
for a long time, so...

17:00.405 --> 17:03.603
You tell Elway?
Not yet.

17:04.085 --> 17:05.405
You know what this means, right?

17:06.565 --> 17:08.522
You and me, side by side.

17:11.045 --> 17:13.196
Just like old times.

17:13.565 --> 17:16.285
Seriously?
Yeah.

17:18.525 --> 17:20.721
It's a crime scene.
Gotta go.

17:20.885 --> 17:21.955
No, I got it, I got it.

17:22.125 --> 17:25.914
Okay.
Next one's on me, partner.

17:34.405 --> 17:36.601
<i>Nothing will change after I'm gone.</i>

17:36.765 --> 17:38.802
<i>Blood will continue to pool.</i>

17:40.885 --> 17:43.525
<i>I just won't be here to photograph it.</i>

17:43.685 --> 17:45.881
The guy was hit
pretty hard.

17:46.085 --> 17:49.157
Major head wounds,
lots of broken bones,

17:49.325 --> 17:50.475
internal injuries.

17:50.645 --> 17:51.681
Road rage.

17:51.885 --> 17:53.683
The guy on the bike wouldn't
get out of the way,

17:53.885 --> 17:56.878
gave him the finger,
so the driver ran him over.

17:57.045 --> 17:58.843
Lieutenant, can I get a word?
Sure.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.235
Hey, Dex.

18:02.605 --> 18:06.155
I didn't know I had to work today.
Why would you think that?

18:06.925 --> 18:08.837
Because it's Saturday.

18:10.885 --> 18:13.161
Are you high?

18:13.365 --> 18:15.402
You're high, aren't you?
I can smell it on you.

18:17.445 --> 18:18.765
Go home.
Dad...

18:18.925 --> 18:21.804
We'll talk about this later. Go.
And stop smoking pot.

18:22.205 --> 18:24.197
You have every right
to tell me what to do at work,

18:24.365 --> 18:26.721
but you have no right
to tell me what to do at home.

18:28.245 --> 18:33.036
Well, that's—
That's a huge shock, Dexter.

18:33.205 --> 18:35.879
I know it seems like
it's out of the blue,

18:36.045 --> 18:38.162
but after Rita's death...

18:39.325 --> 18:40.725
and with the job,

18:40.885 --> 18:45.164
I've just had enough death
in my life for a while.

18:45.325 --> 18:50.002
I need a break, so...
This is my notice.

18:51.765 --> 18:53.484
You need this, don't you?

18:56.805 --> 18:59.036
I wish you nothing but the best.
Thank you.

18:59.245 --> 19:01.362
I'd like to keep this between us.

19:01.525 --> 19:05.883
I'd like to let other people
know myself, Jamie included.

19:06.565 --> 19:09.558
She's gonna take it hard.
You know, she really loves Harrison.

19:09.725 --> 19:11.921
He loves her too.

19:12.445 --> 19:15.005
Anyway,
she's moving on herself.

19:15.165 --> 19:16.679
New job soon.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.484
Maybe this'll make it easier.

19:22.085 --> 19:23.280
I'll miss you, bro.

19:31.485 --> 19:33.920
Hey, listen, and...
If you change your mind,

19:34.085 --> 19:36.077
you always have a home here.

19:36.245 --> 19:38.805
Got it.
Okay.

19:47.725 --> 19:50.240
He said, "I'm too big for a nap,"
and then he went right to sleep.

19:50.885 --> 19:53.161
Heh. Cute.

19:55.125 --> 19:57.879
So are you any closer
in your search for Saxon?

19:58.485 --> 20:00.238
Not really.

20:00.405 --> 20:01.441
I don't know much
about him.

20:01.605 --> 20:03.517
He moves around a lot.

20:03.725 --> 20:05.921
I guess he figures if you stay
in one place too long...

20:06.085 --> 20:08.964
Eventually you get caught.

20:11.165 --> 20:13.236
I wish we could just leave.

20:13.445 --> 20:17.962
Yeah, me too, but I know that
you have to protect Dr. Vogel.

20:21.525 --> 20:23.721
Actually,
she doesn't want me to.

20:23.885 --> 20:25.763
Then why are you doing this?

20:28.725 --> 20:30.682
Because it's what I do.

20:30.845 --> 20:33.963
It's who I am. It's all I know.

20:34.125 --> 20:35.718
Dexter, you're more than that.

20:38.845 --> 20:40.438
Am I?

20:42.605 --> 20:44.881
You think that when
we move to Argentina...

20:47.205 --> 20:50.801
that it's possible for you and me
to have a fresh start?

20:51.205 --> 20:52.719
Yes.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.683
Well, then, the sooner
you kill Saxon,

20:54.845 --> 20:57.360
the sooner
we can get there.

21:02.365 --> 21:05.756
Vogel is the key.
I'm sure he'll go for her.

21:05.925 --> 21:08.520
But I can't just sit
and watch her.

21:08.685 --> 21:11.757
Especially if she figures out
that you're watching her.

21:11.925 --> 21:14.645
That can make things worse.

21:14.805 --> 21:18.162
I need to find him,
but maybe I don't need Vogel.

21:18.325 --> 21:20.476
Just her computer.

21:38.965 --> 21:42.720
I want you to see something.
Get in.

21:44.805 --> 21:47.081
I'm not gonna hurt you, Mom.

21:49.445 --> 21:51.323
Trust me,
if I wanted you dead,

21:51.485 --> 21:52.885
I wouldn't be holding
this door.

22:29.725 --> 22:33.355
Do you recognise this
from the video I sent you?

22:39.365 --> 22:41.243
This is where you kill
your victims.

22:45.005 --> 22:46.405
Why did you bring me here?

22:46.565 --> 22:48.045
To help you understand.

22:49.765 --> 22:51.324
Have a seat.

22:53.765 --> 22:58.237
Don't worry,
I wiped it down after every, uh—

22:59.005 --> 23:00.519
Well...

23:09.445 --> 23:12.358
This room is more than
what you think it is.

23:14.325 --> 23:16.044
It's a reminder.

23:17.925 --> 23:19.678
Of what?

23:21.285 --> 23:23.197
Where you sent me.

23:26.085 --> 23:30.398
I've made it look exactly
like what they called
our treatment room.

23:34.045 --> 23:36.196
When I would refuse
to take my meds,

23:36.365 --> 23:40.518
the doctors would strap me
down into a chair like this...

23:41.885 --> 23:44.605
and they would force
the meds down.

23:46.205 --> 23:50.404
And that was usually
the highlight of my day.

23:53.325 --> 23:56.796
You can see why
I caused that fire.

23:58.325 --> 23:59.805
I can see why
you would do anything

24:00.005 --> 24:02.839
to get out
of a place like this.

24:08.245 --> 24:10.476
You said before
that you wanted to help me.

24:11.885 --> 24:14.559
Yes. I'd like that.

24:15.165 --> 24:17.600
Most facilities aren't
like this, Daniel.

24:17.765 --> 24:20.439
I could put you someplace where

24:20.645 --> 24:23.683
you'd be very comfortable.
I could see you every day.

24:23.845 --> 24:25.882
I want you to help me
like you helped Dexter.

24:27.645 --> 24:30.524
I want you to show me how
to exist free in the world

24:30.685 --> 24:32.085
just the way I am.

24:32.285 --> 24:33.719
As a killer?

24:36.325 --> 24:39.762
Daniel, I can't help you
to murder innocent people.

24:42.045 --> 24:44.560
If you care about me
the way you say you do,

24:46.285 --> 24:49.005
you'll figure out a way
to make this work.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.562
I want to be someone
you can love.

24:55.405 --> 24:57.840
I'm asking you,
as your son...

25:00.165 --> 25:01.360
please help me.

25:15.325 --> 25:18.841
All right, I'll find a way.

25:20.165 --> 25:21.804
What about Dexter?
He's still after me.

25:21.965 --> 25:23.081
I'll talk to Dexter.

25:25.365 --> 25:27.596
Don't make the same mistake
you made with Richard.

25:30.285 --> 25:31.878
Choose right this time.

25:33.885 --> 25:35.399
Choose me.

25:36.765 --> 25:38.279
I'll get Dexter to understand.

25:38.445 --> 25:39.845
Do you think
that's possible?

25:40.005 --> 25:41.962
I'll make it possible.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.605
I want this, Daniel.

25:44.965 --> 25:47.355
I want to be
your mother again.

25:48.325 --> 25:49.839
I'll do whatever it takes.

26:10.885 --> 26:12.842
Vogel told me where
she keeps a spare key

26:13.005 --> 26:14.405
in case of an emergency.

26:14.565 --> 26:18.161
I think protecting her from
her deranged son qualifies.

26:26.645 --> 26:29.479
Saxon installed spyware
on her computer.

26:30.245 --> 26:32.237
Thing is, that can go both ways.

26:32.445 --> 26:35.517
So if Saxon can see
Vogel's computer...

26:37.325 --> 26:39.601
Then I can see Saxon's.

26:40.645 --> 26:41.874
So, what are you looking for?

26:42.045 --> 26:45.675
Something, anything
that can give me an edge.

26:52.965 --> 26:54.604
What's this?

26:56.405 --> 26:58.874
That's the video he sent to Vogel.

27:05.805 --> 27:07.717
And this one's from last week.

27:07.885 --> 27:11.003
<i>No, don't!</i>
Zach.

27:11.165 --> 27:12.645
<i>No, no!
What are you doing? No!</i>

27:14.045 --> 27:15.604
<i>No! No!</i>

27:25.965 --> 27:29.800
Dexter, if something happens
to Evelyn, it will haunt you forever.

27:30.005 --> 27:34.079
You can't just run off to Argentina
and escape who you are.

27:34.245 --> 27:36.077
I'm not trying to escape anything.

27:40.525 --> 27:43.404
So you'll post a job listing
next week?

27:43.565 --> 27:47.320
Great. Listen, I just don't
need any forensic tech.

27:47.485 --> 27:50.205
Hey, I need the best out there.
He's filling some big shoes.

27:50.365 --> 27:52.038
I appreciate it.

27:52.525 --> 27:53.845
Sorry, deputy.
How can I help you?

27:54.005 --> 27:57.396
Just came by to let you know
none of our leads
on Hannah McKay panned out.

27:57.565 --> 28:00.797
You know, when the trail
goes cold at this point,
the subject either was never here,

28:01.365 --> 28:02.879
or skipped town pretty fast.

28:03.045 --> 28:05.799
So, what does that mean?
It means the case is back to low priority.

28:05.965 --> 28:07.524
Okay.
Thanks for the heads up.

28:07.685 --> 28:09.517
Uh— I couldn't help overhearing.

28:09.685 --> 28:11.836
You said you're looking
for a new forensic tech.

28:12.045 --> 28:14.355
You know someone?
No, I'm just curious—

28:14.525 --> 28:16.278
Who's leaving?
It's not Dexter Morgan, is it?

28:16.445 --> 28:18.277
Close the door.

28:20.805 --> 28:23.195
He hasn't told any of his friends yet,

28:23.365 --> 28:26.244
so this is on the QT,
but, yes, Dexter's moving on.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.078
He got a better job, huh?

28:28.245 --> 28:30.316
No, he's going to travel,
spend time with his son.

28:30.525 --> 28:32.835
Really?
Yeah. I can't say I blame him.

28:41.405 --> 28:44.318
Hey, babe.
How was your day?

28:44.485 --> 28:47.444
It was okay. You working?

28:47.605 --> 28:49.961
Yeah, I'm just
sending out résumés.

28:50.165 --> 28:52.043
I'm almost done though.

28:55.405 --> 29:00.605
Hey, um, can we talk
for a sec?

29:01.605 --> 29:03.244
Okay.

29:03.405 --> 29:05.761
I feel like an asshole,
but I gotta be honest with you.

29:06.445 --> 29:10.155
Okay, so be honest.

29:11.685 --> 29:13.358
It's not working out
between us, is it?

29:18.525 --> 29:20.403
Is that a question?
No.

29:20.565 --> 29:23.637
It's— I'm sorry.

29:25.085 --> 29:28.203
Then why did you
let me move in here?

29:30.445 --> 29:32.277
I mean, why wait
until now, Joey?

29:32.445 --> 29:34.960
I hoped it would
make things better.

29:36.525 --> 29:37.800
I don't know what else to say.

29:38.005 --> 29:41.362
Ugh, I am so stupid to think
you would ever get over Deb.

29:41.525 --> 29:43.596
It's got nothing to do with Deb.

29:44.925 --> 29:46.518
I thought you wanted
to be honest with me.

29:46.725 --> 29:48.956
I am. This is on me.

29:49.485 --> 29:50.839
She's got nothing
to do with it.

29:51.005 --> 29:53.565
Joey, see, that is
what hurts the most.

29:53.725 --> 29:56.240
That you just keep lying about it.

29:58.205 --> 29:59.639
I'm not lying, Jamie.

29:59.805 --> 30:01.319
Okay, you know what?
Don't worry.

30:01.485 --> 30:04.080
I'm gonna move my stuff
out of here as soon as I can,

30:04.285 --> 30:06.083
so you're free to not go back to Deb.

30:07.085 --> 30:08.155
Jamie—

30:08.325 --> 30:09.884
Bye.

30:44.565 --> 30:46.636
Just give me a sec.

30:52.445 --> 30:53.481
Hey.

30:57.685 --> 31:00.484
I don't want to intrude.
Well, it's your house.

31:04.245 --> 31:05.964
It's your family.

31:10.805 --> 31:12.797
It's your family too.

31:20.285 --> 31:22.242
I want you and Harrison
to be happy.

31:25.445 --> 31:29.962
So how do you feel
about us leaving?

31:33.165 --> 31:34.565
Scared.

31:36.245 --> 31:38.635
My whole family's moving.

31:40.765 --> 31:42.438
Scared?

31:46.045 --> 31:48.037
You've always been there.

31:50.165 --> 31:52.361
I don't know what my life
looks like without you.

31:53.645 --> 31:56.956
Well, maybe it looks better.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.718
Really?

32:00.245 --> 32:03.716
Hanging out
with two serial killers,
does it get better than that?

32:03.885 --> 32:05.478
So you see my point.

32:10.485 --> 32:12.204
I don't know.

32:13.325 --> 32:15.282
Better or worse...

32:17.965 --> 32:19.558
you've always been there.

32:22.165 --> 32:25.237
Moving on without you
feels like jumping off a cliff.

32:26.405 --> 32:28.522
I know what you mean.

32:36.885 --> 32:38.285
Come on.

32:41.165 --> 32:42.281
Will you?

32:54.605 --> 32:56.597
Hey, look who's here.

33:15.885 --> 33:19.162
Hi.
<i>Hi. Just checking in.</i>

33:19.325 --> 33:20.315
All is well here.

33:20.485 --> 33:22.397
Harrison's playing outside
with Deb.

33:22.605 --> 33:26.121
Oh, good.
<i>You doing okay?</i>

33:26.285 --> 33:29.244
Yeah, I just wanted to hear your voice.

33:33.165 --> 33:34.679
I have to go.

33:40.085 --> 33:41.405
Evelyn.
Dexter.

33:41.565 --> 33:43.204
I was hoping
we could talk.

33:44.685 --> 33:46.199
Okay.

33:46.365 --> 33:48.163
I've been rethinking
what I said earlier,

33:48.325 --> 33:51.602
and I fear I was being
too judgemental.

33:51.805 --> 33:54.843
I think it's possible
that you and Hannah
could have a relationship.

33:55.005 --> 33:58.442
Really?
And I think moving far away,

33:58.645 --> 34:01.683
beginning anew might be
the best thing for you.

34:01.845 --> 34:05.361
Moving far away?
Is that the important part?

34:05.565 --> 34:09.525
You mentioned Argentina?
That could be a good place.

34:09.685 --> 34:11.085
Why do you want me to leave?

34:11.245 --> 34:15.364
Dexter, I think
there's hope for Daniel.

34:15.525 --> 34:17.960
I don't think he likes killing.

34:18.165 --> 34:19.758
I could help him,

34:19.925 --> 34:22.485
but I'm not gonna get
that chance if you kill him.

34:24.565 --> 34:27.558
So just leave, please.
Leave Miami.

34:27.725 --> 34:30.320
You don't think he likes killing?
He says he wants my help.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.681
Let me show you how much
he doesn't like killing.

34:40.525 --> 34:41.754
<i>No, don't! No!</i>

34:43.605 --> 34:44.959
No.

34:45.725 --> 34:47.956
That's Zach's head
he's sawing into.

34:51.645 --> 34:54.479
There's no hope for him, Evelyn.

34:55.125 --> 34:58.038
This is the same person
who killed your younger son.

34:58.245 --> 34:59.804
He will never change.

35:00.885 --> 35:03.480
Don't.
I'm sorry.

35:19.445 --> 35:21.084
So, what now?

35:21.725 --> 35:23.603
You know what needs to happen.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.925
Otherwise, he'll go on killing.

35:31.165 --> 35:32.394
Where is he now?

35:32.565 --> 35:35.717
He said he would call me tonight.

35:35.885 --> 35:38.798
Set up a meeting with him tonight.

35:38.965 --> 35:42.322
Someplace public, safe.

35:42.485 --> 35:44.954
Call me and let me know where.

35:45.165 --> 35:48.124
I'll follow him and take it from there.

35:58.485 --> 36:01.478
Just please don't let him suffer.

36:01.685 --> 36:03.005
I won't.

36:16.965 --> 36:18.922
Debra Morgan.

36:20.645 --> 36:23.763
Do I know you?
Deputy U.S. Marshal Max Clayton.

36:23.925 --> 36:24.995
And this is Harrison.

36:25.565 --> 36:26.965
Hey, buddy.
Hi.

36:27.165 --> 36:30.602
You guys have met?
Over at his dad's, yeah.

36:30.765 --> 36:32.802
Harrison,
why don't you go inside?

36:33.005 --> 36:34.724
I'll be there in a minute.

36:34.925 --> 36:36.405
Okay.

36:40.005 --> 36:42.804
Elway gave me your address.
I thought it better we talk in person.

36:43.325 --> 36:44.315
Okay.

36:46.205 --> 36:49.596
Look, I'm worried about your brother.
Dexter? Why?

36:50.325 --> 36:53.716
It's probably nothing,
but it just struck me as odd

36:53.885 --> 36:56.639
that he's leaving town
at the exact time

36:56.805 --> 36:58.956
Hannah McKay is
rumoured to be here.

36:59.125 --> 37:02.402
How do you know he's leaving?
Uh, overheard at the station.

37:02.805 --> 37:04.876
Maybe it's nothing, but

37:05.045 --> 37:08.277
are he and Arlene Shram
a couple?

37:08.445 --> 37:10.357
I don't know. I don't keep up
with his dating life.

37:10.525 --> 37:13.882
Okay, it's just I know
he used to have a relationship
with Hannah McKay.

37:14.605 --> 37:16.403
What if he still does?

37:16.565 --> 37:18.522
Then he's a fucking idiot.
That's what I'm afraid of.

37:18.685 --> 37:20.404
Look, I know I'm going out
on a limb here,

37:20.565 --> 37:24.400
but what if these two
somehow reconnected?

37:24.565 --> 37:25.919
I mean,
his life could be at risk.

37:26.085 --> 37:27.917
His son's too.
Dexter wouldn't do that.

37:28.085 --> 37:29.678
I hope not.

37:29.845 --> 37:32.360
I don't need to tell you
what a dangerous person
Hannah McKay is.

37:32.565 --> 37:35.285
You know more about her than I do.
If Dexter were dating Hannah McKay,

37:35.485 --> 37:36.635
I would fucking know about it.

37:36.805 --> 37:38.285
Maybe he'd keep it from you.
Who knows?

37:38.485 --> 37:40.875
I mean, men do stupid things
for beautiful women.

37:41.045 --> 37:43.002
Logic just flies out the window.

37:43.165 --> 37:47.682
Well, I appreciate your concern,
but that's not what's happening here.

37:47.845 --> 37:49.677
Dexter's burned out,
that's why he's leaving.

37:49.845 --> 37:51.643
Okay. Thank you.

37:51.805 --> 37:54.479
I respect your opinion.
Here's my card.

37:54.645 --> 37:58.002
You call me if you think of anything.
Okay, I will do.

38:11.165 --> 38:13.122
Hey. You guys hungry?

38:13.285 --> 38:14.275
Yeah!

38:14.445 --> 38:16.676
Hey, go clean up, Harrison.

38:20.885 --> 38:21.955
Is everything okay?

38:22.845 --> 38:24.199
Not really.

38:24.405 --> 38:25.805
Something happen?

38:25.965 --> 38:27.604
Deputy Marshal Clayton happened.

38:27.765 --> 38:29.722
He was just questioning me
on the beach.

38:29.885 --> 38:32.400
I thought that Dexter said
that Clayton was backing off.

38:32.565 --> 38:35.160
Somehow he found out
that Dexter's leaving,
and it tweaked him.

38:35.325 --> 38:37.237
He thinks Dexter's helping you hide.

38:37.405 --> 38:39.362
Oh, God.
I covered for both of you,

38:39.525 --> 38:41.357
but you have got
to stay hidden until you leave.

38:41.525 --> 38:43.482
Of course. Yes.

38:43.645 --> 38:45.079
Oh...

38:46.405 --> 38:49.876
Thank you for protecting me,
again.

38:52.365 --> 38:54.641
Who knew I'd be so good at it?

38:55.245 --> 38:57.885
We'll all be out of here soon.
I know.

38:59.045 --> 39:01.037
I have lunch.

39:01.205 --> 39:02.355
No, thanks.

39:02.525 --> 39:04.517
I have someplace I need to be.

39:14.965 --> 39:18.436
Hey.
Hey.

39:18.605 --> 39:20.836
Can we talk?
Nothing to talk about.

39:21.045 --> 39:22.764
I know why you're here.
I'll have your last cheque drawn.

39:22.965 --> 39:24.877
I was gonna give you two weeks.
Don't want your two weeks.

39:25.045 --> 39:27.321
I still have friends in Miami Metro,
they said you were going back.

39:27.485 --> 39:28.965
Well, shouldn't we talk
about this?

39:29.125 --> 39:31.117
I went out of my way
to make this work.

39:31.285 --> 39:32.844
I put up with your bullshit.

39:33.005 --> 39:34.917
The more I gave,
the more you pushed back.

39:35.085 --> 39:37.236
It's quite clear to me that it
was never gonna work out.

39:39.765 --> 39:41.563
Well, I'm sorry.

39:42.485 --> 39:45.239
I really appreciate the job

39:45.445 --> 39:46.925
and everything
that you've done for me.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.405
Don't mention it.

39:49.605 --> 39:51.403
Let's just, uh...

39:54.285 --> 39:55.958
Okay.

39:57.205 --> 39:58.559
I'm gonna go pack up
my office.

39:58.725 --> 40:01.524
I'll have security do that.
They'll deliver it to your house.

40:01.685 --> 40:03.802
And all the case files
are mine, of course.

40:04.005 --> 40:05.325
Including those
on Hannah McKay.

40:07.485 --> 40:10.398
Good luck to you.
Yeah, you too.

40:15.085 --> 40:18.123
Harrison, remember
what your dad said. That's not a toy.

40:18.285 --> 40:20.004
But Aunt Deb does it
all the time.

40:24.045 --> 40:25.604
Harrison, please listen.

40:26.205 --> 40:27.764
I am.

40:35.685 --> 40:37.278
Ow!

40:38.205 --> 40:39.195
Harrison!

40:42.165 --> 40:46.318
Ow! Ow! Ow!
I know. It's gonna be okay.

40:48.045 --> 40:49.479
Ow.
I know it hurts.

40:49.645 --> 40:52.285
I know it hurts.
It's gonna be okay.

40:52.445 --> 40:54.516
Okay.
Ow.

40:54.725 --> 40:57.638
Here, hold that.
Ouch.

40:57.805 --> 40:59.842
Ow.

41:01.685 --> 41:03.085
<i>Dexter Morgan.</i>

41:03.245 --> 41:04.520
Dexter, call me.

41:08.165 --> 41:11.875
We're gonna have to
take you somewhere
and get you patched up.

41:17.125 --> 41:19.003
What happened?
He fell and hit his chin.

41:19.205 --> 41:21.037
It's a pretty deep cut.
It won't stop bleeding.

41:21.205 --> 41:23.003
I'll let the doctor know.
Are you the mother?

41:24.445 --> 41:26.004
Are you the mother?
Uh, yes.

41:26.165 --> 41:28.361
I'm just waiting for his father
to call me back.

41:28.525 --> 41:29.720
Fill this out.
Okay.

41:29.925 --> 41:31.279
And wait for us
to call his name.

41:31.445 --> 41:33.004
Okay. Thank you.

41:37.205 --> 41:39.117
Harrison,
you're being so brave.

41:39.285 --> 41:41.720
I can't wait to tell your dad.

42:07.365 --> 42:08.685
Harrison Morgan?

42:09.365 --> 42:10.924
Uh, yeah.

42:11.085 --> 42:12.439
Here.

42:27.605 --> 42:29.961
Been a while
since we've been here.

42:30.125 --> 42:33.436
Choir director.
Long time ago.

42:39.925 --> 42:42.235
Saxon's first victim.

43:03.725 --> 43:06.194
And his last victims.

43:07.405 --> 43:10.318
It's also been a while since
you've used victims' pictures.

43:12.645 --> 43:14.796
He needs to see
what he's done.

43:14.965 --> 43:17.924
That was always
very important to you.

43:18.085 --> 43:20.998
People get
what they deserve.

43:21.845 --> 43:23.837
At least they should.

43:25.645 --> 43:28.285
Huh. I've come a long way.

43:28.445 --> 43:32.439
It feels like I'm a different person
from the last time I was in this room.

43:33.125 --> 43:34.479
You're still you, Dexter.

43:34.645 --> 43:36.204
I hope you realise that.

43:36.365 --> 43:39.005
Why wouldn't I?

43:39.165 --> 43:42.158
I just don't want you to have
any unrealistic expectations

43:42.325 --> 43:43.884
about whatever happens next.

43:44.605 --> 43:48.155
I know exactly what happens next.

43:48.325 --> 43:50.760
I kill Saxon.

43:50.925 --> 43:56.125
And then Hannah and Harrison and I
get on a plane and start our new lives.

44:07.325 --> 44:09.920
Hey, Jamie.
Go fuck yourself.

44:10.125 --> 44:13.402
What?
Debra, come on in.

44:18.365 --> 44:20.925
I'm ready to come back,
if you'll have me.

44:21.085 --> 44:22.201
If I'll have you?

44:23.525 --> 44:25.881
Are you sure about this?
You're not fooling me?

44:26.045 --> 44:28.355
Uh, I don't think so.

44:28.565 --> 44:30.284
Well, in that case, hallelujah.

44:31.005 --> 44:32.041
Can you start today?

44:32.205 --> 44:35.084
I was thinking more like
a week or two.

44:35.245 --> 44:37.601
Of course. Loose ends.

44:37.765 --> 44:39.040
Yeah, something like that.

44:39.605 --> 44:43.360
Mm-hm. Well, whenever
you're ready, I'm ready.

44:43.925 --> 44:46.121
It's funny, though.
What?

44:46.285 --> 44:48.356
You coming back
as Dexter's leaving.

44:49.125 --> 44:50.525
He told you?
Yeah.

44:50.685 --> 44:53.325
And, yeah, don't worry
about Jamie.

44:53.485 --> 44:55.795
What was that?
Oh, you don't know?

44:56.005 --> 44:58.122
Quinn just ended things with her.
Stupid idiot.

44:58.285 --> 44:59.799
He did?
And so you know,

44:59.965 --> 45:01.365
Jamie kind of blames you.

45:02.085 --> 45:03.314
Yeah, I get that.

45:03.485 --> 45:05.875
Yeah, she thinks Quinn
is still in love with you
or something like that.

45:06.045 --> 45:08.241
I didn't want to know
the details.

45:12.205 --> 45:14.674
I'll let you have at him first.

45:22.885 --> 45:24.080
We need to talk.

45:24.765 --> 45:27.439
I just did what—
Not here.

45:27.605 --> 45:30.404
Did you break up with her
because of me?

45:30.565 --> 45:33.034
No. Yes.

45:33.205 --> 45:36.357
I mean, no and yes.
Don't get all mad.

45:36.525 --> 45:37.925
Your face gets red
when you get mad.

45:38.085 --> 45:39.963
No, it doesn't.
What the fuck happened?

45:40.485 --> 45:43.603
It's not complicated.
I wasn't happy.

45:43.805 --> 45:47.515
I mean, I was okay,
but I kind of knew
I was never gonna marry her.

45:47.725 --> 45:49.523
Probably would have
ended it soon anyway,

45:49.725 --> 45:51.637
even if what happened
between you and I didn't happen.

45:51.805 --> 45:53.762
Nothing happened.
We shared a kiss.

45:53.925 --> 45:56.281
That's not a reason to fucking
break up with somebody.

45:56.485 --> 45:57.475
You're not hearing me.

45:57.685 --> 46:00.041
I probably would have
broke up with Jamie,

46:00.205 --> 46:02.083
but what happened
between you and I

46:02.285 --> 46:05.961
just made it clear that
I shouldn't be with her anymore.

46:06.125 --> 46:09.801
Got it?
Yes.

46:09.965 --> 46:13.561
So, yeah, to be completely honest,

46:13.725 --> 46:16.365
I still have feelings for you,

46:16.525 --> 46:18.881
But I don't expect anything from you.

46:19.045 --> 46:20.559
Why not?

46:20.725 --> 46:22.603
Because I didn't think you wanted—

46:22.805 --> 46:25.320
I still have feelings for you,
stupid.

46:26.925 --> 46:29.042
That didn't change, I just—

46:29.965 --> 46:32.480
I wasn't sure
that I saw a future for us.

46:32.685 --> 46:33.835
What about now?

46:34.325 --> 46:36.920
I don't know.
I mean, I used to...

46:37.725 --> 46:40.957
I used to feel like something
was holding me back, but now—

46:41.125 --> 46:44.118
Now I just— Shh.

46:51.365 --> 46:53.482
Are you sure it was
Hannah McKay
you saw earlier today?

46:53.645 --> 46:55.364
Yeah. I'd seen her picture
on the news.

46:55.525 --> 46:57.676
She brought in her son.
He had a cut on his chin.

46:57.845 --> 46:59.404
Hannah McKay
doesn't have any children.

46:59.565 --> 47:02.239
Are you sure this is her?
Well, I think so.

47:02.405 --> 47:03.395
What was her boy's name?

47:03.765 --> 47:05.916
His name
was Harrison Morgan,

47:06.085 --> 47:08.441
and she sure acted
like he was her own.

47:15.765 --> 47:17.757
I fell on my chin.

47:17.925 --> 47:20.360
Yeah, how many stitches
are holding that chin together?

47:20.565 --> 47:23.239
Six.
Wow. I bet that hurt.

47:23.445 --> 47:26.404
Yeah, but Harrison
was very brave.

47:26.565 --> 47:29.478
I even got a lollipop.
Can I go play now?

47:29.645 --> 47:31.318
Yeah, sure.

47:34.845 --> 47:36.199
Thanks for taking care of him.

47:36.365 --> 47:38.675
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I feel awful.

47:38.845 --> 47:42.316
I can't believe I wasn't here for you.
You went out in public.

47:42.485 --> 47:45.159
You put yourself in jeopardy
because I was setting up a kill room.

47:45.325 --> 47:48.636
Dex, you didn't know.
It doesn't matter.

47:49.765 --> 47:53.361
I'm trying to save Dr. Vogel
when I should be taking care
of you and Harrison.

47:54.085 --> 47:55.644
We're okay, really. It's fine.

47:56.485 --> 47:59.000
But there is one other thing.
What?

47:59.165 --> 48:01.122
That deputy marshal came by.
Here?

48:01.285 --> 48:04.995
He talked to Deb.
I think she put him off, but still,
we can't stay here for much longer.

48:06.365 --> 48:07.401
I know.

48:11.365 --> 48:14.642
Evelyn?
<i>Dexter, he's here.</i>

48:14.805 --> 48:16.285
Here? Where's here?

48:16.445 --> 48:19.324
At my house. He called me.

48:19.485 --> 48:20.965
Said he was a couple
of blocks away.

48:21.125 --> 48:22.479
No, that wasn't the plan.

48:22.645 --> 48:25.638
You were supposed to meet
him someplace in public.
Someplace safe.

48:25.845 --> 48:28.644
It's the last time
I'm ever going to see him.

48:28.845 --> 48:30.404
I wanted a private goodbye.

48:30.565 --> 48:32.875
<i>It's not a good idea.</i>

48:34.685 --> 48:36.642
That's him now.
<i>Evelyn?</i>

48:40.925 --> 48:42.484
What?

48:43.245 --> 48:45.237
I have to go.

48:45.605 --> 48:48.200
Well, be careful.
I will.

48:57.005 --> 48:59.315
Dexter, go.
What if the marshal comes back?

48:59.485 --> 49:01.761
He's not coming back.
It's Evelyn who needs you right now.

49:01.925 --> 49:03.803
I should stay here with Hannah.

49:04.005 --> 49:05.803
This is exactly
what Vogel warned you about.

49:06.005 --> 49:08.361
You're trying to live
in two different worlds,
and it's got you paralysed.

49:08.525 --> 49:11.165
I'm not paralysed.
I'm making a choice.

49:11.325 --> 49:14.204
Son, you're choosing
to be afraid,

49:14.365 --> 49:17.324
because for the first time
in your life, you think
you've got something to lose.

49:17.485 --> 49:19.875
Is that who you
wanna be?

49:25.365 --> 49:28.199
Oh. That's all right.
I'll do it.

49:29.805 --> 49:31.683
I'm getting old.

49:31.845 --> 49:34.644
My aim isn't as good
as it used to be.

49:39.005 --> 49:41.042
Why'd you want
to see me tonight?

49:45.725 --> 49:49.162
I just thought it would be
nice for us to talk...

49:49.685 --> 49:52.325
about normal things.

49:52.485 --> 49:53.919
Unlike the other couple
of times.

49:54.085 --> 49:56.441
Mm. Of course.

50:02.765 --> 50:04.996
What's wrong?
Wrong?

50:05.165 --> 50:06.884
You seem tense.
No.

50:07.045 --> 50:10.356
No, not at all.
I'm very comfortable.

50:11.165 --> 50:14.556
Maybe a little tired,
under the circumstances.

50:20.365 --> 50:21.845
Is there something
you want to tell me?

50:27.485 --> 50:29.875
I just wanted to see you.

50:32.005 --> 50:35.919
Heh. Guess I'm sounding
like a mother already...

50:37.245 --> 50:39.043
constantly wanting
her son around.

50:45.445 --> 50:47.118
You know...

50:48.805 --> 50:51.400
when you see as many people
die as I have,

50:52.925 --> 50:54.962
you know when they're afraid.

50:56.325 --> 50:58.282
What are you afraid of,
Mother?

51:04.965 --> 51:06.240
<i>He's still here.</i>

51:10.445 --> 51:12.835
<i>Hello, Dexter.</i>
What do you want? Where—

51:13.005 --> 51:15.474
<i>Don't move.
I want to show you something.</i>

51:19.445 --> 51:20.674
Don't touch her.

51:20.845 --> 51:23.599
Mother chose
the wrong son, again.

51:34.725 --> 51:36.557
Evelyn?

51:36.725 --> 51:38.444
Oh, no, no, no.

51:38.605 --> 51:40.119
No...
