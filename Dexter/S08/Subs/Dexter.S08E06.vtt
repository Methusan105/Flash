<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:12.045 --> 00:13.798
Who's the guy that dropped you off?

00:14.005 --> 00:15.519
We didn't sleep together.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.762
You are certainly allowed
to be a player.

00:19.285 --> 00:21.197
You remember Cassie, right?
Yeah.

00:21.405 --> 00:22.441
New neighbour. Hi.
Hi.

00:22.645 --> 00:24.125
I kind of need to leave.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.760
I'll take care of Jamie.
Maybe we could reschedule?

00:27.005 --> 00:28.564
Yeah. I'd like that.

00:29.045 --> 00:30.877
Any reason why you
haven't taken the exam?

00:31.085 --> 00:33.964
I got your brother on my ass
about taking the sergeant's testâ€”

00:34.165 --> 00:36.236
What is so wrong about
bettering yourself?

00:36.445 --> 00:37.640
You nailed it, bro.

00:37.845 --> 00:41.236
Is he your choice for sergeant?
I'm ready for more responsibility.

00:41.445 --> 00:43.835
I want you to strongly consider
making her sergeant.

00:44.045 --> 00:45.365
I think you may be my father.

00:45.605 --> 00:49.155
Family showing up out of nowhere?
A lot of times, they want something.

00:49.405 --> 00:51.556
I you to do a background check
on someone.

00:51.765 --> 00:54.325
You think she's here to rip you off?
I don't know.

00:54.725 --> 00:55.841
Norma Rivera.

00:56.045 --> 00:58.799
She'd been having an affair
with the boss, Ed Hamilton.

00:59.005 --> 01:00.962
Dad, what's going on?
The Hamilton's son.

01:01.205 --> 01:03.356
Did you go to where
Norma Rivera was killed?

01:03.565 --> 01:06.763
I did.
What did you see in your analysis?

01:07.005 --> 01:08.803
Leave the kid alone.
He killed her.

01:09.045 --> 01:11.196
You don't know that.
Your only witness recanted.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.761
No reason to make enemies
unless we really have to.

01:13.965 --> 01:15.797
Where's Yates?

01:16.005 --> 01:18.804
So this is finally over.
My tormenter's dead.

01:19.005 --> 01:21.281
Thanks to you, Dexter.
And Deb.

01:21.485 --> 01:23.716
I'm glad you found your way
back to each other.

01:23.925 --> 01:25.803
Well, the family that kills together...

01:26.005 --> 01:28.964
A few days ago, everything seemed
hopeless between Deb and me.

01:29.165 --> 01:31.441
But through Dr. Vogel,
I've got my sister back.

01:31.645 --> 01:33.125
It's beautiful out here, Dexter.

01:33.365 --> 01:34.924
I wanted to be with family.

01:36.005 --> 01:42.079
FaceTime with British Models 24/7

03:37.525 --> 03:38.800
<i>Accidents happen,</i>

03:39.005 --> 03:41.156
<i>shattering our sense of control,</i>

03:41.405 --> 03:43.283
<i>if not our lives.</i>

03:46.605 --> 03:49.040
<i>It's no accident
that Zach Hamilton is here.</i>

03:49.245 --> 03:52.124
<i>He's drawn to blood, like me.</i>

03:53.645 --> 03:56.524
<i>Did he kill Norma Rivera?</i>

04:07.765 --> 04:11.361
<i>After a week of vetting him, I haven't
been able to find definitive proof.</i>

04:17.525 --> 04:21.678
<i>But I'm sure if I keep following him
the truth will become clear.</i>

04:38.925 --> 04:40.564
<i>Or it could get murkier.</i>

05:14.965 --> 05:16.081
Dexter.

05:16.285 --> 05:18.436
Have you taken on
Zach Hamilton as a patient?

05:18.645 --> 05:19.840
It's nice to see you too.

05:20.045 --> 05:23.163
I have to protect you from another
murderer? How did he get to you?

05:23.645 --> 05:24.965
His father contacted me

05:25.165 --> 05:28.920
because of my reputation
for working with psychopaths.

05:29.165 --> 05:33.239
He's concerned about his son's
behaviour, his propensity for violence.

05:33.445 --> 05:34.879
It's more than a propensity.

05:35.085 --> 05:38.317
I think Zach Hamilton
killed Norma Rivera.

05:39.445 --> 05:42.483
And I take it that
you followed him here today

05:42.685 --> 05:44.677
because you're planning
to kill him?

05:44.885 --> 05:48.083
The thought had crossed my mind,
yes, if I can find solid proof.

05:48.565 --> 05:51.876
Well, then it would seem
that we have a conflict of interest.

05:54.245 --> 05:56.202
I don't believe this.

05:57.205 --> 06:00.721
You're going to work with another killer
after what happened with Yates?

06:01.085 --> 06:03.839
Dexter, I appreciate your concern,

06:04.045 --> 06:07.834
but I'm not going to talk about
Zach Hamilton with you any further.

06:08.725 --> 06:10.125
It wouldn't be ethical.

06:10.325 --> 06:12.442
Suddenly,
you're worried about ethics?

06:12.685 --> 06:15.075
I know. I threw them out
the window when I met you

06:15.285 --> 06:17.356
because my life was on the line.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.523
Now the threat is over.

06:19.725 --> 06:21.921
You're bringing another threat
into your life.

06:22.125 --> 06:25.402
It's my work. What can I say?

06:25.885 --> 06:27.956
I treat dangerous people.

06:28.205 --> 06:29.798
It's a hazard of the job.

06:30.005 --> 06:31.519
Besides, you have no proof

06:31.725 --> 06:33.956
that Zach Hamilton
is guilty of anything.

06:34.685 --> 06:35.801
I will.

06:36.285 --> 06:37.639
If you do,

06:37.845 --> 06:39.802
then come to see me first,

06:40.045 --> 06:41.559
before you do anything,

06:41.765 --> 06:44.200
and we'll have
another conversation.

06:45.325 --> 06:47.237
Would you do me that favour?

06:48.405 --> 06:49.964
We'll see.

07:02.445 --> 07:04.914
Maybe this is why
she tracked me down, for money.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.878
You don't know that.

07:07.085 --> 07:09.645
I mean, maybe she genuinely
wanted to get to know you.

07:09.845 --> 07:12.565
What, at the same time
her Hyundai's being repossessed?

07:12.765 --> 07:15.075
Has she asked you for money?
No.

07:15.285 --> 07:18.562
But she always seems to be missing
her purse when the check comes.

07:23.045 --> 07:26.595
I thought we had a real connection.
You like having Niki in your life?

07:27.805 --> 07:29.637
I do.
Then why don't you wait it out

07:29.885 --> 07:32.002
and see how it plays out?

07:32.285 --> 07:35.119
In the meantime,
you can enjoy her company.

07:38.285 --> 07:39.639
Okay.

07:46.045 --> 07:47.604
Hm, heh.
Thanks, Deb.

07:47.765 --> 07:49.404
Welcome.

07:51.645 --> 07:54.365
Deb, got a new case.

07:55.565 --> 07:59.525
Let me guess, someone suspects their
significant other is fucking around.

08:00.125 --> 08:03.516
Yeah, but this one
is a bit different.

08:03.725 --> 08:06.524
How?
Because the person is me

08:06.725 --> 08:08.205
and the significant other

08:08.405 --> 08:11.045
is my sister's ass-chasing,
shithead boyfriend.

08:11.245 --> 08:13.077
Kevin Wyman, notorious player,

08:13.285 --> 08:16.198
frequents a singles bar in a hotel
where he keeps a suite.

08:17.005 --> 08:18.883
Have you tried talking to her?

08:19.085 --> 08:20.155
Susan doesn't listen to me.

08:20.365 --> 08:22.596
It'd just push her
more quickly into his arms.

08:22.805 --> 08:24.034
So that's off the table.

08:24.245 --> 08:27.761
Well, going behind her back
seems kind of fucked up.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.685
It's gotta be this way.
I gotta catch this guy in the act.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.604
Okay, but you're doing it
by yourself.

08:32.805 --> 08:34.205
I need your help on this, Deb.

08:34.365 --> 08:35.515
It'd be a lot less conspicuous

08:35.685 --> 08:37.404
if we work this as a couple.

08:37.605 --> 08:39.756
Well, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable.

08:39.965 --> 08:42.161
Well, are you comfortable
getting a pay cheque?

08:45.525 --> 08:46.800
Okay, boss.

08:48.765 --> 08:50.438
Thank you.

08:53.605 --> 08:55.676
Where does this piece go?

08:57.045 --> 08:58.764
Right here.

08:59.485 --> 09:00.805
Very good.

09:01.005 --> 09:02.598
Dex?

09:02.845 --> 09:05.360
Don't forget, my birthday picnic's
in a few days, okay?

09:05.605 --> 09:08.074
On the beach, outside of Papa's.
Bring Harrison.

09:08.285 --> 09:10.163
Yeah, we'll be there.
Great.

09:10.405 --> 09:13.318
You know who else
will be there? Cassie.

09:13.525 --> 09:14.754
I heard you have a date with her.

09:14.965 --> 09:16.081
No, it's not a date.

09:16.325 --> 09:20.160
I felt like I owed her one after we both
bailed on your dinner the other night.

09:20.365 --> 09:22.516
Why won't you just admit
that you like her

09:22.725 --> 09:24.717
and that I am an
awesome matchmaker?

09:24.965 --> 09:28.276
I admit that you're an awesome nanny.
You'll have to settle for that.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.557
We'll revisit this after the date.

09:31.885 --> 09:33.365
Oh, by the way,

09:33.565 --> 09:35.238
the TV remote has

09:35.445 --> 09:36.515
been missing since yesterday.

09:36.765 --> 09:38.438
I think somebody hid it

09:38.685 --> 09:41.519
but I can't get anything
out of him.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.122
Harrison, did you
take the TV remote?

09:44.325 --> 09:45.600
No.

09:45.805 --> 09:48.559
Do you know where it is?
No.

09:49.045 --> 09:50.161
He says he didn't take it.

09:50.405 --> 09:51.475
Right.

09:51.685 --> 09:54.200
Guess I'll just keep looking for it.

09:57.685 --> 10:00.120
Homicide in Liberty City.

10:00.325 --> 10:03.363
It looks like you're gonna have
to finish that puzzle on your own.

10:03.565 --> 10:05.602
I'm doing all the work anyway.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.961
Yeah, you are.

10:09.165 --> 10:11.077
Bye.
Bye.

10:20.045 --> 10:21.764
Welcome to spatter-land.

10:21.965 --> 10:23.319
Hope you brought extra string.

10:23.565 --> 10:25.602
Never leave home without it.

10:27.205 --> 10:28.355
Good news.

10:28.605 --> 10:30.642
We have the victim's boyfriend
in custody.

10:30.845 --> 10:33.314
A witness saw him
taking off from the scene,

10:33.525 --> 10:35.517
and he forgot to change
his bloody socks.

10:35.725 --> 10:37.478
Heh. God bless stupid killers.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.358
<i>Once again, drawn to blood.</i>

10:54.285 --> 10:57.562
<i>Looks like Zach has just given me
the in I need.</i>

11:17.725 --> 11:20.081
Zach Hamilton, right?

11:20.365 --> 11:21.958
You were at my house.

11:22.205 --> 11:23.321
That's right.

11:23.885 --> 11:26.320
You guys find out
who killed Norma?

11:26.845 --> 11:29.679
No luck. It's a dead end.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.805
You like to shoot crime scenes?

11:34.045 --> 11:36.924
Yeah, I got a police scanner
app on my phone.

11:37.125 --> 11:38.605
Better than playing video games.

11:38.845 --> 11:41.599
You ever been on the other side
of the yellow tape?

11:42.125 --> 11:44.765
Nope.
This is as close as I've gotten.

11:45.645 --> 11:47.955
Well, come on.

11:49.805 --> 11:53.116
Are you serious?
Yeah, just don't touch anything.

12:00.965 --> 12:02.558
Whoa.

12:04.525 --> 12:06.437
This is amazing.

12:06.845 --> 12:10.043
<i>I remember that feeling.
Awe, wonder.</i>

12:10.245 --> 12:11.361
<i>It only fed the urge.</i>

12:11.565 --> 12:14.034
Hey, can I take some pictures?

12:15.885 --> 12:19.561
It's usually against protocol,

12:19.805 --> 12:21.034
but what the hell? Go ahead.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.402
Cool. Thanks.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.995
So, what happened to her?

12:29.205 --> 12:30.719
She was stabbed.

12:30.925 --> 12:33.440
Yeah, obviously.
But, like, you know, how?

12:33.925 --> 12:36.724
<i>If I open up to him,
maybe he'll open up to me.</i>

12:36.925 --> 12:38.439
Come on. I can handle it.

12:42.045 --> 12:44.082
Well, the victim
tried to defend herself.

12:44.325 --> 12:46.237
There were defensive
wounds on her body

12:46.445 --> 12:50.564
but you can also tell by these
big, round drops on the ground.

12:54.125 --> 12:56.003
And this multiple cast-off spatter

12:56.205 --> 12:59.357
suggests that she was
stabbed several times.

12:59.565 --> 13:02.285
And the arterial spurting here

13:02.485 --> 13:05.364
indicates that the killer
severed her carotid artery

13:05.565 --> 13:07.238
with the first stab.

13:09.165 --> 13:11.964
You can tell all that
just by looking at the blood?

13:12.845 --> 13:13.995
Pretty much.

13:14.805 --> 13:16.478
Awesome.

13:18.685 --> 13:20.836
So I heard you caught
the guy who did it.

13:21.045 --> 13:22.877
Yeah, her boyfriend.
How?

13:23.085 --> 13:26.078
He was sloppy.
Left a bloody print and DNA.

13:26.325 --> 13:28.476
He was spotted
driving away from the scene.

13:28.685 --> 13:30.358
Oh, yeah? What kind of car?

13:30.565 --> 13:32.921
<i>Must have heard his Porsche
was seen at Norma's apartment.</i>

13:33.165 --> 13:34.360
No one noticed.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.277
So the killer,

13:42.285 --> 13:44.436
he should've worn gloves
and long sleeves,

13:44.645 --> 13:46.125
made sure
he was covered up.

13:46.325 --> 13:49.124
<i>He's making this a teaching moment.</i>

13:49.845 --> 13:52.280
Well, yeah, if he was smart.

13:53.685 --> 13:54.880
<i>The kid's a quick study,</i>

13:55.085 --> 13:57.520
<i>but that doesn't prove
he killed Norma Rivera.</i>

13:59.085 --> 14:03.716
So, hey, I gotta get going,
but thanks.

14:04.405 --> 14:07.637
Hey, why don't you give me a call
when you print those up?

14:07.845 --> 14:09.837
I'd love to take a look.

14:10.565 --> 14:13.524
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.760
<i>Time to make another connection.</i>

14:26.565 --> 14:29.717
Here you go.
Thank you.

14:29.925 --> 14:32.235
Thank you
for doing this with me.

14:32.445 --> 14:35.563
When you own a food truck, you
have to scope out the competition.

14:35.765 --> 14:37.279
Plus I just really love to eat.

14:37.525 --> 14:38.561
Yeah, no problem.

14:38.765 --> 14:41.041
I wouldn't miss these peanut butter
and Nutella fries for anything.

14:41.245 --> 14:42.759
Mm-hm.

14:48.325 --> 14:50.521
So you're indulging me
in my favourite pastime.

14:50.725 --> 14:52.364
What do you like to do for fun?

14:52.565 --> 14:55.000
You know, normal stuff.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.238
Like what?

14:58.325 --> 15:00.635
Um...
Heh, heh.

15:01.965 --> 15:03.922
I like spending time with my son.

15:04.125 --> 15:06.321
I already know you're
a great dad. What else?

15:08.205 --> 15:09.275
I love my job.

15:09.925 --> 15:12.565
But that's work.
What are you passionate about?

15:15.485 --> 15:16.999
I like to bowl.

15:17.205 --> 15:18.878
You're passionate about bowling?

15:20.885 --> 15:22.683
No. Heh.
Heh, heh.

15:22.885 --> 15:24.683
Of course not.

15:24.885 --> 15:27.480
I just do it for fun, once in a while.

15:29.285 --> 15:32.722
What about your weekends
or your free time?

15:34.165 --> 15:35.645
Oh, I have a boat.

15:35.845 --> 15:37.120
Oh, I love to sail.

15:37.725 --> 15:39.682
No, it's a motorboat.

15:39.885 --> 15:42.002
Oh. You water-ski?

15:42.325 --> 15:43.725
No.

15:43.965 --> 15:46.525
Race?
No.

15:47.365 --> 15:49.038
Do you scuba dive?

15:49.565 --> 15:50.999
No.

15:51.165 --> 15:53.760
Heh, heh.
What do you do on your boat?

15:55.165 --> 15:56.485
I just...

15:56.725 --> 15:59.684
Take it out and...

16:00.565 --> 16:02.557
Turn around and come back.

16:04.045 --> 16:05.081
That's it?

16:05.285 --> 16:07.561
<i>That's all I can tell you.</i>

16:08.125 --> 16:09.798
I think we may need
some alcohol.

16:10.885 --> 16:12.239
Right.

16:13.445 --> 16:16.040
<i>Dating is harder than I remember.</i>

16:23.045 --> 16:24.718
Oh, this guy is fucking pathetic.

16:24.965 --> 16:27.525
I get that you hate the guy,
but looking isn't cheating.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.637
It's a slow night.
Give him a minute.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.244
So you said Susan
doesn't listen.

16:34.445 --> 16:36.914
Does that mean you all
have a strained relationship?

16:37.125 --> 16:38.605
Not from my end, no.

16:39.565 --> 16:41.318
But from hers?

16:42.325 --> 16:43.964
Yeah, you know, probably.

16:44.725 --> 16:47.604
I mean, look, I couldn't wait
to get away from my old man,

16:47.805 --> 16:49.398
and Susan was just a kid.

16:49.605 --> 16:53.565
You know, I should have
at least picked up the phone.

16:54.645 --> 16:57.114
But I never did,
you know, so...

16:59.405 --> 17:01.795
Well, you can't undo the past.

17:03.365 --> 17:06.005
And families fuck you up.
That's just the way it is.

17:07.485 --> 17:10.125
I can stop Susan from fucking up her future.
I can do that.

17:14.085 --> 17:16.520
It looks like he's
packing it in for the night.

17:16.765 --> 17:19.121
If you wanna catch this guy,
why don't I set him up?

17:19.325 --> 17:22.397
We can see if he takes the bait.
No, I don't want you doing that.

17:22.645 --> 17:25.444
I worked Vice. I've done
worse than that before.

17:27.685 --> 17:29.756
I just need pictures
of him hitting on you.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.558
Certainly nothing
more than that.

17:31.765 --> 17:33.119
Are you sure?

17:33.365 --> 17:36.995
I mean, I could marry him,
maybe pop out a couple of babies.

17:38.405 --> 17:39.919
Let's go.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.197
Dexter, thanks for coming.
Sure.

17:58.965 --> 18:00.797
Couldn't wait to show you
these photos.

18:01.005 --> 18:02.917
Yeah, no problem.
It's on my way to work.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.241
Doughnut?

18:05.005 --> 18:06.234
Fucking A.

18:08.205 --> 18:09.241
Mm.

18:11.245 --> 18:12.964
Well?

18:16.045 --> 18:19.356
<i>He treats the blood
like a swimsuit model.</i>

18:20.165 --> 18:21.758
Well,

18:22.485 --> 18:24.124
very colourful.

18:24.325 --> 18:27.875
You know, a lot of photographers
like to mute down their reds.

18:28.125 --> 18:30.799
You know,
find it too distracting,

18:31.045 --> 18:33.355
but I like to ride the saturation.

18:33.525 --> 18:34.800
Hm.

18:36.565 --> 18:38.079
You think I overdid it?

18:38.765 --> 18:40.757
No way. These are you.

18:40.965 --> 18:42.479
That's the important thing.

18:42.725 --> 18:45.365
Well, I can work you up
some prints, if you want.

18:45.605 --> 18:46.959
I wouldn't have them
if it weren't for you.

18:47.165 --> 18:50.317
Actually, I think I have
plenty of my own.

18:52.525 --> 18:53.845
Right.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.480
Of course.
I forget it was a crime scene.

18:56.685 --> 19:00.599
Keep thinking that dead chick
spilled all that blood just for me.

19:07.525 --> 19:08.845
Who's she?

19:10.925 --> 19:12.439
Uh, it's nothing.

19:13.565 --> 19:16.364
Just a lens test.

19:16.565 --> 19:19.080
New 300 millimetre.
Fucking monster.

19:19.285 --> 19:20.275
Wow.

19:22.805 --> 19:24.125
Excuse me.

19:24.285 --> 19:25.685
Yep?

19:33.285 --> 19:37.199
Jesus, you still drunk from last night
or are you starting a new bender?

19:37.445 --> 19:41.075
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I said okay.

19:42.845 --> 19:44.996
Uh, I gotta go.

19:45.245 --> 19:47.441
Anything wrong?
It's fine. I just gotta go.

19:49.565 --> 19:51.124
Sure, some other time then.

19:53.885 --> 19:56.764
<i>I'll have to find another way
to get to him.</i>

20:04.005 --> 20:05.041
Ah, lieutenant.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.998
Tell me something.

20:07.205 --> 20:09.242
Did you decide
you don't need a sergeant?

20:09.445 --> 20:11.880
Sir?
I expected an announcement by now.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.121
What's going on?

20:13.805 --> 20:17.924
To tell you the truth, I'm having trouble
narrowing down my choice.

20:23.845 --> 20:27.316
I know you want me to pick Miller,
and on paper, I can't argue with that.

20:27.525 --> 20:30.324
Scored higher on the test,
got the experience, the recordâ€”

20:30.525 --> 20:32.403
She's African-American,
a woman.

20:32.605 --> 20:35.803
Here's the thing,
Quinn has his attributes too.

20:36.925 --> 20:37.961
Name one.

20:38.165 --> 20:39.201
He's street-smart.

20:40.205 --> 20:42.083
Look, I know what's going on here.

20:42.285 --> 20:44.561
What do you mean?
You want me to be the bad guy.

20:44.805 --> 20:47.001
You want me to insist
that you promote Miller.

20:47.205 --> 20:49.436
That way you can tell Quinn,
"I had no choice."

20:49.685 --> 20:51.961
I'm not sure that'sâ€”
You're lieutenant now.

20:52.165 --> 20:53.645
Time to grow a set of balls.

20:53.845 --> 20:56.440
I wanna hear something
by the end of the day.

21:22.005 --> 21:24.395
Just like old times, huh?

21:25.045 --> 21:27.879
You, me, steak, beer.

21:28.085 --> 21:30.077
Yeah, it's been a while.

21:34.845 --> 21:36.040
So how are things?

21:36.245 --> 21:38.555
Good, great. You?

21:38.765 --> 21:41.803
Fine. Better.

21:42.445 --> 21:44.437
Good. I'm glad.

21:45.925 --> 21:47.598
Me too.

21:49.045 --> 21:50.764
I think these are done.

21:58.965 --> 22:01.241
Well, how's work?

22:01.445 --> 22:03.437
Uh, crazy.

22:03.645 --> 22:07.525
Elway wants to catch his sister's
boyfriend fucking around on her,

22:07.765 --> 22:10.803
so I offered myself as bait
so he'd get it done.

22:11.005 --> 22:13.395
Whatâ€”? You did what?

22:13.645 --> 22:15.443
I used to do it
all the time in Vice.

22:15.965 --> 22:17.001
Yeah, and you hated it.

22:17.205 --> 22:19.037
Why put yourself
in that position again?

22:19.245 --> 22:20.759
Because he's my boss.

22:20.965 --> 22:24.356
And because I can only take
one control freak at a time.

22:26.165 --> 22:27.599
Sorry.

22:34.685 --> 22:36.404
This is tough.

22:38.645 --> 22:39.681
A little.

22:39.925 --> 22:42.520
Not exactly worth living for.

22:42.725 --> 22:44.398
What?

22:45.245 --> 22:47.805
You said that once
when you tasted one of my steaks,

22:48.005 --> 22:49.564
that it was worth living for.

22:49.805 --> 22:52.525
For some reason,
I've always remembered that.

22:55.685 --> 22:56.755
It'll get easier, Dex.

22:56.965 --> 22:59.161
We're just getting
back in the saddle, you know?

22:59.365 --> 23:02.403
Yeah, I think we might be
eating a saddle.

23:06.005 --> 23:08.281
Are you still seeing Dr. Vogel?

23:08.485 --> 23:11.683
Yeah, it's too bad for me
there's no magic pill to cure PTSD.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.357
Well, as long as she's helping you.

23:15.125 --> 23:17.845
Like, she knows everything
about our lives because of Dad,

23:18.085 --> 23:19.644
but I know jack shit about her.

23:19.845 --> 23:21.677
Where'd she get
that fucking accent?

23:21.925 --> 23:23.996
And who the fuck is Rich?

23:24.645 --> 23:27.205
Her husband.
She was married?

23:27.405 --> 23:29.044
When I first looked into her,

23:29.245 --> 23:31.476
I found out some stuff
about her background,

23:31.725 --> 23:34.479
and she was married
to a Dr. Richard Vogel.

23:34.885 --> 23:36.205
Huh.

23:36.925 --> 23:41.044
Okay, so Harrison's asleep.
And look what I found under his bed.

23:41.245 --> 23:42.565
Ooh, someone's in trouble.

23:42.765 --> 23:43.960
He lied about it.

23:44.165 --> 23:45.519
At least now we know why.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.318
I hope it's under warranty,

23:47.525 --> 23:51.917
or I'll be stuck with whatever's on
PBS Kids for the foreseeable future.

23:52.125 --> 23:53.957
I'll talk to him.
Okay.

23:54.205 --> 23:56.640
Enjoy your dinner, guys.
Bye.

23:59.765 --> 24:02.121
Should I be worried
that Harrison's lying?

24:02.325 --> 24:04.396
He's 4, doofus.

24:04.605 --> 24:06.119
Right.

24:07.005 --> 24:09.281
This steak tastes like asshole.
Yeah.

24:10.685 --> 24:12.278
Let's order pizza.

24:12.485 --> 24:13.805
With pineapple, please.

24:14.005 --> 24:15.962
Not on my half.

24:17.565 --> 24:19.318
Sorry, cow.

24:39.005 --> 24:40.519
What's up?

24:41.365 --> 24:43.596
I'm promoting Miller to sergeant.

24:44.405 --> 24:45.805
Say that again?

24:46.525 --> 24:48.403
I'm giving Miller the job. I'm sorry.

24:48.605 --> 24:51.757
I just think she's
the most qualified candidate.

24:51.965 --> 24:55.402
Are you fucking kidding me?
I mean, after all the quizzes,

24:55.605 --> 24:57.961
and the speeches
about bettering my life?

24:58.165 --> 25:00.361
You actually made me want this,

25:00.605 --> 25:02.597
and now you're gonna take it away.

25:02.805 --> 25:04.956
Why, because I didn't solve
the Rivera case?

25:05.165 --> 25:06.565
No, of course not.

25:06.765 --> 25:09.758
It's just a lot of other stuff
I can't ignore, man.

25:10.325 --> 25:13.921
The Nadia thing,
shooting Novikov.

25:14.125 --> 25:15.275
You know what? Fuck it.

25:15.485 --> 25:17.920
You did what you thought was right.

25:18.165 --> 25:19.804
Leave it at that.

25:26.805 --> 25:28.239
Hey.

25:28.445 --> 25:31.677
I need everything you got
on the Norma Rivera case,

25:31.925 --> 25:34.645
anything that points
to Zach Hamilton.

25:34.885 --> 25:40.005
Uh, well, forensically, there's not much.
There's nothing, actually.

25:42.165 --> 25:45.954
Fuck it. I'll just tail the little prick 24/7
until I get what I need.

25:46.165 --> 25:47.918
<i>If Quinn's stalking Zach, how can I?</i>

25:48.085 --> 25:50.202
Won't even know I'm there
till I bust him.

25:50.445 --> 25:52.323
You mind if I come along?

25:55.045 --> 25:56.638
You want to come along?

25:57.525 --> 25:59.881
Things are slow here.
I'm going a little stir-crazy.

26:00.125 --> 26:01.957
Maybe you could use
another set of eyes?

26:02.685 --> 26:04.199
Sure.

26:24.445 --> 26:27.756
I mean, you think
Miller's clean? Come on.

26:27.965 --> 26:30.275
You dig deep enough
on anyone in this department

26:30.525 --> 26:32.482
and you know what you find?

26:33.765 --> 26:35.757
What?
The shit.

26:35.965 --> 26:37.957
It's there. I mean, we all got it.

26:38.205 --> 26:40.322
I know you know
what I'm talking about.

26:41.285 --> 26:43.754
Yeah, I can't argue with that.
We've all got the shit.

26:43.965 --> 26:45.365
Yeah.

26:45.565 --> 26:48.125
Big difference is some people
get away with theirs

26:48.325 --> 26:50.044
and some people don't.

26:51.085 --> 26:52.917
You're a good detective.
It'll work out.

26:53.125 --> 26:55.799
Yeah, I'm just worried about
how Jamie's going to take it.

26:56.005 --> 26:59.442
I think she was all excited
about me moving up in the world,

26:59.685 --> 27:01.642
making something out of my life.

27:01.845 --> 27:04.838
She'll probably break up
with my ass now.

27:05.645 --> 27:08.683
Jesus Christ, how many pictures
of fucking women in tights

27:08.885 --> 27:10.239
does this pervert need?

27:10.845 --> 27:12.723
Apparently, a lot.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.716
How's Deb doing?
I've been worried about her.

27:16.365 --> 27:19.278
She's good. She's much better.

27:19.725 --> 27:22.445
You guys work out
whatever your issue was?

27:22.645 --> 27:23.715
What do you mean?

27:23.925 --> 27:27.760
I mean, you guys have been connected
at the hip for most of your lives.

27:28.005 --> 27:31.237
All of a sudden, you're not talking,
you don't see each other.

27:32.165 --> 27:34.396
Somebody shit
in somebody's Cheerios.

27:34.605 --> 27:36.119
Yeah.

27:36.645 --> 27:40.161
Just typical brother and sister stuff.
It's no big deal.

27:41.325 --> 27:42.600
Something had her fucked up.

27:42.845 --> 27:45.679
How weird was it that
she confessed to killing LaGuerta?

27:45.885 --> 27:47.604
<i>I should have stayed in my office.</i>

27:47.805 --> 27:49.762
What was that about?

27:53.485 --> 27:56.523
<i>That's the woman in the photo
that Zach didn't want me to see.</i>

27:57.325 --> 28:00.602
<i>And he isn't looking at the class,
he's looking at her.</i>

28:02.245 --> 28:03.440
You know what I'm saying?

28:03.645 --> 28:04.920
<i>Fortunately, Quinn isn't.</i>

28:05.685 --> 28:09.474
Well, people do weird stuff
when they're under a lot of stress.

28:09.685 --> 28:12.359
We may never know
what that was all about.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.158
All right, see you guys later.

28:14.365 --> 28:17.563
Looks like they're done.
- So is our guy.

28:23.845 --> 28:24.881
Buckle up.

28:44.045 --> 28:45.559
Hey.
Hey.

28:45.725 --> 28:48.240
Wow. Okay. Uh...
What?

28:48.445 --> 28:50.596
You look incredible.
Good job.

28:50.805 --> 28:53.445
Well, that's the point.
Don't look so fucking surprised.

28:53.645 --> 28:56.160
Didn't leave me a lot of places
to put the transmitter.

28:56.365 --> 28:58.721
Are you bitching? I'm the one
helping you, remember?

28:58.965 --> 29:02.117
I just don't wanna touch
anything I'm not supposed to.

29:03.205 --> 29:04.685
Here.

29:12.645 --> 29:14.284
Thank you.

29:18.565 --> 29:21.125
Mic?
There you go.

29:28.325 --> 29:30.760
I'm not looking.
I'm not looking.

29:31.405 --> 29:32.441
Okay.
Okay?

29:32.645 --> 29:34.557
Yep.
All right.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.363
Quickly, just say
something for me.

29:40.565 --> 29:42.363
You blush like a little girl.

29:42.525 --> 29:45.563
Heh, heh. Okay, just...

29:46.445 --> 29:48.914
Just get him alone.
That's all I need, okay?

29:49.125 --> 29:51.845
Okay.
Thank you.

29:53.925 --> 29:55.996
I'm really glad we met.

29:56.885 --> 29:58.524
Me too.

30:00.445 --> 30:03.005
You know, I didn't know
if I mentioned it,

30:03.165 --> 30:05.396
but tonight's kind of a celebration.

30:05.605 --> 30:07.403
Yeah?

30:08.005 --> 30:10.201
Closed a huge deal.

30:10.405 --> 30:13.204
Two blocks downtown,
prime views of the bay.

30:13.405 --> 30:16.682
It's gonna rent through the roof
and I get a big piece of it.

30:16.885 --> 30:20.356
Something tells me you like
getting a big piece of everything.

30:22.365 --> 30:24.357
Whenever I can manage.

30:24.565 --> 30:25.840
Congratulations.

30:26.045 --> 30:27.274
Thank you.

30:27.445 --> 30:29.755
I just wish I had a present for you.

30:33.805 --> 30:36.525
What do you say we migrate
to my suite?

30:36.725 --> 30:39.285
Got a nice little private bar.

30:39.525 --> 30:42.085
It's a lot quieter than this place.

30:44.525 --> 30:46.244
All done here.

30:48.525 --> 30:51.643
You're gonna love the views.
It's beautiful.

30:52.725 --> 30:54.956
Nice, light music.

30:57.245 --> 30:59.999
It'll be real nice.
No, save it for the room.

31:00.205 --> 31:02.765
What, you playing hard to get?
I don't kiss in public.

31:03.005 --> 31:04.644
You're bashful.
Mm-hm. Maybe.

31:06.045 --> 31:08.435
Get your fucking hands off of her!

31:08.645 --> 31:11.240
Jesus, Elway.

31:11.965 --> 31:13.001
The hell is going on?

31:13.205 --> 31:15.800
She's wired, douche bag.
You're done.

31:16.005 --> 31:17.234
You fucking son of a bitch.

31:17.445 --> 31:20.199
You're gonna call Susan tonight.
Tell her it's over.

31:20.445 --> 31:22.835
If you don't, she's getting an e-mail.
You got it?

31:23.525 --> 31:25.323
You got it?

31:25.525 --> 31:27.596
Yeah, I got it.
Good.

31:27.805 --> 31:29.364
You're an asshole.

31:33.245 --> 31:34.759
The fuck are you thinking?

31:37.205 --> 31:39.162
I'm sorry, all right? I justâ€”

31:39.365 --> 31:43.803
Seeing him paw all over you like that,
I don't like that shit.

31:45.085 --> 31:46.280
I'm sorry about your top.

31:46.485 --> 31:49.080
That's okay. It's all right. I got it.

32:11.285 --> 32:13.800
<i>Sofia Fuentes,
current place of employment:</i>

32:14.005 --> 32:16.361
<i>the Cypress Harbour Yacht Club,</i>

32:16.565 --> 32:18.716
<i>which is owned by Zach's family.</i>

32:18.925 --> 32:22.157
<i>That's where Zach must have
first laid eyes on her.</i>

32:22.405 --> 32:25.364
<i>If Zach takes pictures of his victims
before he's killed them,</i>

32:25.565 --> 32:28.524
<i>chances are he likes
after photos as well.</i>

32:28.725 --> 32:32.196
<i>If he did kill Norma Rivera,
then he's got the photos to prove it.</i>

33:18.885 --> 33:22.083
<i>Sofia. Probably his next victim.</i>

33:22.965 --> 33:26.641
<i>Now I just need to find
any photos of Norma Rivera.</i>

34:23.405 --> 34:24.998
<i>Norma Rivera.</i>

34:25.205 --> 34:27.162
<i>Taken seconds after she was killed,</i>

34:27.365 --> 34:31.882
<i>the pool of blood around her head
growing from one image to the next.</i>

34:35.965 --> 34:39.163
<i>Zach Hamilton,
murder weapon in hand.</i>

34:39.365 --> 34:41.436
<i>All the proof I need.</i>

34:49.365 --> 34:51.482
You wanted proof. There it is.

34:51.685 --> 34:53.597
Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.

34:54.925 --> 34:58.521
Yes. I know.

35:00.005 --> 35:01.803
You know?
Mm.

35:02.645 --> 35:06.036
Zach told me
during our first session.

35:06.245 --> 35:08.840
But you didn't tell me
because of your sense of ethics?

35:09.085 --> 35:11.316
Oh, forget ethics.

35:11.525 --> 35:15.041
Why would I help facilitate the death
of someone I see potential in?

35:15.245 --> 35:17.282
Potential? He's a killer.
He deserves to die.

35:17.445 --> 35:21.883
Heh, heh. Isn't that a little
intolerant, coming from you?

35:22.085 --> 35:23.724
I don't kill innocent people.

35:26.645 --> 35:28.398
But you might have,

35:29.405 --> 35:31.317
if it hadn't been for Harry and me.

35:31.845 --> 35:34.360
You could even
be on death row right now.

35:34.565 --> 35:36.238
Right.

35:36.485 --> 35:39.557
But you were spared.
Yeah, spared because of the code.

35:42.645 --> 35:45.114
That's an interesting idea.

35:45.325 --> 35:46.725
What do you mean?

35:48.365 --> 35:50.755
What if we were
to teach Zach the code?

35:51.005 --> 35:53.281
You can't be serious.
Why not?

35:53.485 --> 35:56.683
It never occurred to me to try again,

35:56.925 --> 35:59.121
because I didn't have Harry.

35:59.805 --> 36:01.762
But now I have you.

36:02.245 --> 36:04.202
Maybe it's time to see

36:05.165 --> 36:06.679
if the experiment will work.

36:06.885 --> 36:08.558
This isn't a science project.

36:08.765 --> 36:12.156
No, but it's a matter of life and death.

36:12.365 --> 36:15.005
Zach's life is on the line.

36:15.205 --> 36:19.119
What possibly makes you think
Zach could be taught the code?

36:19.365 --> 36:23.041
I told you, I see something in him.
And it worked with you.

36:23.285 --> 36:26.039
Zach and I are nothing alike.
No, of course not.

36:26.285 --> 36:29.039
You are definitely one of a kind.

36:29.245 --> 36:31.999
He killed an innocent
and he's getting ready to do it again.

36:32.205 --> 36:33.924
He needs to die.

36:42.645 --> 36:45.524
<i>Harrison.
I never intended to have a son,</i>

36:45.765 --> 36:49.839
<i>but now he's the one thing in my life
that seems most right.</i>

36:50.045 --> 36:51.957
There she is!

36:52.245 --> 36:53.281
Hi!

36:55.165 --> 36:57.396
Yay! Aw. Mwah.

36:57.605 --> 37:00.723
Happy birthday.
Aw, thanks, Dex. Thank you.

37:00.925 --> 37:01.961
Can I go play?

37:03.245 --> 37:05.840
Yeah, sure. Have fun.

37:07.045 --> 37:09.321
Stay close, Harrison.

37:14.725 --> 37:15.841
Yeah, I'mâ€”

37:16.085 --> 37:18.998
I'm not sure if he's a date
or just a friend.

37:19.205 --> 37:21.595
I mean, what I do know
is that she's very attractive,

37:21.845 --> 37:22.881
and men like her,

37:23.085 --> 37:25.725
so if you want a chance,
you better move fast.

37:26.485 --> 37:28.044
Right.

37:32.005 --> 37:33.758
I think I'm gonna go grab a beer.

37:35.125 --> 37:37.117
You know, this may sound weird,

37:37.325 --> 37:40.397
and I don't mean
to sound creepy or anything,

37:40.605 --> 37:42.437
but I think I really like you.

37:42.645 --> 37:44.523
Aw, I like you too.

37:45.365 --> 37:47.482
I'm not really ready
to call you "Dad,"

37:47.685 --> 37:50.359
but you're cool.

37:50.565 --> 37:53.558
"Cool"? Usually, I'm the only one
that calls me that.

37:53.765 --> 37:55.279
So that's awesome.

37:55.485 --> 37:58.239
Oh, hey. I got you something.

37:58.445 --> 38:01.119
What?
It's really not a big deal.

38:03.405 --> 38:06.159
It's not a big deal?
You're giving me $5000? Why?

38:06.365 --> 38:08.834
Hey, I know
you could really use it.

38:09.045 --> 38:12.117
But you should know that
that's really all that I can afford.

38:12.325 --> 38:14.203
I don't understand.
How do you know that?

38:14.405 --> 38:16.044
Well, you know,

38:16.245 --> 38:18.077
I just did a little research on you.

38:18.725 --> 38:21.001
You checked into me?
Like a criminal?

38:21.205 --> 38:23.037
No, I just wanted to make sure

38:23.245 --> 38:25.043
you were who you said you were.

38:25.285 --> 38:27.561
And that I wasn't after you
for your money?

38:28.445 --> 38:30.437
I justâ€”
Look, I have debts,

38:30.645 --> 38:32.159
but they're soon to be paid,

38:32.365 --> 38:34.436
and that's not really
any of your business.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.557
I wouldn't ask you for this.

38:36.765 --> 38:37.994
I'm really sorry.

38:38.205 --> 38:40.640
Do you understand that it was
hard for me to do this?

38:40.885 --> 38:41.921
To find my father?

38:42.125 --> 38:44.435
But I felt like it was worth it
to get to know you.

38:44.645 --> 38:47.558
You know, maybe I was wrong.
Here you go. No, thank you.

38:47.805 --> 38:48.921
Hey, Nikiâ€”

38:49.125 --> 38:51.481
All right, everyone.
I'd like to make a toast.

38:51.725 --> 38:56.322
To the best kid sister
a guy could ever have, Jamie.

38:56.565 --> 38:57.794
Aw.
Aw. Thank you.

38:58.005 --> 38:59.234
I love you.
Happy birthday.

38:59.485 --> 39:01.078
I love you too.

39:01.285 --> 39:02.514
Aw, thank you, guys.

39:02.725 --> 39:04.318
Thank you so much for coming.

39:04.525 --> 39:08.360
You guys are the best, and it
really is so nice to have you all

39:08.565 --> 39:10.204
here in one place together.

39:10.405 --> 39:12.681
I love you guys. Cheers.

39:13.445 --> 39:15.482
Happy birthday.

39:16.805 --> 39:19.798
And here's to you, Sergeant Quinn.

39:20.685 --> 39:21.880
I know it's prematureâ€”

39:22.085 --> 39:23.758
Way premature.
You didn't tell her?

39:23.965 --> 39:26.400
I didn't want to upset her
on her birthday.

39:26.845 --> 39:28.359
No.

39:28.765 --> 39:30.836
You didn't get the job?

39:32.005 --> 39:33.200
You didn't give it to him?

39:33.405 --> 39:35.840
I had to go with the person
best for the job.

39:36.045 --> 39:37.195
And how is that not Joey?

39:37.405 --> 39:39.601
Hey, it's okay.
He gave the promotion to Miller.

39:39.805 --> 39:40.841
It's, you know...

39:41.045 --> 39:43.435
But going for sergeant
was your idea in the first place.

39:44.405 --> 39:45.919
You set him up.

39:46.125 --> 39:48.037
I didn't mean to.
Jesus, Angel.

39:55.485 --> 39:57.238
Hey.
Dexter, hi.

39:57.445 --> 40:00.005
How are you?
I'm great. You?

40:00.205 --> 40:02.322
Great. Nice party, huh?

40:02.525 --> 40:04.084
Yeah.

40:05.885 --> 40:07.638
The beach.

40:07.885 --> 40:10.639
Yeah. Harrison looks like
he's having a really nice time.

40:10.885 --> 40:12.478
Yep.

40:14.005 --> 40:16.315
Uh, Dexter, this is Oliver.
Oliver, Dexter.

40:16.525 --> 40:19.085
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, you too.

40:19.285 --> 40:22.164
I didn't know if you wanted
the Belgian brown or the pilsner,

40:22.365 --> 40:24.436
so I got you the one
with the moose on it.

40:24.645 --> 40:26.876
Can't go wrong with a moose.
Heh, heh, heh.

40:29.445 --> 40:31.164
I'm gonna go check on Harrison.

40:31.685 --> 40:33.995
Okay, take care.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.358
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, that's great.

40:36.565 --> 40:38.796
- That's your neighbour, right?
- Yes.

40:48.125 --> 40:50.845
What happened with Susan?
Wyman break up with her?

40:51.045 --> 40:52.843
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

40:53.485 --> 40:54.521
So it's a win.

40:54.765 --> 40:57.121
Why do you look like someone
just ran over your dog?

40:57.325 --> 41:00.557
I just got off the phone with her
and she couldn't stop crying.

41:00.965 --> 41:02.479
She thinks it's all her fault,

41:02.685 --> 41:05.564
like somehow, she's not
good enough or something.

41:05.765 --> 41:08.724
Well, she would've caught him
cheating eventually.

41:08.925 --> 41:11.394
The result
would have been the same.

41:11.845 --> 41:15.156
Yeah, but it wouldn't be me
that made her cry.

41:16.165 --> 41:18.521
Jesus, I just feel like shit.

41:19.245 --> 41:21.237
People can't help
sticking their noses in

41:21.445 --> 41:23.198
when it's someone
they care about.

41:23.645 --> 41:25.318
I know.

41:25.525 --> 41:28.165
I know. You tried to tell me.

41:30.965 --> 41:32.957
So does that mean
you care about me?

41:34.405 --> 41:37.876
Only to the extent
that you sign my pay cheque.

41:40.285 --> 41:41.878
TouchÃ©.

41:42.085 --> 41:45.681
Okay, what are we gonna read tonight?
Let me guess, <i>Wee Monkeys.</i>

41:45.885 --> 41:47.478
<i>Wee Monkeys!</i>

41:57.285 --> 42:02.201
Before I read to you, I gotta
talk to you about the TV remote.

42:02.405 --> 42:03.805
You said you didn't take it,

42:04.045 --> 42:06.435
but Jamie found it
under your bed.

42:11.005 --> 42:12.359
I didn't mean to break it.

42:12.565 --> 42:14.602
I was pretending
it was a Thunder Blaster

42:14.845 --> 42:17.235
and I dropped it in the kitchen.

42:17.445 --> 42:19.357
Well, yeah, that's okay.
Accidents happen.

42:19.565 --> 42:21.284
But you lied to me.
That's a big deal.

42:21.485 --> 42:23.317
We should never lie.

42:27.285 --> 42:29.117
But, Daddy,

42:29.925 --> 42:31.757
you lie.

42:34.325 --> 42:36.078
What do you mean?

42:48.525 --> 42:51.085
You told me Doggy got lost.

42:51.285 --> 42:53.845
I saw you throw him in the trash.

42:54.045 --> 42:56.355
I had to rescue him.

43:01.005 --> 43:03.042
You're right. I lied.

43:04.645 --> 43:07.877
Doggy got dirty,
and I tried to clean him up,

43:08.085 --> 43:10.805
and when I couldn't,
I threw him away.

43:11.605 --> 43:13.915
I'm sorry I lied to you, Harrison.

43:14.125 --> 43:16.685
That's okay.
But can I keep him?

43:16.885 --> 43:18.524
I really love him.

43:18.725 --> 43:21.160
<i>He's soaked in blood
that links me to a murder.</i>

43:21.365 --> 43:24.119
Yeah, but maybe
he should live under the bed.

43:24.325 --> 43:26.556
Okay.
Okay.

43:26.765 --> 43:27.994
<i>Wee Monkeys.</i>

43:28.205 --> 43:30.162
<i>Wee Monkeys!</i>

43:30.365 --> 43:33.961
<i>It's no accident,
Harrison catching me in a lie.</i>

43:34.965 --> 43:37.355
<i>I can live with my lies,
but how long can Harrison</i>

43:37.565 --> 43:40.125
<i>before he finally sees through?</i>

43:40.365 --> 43:42.163
I should be back
in a few hours.

43:42.365 --> 43:45.119
Sorry to keep you late
on your birthday.

43:45.325 --> 43:48.124
Trust me, it'll probably be
the highlight of my day.

43:48.325 --> 43:51.523
<i>Vogel doesn't want me to kill Zach,
but she's wrong about him.</i>

43:51.725 --> 43:53.876
<i>He deserves nothing but my table.</i>

43:55.005 --> 43:56.803
<i>He's here.</i>

44:01.645 --> 44:02.761
Hey, Zach, it's Dexter.

44:26.405 --> 44:28.078
<i>Where is he?</i>

44:35.645 --> 44:39.400
<i>Why would Zach buy a car
for $1200?</i>

44:39.605 --> 44:42.120
<i>Because the one mistake
he made with Norma Rivera</i>

44:42.365 --> 44:44.755
<i>was showing up to kill her
in a red Porsche.</i>

44:44.965 --> 44:47.355
<i>He's going to kill Sofia tonight.</i>

45:04.685 --> 45:06.165
<i>Cypress Harbour Yacht Club.</i>
Hi.

45:06.365 --> 45:09.244
Could you tell me
if Sofia Fuentes is working tonight?

45:09.445 --> 45:12.199
<i>She gets off here in a few minutes.</i>
Thank you.

45:32.245 --> 45:35.238
<i>Zach, waiting to make his move.</i>

45:45.685 --> 45:49.076
<i>And Quinn,
still trying to prove he's a good cop.</i>

45:59.965 --> 46:01.797
Hey, Dex.
<i>Hey.</i>

46:02.005 --> 46:05.362
Look, this is probably
none of my business,

46:05.565 --> 46:08.285
but I feel like I should
tell you about Quinn.

46:08.965 --> 46:10.001
Okay.

46:10.245 --> 46:12.202
He thinks you're gonna
break up with him.

46:12.405 --> 46:13.805
<i>Break up with him? Why?</i>

46:14.045 --> 46:15.843
Because he didn't make sergeant.

46:16.845 --> 46:18.074
That's crazy.

46:18.285 --> 46:19.435
Why would he think that?

46:19.645 --> 46:23.719
Maybe you should, um, invite him over.
I think he's feeling pretty down.

46:23.965 --> 46:25.763
<i>Yeah. Yeah, of course.</i>

46:26.245 --> 46:29.397
Thanks, Dex, for calling.
That really is so sweet of you.

46:29.645 --> 46:30.795
Sure.

46:50.725 --> 46:53.285
<i>Quinn problem solved.</i>

46:55.045 --> 46:56.115
<i>And there's Sofia.</i>

47:04.045 --> 47:05.638
<i>Zach's father.</i>

47:07.005 --> 47:11.204
<i>Sofia is Hamilton's mistress,
just like Norma before her.</i>

47:38.485 --> 47:40.442
<i>What is he doing?</i>

48:12.645 --> 48:13.795
Hey.

48:14.005 --> 48:15.564
I know what you're doing.

48:15.765 --> 48:16.960
Quinn.

48:17.645 --> 48:20.114
You playing detective?
Watching Zach?

48:22.445 --> 48:23.799
Yeah, you caught me.

48:24.045 --> 48:27.482
I'm going to see Jamie.
Keep an eye on Zach.

48:35.685 --> 48:38.439
Jesus. What the fuck?

48:38.685 --> 48:40.517
What are you doing?

48:43.325 --> 48:45.681
Why were you going
to kill your father?

48:45.885 --> 48:49.401
What? I wasn't trying to kill myâ€”
I know you killed Norma Rivera.

48:49.605 --> 48:53.235
I thought you were going to kill Sofia,
but you were going after your father.

48:53.445 --> 48:55.164
Why?
You're crazy.

48:55.365 --> 48:57.880
I didn't try and kill my father.

48:58.525 --> 49:01.199
You tell me one more lie,
and I'll kill you.

49:03.205 --> 49:04.798
I had to.

49:05.045 --> 49:07.196
Why?
Because he's killing my mother.

49:08.365 --> 49:11.437
She's drinking herself to death
because of him.

49:11.845 --> 49:13.802
Over the years,
one affair after another,

49:14.005 --> 49:16.565
and he doesn't
even try and hide it.

49:17.325 --> 49:19.157
I thought killing Norma
would put an end to it,

49:19.325 --> 49:21.237
but two days later,

49:21.445 --> 49:23.562
he's banging some hostess
from the club.

49:25.045 --> 49:26.718
I knew if I wanted it to stop,

49:26.925 --> 49:29.121
I had to kill Dad.

49:31.645 --> 49:33.796
So that's what this is all about,

49:34.005 --> 49:36.474
you trying to protect your mother?

49:36.805 --> 49:38.478
You actually care about her?

49:39.125 --> 49:41.356
Of course I do. She's my mother.

49:45.245 --> 49:48.443
But showing up at crime scenes,

49:49.565 --> 49:51.841
accidents,

49:53.085 --> 49:54.758
taking pictures of all the blood.

49:54.965 --> 49:56.797
This is about more than
just your mother.

49:57.005 --> 49:58.564
No, I had to protect her.

49:58.805 --> 50:01.195
Yeah, I believe you.

50:01.645 --> 50:04.035
But you killed because you want to kill.
No.

50:04.365 --> 50:06.277
Yes.

50:08.205 --> 50:10.765
To take a living person

50:11.685 --> 50:13.756
and make them dead,

50:15.725 --> 50:18.718
imagining that you can
actually hear the moment

50:18.925 --> 50:21.315
when their heart stops beating,

50:22.285 --> 50:25.881
smell the blood
as it pools across the floor.

50:30.965 --> 50:32.877
I can't help it.

50:36.325 --> 50:38.965
It just builds up inside me

50:39.285 --> 50:41.277
all these years.

50:41.485 --> 50:44.239
But Norma was the first time
I ever followed through.

50:44.445 --> 50:46.323
And how was it,

50:46.965 --> 50:48.445
once you'd killed her?

50:50.605 --> 50:54.121
It felt like this huge weight

50:54.365 --> 50:56.641
was lifted off my chest,

50:56.845 --> 51:02.159
this release of something
horrible inside me.

51:04.845 --> 51:07.440
Like you were finally in control.

51:07.645 --> 51:09.284
Yes.

51:15.485 --> 51:17.954
You should just
go ahead and kill me.

51:19.965 --> 51:21.001
Why?

51:21.205 --> 51:23.845
Because if you don't,
I know I'll do it again.

51:27.005 --> 51:31.284
I don't want to be like this,
but I can't help it.

51:33.045 --> 51:34.684
I just am.

51:34.885 --> 51:36.877
I'm some kind of freak.

51:37.085 --> 51:38.804
A monster.

51:39.805 --> 51:41.239
Yes.

51:43.885 --> 51:45.877
You haven't told anyone else
about this?

51:46.125 --> 51:48.082
Besides Dr. Vogel.

51:48.285 --> 51:50.925
No, I couldn't.

51:51.485 --> 51:53.954
You never had a Harry.

51:55.045 --> 51:56.718
A what?

51:57.205 --> 51:59.401
Someone to talk to.

52:02.845 --> 52:04.962
Someone to teach you.

52:08.205 --> 52:10.401
<i>Some things happen to us
by accident.</i>

52:10.645 --> 52:13.797
<i>Others are choices.</i>

52:14.285 --> 52:17.357
<i>There are parts of me that I can
never share with my own son.</i>

52:17.565 --> 52:19.443
<i>But with Zach,</i>

52:19.965 --> 52:21.843
<i>could I teach him?</i>

52:22.045 --> 52:24.082
<i>Am I ready for this,</i>

52:24.325 --> 52:27.204
<i>to be a spiritual father?</i>

52:30.525 --> 52:34.405
So how'd your sting go with Elway?

52:36.165 --> 52:37.963
Terribly.

52:38.685 --> 52:40.438
Didn't work out?

52:41.045 --> 52:43.435
No, it worked out fine, butâ€”

52:44.045 --> 52:45.638
What?

52:48.485 --> 52:50.238
He likes me.

52:50.605 --> 52:52.039
Oh.

52:52.645 --> 52:53.795
That's a bad thing?

52:54.005 --> 52:57.521
Well, he likes me because he doesn't
know a fucking thing about me.

52:58.405 --> 53:02.479
"Yeah, I killed two people
and tried to kill myself and my brother.

53:02.685 --> 53:05.200
But, sorry, what kind of wine
would you like to order?"

53:05.405 --> 53:08.125
I mean, what the fuck?

53:08.325 --> 53:11.682
Yeah, I kind of know what you mean.

53:11.885 --> 53:14.161
How are things with Cassie?

53:15.085 --> 53:16.519
Um...

53:17.365 --> 53:19.482
I don't think there's
much of a future there.

53:19.685 --> 53:22.519
Maybe the Morgans just
aren't meant for relationships.

53:22.765 --> 53:24.802
Yeah, maybe not.

53:27.885 --> 53:29.114
But, hey, life is good.

53:29.325 --> 53:31.760
I'm feeling optimistic
for the first time in a while.

53:31.965 --> 53:34.844
I'm even thinking about
taking on a kind of...

53:35.365 --> 53:36.845
Intern.

53:38.045 --> 53:39.559
Hm...

53:40.925 --> 53:42.882
Well, that's a big step for you, right?

53:43.085 --> 53:47.045
Letting some novice
into your private lab.

53:47.285 --> 53:48.799
Yeah.

53:51.645 --> 53:53.602
Hey, are you okay?

53:53.805 --> 53:55.956
I don't feel so good.

53:56.645 --> 53:58.443
What's wrong?

53:58.805 --> 54:01.081
I feel kind of dizzy.

54:01.285 --> 54:02.639
Deb?

54:08.045 --> 54:09.957
Hello, Dexter.

54:14.005 --> 54:15.962
Remember me?
