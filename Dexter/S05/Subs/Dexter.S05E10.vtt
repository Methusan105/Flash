WEBVTT

00:09.418 --> 00:11.206
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

00:11.326 --> 00:13.121
I need to get my hands
on that vial.

00:13.416 --> 00:15.350
I'm just gonna extract
a sample.

00:15.385 --> 00:17.953
I'll run it for DNA.
Hopefully get an I. D.

00:17.987 --> 00:19.855
So whose blood
do you think it is?

00:19.889 --> 00:22.925
- Your blood results are in.
- Emily Birch.

00:22.959 --> 00:24.593
She's not a victim.
She's alive.

00:24.627 --> 00:26.829
Boozing it up in Coral Gables.

00:26.863 --> 00:28.530
The barrel girls case,

00:28.565 --> 00:31.133
there are partial sequences
from multiple people.

00:31.167 --> 00:33.035
Cole and Boyd
did this together?

00:33.069 --> 00:35.771
With maybe three
or four others.

00:35.805 --> 00:38.640
As far as Quinn goes,
he wasn't on vacation.

00:38.675 --> 00:41.777
I suspended him
to protect your brother.

00:41.811 --> 00:44.112
I trusted you.

00:44.147 --> 00:45.514
And while you were fucking me,

00:45.548 --> 00:47.683
you were spreading shit
about my brother behind my back.

00:47.717 --> 00:51.587
Fuck you.

00:51.621 --> 00:53.689
Cole as a teenager.

00:59.429 --> 01:01.597
Your boy Dexter Morgan
and his girlfriend

01:01.631 --> 01:03.732
on his boat at 3:00 A. M.

01:03.766 --> 01:05.567
- What's in the bags?
- Something heavy.

01:05.602 --> 01:07.536
I'm thinking narcotics.
Maybe a body.

01:07.570 --> 01:09.304
It's time to stop.

01:09.339 --> 01:11.807
Stay the fuck away from Deb!

01:11.841 --> 01:13.075
Dexter?

01:13.109 --> 01:15.978
No, it's Jordan Chase.
Can I leave a message?

01:16.012 --> 01:20.115
Tick tick tick.

01:20.149 --> 01:23.185
That's the sound
of his life running out.

01:23.219 --> 01:25.087
Take care, Lumen.

03:22.350 --> 03:24.485
They say that history
repeats itself,

03:24.519 --> 03:27.521
but I will never put my family
in danger again.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.456
Now that Jordan Chase knows
Lumen and I are on to him,

03:29.491 --> 03:31.191
I need to plan for the worst.

03:34.262 --> 03:36.230
Yeah, I think
that's the last of it.

03:36.264 --> 03:37.431
I put the grandparents' address

03:37.465 --> 03:39.199
in the navigational system.

03:39.234 --> 03:41.135
And I have the print-out
you gave me.

03:41.169 --> 03:42.970
And Harrison is going
to have such a good time

03:43.004 --> 03:46.240
with his big sister
and big brother in Orlando.

03:46.274 --> 03:49.409
I'm getting Harrison
out of Miami

03:49.444 --> 03:52.279
and Lumen out of that house.

03:52.313 --> 03:53.569
Dexter.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.718
I haven't been apart from him
since Rita died.

03:57.752 --> 03:59.987
Nothing is going to happen
to Harrison.

04:05.794 --> 04:09.329
Love you.

04:09.364 --> 04:11.965
Call me as soon
as you get there.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.134
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Dexter.

04:23.178 --> 04:26.914
Lumen.

04:26.948 --> 04:29.049
Come on.
We'll be safe here.

04:29.083 --> 04:30.551
Jordan doesn't know
about this place.

04:30.585 --> 04:35.155
He thinks we're at the house.

04:40.361 --> 04:45.399
What the fuck
are you up to now?

04:49.704 --> 04:53.507
We can't wait any more.
We need to take out Jordan.

04:53.541 --> 04:55.275
That might be difficult.

04:55.310 --> 04:57.811
He's surrounded at all times
by four bodyguards

04:57.846 --> 05:00.113
except when he's on stage
in front of 200 people.

05:00.148 --> 05:01.515
I think we should start
with the others.

05:01.549 --> 05:02.916
We don't even know
who they are.

05:02.951 --> 05:05.085
No. But she can help us.

05:06.721 --> 05:07.988
Is that her?

05:08.022 --> 05:09.857
The one whose blood
Jordan wears around his neck?

05:09.891 --> 05:11.325
Yeah. Emily Birch.

05:11.359 --> 05:13.994
She looks like me
and the girls in the barrels.

05:14.028 --> 05:15.996
But older.

05:16.030 --> 05:20.135
She's the same age
as Jordan, and Cole, and Boyd.

05:21.069 --> 05:23.303
I think
she was the first victim.

05:23.338 --> 05:25.639
How is she still alive?

05:25.673 --> 05:27.541
I don't know.
I hope she can tell us.

05:27.575 --> 05:30.344
- We're gonna talk to her today?
- I'll come back at lunchtime.

05:30.378 --> 05:32.279
We'll go then.

05:35.750 --> 05:38.552
Stay inside.
Don't open the door.

05:38.586 --> 05:42.723
- I won't.
- To anyone.

05:50.899 --> 05:52.466
Okay, by now you're all aware

05:52.500 --> 05:55.535
that new evidence has been found
in the barrel girls case,

05:55.570 --> 05:59.640
which this department is again
pursuing as a top priority.

05:59.674 --> 06:01.375
Our initial conclusion
that Boyd Fowler

06:01.409 --> 06:04.011
was solely responsible
for these crimes was wrong.

06:04.045 --> 06:05.479
It now appears
that he had help.

06:05.513 --> 06:07.481
And the day began
with such promise.

06:07.515 --> 06:12.019
Vince, can you take us
through the DNA?

06:12.053 --> 06:13.487
New evidence "has been found"?

06:13.521 --> 06:16.556
Like, maybe the evidence
discovered itself.

06:16.591 --> 06:19.192
I'm just glad to be back.
It beats the fucking file room.

06:19.227 --> 06:20.594
DNA reports
from the coroner's office

06:20.628 --> 06:22.696
point to multiple perps.

06:22.730 --> 06:23.897
- Do we have any names?
- No.

06:23.932 --> 06:25.132
What we have are partial
sequences

06:25.166 --> 06:27.000
from very seriously
degraded DNA.

06:27.035 --> 06:29.569
But the evidence confirms
what we knew about Boyd Fowler.

06:29.604 --> 06:31.772
And it also points
with a high probability

06:31.806 --> 06:34.174
to Cole Harmon, Jordan Chase's
head of security.

06:34.208 --> 06:36.376
As you know, Cole Harmon
was our original suspect

06:36.411 --> 06:37.544
in the case.

06:37.578 --> 06:39.112
Until I pointed them
toward Boyd Fowler.

06:39.147 --> 06:40.948
He is now
our main target again.

06:40.982 --> 06:43.850
A target you'll never hit.
He's already buried at sea.

06:43.885 --> 06:45.185
- Morgan.
- Yeah.

06:45.219 --> 06:46.853
- Yeah.
- Debra.

06:46.888 --> 06:48.655
Take Quinn and bring in
Cole Harmon.

06:48.690 --> 06:49.823
Start at his office.

06:49.857 --> 06:51.058
In the meantime,

06:51.092 --> 06:52.559
I'm getting search warrants
for his house.

06:52.593 --> 06:53.894
You should have them
within the hour.

06:53.928 --> 06:56.630
- Fuck yeah.
- That's it.

06:59.434 --> 07:02.135
Hey, congrats. Looks like
your filing days are over.

07:02.170 --> 07:05.439
Yeah, at least
until Laguerta's mood changes.

07:10.511 --> 07:13.880
Angel...

07:13.915 --> 07:15.749
So you got Morgan back.

07:15.783 --> 07:18.318
Yeah. Thanks for that.

07:18.353 --> 07:21.455
It's what you wanted.

07:21.489 --> 07:23.523
- She earned it.
- So...

07:23.558 --> 07:24.758
I'll keep you posted
on the case.

07:40.808 --> 07:43.577
- May I help you?
- Miami Metro Homicide.

07:43.611 --> 07:46.646
We're looking for Cole Harmon.

07:46.681 --> 07:50.984
Mr. Harmon hasn't worked here
in more than two weeks.

07:51.019 --> 07:52.486
What?

07:52.520 --> 07:55.055
You should probably talk
to Mr. Chase.

07:55.089 --> 07:56.823
Are you fucking kidding me?

07:56.858 --> 07:58.158
Your head of security
disappears

07:58.192 --> 07:59.760
and you don't think
it's worth reporting?

07:59.794 --> 08:01.328
It seemed
like an internal matter.

08:01.362 --> 08:03.296
Cole Harmon is wanted
for the rape and murder

08:03.331 --> 08:05.098
of at least five women.

08:05.133 --> 08:06.233
Hold on a second.

08:06.267 --> 08:08.502
Detective Batista
told me and Mr. Harmon

08:08.536 --> 08:10.070
that you'd made a mistake,

08:10.104 --> 08:13.073
that some animal pickup officer
was your sole suspect.

08:13.107 --> 08:14.808
He's not anymore.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.643
And I was supposed
to divine that somehow?

08:16.677 --> 08:18.101
Do you know where he is or not?

08:18.221 --> 08:20.180
Detective Morgan,
I don't know where this aggression

08:20.214 --> 08:21.782
is coming from
or why it's directed at me.

08:21.816 --> 08:23.450
But a word of caution:

08:23.484 --> 08:25.552
Aggression can be
a powerful motivator,

08:25.586 --> 08:27.087
but it can also cloud
your percep...

08:27.121 --> 08:29.089
Save your bullshit
for your seminars

08:29.123 --> 08:30.424
and answer my question.

08:30.458 --> 08:32.225
I have no idea where Cole is.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.061
He told me he needed
some personal time.

08:34.095 --> 08:36.396
Your head of security says
he needs some time off

08:36.431 --> 08:37.898
and you just say "okay"?

08:37.932 --> 08:39.299
I have been nothing
but cooperative

08:39.333 --> 08:40.434
with your department.

08:40.468 --> 08:42.035
But that was predicated
on a certain amount

08:42.070 --> 08:43.537
of discretion on your part.

08:43.571 --> 08:44.805
And respect.

08:44.839 --> 08:46.373
Now you barge into my place
of business,

08:46.407 --> 08:48.141
hurling insinuations.

08:48.176 --> 08:50.477
No one is insinuating anything.

08:50.511 --> 08:55.082
Look, if you hear from Cole,
give us a call, okay?

08:55.116 --> 08:56.750
From now on,
any contact between us

08:56.784 --> 08:57.984
will be through my attorney.

08:58.019 --> 09:01.655
He'll be hearing from us.

09:01.689 --> 09:03.490
Is there some reason
you needed to antagonize him

09:03.524 --> 09:04.624
like that?

09:04.659 --> 09:05.759
Yes.

09:05.793 --> 09:07.527
Girls are being raped,
tortured,

09:07.562 --> 09:08.795
and stuffed into barrels.

09:08.830 --> 09:11.465
Two rapist-killers are directly
connected to him.

09:11.499 --> 09:13.266
What are the odds
he knows absolutely nothing

09:13.301 --> 09:14.267
about it?

09:14.302 --> 09:15.802
- Small.
- Yes.

09:15.837 --> 09:17.537
Small, Quinn.
That was my point.

09:17.572 --> 09:21.208
I understand that.
I'm on your side, okay?

09:24.445 --> 09:26.146
The search warrants
have probably come through.

09:26.180 --> 09:28.281
Let's go fuck up Cole Harmon's
living room.

09:44.866 --> 09:48.034
- Emily Birch?
- Yes?

09:48.069 --> 09:49.269
Who are you?

09:49.303 --> 09:51.238
We're trying to track down
some information

09:51.272 --> 09:52.472
on Jordan Chase.

09:52.507 --> 09:55.075
<i>The Jordan Chase?</i>

09:55.109 --> 09:57.244
We understand
that you know him.

09:57.278 --> 09:58.578
Do I look
like the kind of person

09:58.613 --> 10:00.347
that knows Jordan Chase?

10:00.381 --> 10:03.583
Well, he knows who you are.

10:03.618 --> 10:05.185
How?

10:05.219 --> 10:07.053
Do you mind
if I show you a photo?

10:10.884 --> 10:12.144
I think you need to go.

10:12.174 --> 10:13.975
- Maybe you know some of these people.
- No.

10:14.095 --> 10:15.280
Could you at least
just look at it?

10:15.400 --> 10:16.863
I told you I don't know

10:16.898 --> 10:18.652
who any of those people are
and I want you to go.

10:18.672 --> 10:19.960
Emily.

10:22.904 --> 10:27.007
That went well.

10:27.041 --> 10:28.942
Did you see how she reacted
to that photo?

10:28.976 --> 10:30.443
She definitely knows
who they are.

10:30.478 --> 10:33.280
You'd think she'd want
to talk to us.

10:33.314 --> 10:36.850
I don't know.
Security bars, DUIs.

10:36.884 --> 10:39.286
She's got a lot of defenses
in place.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.620
There's got to be a way
to get her

10:40.655 --> 10:41.721
to give us those names.

10:44.425 --> 10:47.627
Deb needs me
on a search warrant

10:47.662 --> 10:51.231
at Cole Harmon's house.

10:51.265 --> 10:53.767
I'll drop you back
at the apartment first.

11:08.950 --> 11:10.650
I don't see any blood.

11:10.685 --> 11:12.986
You think we'd call you here
for nothing?

11:14.989 --> 11:16.556
Kid gloves, okay?

11:16.591 --> 11:18.124
That's gonna tell us
which scumbag friends

11:18.159 --> 11:19.726
he's been talking to.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.328
Unless there's such a thing
as red mold,

11:21.362 --> 11:23.563
this sure as shit
looks like blood.

11:23.598 --> 11:25.398
Cole Harmon's blood.

11:25.433 --> 11:28.802
Left there when Lumen hit him
to save me.

11:35.509 --> 11:36.910
It's definitely blood.

11:36.944 --> 11:38.812
Blood that's been cleaned up.

11:38.846 --> 11:40.080
You don't miss a thing.

11:40.114 --> 11:41.648
Unfortunately.

11:41.682 --> 11:44.751
There's something fucked up
about this whole situation.

11:44.785 --> 11:46.653
Cole's car is still
in the driveway.

11:46.687 --> 11:47.988
It's not like he got up
and ran.

11:48.022 --> 11:51.057
It's like he disappeared,
or he got disappeared.

11:51.092 --> 11:52.525
Rush that blood work, okay?

11:52.560 --> 11:53.526
I want to know if it's Cole's

11:53.561 --> 11:55.862
and if someone did a number
on him.

11:55.896 --> 12:01.434
Deb. Deb, you got to take
a look at this.

12:22.490 --> 12:24.891
DVDs.
They were in that lockbox.

12:24.925 --> 12:29.396
No!
No! No!

12:29.430 --> 12:34.567
They videotaped themselves
torturing these women.

12:34.602 --> 12:37.003
13 disks.
They're all numbered.

12:37.038 --> 12:40.173
Lumen was the last victim.
That would make her number 13.

12:40.207 --> 12:43.576
Turn it off.

13:03.564 --> 13:05.131
Despite having
considered myself a monster

13:05.166 --> 13:07.867
for as long as I can remember,

13:07.902 --> 13:10.437
it still comes as a shock
when I'm confronted

13:10.471 --> 13:14.107
with the depth of evil
that exists in this world.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.514
Did the blood work go out?

13:21.549 --> 13:24.451
- An hour ago.
- And?

13:24.485 --> 13:25.785
Deb, the results
won't come back

13:25.820 --> 13:27.687
for at least a day.

13:27.722 --> 13:29.189
But you'll let me know?

13:31.859 --> 13:35.395
Right.

13:35.429 --> 13:38.398
I need to take a breath,
you know?

13:38.432 --> 13:40.567
It's hard.

13:40.601 --> 13:42.702
There is some seriously
fucked up shit in there.

13:42.737 --> 13:44.871
And if Debra gets eyes
on Lumen's DVD,

13:44.905 --> 13:46.039
she'll know everything.

13:46.073 --> 13:47.874
It will all unravel.

13:47.908 --> 13:51.444
Deb, Cole Harmon's emails
and phone records are up.

13:51.479 --> 13:52.694
You want to go through them?

13:53.142 --> 13:55.214
Fuck yes. Let's see
who he's been talking to.

14:15.870 --> 14:16.903
No, no, no, no.

14:16.937 --> 14:18.638
Chain of custody.
Chain of custody.

14:18.672 --> 14:21.341
Your sister's new mantra.

14:21.375 --> 14:24.411
Last time someone came in here,
she nearly killed me,

14:24.445 --> 14:26.246
which, frankly, would be better
than going through

14:26.280 --> 14:28.248
another one of these DVDs.

14:28.282 --> 14:32.385
Each one, same creepy place.

14:32.420 --> 14:37.123
Same creepy shit.

14:37.158 --> 14:39.292
Notice anything about them?

14:39.326 --> 14:41.361
They all look like Lumen.

14:41.395 --> 14:44.197
Uh, no, not really.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.833
Well, they could be sisters.

14:46.867 --> 14:51.171
All 13 of them.
Which is weird.

14:51.205 --> 14:53.173
I mean, 13.
Why?

14:53.207 --> 14:56.309
You were at Boyd Fowler's house

14:56.343 --> 14:58.812
when we went through it, right?

14:58.846 --> 14:59.946
Yep.

14:59.980 --> 15:03.349
Remember those locks of hair?

15:03.384 --> 15:07.320
There were 12.
So there should be 12 victims.

15:07.354 --> 15:11.024
But there are 13 disks.

15:11.058 --> 15:14.561
He's nearly there.
Yeah, that is weird.

15:16.730 --> 15:18.164
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa, Dex! Whoa!

15:18.199 --> 15:20.533
Back back back! Dude!
Sorry.

15:20.568 --> 15:21.868
You've got to be
more careful, man!

15:21.902 --> 15:23.670
This is all we got to nail
these fucking assholes,

15:23.704 --> 15:24.671
this right here!

15:24.705 --> 15:25.972
I know. I'm sorry.

15:26.006 --> 15:28.975
I'll just... I'll leave.

15:32.546 --> 15:33.713
I've been trying
to get a handle

15:33.747 --> 15:36.316
on this Emily Birch
and there's nothing.

15:36.350 --> 15:38.117
She graduates high school
in 1992

15:38.152 --> 15:40.353
and then it's just a big blank.

15:40.387 --> 15:42.655
Except for those DUIs
that you found.

15:46.527 --> 15:50.163
What?

15:50.197 --> 15:54.801
They found this
in the search at Cole's.

15:54.835 --> 15:56.870
The men who hurt you,

15:56.904 --> 15:59.906
they made DVDs
of everything they did.

16:04.044 --> 16:08.515
13. Is that me?

16:19.026 --> 16:22.095
- Did everyone watch it?
- No.

16:22.129 --> 16:25.798
I managed to get it
out of evidence in time.

16:25.833 --> 16:28.635
Did you...

16:28.669 --> 16:30.370
did you watch it?

16:30.404 --> 16:32.138
Only enough to make sure
I had the right one.

16:35.476 --> 16:38.478
Are you sure you want
to keep it?

16:38.512 --> 16:42.415
Number 13.

16:42.449 --> 16:47.587
That's what I was to them.

16:57.064 --> 16:59.299
It must've been hard
for you to get that.

17:04.672 --> 17:07.707
I know that you risk your life

17:07.741 --> 17:11.077
every day that you're with me.

17:11.111 --> 17:14.113
You've been my only way
through this.

17:18.586 --> 17:20.674
Well, I guess...

17:21.922 --> 17:25.491
We both met each other
at the right time.

17:38.505 --> 17:44.410
No! No! Let me out of here!
No! No! No!

17:44.445 --> 17:46.746
No! No! Let me go!

17:51.452 --> 17:55.989
No! Get me out of here!
No! No! No!

18:06.500 --> 18:10.370
The DVDs.
Lumen watching at home.

18:10.404 --> 18:13.806
Deb watching here.

18:13.841 --> 18:17.343
Both wanting some sort
of resolution.

18:17.378 --> 18:20.113
But I can only help one.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.755
Watching these DVDs...
watching it actually happen...

18:28.789 --> 18:31.457
is worse than any fucking
crime scene.

18:31.492 --> 18:33.793
What these women went through,

18:33.827 --> 18:35.461
I don't know,
maybe it's a fucking blessing

18:35.496 --> 18:37.063
that they're dead.

18:37.097 --> 18:38.631
No one could go through
something like this

18:38.666 --> 18:43.069
and have a life again.

18:50.611 --> 18:52.912
People may be stronger
than you think.

18:52.946 --> 18:56.082
Believe me, on this one,
you're wrong.

18:56.116 --> 18:58.317
There's no coming back
from something like this.

19:03.157 --> 19:08.127
- Where's 13?
- Disk 13... it was damaged.

19:08.162 --> 19:09.762
I was actually grateful
I didn't have to watch

19:09.797 --> 19:10.930
another one of these.

19:10.964 --> 19:15.401
Have you been here all night?

19:15.436 --> 19:17.003
Yeah. And I think
it was worth it

19:17.037 --> 19:19.338
'cause I think I'm starting
to figure it out.

19:19.373 --> 19:22.241
I went through Cole Harmon's
contacts.

19:22.276 --> 19:27.246
And do you remember that weird
plastic-wrap murder

19:27.281 --> 19:28.881
a few weeks back?

19:28.916 --> 19:31.217
Those two guys
at the warehouse.

19:31.251 --> 19:33.519
Yeah, one of them
was a dentist.

19:33.554 --> 19:36.622
A kids' dentist.
Dan Mendell.

19:36.657 --> 19:40.126
Well, it turns out
he and Cole are buddies.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.929
They fucking poke each other
on Facebook.

19:42.963 --> 19:46.432
And you see that ring
on the DVD?

19:46.467 --> 19:51.370
It matches photos taken
at the warehouse crime scene.

19:51.405 --> 19:54.707
So I think
he's one of these guys.

19:54.742 --> 19:57.577
So Dan the dentist is dead.
He was shot to death.

19:57.611 --> 20:00.747
Looks like somebody attacked
Cole Harmon in his house.

20:00.781 --> 20:03.149
And Boyd Fowler's disappeared.

20:03.183 --> 20:04.984
This is a group of guys
that like to get together

20:05.018 --> 20:08.721
and they like to do this
for fun.

20:08.756 --> 20:10.890
So what else do they have
in common?

20:10.924 --> 20:12.225
They're all missing.

20:12.259 --> 20:14.227
They're not on the run.
I can tell you that.

20:14.261 --> 20:15.595
Not one of them
bought a plane ticket,

20:15.629 --> 20:16.729
or emptied their bank account,

20:16.764 --> 20:19.332
or used a fucking credit card.

20:19.366 --> 20:22.869
Someone is taking
these guys out.

20:22.903 --> 20:24.237
Who?

20:24.271 --> 20:27.974
Well, at first I thought
they were turning on each other.

20:28.008 --> 20:29.709
But then I thought
"that doesn't make any sense.

20:29.743 --> 20:32.645
Why would they do that
after all this time?"

20:32.679 --> 20:35.515
So I started asking myself,

20:35.549 --> 20:39.118
"who would want
to take these guys out?"

20:39.153 --> 20:44.056
And you know the first person
that came to mind?

20:44.091 --> 20:48.628
Me.
You?

20:48.662 --> 20:50.229
Someone who knows
what these cocksuckers

20:50.264 --> 20:53.232
have been up to
and wants to give them

20:53.267 --> 20:56.602
what they deserve.

20:56.637 --> 20:58.871
So what are you saying?
There's a vigilante out there?

20:58.906 --> 21:01.541
Yeah, I think that's
what I'm saying. Yes.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.850
This is what happened to me.

21:14.855 --> 21:16.789
Is it also what happened
to you?

21:21.195 --> 21:25.364
There were 13 of us after you.

21:25.399 --> 21:28.401
I didn't know.

21:28.435 --> 21:30.069
I didn't know there was
anybody else

21:30.103 --> 21:31.871
until you knocked on my door.

21:31.905 --> 21:34.874
I'm the only one who survived.

21:34.908 --> 21:38.978
Oh, my God.

21:39.012 --> 21:43.583
Emily, I need you to tell me

21:43.617 --> 21:46.319
what happened to you.

21:46.353 --> 21:48.921
Can you do that?

21:54.361 --> 21:56.495
It was almost 20 years ago

21:56.530 --> 22:01.000
during the summer at camp.

22:01.034 --> 22:06.472
I was a C. I. T. ,
counselor in training,

22:06.506 --> 22:10.276
a year older than them.

22:10.310 --> 22:14.413
They were just...

22:18.552 --> 22:20.920
Except Jordan.

22:20.954 --> 22:24.590
Only, he wasn't called
Jordan then.

22:24.625 --> 22:29.061
He was Eugene Greer.

22:29.096 --> 22:33.032
That's Jordan Chase?

22:33.066 --> 22:35.268
When he was Eugene Greer.

22:35.302 --> 22:37.737
I felt sorry for him.

22:37.771 --> 22:40.072
Became his friend, you know.

22:40.107 --> 22:41.741
We would take these walks.

22:41.775 --> 22:47.313
And one day, we were walking
and I blacked out.

22:47.347 --> 22:49.649
He must have drugged me
or something.

22:49.683 --> 22:54.020
They drugged me too.

22:54.054 --> 22:58.724
I woke up in a cabin.
My clothes were off.

22:58.759 --> 23:01.994
And I was tied to a bunk.

23:04.531 --> 23:07.833
Eugene started in...

23:07.868 --> 23:10.336
So he attacked you.

23:10.370 --> 23:15.141
No.
Eugene never touched me.

23:15.175 --> 23:17.276
But he got those guys going.

23:17.311 --> 23:19.078
He talked them into it.

23:19.112 --> 23:22.381
Told them
to seize their desires.

23:22.416 --> 23:25.518
And... and...

23:25.552 --> 23:27.820
They did.

23:27.854 --> 23:30.723
And I was watching Gene's face.

23:30.757 --> 23:34.493
The look that came over
his face,

23:34.528 --> 23:37.463
it was just a flash,

23:37.497 --> 23:41.120
but it's the same look
he has all the time now.

23:42.636 --> 23:45.071
And I got dressed.

23:45.105 --> 23:48.774
And they made me...

23:48.809 --> 23:51.377
Take their picture.

23:51.411 --> 23:55.548
This photo.

23:55.582 --> 23:58.851
So this is Cole.

23:58.885 --> 24:01.053
And that's Dan.

24:01.088 --> 24:04.557
And that's Boyd.

24:04.591 --> 24:08.394
And Jordan.

24:08.428 --> 24:10.696
Who is this one?

24:10.731 --> 24:12.331
Alex.

24:16.003 --> 24:17.436
Alex Tilden.

24:17.471 --> 24:20.740
He's the fifth.

24:28.181 --> 24:30.483
Can I help you?

24:30.517 --> 24:34.053
Yeah. You got a pen?

24:34.087 --> 24:36.522
Sure.

24:36.556 --> 24:37.990
Just, uh, leaving a note
for Joey.

24:38.025 --> 24:41.093
I'm an old friend.
Thank you.

24:44.197 --> 24:47.466
You're, um...
you're Harry's kid, right?

24:47.501 --> 24:49.902
Blood guy.
That's right.

24:49.936 --> 24:53.539
And your sister,
Detective Morgan...

24:53.573 --> 24:55.941
Usually it's the boy child
ends up doing the police work,

24:55.976 --> 24:57.109
not the girl.

24:57.144 --> 24:59.845
But here you are
in the geek squad.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.847
Yeah. Blood spatter
suited me more.

25:01.882 --> 25:05.951
- You like the blood, huh?
- I like catching bad guys.

25:05.986 --> 25:08.421
That's cute.

25:13.693 --> 25:15.428
Dexter.

25:15.462 --> 25:19.265
Yeah, I'll be right down.
Got to go.

25:19.299 --> 25:23.402
So long, Dexter.

25:39.119 --> 25:41.921
Hey, beautiful,
I got to pick up a few things

25:41.955 --> 25:43.656
for a stake-out.

25:43.690 --> 25:46.158
It's for Detective Quinn.
You see his name there.

25:46.193 --> 25:47.693
Let's see.
Surveillance cameras,

25:47.727 --> 25:48.794
wireless mics,

25:48.829 --> 25:51.564
and a portable wireless
recorder monitor.

25:51.598 --> 25:53.766
- Yep.
- Be right back.

25:53.800 --> 25:56.969
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

25:58.505 --> 26:00.940
So Emily never told anyone.

26:00.974 --> 26:02.875
She said she was afraid
of her father.

26:02.909 --> 26:05.277
He hated her friends.
He hated the way she dressed.

26:05.312 --> 26:07.113
She was afraid
he would blame her.

26:07.147 --> 26:10.116
That's probably the reason
Jordan let her live.

26:10.150 --> 26:12.451
Listening to her talk,
I could just see it.

26:12.486 --> 26:13.986
Jordan's whole philosophy.

26:14.020 --> 26:15.921
Transforming your life.
Blah blah blah.

26:15.956 --> 26:18.324
It all came
from destroying hers.

26:18.358 --> 26:21.026
That moment turned Jordan
into a monster.

26:21.061 --> 26:24.730
My guess,
he already was a monster.

26:24.764 --> 26:26.732
You weren't supposed
to go see her alone.

26:26.766 --> 26:28.334
You were supposed to stay
in the apartment.

26:28.368 --> 26:31.804
- I tried. I couldn't.
- It's not safe.

26:31.838 --> 26:34.039
You understand that, right?

26:40.780 --> 26:46.452
Did Emily name the other one
in the photo?

26:46.486 --> 26:48.086
Yes.

26:51.525 --> 26:52.525
What?

26:52.559 --> 26:56.662
I want to be the one
to do this.

26:58.865 --> 26:59.999
It's one thing to watch it.

27:00.033 --> 27:01.467
It's another thing
to actually do it.

27:01.501 --> 27:03.402
- I know.
- It will change you.

27:03.436 --> 27:06.338
I'm already changed.

27:16.616 --> 27:18.417
What's the last guy's name?

27:20.921 --> 27:22.755
I'm Alex Tilden.
How can I help you?

27:22.789 --> 27:25.558
- Detective Quinn.
- Morgan. Metro Homicide.

27:25.592 --> 27:29.562
Homicide?
Okay. What's going on?

27:29.596 --> 27:31.897
Well, we're investigating
a recent series of murders.

27:31.932 --> 27:33.265
You may have read about it.

27:33.300 --> 27:36.101
A number of girls were killed
and stored in barrels.

27:36.136 --> 27:37.403
Yeah. Yeah, I saw it
on the news.

27:37.437 --> 27:39.171
It's pretty shocking.

27:39.206 --> 27:40.839
What does it
have to do with me?

27:40.874 --> 27:43.642
Cole Harmon is a suspect
in our case.

27:43.677 --> 27:45.844
Your name turned up
on a list of acquaintances.

27:45.879 --> 27:47.112
We're talking to everyone
on the list.

27:47.147 --> 27:49.748
Uh, yeah. Well, sure.
Yeah, I know Cole.

27:49.783 --> 27:52.351
You two talk
on the phone a lot?

27:52.385 --> 27:54.753
Uh, we're in a fantasy
football league together.

27:54.788 --> 27:57.489
I was trying to get him to
give up a player all season.

27:57.524 --> 27:59.158
Have you heard from him lately?

27:59.192 --> 28:02.027
No, no.
What's going on here?

28:02.062 --> 28:06.298
Do you know
any of Cole's friends?

28:06.333 --> 28:08.133
Dan Mendell?
He's a kids' dentist.

28:08.168 --> 28:09.702
I don't have kids.

28:09.736 --> 28:11.704
- Do you know him?
- No.

28:11.738 --> 28:14.306
Boyd Fowler.
That name ring a bell?

28:14.341 --> 28:18.477
No. I don't know
either of those men.

28:18.511 --> 28:22.047
You want to tell me what
this is all about?

28:22.082 --> 28:24.049
Then, unless I'm in
some sort of trouble,

28:24.084 --> 28:25.384
I need to get back to work.

28:25.418 --> 28:28.053
I have a closing in 15 minutes
I should prepare for.

28:28.088 --> 28:30.556
One more name.
Jordan Chase.

28:30.590 --> 28:35.060
<i>Jordan Chase Jordan Chase?
He's messed up in this?</i>

28:35.095 --> 28:37.463
- Do you know him?
- I never met him.

28:37.497 --> 28:39.999
You know,
I've always wanted to.

28:40.033 --> 28:43.836
Well, if you, uh,
do hear from Cole,

28:43.870 --> 28:45.004
give us a call, okay?

28:45.038 --> 28:46.772
I'll do that.

28:46.806 --> 28:48.774
Thank you.

28:54.447 --> 28:57.082
"If you do hear from Cole,
give us a call"?

28:57.117 --> 28:58.817
Might be hard for him
to get cell reception

28:58.852 --> 29:01.020
from six feet underground.

29:01.054 --> 29:02.321
You really think

29:02.355 --> 29:05.224
a vigilante's killing off
these people one by one?

29:05.258 --> 29:07.026
Anyone who knows
what these guys were up to

29:07.060 --> 29:09.995
would probably do something
pretty extreme.

29:10.030 --> 29:12.364
Watch the tapes again.
You'll get it.

29:17.637 --> 29:18.704
I'm not dressed right.

29:18.738 --> 29:21.540
No, you're fine.

29:21.574 --> 29:23.909
But I did get you something.

29:23.943 --> 29:25.944
Oh.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.821
They're just like yours.

29:39.059 --> 29:40.192
Try them on.

29:53.907 --> 29:56.041
From now on, we have to be
especially careful

29:56.076 --> 29:57.343
not to leave anything behind.

29:57.377 --> 29:59.345
No fingerprints, no evidence.

29:59.379 --> 30:02.348
Nothing that points back to us.

30:04.284 --> 30:06.352
You sure we have enough time
to get it all done?

30:06.386 --> 30:09.888
Yes, if we move now.

30:09.923 --> 30:11.390
His bank closes at 7:00.

30:11.424 --> 30:14.727
We have to be in and out of his
house before he gets back.

30:33.546 --> 30:35.914
I'm used to hunting on my own.

30:35.949 --> 30:40.185
And here we are,
hunting as a pair.

30:42.455 --> 30:45.324
Looks like Alex
believes in karma.

30:52.966 --> 30:56.935
And it's all become so...

30:56.970 --> 30:58.404
Natural.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.248
Should we take it?

31:09.282 --> 31:11.817
No. He'll know
someone was here.

31:11.851 --> 31:15.053
This is just
a fact-finding mission.

31:15.088 --> 31:17.823
I think we know
what the facts are.

31:17.857 --> 31:19.825
There's a way to do this.

31:19.859 --> 31:22.828
It protects you.

31:22.862 --> 31:26.098
It protects both of us.

31:30.103 --> 31:31.437
One of these days,

31:31.471 --> 31:34.573
you've got to teach me
how to do that.

31:41.047 --> 31:45.150
13 pieces of jewelry.
13 trophies.

31:48.888 --> 31:50.756
My grandparents gave me this

31:50.790 --> 31:53.692
when I graduated
from high school.

31:53.726 --> 31:55.828
I was wearing it
the night they took me.

31:55.862 --> 31:57.830
This is mine.

31:57.864 --> 31:59.798
Let me.

32:10.944 --> 32:14.980
How do you choose the...
What do you call it, the place?

32:15.014 --> 32:16.982
Kill room.

32:19.419 --> 32:24.089
We need someplace
inconspicuous and secure.

32:26.960 --> 32:29.495
Like this?

32:32.031 --> 32:36.802
Maybe it's true that pairs
survive better in the wild.

32:42.108 --> 32:46.278
It's not easy
talking to a stranger.

32:46.312 --> 32:49.848
But I did it anyway.

32:49.883 --> 32:51.583
For you.

32:51.618 --> 32:56.555
You told her everything,
about what happened at the camp?

32:56.589 --> 33:01.093
It was hard, but yeah.

33:02.829 --> 33:06.131
You told her about Alex?

33:06.165 --> 33:08.433
I told her the truth,

33:08.468 --> 33:10.102
like you said.

33:10.136 --> 33:13.071
Even though I didn't want to.

33:16.676 --> 33:18.710
Are you in trouble, Jordan?

33:23.449 --> 33:28.253
The girl you talked to
was making waves.

33:30.423 --> 33:33.392
But everything's fine now,

33:33.426 --> 33:35.093
thanks to you.

33:35.128 --> 33:38.463
She was pretty.

33:38.498 --> 33:39.965
The girl.

33:39.999 --> 33:43.268
Emily.

33:43.303 --> 33:45.270
No one could ever
take your place.

33:45.305 --> 33:46.872
You know that, right?

33:49.275 --> 33:52.277
We have a bond

33:52.312 --> 33:55.280
that no one can ever break.

33:57.450 --> 33:59.851
You made me what I am today.

34:28.047 --> 34:31.016
Do you know how special
you are to me?

34:44.430 --> 34:46.498
Eugene Greer has arrived.

34:46.532 --> 34:49.968
Oh, the parade's here.

34:50.003 --> 34:51.870
Four bodyguards?
That's it?

34:57.744 --> 34:59.578
Detectives,
I'd like you to meet

34:59.612 --> 35:01.413
my friend and attorney,
Stuart Frank.

35:01.447 --> 35:02.748
How do you do?

35:02.782 --> 35:05.617
You've requested a DNA sample
from my client.

35:05.652 --> 35:06.852
I'd like to know why.

35:06.886 --> 35:09.187
There was unidentified male DNA

35:09.222 --> 35:10.422
found on
the barrel girl victims.

35:10.456 --> 35:12.858
We want to clear Mr. Chase
as a suspect.

35:12.892 --> 35:14.826
Why on earth is he even
considered a suspect?

35:14.861 --> 35:16.662
Because the DNA
we have identified

35:16.696 --> 35:19.064
belongs to men directly
connected to your client.

35:19.098 --> 35:20.899
Cole Harmon is
your head of security.

35:20.933 --> 35:22.768
Boyd Fowler is a devoted fan.

35:22.802 --> 35:24.703
We found your books
and tapes in his home.

35:24.737 --> 35:27.205
That proves exactly nothing.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.408
A million people have
connections with my client.

35:29.442 --> 35:32.310
I assume the two men
you're talking about drive cars.

35:32.345 --> 35:35.380
Are you going to start
interrogating automobile CEOs?

35:35.415 --> 35:36.581
Detective Morgan,

35:36.616 --> 35:38.350
I've helped a lot of people
over the years.

35:38.384 --> 35:40.419
Many of them were
broken individuals

35:40.453 --> 35:42.521
going through very difficult
periods in their lives.

35:42.555 --> 35:44.523
Is that what you call this?

35:44.557 --> 35:45.657
Someone who's going through

35:45.692 --> 35:49.628
"a very difficult period"
in their life?

35:49.662 --> 35:52.564
If Mr. Chase knew
anything about this,

35:52.598 --> 35:54.299
he would have
informed the police.

35:54.333 --> 35:55.534
Now, unless you're
working your way

35:55.568 --> 35:57.669
toward some more reasonable
line of inquiry,

35:57.704 --> 35:58.670
we're done here.

35:58.705 --> 35:59.971
- Jordan.
- No, we're not.

36:00.006 --> 36:01.840
I want to do anything I can

36:01.874 --> 36:04.142
to help you find
the people who did that.

36:04.177 --> 36:06.011
If you want to take my DNA,
you're welcome to it.

36:06.045 --> 36:08.346
- Jordan.
- It's okay, Stu.

36:08.381 --> 36:11.016
I know it's your duty
to be suspicious.

36:11.050 --> 36:13.351
But I swear, no one is
more disturbed than I am

36:13.386 --> 36:14.486
that people I've helped

36:14.520 --> 36:17.222
could be responsible
for something like this.

36:17.256 --> 36:18.890
So how does this work?

36:18.925 --> 36:22.094
It's just a cheek swab.
It won't take but a second.

36:22.128 --> 36:23.095
You don't have to do this.

36:23.129 --> 36:25.130
Dexter will help you.

36:42.682 --> 36:44.649
Have a seat.

36:51.958 --> 36:54.226
I was hoping we'd have
a chance to speak again.

36:54.260 --> 36:55.660
We don't have anything
to talk about.

36:55.695 --> 36:56.828
Oh, I beg to differ.

36:56.863 --> 36:58.430
I think we have
a lot to discuss.

36:58.464 --> 37:00.799
After all, you are a client.

37:00.833 --> 37:02.434
Former.

37:02.468 --> 37:04.436
Your program
didn't work for me.

37:04.470 --> 37:08.106
Regardless, when I see someone
on a self-destructive path,

37:08.141 --> 37:11.276
I can't just stay silent.

37:11.310 --> 37:12.811
Often, people get involved

37:12.845 --> 37:14.212
with someone
who is toxic to them.

37:14.247 --> 37:16.314
Unstable and dangerous.

37:16.349 --> 37:17.883
Bad things happen.

37:17.917 --> 37:19.718
Open.

37:23.756 --> 37:25.957
You're just now putting
your life back together

37:25.992 --> 37:27.726
after a terrible tragedy.

37:27.760 --> 37:32.164
I implore you,
don't invite another one.

37:32.198 --> 37:35.534
For yourself or for what's
left of your family.

37:38.104 --> 37:40.305
You know, I'm glad you
didn't touch any of them.

37:40.339 --> 37:43.475
Really? Why is that?

37:43.509 --> 37:45.143
Because this DNA test
will clear you

37:45.178 --> 37:46.578
and leave you all to me.

37:46.612 --> 37:48.180
And to her.

37:48.214 --> 37:50.348
Your time is up.

37:53.553 --> 37:56.922
There you go.
You're done.

37:58.758 --> 38:00.125
Thank you, Dexter.

38:02.128 --> 38:04.429
I'm here for you.
Don't forget that.

38:04.463 --> 38:06.298
And soon,
I'll be there for you.

38:06.332 --> 38:08.233
I appreciate it.

38:22.415 --> 38:24.683
What else did Jordan say?

38:24.717 --> 38:28.053
That you were toxic

38:28.087 --> 38:29.821
and dangerous,

38:29.856 --> 38:33.825
and that I was on
a self-destructive path.

38:33.860 --> 38:37.329
That sounds like a threat.

38:37.363 --> 38:41.566
He was trying
to make me doubt...

38:41.601 --> 38:44.069
You.

38:44.103 --> 38:46.104
What do you think?

38:48.341 --> 38:50.008
Uh...

38:50.042 --> 38:52.477
You look...

38:52.511 --> 38:54.646
I look stupid, don't it?

38:54.680 --> 38:56.414
No, no, no.

38:56.449 --> 38:59.150
You can tell me the truth.

39:00.453 --> 39:04.122
You look...

39:04.156 --> 39:05.423
Perfect.

39:05.458 --> 39:06.958
Really?

39:12.565 --> 39:15.867
Look at those.

39:17.637 --> 39:21.373
These are beautiful.

39:21.407 --> 39:23.008
May I?

39:23.042 --> 39:25.710
Sure.

39:38.057 --> 39:39.925
The other way.

39:39.959 --> 39:41.993
Oh.

39:48.668 --> 39:50.135
Just...

39:50.169 --> 39:52.804
Be careful.

40:31.210 --> 40:34.079
Oh, my goodness.

40:35.881 --> 40:38.316
I'm thinking maybe I should
leave town for a while.

40:38.351 --> 40:40.385
Take some sick days,
get the hell out of here.

40:40.419 --> 40:41.386
No.

40:41.420 --> 40:42.387
The police could come back

40:42.421 --> 40:43.888
with more questions about Cole.

40:43.923 --> 40:46.124
If you're suddenly gone,
it might look suspicious.

40:46.158 --> 40:47.759
Well, at least
I'll fucking be alive!

40:47.793 --> 40:50.028
Alex, you need to calm down.

40:50.062 --> 40:52.197
I've taken steps
to resolve the situation.

40:52.231 --> 40:54.299
What steps? What are you...
what are you talking about?

40:54.333 --> 40:56.768
- I'm on top of it.
- No, not so far, you're not.

40:56.802 --> 40:59.771
I am. And I need you
to trust me.

40:59.805 --> 41:01.373
I do trust you.
You know that.

41:01.407 --> 41:03.441
Good.
Now, listen to me.

41:03.476 --> 41:05.477
It's very important
that you keep acting

41:05.511 --> 41:06.711
like everything's normal.

41:06.746 --> 41:08.313
You're not gonna leave town.

41:08.347 --> 41:10.648
You're gonna maintain
your regular routine.

41:10.683 --> 41:11.950
To the letter.

41:11.984 --> 41:14.486
Do you understand?

41:14.520 --> 41:15.687
Alex?

41:15.721 --> 41:18.089
Tell me you understand
what I've said.

41:19.592 --> 41:21.059
I understand.

41:21.093 --> 41:23.395
Now go home like you always do.

41:23.429 --> 41:26.564
Have a vodka tonic.
Watch TV.

41:26.599 --> 41:29.100
I'll call you
as soon as I know more.

41:29.135 --> 41:33.438
Everything's gonna be fine.
I promise.

41:33.472 --> 41:35.273
Okay.

41:43.549 --> 41:46.217
Right on schedule.

42:00.966 --> 42:03.034
Detective Morgan, please?

42:05.838 --> 42:06.871
Morgan.

42:06.906 --> 42:09.808
Detective, it's Jordan Chase.

42:09.842 --> 42:11.476
How can I help you?

42:12.845 --> 42:14.946
My lawyer doesn't know
I'm making this call.

42:14.980 --> 42:16.047
Okay.

42:16.082 --> 42:19.784
But those images you showed me,

42:19.819 --> 42:22.854
I haven't been able to get it.

42:22.888 --> 42:24.823
They're very disturbing.

42:24.857 --> 42:27.459
They are.

42:27.493 --> 42:29.260
I just want you to know,

42:29.295 --> 42:31.930
I've always considered myself
a friend of the police.

42:31.964 --> 42:36.935
Well, uh, thank you, friend.

42:36.969 --> 42:39.137
What is this about?

42:39.171 --> 42:44.909
A strange call came into
my office from an Alex Tilden.

42:44.944 --> 42:48.046
Alex Tilden called you?
What... what did he want?

42:48.080 --> 42:49.581
I didn't speak to him myself,

42:49.615 --> 42:53.885
but my secretary said that
he was looking for Cole Harmon.

42:53.919 --> 42:56.387
She said he sounded panicked,

42:56.422 --> 42:57.622
that he wanted to speak to Cole

42:57.656 --> 42:59.491
about a flight
he needed to arrange.

42:59.525 --> 43:00.825
A flight to where?

43:00.860 --> 43:02.427
That's all I know.

43:02.461 --> 43:04.095
It's not much, I realize,

43:04.130 --> 43:06.931
but I hope it can be useful.

43:06.966 --> 43:08.766
Thank you, Mr. Chase.

43:15.708 --> 43:17.108
Saddle up.

43:17.143 --> 43:20.478
It looks like our fantasy
footballer's leaving town.

43:33.292 --> 43:35.593
No! No!
Let me out of here!

43:35.628 --> 43:39.464
No! No! No! No! Stop!

43:39.498 --> 43:43.801
No! Let me go!
Aah! Aah!

43:43.836 --> 43:44.802
Oh, my God.

43:50.075 --> 43:52.010
Help!

44:08.561 --> 44:10.695
Who are you?

44:24.710 --> 44:26.644
What's that?

44:26.679 --> 44:28.279
What...

44:31.650 --> 44:33.351
Uhh!

44:41.293 --> 44:42.994
It's for her.

44:43.028 --> 44:45.964
- Who?
- Oh, I think you know.

44:47.399 --> 44:50.602
Uh, I mean, what's her name?

44:50.636 --> 44:52.704
Oh, now you want to
know her name?

44:58.911 --> 45:01.913
Look, you... you really
have this all wrong.

45:01.947 --> 45:04.349
Save it for her.

45:04.383 --> 45:05.783
What's the address?

45:05.818 --> 45:10.154
Alex Tilden, 3040.
That's 3048.

45:10.189 --> 45:11.589
Here it is.

45:13.459 --> 45:14.726
And he's home.

46:22.861 --> 46:26.764
I look different, don't I?

46:26.799 --> 46:29.000
Without my hands tied
behind my back.

46:32.371 --> 46:35.006
But you recognize me.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.708
I can tell.

46:43.315 --> 46:45.516
I ne... I never wanted
to do any of it.

46:45.551 --> 46:47.585
Really?

46:47.619 --> 46:50.254
It wasn't... it wasn't me.

46:50.289 --> 46:52.023
It was... it was Jordan.

46:52.057 --> 46:54.692
It's all Jordan.

46:54.727 --> 46:56.828
He has this way.

46:56.862 --> 46:57.962
Of getting inside your head,

46:57.996 --> 47:01.265
getting you in touch
with your primal nature?

47:01.300 --> 47:02.834
He made me do things
I never would have done.

47:02.868 --> 47:08.039
No, you made me do things
I never would have done.

47:08.073 --> 47:10.007
Ever.

47:10.042 --> 47:11.275
<i>Ever!</i>

47:13.212 --> 47:15.713
What do you people want?

47:15.748 --> 47:17.215
I can give you Jordan Chase.

47:17.249 --> 47:19.684
We've got Jordan Chase.

47:19.718 --> 47:21.819
W-well, what do you want?

47:21.854 --> 47:23.855
Everybody wants something.

47:23.889 --> 47:26.290
I mean, that... that... that...
that's what brought us

47:26.325 --> 47:31.062
to this fucking unfortunate
situation, am I right?

47:31.096 --> 47:32.930
I'm a banker.

47:32.965 --> 47:34.465
I can get money.
Lots of it.

47:34.500 --> 47:35.466
We can work this out.

47:35.501 --> 47:36.567
So tell me,

47:36.602 --> 47:37.935
what's this gonna cost?

47:37.970 --> 47:39.637
Just give me a number.

47:43.575 --> 47:46.778
13.

47:46.812 --> 47:50.081
No. I-I-I...

47:56.155 --> 47:58.556
There's a first time
for everything.

47:58.590 --> 48:00.992
A first step.
A first word.

48:01.026 --> 48:04.328
A first kiss.
A first kill.

48:04.363 --> 48:06.898
Somehow you know
when the time is right.

48:06.932 --> 48:08.599
Aim for the heart.

48:49.908 --> 48:51.476
You okay?

48:53.011 --> 48:55.780
Yes.

48:55.814 --> 48:57.748
We should lock down
the airports

48:57.783 --> 48:59.584
in case he tries to flee.

48:59.618 --> 49:01.819
He's not going anywhere.

49:04.756 --> 49:07.558
Look at this. Looks like
a partial footprint.

49:10.963 --> 49:12.330
It looks small.

49:12.364 --> 49:13.431
Maybe a woman's.

49:16.068 --> 49:19.003
And she was just here.

49:21.006 --> 49:24.775
Remember at Boyd's house,
that fucking hair book,

49:24.810 --> 49:26.077
it had 12 pieces in it?

49:26.111 --> 49:29.580
But there are 13 DVDs.

49:29.615 --> 49:32.316
One of them didn't
get their hair taken.

49:32.351 --> 49:34.986
So what are you saying exactly?

49:35.020 --> 49:38.222
Well, what if one of them
escaped somehow

49:38.257 --> 49:40.491
and... and... after everything
they'd done,

49:40.526 --> 49:42.627
they've come back to get even?

49:42.661 --> 49:45.296
What if the vigilante
is one of their victims?

49:59.077 --> 50:00.378
Harry tried to mold me

50:00.412 --> 50:04.181
into the image of the monster
he thought I was.

50:12.424 --> 50:15.126
He told me to flee
human connection,

50:15.160 --> 50:17.161
so that became a way
of life for me.

52:34.599 --> 52:39.737
But with Lumen...

52:39.771 --> 52:42.740
I'm someone different.

52:45.944 --> 52:48.913
In her eyes...

52:52.250 --> 52:55.219
I'm not a monster at all.
