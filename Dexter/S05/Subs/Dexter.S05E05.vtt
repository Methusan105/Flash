00:10.599 --> 00:11.599
Previously on Dexter...

00:11.684 --> 00:13.518
- What'd you get?
- Two guys in their 30s.

00:13.602 --> 00:17.689
Strong accents, possibly
recent immigrants from Venezuela.

00:17.773 --> 00:20.358
Masuka found a match
on the print we had from the cigar butt -

00:20.442 --> 00:22.110
Carlos Fuentes.

00:22.194 --> 00:24.987
He's got a brother, Marco,
and I got the address.

00:25.072 --> 00:27.824
Cut him, and I'll blow your fucking head off.

00:29.034 --> 00:30.576
Medic! I need a fucking medic!

00:31.120 --> 00:32.912
Don't you dare let him die.

00:34.581 --> 00:35.915
I apologised. He accepted.

00:35.999 --> 00:37.291
It's assault and battery.

00:37.376 --> 00:40.712
Batista could not only lose his job,
he could serve time.

00:40.796 --> 00:43.339
According to
Sergeant Lopez's deposition,

00:43.424 --> 00:46.008
you give the best blowjob in Miami.

00:47.928 --> 00:49.470
Do you recognise this man?

00:49.555 --> 00:50.847
Jonah, is this Kyle Butler?

00:50.931 --> 00:52.515
Back away! Back away!

00:52.599 --> 00:54.976
You're on unpaid suspension
until further notice.

00:55.060 --> 00:56.060
Suspension?

00:56.145 --> 00:58.730
Just tell everyone you're
taking a few vacation days.

00:58.814 --> 01:00.273
I don't want to be alone tonight.

01:00.357 --> 01:02.567
I'm no good for you.

01:02.651 --> 01:04.402
I'm not looking for good right now.

01:04.486 --> 01:08.114
I just want to find out who that girl is
before the M99 wears off.

01:09.491 --> 01:11.242
Lumen Ann Pierce.

01:11.326 --> 01:14.537
- Why didn't you take me to the hospital?
- Because you saw me.

01:16.665 --> 01:19.000
- I didn't see anything.
- We both know that's not true.

01:19.084 --> 01:21.335
Every one of these barrels
has a body in it.

01:22.963 --> 01:24.505
- Look at this.
- No.

01:24.590 --> 01:26.716
This is what happened
to the girls before you.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.718
This is what
was going to happen to you.

01:28.802 --> 01:30.303
I saved your life.

01:31.930 --> 01:35.057
I was locked up.
And I thought it would never stop.

01:35.142 --> 01:38.102
But it has stopped.
He's dead. It's over.

01:38.187 --> 01:40.271
Boyd wasn't the only one
who did this to me.

01:42.065 --> 01:44.108
There were others.

03:40.267 --> 03:42.393
We all have something to hide,

03:42.477 --> 03:46.272
some dark place inside us
we don't want the world to see.

03:49.026 --> 03:51.444
So we pretend everything's OK...

03:52.446 --> 03:55.072
wrapping ourselves in rainbows.

03:55.866 --> 03:58.701
And maybe that's all for the best,

03:58.785 --> 04:02.413
because some of these places
are darker than others.

04:02.497 --> 04:04.707
- Whoo!
- Carefully.

04:05.709 --> 04:08.669
I want to believe that smile.

04:08.754 --> 04:11.213
That watching your mother die
hasn't changed you,

04:11.298 --> 04:13.090
the way watching mine changed me.

04:13.175 --> 04:15.885
Gently falling.

04:18.972 --> 04:20.473
Sweetheart!

04:20.557 --> 04:22.433
Sweetheart, what is it?

04:22.517 --> 04:25.227
Oh! It's OK. It's OK!

04:25.312 --> 04:28.439
He's got a scratch. Looks like someone
was playing a little rough.

04:28.523 --> 04:31.233
That's a little too familiar.

04:31.318 --> 04:32.860
- Let's get a Band-Aid on him.
- OK.

04:32.945 --> 04:34.487
That's it for today!

04:35.822 --> 04:37.615
But I use a scalpel.

04:37.699 --> 04:39.617
All you have are your fingers.

04:39.701 --> 04:43.245
Wiped clean. Not even a year old,
you're already destroying evidence.

04:46.041 --> 04:48.709
And having to flee the scene of the crime.

04:48.794 --> 04:50.836
Oh! It's OK.

05:13.986 --> 05:17.238
Every time you see me,
you look disappointed,

05:17.322 --> 05:19.407
like you were hoping
to find an empty table.

05:19.491 --> 05:21.659
Guilty.

05:21.743 --> 05:24.870
I still think you need
to consider my advice.

05:25.956 --> 05:27.832
Leave town?

05:28.792 --> 05:31.627
Go home to people who care about you.

05:31.712 --> 05:33.504
I told you why I can't do that.

05:34.214 --> 05:36.340
If you stay in Miami,
you'll never get past this.

05:38.552 --> 05:40.636
If you had something
horrible happen to you,

05:40.721 --> 05:44.223
could you just forget about it
and move on?

05:47.686 --> 05:49.687
I would want to.

05:49.771 --> 05:51.689
What if you couldn't?

05:58.864 --> 06:03.701
If you really want to help me get past this,
help me find those guys and kill them.

06:07.330 --> 06:09.123
I saw you kill Boyd.

06:09.207 --> 06:10.666
You knew what you were doing.

06:10.751 --> 06:11.751
Usual?

06:11.835 --> 06:13.794
Thanks.

06:18.884 --> 06:21.552
Going after those men
won't help you get past this.

06:21.636 --> 06:23.262
It'll only make it worse.

06:24.222 --> 06:25.514
How could it get worse?

06:25.599 --> 06:29.727
It'll open up something inside you
you don't want to know is there.

06:29.811 --> 06:31.062
Trust me.

06:31.897 --> 06:33.689
Trust you?

06:33.774 --> 06:35.816
I don't even know your last name.

06:35.901 --> 06:37.818
The less you know about me,
the better.

06:37.903 --> 06:40.696
- Better for who?
- For the both of us.

06:42.115 --> 06:45.201
If you're not gonna help me,
why do you keep coming back here?

06:46.286 --> 06:48.954
I'm trying to help you.

07:02.135 --> 07:03.928
Minneapolis.

07:04.012 --> 07:06.097
Yeah, I used some miles.

07:06.181 --> 07:07.598
Wow.

07:10.018 --> 07:12.144
You really want to get rid of me,
don't you?

07:15.857 --> 07:18.692
I want you to get on with your life.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.366
Lumen...

07:28.787 --> 07:30.329
She took the ticket.

07:30.413 --> 07:33.499
Maybe this is one problem
I can check off the list.

07:36.461 --> 07:39.046
And maybe it'll snow this week.

07:44.636 --> 07:46.095
Where's the fire?

07:46.179 --> 07:48.389
Got to get my ass in gear,
or I'm gonna be late.

07:52.310 --> 07:55.771
I could take that ass back to bed.

07:56.982 --> 07:58.816
What part of "late" don't you understand?

08:01.444 --> 08:04.029
I mean, at least let me
make you breakfast or something.

08:04.114 --> 08:06.448
I have no time.
I've got to meet Batista at the hospital.

08:06.533 --> 08:08.617
We're interviewing that kid
Fuentes sliced open.

08:08.702 --> 08:10.536
Good luck with that.

08:10.620 --> 08:14.540
"Good luck with that"? Fuentes has killed three people. I'm
running down leads,

08:14.624 --> 08:17.001
and you're sitting around in your
boxer shorts watching TV all day.

08:17.085 --> 08:19.962
Is that why you're, like, all,
"Let me get the fuck out of here."

08:20.046 --> 08:22.173
- Cos I'm taking a few days off?
- Just drop it.

08:22.257 --> 08:24.008
This wasn't even my call.

08:24.092 --> 08:26.635
LaGuerta said I had too many days.
I had to use 'em or lose 'em.

08:26.720 --> 08:28.721
- That's bullshit.
- No argument here.

08:30.849 --> 08:32.308
I gotta go.

08:37.647 --> 08:41.650
Quinn's my partner.
He should be here, not you. No offence.

08:41.735 --> 08:43.652
What do you want me to do?
He put in for his time.

08:43.737 --> 08:45.905
No, he told me he was forced
to take his leave.

08:45.989 --> 08:48.741
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Exactly. So will you talk to LaGuerta...

08:48.825 --> 08:49.909
- Shit.
- What?

08:49.993 --> 08:52.453
- It's the mother. What is she doing?
- She's coming this way.

08:52.537 --> 08:54.121
Fuck me so bad.
What am I supposed to say?

08:54.206 --> 08:56.332
"I'm sorry. It's my fault your son
got his throat slit"?

08:56.416 --> 08:57.958
No, let me do the talking.

09:09.012 --> 09:11.055
De nada, de nada.

09:13.308 --> 09:16.602
If it's OK with you, we'd like to ask
your son some questions.

09:23.318 --> 09:24.860
- Sí.
- Yes.

09:26.029 --> 09:27.154
Gracias.

09:31.618 --> 09:35.329
- Jandro, how you feeling?
- ¿Cómo te sientes?

09:35.413 --> 09:37.915
- Poquito mejor.
- A little better.

09:37.999 --> 09:40.918
Bueno. We were wondering
if there's anything you can tell us

09:41.002 --> 09:43.420
about the man who... injured you.

09:47.759 --> 09:48.801
Uh...

09:56.851 --> 09:59.687
He's seen him around,
but he didn't know who he was.

10:04.609 --> 10:06.819
I asked if he had heard anything
about Fuentes around the neighbourhood.

10:06.903 --> 10:09.905
Does he remember anything about that day,
anything Fuentes said or did?

10:09.990 --> 10:11.115
Anything at all?

10:21.418 --> 10:24.378
He doesn't remember anything else.
He was really scared.

10:24.462 --> 10:27.464
Fuentes said he was going to kill him.

10:29.009 --> 10:31.260
OK. Gracias.

10:32.929 --> 10:35.306
Uh...

10:38.727 --> 10:41.520
He had a mark on his hand.

10:41.604 --> 10:43.647
- A small one.
- Like a tattoo?

10:43.732 --> 10:45.649
Sí, como un tatuaje.

10:45.734 --> 10:48.819
Can you draw it for us?

10:58.246 --> 11:01.165
Lumen needs to stay away
from the darkness.

11:01.249 --> 11:04.001
I, on the other hand,
always need names for my table,

11:04.085 --> 11:08.088
and there are few people more deserving
than Boyd Fowler's accomplices.

11:08.173 --> 11:10.549
Nothing in Boyd's arrest record
even hints he had help.

11:10.633 --> 11:12.176
Zero to go on.

11:12.260 --> 11:14.470
I'll have to look elsewhere.

11:17.557 --> 11:18.724
Yours.

11:20.226 --> 11:21.685
Thanks. You didn't have to do that.

11:21.770 --> 11:25.522
No, it really is yours.
You left it on the hood of your car.

11:25.607 --> 11:27.191
Oh.

11:27.275 --> 11:28.817
My head's in 50 places.

11:28.902 --> 11:31.362
Masuka didn't even begin
to keep up the caseload.

11:31.446 --> 11:34.323
Well, good luck getting
the midget porn off your hard drive.

11:34.407 --> 11:36.367
He might have shown it to me.

11:38.328 --> 11:40.662
How was Mommy And Me?
Harrison break any hearts?

11:41.539 --> 11:43.290
No, but he drew his first blood.

11:43.375 --> 11:45.584
I think his little black book
still has a few blank pages.

11:45.668 --> 11:48.337
- Well, not for long.
- He missed you this morning.

11:48.421 --> 11:51.215
He's used to having his Aunt Deb
feed him his mango oatmeal.

11:51.299 --> 11:53.092
Yeah, sorry.

11:53.176 --> 11:55.219
You didn't come home last night.

11:57.305 --> 11:59.348
No, it was late,
and I didn't want to wake you.

11:59.432 --> 12:02.643
- I just crashed at a friend's house.
- Oh. What friend?

12:02.727 --> 12:05.354
What, are you Mom now?

12:05.438 --> 12:06.647
You want to do lunch?

12:06.731 --> 12:08.982
I think I'm gonna be dining on backlog.

12:09.067 --> 12:10.818
And paying a visit to Boyd's house.

12:10.902 --> 12:15.406
Hm. All right, well,
I'll bring you something back. Bye.

12:24.457 --> 12:26.250
Wait a second.

12:26.334 --> 12:28.168
What?

12:29.629 --> 12:31.755
Give me your opinion as a female.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.800
- As a female?
- As a woman, you know?

12:36.219 --> 12:37.261
McCourt.

12:38.721 --> 12:40.806
- What about him?
- Do you find him attractive?

12:40.890 --> 12:42.266
Do you?

12:44.060 --> 12:45.978
I mean, would you ever?

12:46.062 --> 12:49.231
I would rather put a campfire out
with my face.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.067
OK?

12:52.152 --> 12:53.485
I checked in with Cira.

12:53.570 --> 12:55.737
She's gonna stay
on the ATM video surveillance

12:55.822 --> 12:58.657
- while I track down the tattoo.
- Let me see that again.

13:00.368 --> 13:02.202
See, it still looks like a UFO to me.

13:02.287 --> 13:03.787
- Who the fuck knows, right?
- Yeah.

13:03.872 --> 13:06.457
- We need to talk to an expert.
- An expert, huh?

13:06.541 --> 13:07.749
Mm-hm.

13:14.007 --> 13:18.218
The dragon lady represents
the dualities of my inner warrior.

13:19.429 --> 13:20.971
Or your inner idiot.

13:21.055 --> 13:25.267
Hey! If you can't muster up the appropriate respect, I'm
dropping the curtain.

13:25.351 --> 13:27.269
When did you get this?

13:27.353 --> 13:29.646
I've been adding to it over time,

13:29.731 --> 13:33.901
but the main work started
about two years ago.

13:33.985 --> 13:35.319
I was having a bit of a crisis,

13:35.403 --> 13:37.571
and this was my way
of working through it.

13:37.655 --> 13:40.866
- Viagra probably would have been cheaper.
- This was a crisis of the soul, Morgan.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.784
Don't you have to have a soul
before it could be in crisis?

13:42.869 --> 13:46.205
- Point is, you know a little about this world.
- I know a little.

13:46.289 --> 13:49.583
The person you want to talk to
is my body artist, Michael Angelo.

13:49.667 --> 13:53.170
- You're kidding. Michelangelo?
- Two words. Michael Angelo.

13:53.254 --> 13:54.338
And, yes, I'm serious.

13:54.422 --> 13:58.592
If your tattoo were done by anyone local,
Michael Angelo will know.

13:58.676 --> 14:00.594
You can lower the curtain.

14:07.227 --> 14:10.687
From the outside,
a normal home is indistinguishable

14:10.772 --> 14:14.441
from the home of a monster
who puts women in barrels.

14:20.448 --> 14:21.949
But step inside...

14:24.577 --> 14:29.164
There must be something around here
that will point me to Boyd's accomplices.

14:33.670 --> 14:36.129
Somebody's been here.

14:37.173 --> 14:39.132
Oh, great.

14:39.217 --> 14:40.926
Blood.

14:51.813 --> 14:54.523
They were going through Boyd's files.

15:05.743 --> 15:08.036
Whoever Boyd was working with
must have panicked,

15:08.121 --> 15:10.330
tried to cover up any trace
of their existence.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.376
Amateurs.

15:23.261 --> 15:27.180
Here he is, freshly bathed,
clean as a whistle...

15:27.265 --> 15:28.515
and ready for bed.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.726
- Thanks.
- I'm gonna get going.

15:30.810 --> 15:32.603
Cheque's on the counter.

15:33.646 --> 15:35.439
Sonya, can I ask you a question?

15:35.523 --> 15:37.316
Sure.

15:38.192 --> 15:42.237
Have you ever noticed Harrison being... aggressive?

15:42.322 --> 15:44.031
Aggressive?
What do you mean?

15:44.115 --> 15:46.158
Scratching, stuff like that.

15:46.659 --> 15:48.076
No.

15:48.161 --> 15:50.662
He's a very gentle child, really.
Why?

15:50.747 --> 15:53.915
There might have been an incident
at one of the Mommy And Me classes.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.959
Can't be sure it was Harrison or not.

15:56.044 --> 15:57.294
He's a little boy.

15:57.378 --> 16:00.797
My little brother used to bite people.
Bloody little cannibal.

16:00.882 --> 16:02.966
Now he's a vegetarian,
works for Greenpeace.

16:03.051 --> 16:05.677
Well, that's comforting.

16:06.679 --> 16:09.348
Not to worry.
You've got a little angel on your hands.

16:09.432 --> 16:10.682
Nothing can change that.

16:10.767 --> 16:13.685
- See you tomorrow morning.
- Night.

16:19.817 --> 16:22.152
No match for Daddy
in the criminal database.

16:22.236 --> 16:26.740
You're absolutely right. Maybe he drives.

16:26.824 --> 16:28.492
Let's check the DMV.

16:32.872 --> 16:34.873
Minnesota.

16:36.584 --> 16:38.377
Lumen Ann Pierce.

16:40.546 --> 16:42.964
She broke into Boyd's house.

16:44.634 --> 16:46.259
She beat me to it.

17:33.766 --> 17:36.017
Oh, my God.

17:45.403 --> 17:49.448
Dexter, this seem like the product
of a stable mind?

17:53.411 --> 17:56.705
A closet was the only place
she felt safe from them.

17:57.957 --> 17:59.791
She's remade it here.

18:00.752 --> 18:04.171
- Dexter, are you listening to me?
- Yes, I'm listening.

18:04.922 --> 18:08.049
She's not a killer. She's not you.
She's coming undone.

18:13.347 --> 18:14.806
What's that now?

18:14.891 --> 18:18.393
This is the letter she took
from Boyd Fowler's house.

18:18.478 --> 18:21.772
From his ex-cellmate, Robert Brunner.

18:21.856 --> 18:25.859
"I'm getting paroled next week.
Need a place to 'sleap'."

18:25.943 --> 18:27.778
S-L-E-A-P.

18:28.946 --> 18:30.322
She's found a target.

18:30.406 --> 18:32.407
You don't know what she's planning.

18:32.492 --> 18:35.118
I know this isn't gonna end well.

18:35.203 --> 18:37.621
She keeps going this way,
she's gonna get herself killed

18:37.705 --> 18:40.540
or thrown in jail, and you're
gonna be right there with her.

18:40.625 --> 18:43.251
Dex, she's gonna bring you down.

19:00.645 --> 19:03.230
I know what you're doing.

19:05.733 --> 19:08.610
- Having breakfast?
- You're looking for the men who hurt you.

19:08.694 --> 19:10.695
So...

19:10.780 --> 19:12.364
What, you're spying on me now?

19:12.448 --> 19:15.617
What are you gonna do
if you actually find one of these guys?

19:16.619 --> 19:18.537
Maybe...

19:18.621 --> 19:21.414
- what you won't.
- Are you gonna kill them? Is that it?

19:22.416 --> 19:23.583
I'm sorry.

19:24.502 --> 19:26.294
You don't get to tell me what to do.

19:28.089 --> 19:30.215
I asked for your help.
You turned me down.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.300
For your own good.

19:34.804 --> 19:36.805
Look...

19:36.889 --> 19:39.933
You saved my life.
I'm grateful for that.

19:40.017 --> 19:42.477
But what I need from you right now
is to leave me alone.

19:42.562 --> 19:45.230
- Lumen...
- Don't touch me!

20:01.247 --> 20:05.375
These men put five women in barrels.
They're not gonna want to be found.

20:05.459 --> 20:07.043
Please...

20:08.045 --> 20:09.838
stop this before it's too late.

20:24.145 --> 20:27.772
She's not going to stop
until she finds Brunner.

20:37.491 --> 20:40.243
- My favourite colour.
- Help you, Sergeant?

20:40.328 --> 20:43.121
Morgan has been all over me
the last two days about Quinn.

20:43.205 --> 20:46.833
- What about Quinn?
- The vacation he's being forced to take.

20:46.918 --> 20:49.252
She's feeling shorthanded
without her partner.

20:49.337 --> 20:53.673
- To tell you the truth, we need him.
- Well, it's the union.

20:53.758 --> 20:55.216
Not my call.

20:56.218 --> 20:57.469
That all?

20:59.096 --> 21:01.681
Is there anything I need to know
about my case with IA?

21:03.559 --> 21:04.893
Mm-mm.

21:06.520 --> 21:09.356
Is there anything I need to know
about anything else?

21:14.403 --> 21:16.571
I'm sorry, Angel, but I gotta go.

21:16.656 --> 21:18.406
Sure.

21:18.491 --> 21:19.824
I'll see you tonight?

21:19.909 --> 21:21.952
Yeah... Um...
I might be late.

21:22.036 --> 21:24.412
OK, so I'll let you know.

21:24.497 --> 21:26.289
OK?

22:09.333 --> 22:11.167
Hope you didn't have to dig too deep.

22:11.252 --> 22:14.921
Only eight boxes, but I always remember
to lift with my back.

22:15.006 --> 22:17.590
Well, here's the guy you asked for -
Robert Brunner.

22:17.675 --> 22:20.510
- Nuh-uh-uh! Like we agreed.
- Right.

22:20.594 --> 22:22.762
- Hm.
- There you go.

22:22.847 --> 22:26.391
Aw. Oh! That face!

22:27.977 --> 22:30.311
Abduction, torture, rape.

22:30.396 --> 22:33.023
He's so big. Is he a year yet?

22:33.733 --> 22:35.275
- Ten months.
- He's beautiful.

22:35.359 --> 22:36.943
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

22:37.028 --> 22:40.238
Seven years for sexual assault.
Out in three for good behaviour.

22:40.322 --> 22:43.199
Mm. Good behaviour.
You ever seen scars like that?

22:43.284 --> 22:44.784
Yes. On Lumen.

22:44.869 --> 22:46.327
And he's out now.

22:46.412 --> 22:48.163
Thank you, State of Florida.

22:48.247 --> 22:50.540
Looks like she stumbled
on to the right guy.

22:50.624 --> 22:53.126
It says he's living under Tuttle Bridge.
Is this current?

22:53.210 --> 22:55.879
Mm-hm.
Sex offenders can't live anywhere near kids.

22:55.963 --> 22:57.630
Tuttle's the only place they can go.

22:57.715 --> 22:59.883
- Can I keep this?
- Well, that depends, now.

22:59.967 --> 23:02.135
You gonna bring this little cutie by
to see me?

23:02.219 --> 23:03.636
- Will do.
- OK.

23:05.264 --> 23:08.558
Tuttle Bridge is the perfect place
for Brunner to hide in the dark,

23:08.642 --> 23:12.062
but not from me.
I've got to get to him before she does.

23:15.566 --> 23:17.150
Yo, what's up?

23:21.864 --> 23:24.407
Tramp stamp.
I think I'm in love.

23:24.492 --> 23:27.535
She's into needles.
Why don't you show her your dick?

23:28.996 --> 23:30.538
That's disgusting.

23:30.623 --> 23:32.832
You are so judgmental, Morgan.
I mean, come on.

23:32.917 --> 23:35.460
We all have our own ways
of expressing ourselves.

23:35.544 --> 23:38.296
I have my ink,
and you have your...

23:39.590 --> 23:40.632
man-boots.

23:40.716 --> 23:41.925
Yeah?

23:42.009 --> 23:45.470
Well, expect my man-boots up your ass
if you're wasting my time, OK?

23:45.554 --> 23:46.888
Vincent?

23:46.972 --> 23:49.307
Now, what can I do you for?

23:51.644 --> 23:53.770
- That's Michael Angelo?
- The one and only.

23:53.854 --> 23:55.855
- M, how are you?
- Come here.

23:56.941 --> 23:58.691
- Good to see you.
- Always good to see you.

23:58.776 --> 24:01.861
M, this is the detective
I was telling you about - Detective Morgan.

24:03.322 --> 24:05.865
- Enchantée.
- Right.

24:06.784 --> 24:08.785
You mind taking a look
at something for us?

24:08.869 --> 24:10.787
Any friend of Sugar's
is a friend of mine.

24:10.871 --> 24:12.956
"Sugar"?

24:13.040 --> 24:14.624
OK.

24:15.709 --> 24:19.963
We interviewed this kid who saw this
on the hand of a suspect we're looking for.

24:20.047 --> 24:21.381
Any idea what it means?

24:21.465 --> 24:24.425
Crude, simplistic, but...

24:24.510 --> 24:26.261
it's definitely an eye.

24:26.345 --> 24:27.887
Look.

24:29.431 --> 24:30.557
The similarity.

24:32.143 --> 24:34.310
- See?
- And that would mean?

24:34.395 --> 24:37.438
Eyes symbolise the third eye in our minds,

24:37.523 --> 24:39.107
like the god Horus

24:39.191 --> 24:40.650
and also...

24:41.902 --> 24:44.279
just like...

24:45.114 --> 24:47.448
the back of a dollar bill.

24:50.161 --> 24:53.580
Hm.
Have you ever done something like this?

24:53.664 --> 24:55.707
Well, if I had,
I would have remembered it.

24:55.791 --> 24:58.334
Anything else you can tell us?
We're kinda desperate here.

24:58.419 --> 25:02.172
Without it in front of me,
that's the best I can do.

25:02.256 --> 25:04.340
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's OK.

25:04.967 --> 25:07.093
M, thank you so much, anyways.

25:07.761 --> 25:09.012
Always for you.

25:09.096 --> 25:10.763
And you...

25:12.975 --> 25:14.767
You come see me anytime, OK?

25:15.269 --> 25:17.103
OK, thank you.

25:17.688 --> 25:19.147
- OK.
- OK, bye.

25:19.231 --> 25:20.648
Bye.

25:20.733 --> 25:23.276
- I'll be in soon.
- Bye.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.694
Hey, I think she likes you.

25:24.778 --> 25:27.155
Don't ever speak about this.

25:28.199 --> 25:31.951
Since we're already here, why don't you
get Quinn's name put on your...

25:32.036 --> 25:34.287
- Hey, I have a gun.
- I'll just wait in the car.

25:34.371 --> 25:36.456
OK.

25:42.171 --> 25:44.589
- Hello?
- Cira, it's me.

25:44.673 --> 25:47.884
- Any luck?
- Just a steaming pile of fuck-all.

25:47.968 --> 25:49.177
Please tell me you have something.

25:49.261 --> 25:52.472
I've gone through most of the bank's
ATM footage. Eight names and counting.

25:52.556 --> 25:53.973
They're all freaking out about something

25:54.058 --> 25:56.100
while they're withdrawing
maximum amounts from their accounts,

25:56.185 --> 25:58.019
just like our first Santa Muerte vics.

25:58.103 --> 26:01.898
I want addresses for all eight names
and any others you can find.

26:01.982 --> 26:06.069
I'll pick you up on my way to work tomorrow,
and we'll check 'em out, OK?

26:13.494 --> 26:15.286
Poor Julia Tuttle.

26:16.163 --> 26:17.664
The Mother of Miami.

26:17.748 --> 26:21.084
They named this bridge after her
in her honour.

26:21.168 --> 26:24.879
Now it's crawling with paedophiles
and sex offenders.

26:27.883 --> 26:30.218
So much for honour.

26:48.988 --> 26:53.574
Japan's total area is slightly smaller than the US
State of Montana...

26:53.659 --> 26:55.952
You mind if I watch?

26:57.413 --> 26:59.998
The kid fuckers stay over by the tracks.

27:00.082 --> 27:01.541
That's not why I'm here.

27:01.625 --> 27:03.126
And why is that?

27:03.210 --> 27:06.045
A stuck-up little co-ed and I
had a legal disagreement

27:06.130 --> 27:08.798
concerning the meaning
of the word "consent".

27:11.218 --> 27:12.760
Take a load off.

27:15.097 --> 27:17.056
Appreciate it, brother.

27:20.853 --> 27:22.937
Where'd you do your time?

27:23.564 --> 27:26.065
Okeechobee.

27:26.150 --> 27:29.944
My last stretch was in that shithole.
Rough place.

27:31.196 --> 27:32.989
Yeah.

27:33.073 --> 27:36.659
Told everyone I was in for armed robbery
to keep a target off my back.

27:39.330 --> 27:42.123
- You from Miami?
- Used to be.

27:42.207 --> 27:44.000
Guy I bunked with
lives down here now.

27:44.084 --> 27:46.419
Thought I'd let him show me the town
and have some fun.

27:46.503 --> 27:48.880
Did that fun include Lumen?

27:48.964 --> 27:51.716
That is until my parole officer,
the cunt, started giving me shit

27:51.800 --> 27:53.801
about staying with someone
from the joint.

27:55.554 --> 27:57.472
- Wound up here.
- Hmm.

27:57.556 --> 27:59.682
- Beats a cell.
- Barely.

28:00.601 --> 28:02.935
Once my parole is done,
fuck Florida.

28:05.272 --> 28:07.190
I'm going north.

28:07.274 --> 28:09.275
Get me some of that farm-fresh pussy.

28:10.944 --> 28:14.197
- You ever tap that?
- Can't say I have.

28:15.991 --> 28:18.076
A couple weeks ago...

28:18.160 --> 28:22.955
I had this hot, little blonde
on all fours.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.957
A few of us did.

28:25.042 --> 28:27.377
Believe me,
that bitch got every fucking inch

28:27.461 --> 28:30.046
- of my motherfucking...
- That's enough.

28:34.885 --> 28:37.095
This room was meant for Boyd,
not his cellmate.

28:37.179 --> 28:39.180
They were co-workers, partners.

28:39.264 --> 28:41.516
- Basically the same.
- You're sure?

28:41.600 --> 28:43.810
I need to kill him...

28:43.894 --> 28:47.397
so Lumen doesn't have to.
I don't want her down that road.

28:47.481 --> 28:50.900
- Think about what you're doing.
- I am.

28:50.984 --> 28:52.527
- He's a sex offender...
- I know.

28:52.611 --> 28:53.694
...on parole.

28:55.697 --> 28:57.448
- What are you saying?
- Think!

28:58.575 --> 29:00.785
Are you listening?

29:07.626 --> 29:09.419
OK.

29:09.503 --> 29:12.088
He's wearing an ankle bracelet.
It couldn't have been him.

29:12.172 --> 29:14.173
She had the wrong guy.

29:16.718 --> 29:24.892
I was ready to kill him.

29:25.894 --> 29:27.687
I was ready to kill him!

29:32.109 --> 29:34.402
Robert Brunner isn't
one of the men who hurt her.

29:39.867 --> 29:40.992
Harry's right.

29:41.076 --> 29:44.162
I have to convince Lumen to do
what I never could -

29:44.246 --> 29:46.289
to move on.

29:49.418 --> 29:51.461
You're home early.

29:53.046 --> 29:55.131
- Where's Sonya?
- I sent her home.

29:55.215 --> 29:57.592
She said you were gonna
be working late.

29:57.676 --> 30:01.304
- Hope you don't mind, I grabbed a beer.
- What's he doing here?

30:01.388 --> 30:03.181
He wanted to...

30:04.516 --> 30:05.766
borrow...

30:07.186 --> 30:08.978
- a book.
- He reads?

30:10.814 --> 30:13.608
- Yeah, he does.
- Here.

30:14.610 --> 30:15.818
Thanks.

30:15.903 --> 30:17.528
Little vacation reading.

30:17.613 --> 30:19.614
Quinn was just leaving.

30:20.407 --> 30:22.200
What she said.

30:25.412 --> 30:27.455
I will call you in the morning, Joseph.

30:28.707 --> 30:31.584
Oh. OK, Debra.

30:35.380 --> 30:37.381
Kinda warm for gloves.

30:40.302 --> 30:42.470
- Good night.
- Thanks for the book.

30:49.978 --> 30:51.979
What was that about?

30:52.064 --> 30:54.398
It's late, so I'll take the couch.

30:54.483 --> 30:56.067
Are you and Quinn?

30:59.571 --> 31:02.782
We're fuck buddies. That's it.

31:04.701 --> 31:06.494
You need Quinn for that?

31:06.578 --> 31:10.122
I know it's insane. I know it's...

31:11.250 --> 31:12.792
wrong for a fuck-ton of reas...

31:12.876 --> 31:15.294
Will you please stop looking
at me like that?

31:15.379 --> 31:16.420
It's your life, Deb.

31:16.505 --> 31:19.799
Just don't bring him around
when Harrison's here.

31:19.883 --> 31:22.802
- What's that supposed to mean?
- He's at an impressionable age.

31:22.886 --> 31:27.223
- We don't know what might rub off on him.
- What will rub off on him?

31:27.307 --> 31:29.725
- Just keep Quinn away from my son.
- Fine.

31:29.810 --> 31:31.936
You know, you're wrong about Quinn.
He's...

31:33.647 --> 31:34.814
not that bad.

31:38.443 --> 31:39.860
Hey.

31:39.945 --> 31:41.988
Sorry. Long day.

31:43.532 --> 31:45.366
Dinner's in the oven.

31:46.118 --> 31:48.578
You mind if I, um, hop in the shower first?

31:55.335 --> 31:57.253
You never called.

31:57.337 --> 32:00.506
Yeah, I know.
I just lost track of time.

32:01.883 --> 32:03.634
Why so late?

32:05.178 --> 32:07.972
Budgets are due
at the end of the month, so...

32:08.932 --> 32:10.141
I'm gonna...

32:10.225 --> 32:13.102
- I'll set the table.
- Thanks.

32:52.059 --> 32:54.477
She's not there.
You just missed her.

32:54.561 --> 32:57.855
- Did my wife say where she was going?
- You two still not seeing eye to eye?

32:57.939 --> 33:00.524
Look, I really need to find her.
It's important.

33:00.609 --> 33:02.485
She was asking about Tuttle Bridge.

33:02.569 --> 33:06.113
I told her that is the last place
she wants to be.

33:27.427 --> 33:30.304
What the fuck, asshole?

33:30.389 --> 33:32.973
Nice. Where you going, baby?

35:00.687 --> 35:02.855
What are you doing?

35:05.025 --> 35:07.610
- I'm taking you out of here.
- Give me the gun.

35:07.694 --> 35:09.445
- No.
- Give it to me!

35:09.529 --> 35:12.573
You have no idea
what those animals did to me.

35:12.657 --> 35:13.741
Passing me around.

35:13.825 --> 35:15.910
I couldn't move.
I couldn't stop them.

35:15.994 --> 35:17.578
- It wasn't Brunner.
- It was.

35:17.662 --> 35:19.330
He was Boyd's cellmate.

35:19.414 --> 35:22.833
He raped three women!
He tortured them, just like he did to me.

35:22.918 --> 35:24.668
- That's impossible.
- You weren't there!

35:24.753 --> 35:25.878
Just listen to me.

35:25.962 --> 35:28.464
He's wearing an ankle bracelet
as part of his parole.

35:28.548 --> 35:31.425
If he leaves this place, it gets reported.
I checked.

35:31.510 --> 35:34.303
He was here the whole time
you were taken.

35:37.098 --> 35:40.768
Robert Brunner's never seen you before.
He's never touched you.

35:40.852 --> 35:42.645
He never hurt you.

35:42.729 --> 35:45.397
You were about to murder the wrong man.

35:49.694 --> 35:51.570
Oh, fuck.

35:53.573 --> 35:56.367
You see?
This is where it leads.

35:56.993 --> 35:59.995
But it's not too late.
There's still no blood on your hands.

36:05.418 --> 36:08.587
I just...
I just want to feel better.

36:08.672 --> 36:10.840
I want all this to go away.

36:12.384 --> 36:14.134
It will.

36:14.219 --> 36:16.220
I don't see how it can.

36:16.930 --> 36:18.848
Go home.

36:20.100 --> 36:21.684
Back to your family.

36:21.768 --> 36:24.353
If you don't put this behind you,

36:24.437 --> 36:27.523
I swear what you're feeling now
will only get worse.

36:30.277 --> 36:31.861
Oh...

36:36.032 --> 36:38.492
OK. OK, OK, I'll go.

36:39.035 --> 36:40.828
OK.

36:43.915 --> 36:45.666
Next one on our ATM list.

36:45.750 --> 36:49.712
0-for-fucking-5,
that's how I like to start my fucking day.

36:52.090 --> 36:55.593
You want to make a bet why this one
was taking a wad of cash out of the ATM?

36:55.677 --> 36:57.761
Gambling, hookers, drugs?

36:57.846 --> 36:59.930
You're very cynical.

37:00.015 --> 37:02.850
It's called being a detective.
And blow me.

37:02.934 --> 37:05.811
You have to put positive energy
out into the universe.

37:07.188 --> 37:09.773
Right. Blow you.

37:13.945 --> 37:15.738
You smell that?

37:24.664 --> 37:26.457
Holy shit.

37:31.713 --> 37:34.214
- Little help here? Anytime you're ready.
- Yeah.

38:06.831 --> 38:10.250
This is Detective Morgan
requesting CSI and body transport

38:10.335 --> 38:13.921
at 2075 Ocean Way
for a possible double homicide.

38:14.005 --> 38:19.468
And you need to tell Masuka and Dexter
that they need to bring a bug kit...

38:19.552 --> 38:21.220
and some fucking crackers.

38:24.015 --> 38:25.849
You good?

39:04.014 --> 39:05.472
You son of a bitch.

39:05.557 --> 39:07.933
- Angel!
- Sergeant, you're making a big mistake!

39:08.059 --> 39:11.020
The only mistake I made was not kicking your ass when you
first laid eyes on my wife.

39:11.104 --> 39:13.188
Angel, let him go! This is a sting!

39:14.858 --> 39:17.192
Let him go!

39:19.863 --> 39:22.406
- You're wearing a wire?
- No shit.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.950
You idiot.
What would have happened

39:25.035 --> 39:27.536
- if he barged in here a half-hour ago?
- I know.

39:28.329 --> 39:30.789
Just give us a minute, Jim.

39:30.874 --> 39:33.584
You just don't learn, do you, Batista?

39:36.254 --> 39:39.965
Have you completely lost your mind?

39:40.050 --> 39:42.342
- I thought...
- What? That I was fucking him?

39:42.427 --> 39:46.096
What am I supposed to think?
You barely talk to me.

39:46.181 --> 39:48.432
The late nights, the sneaking around.

39:50.060 --> 39:51.977
How'd you find us?

39:52.062 --> 39:54.313
Wait. You...

39:54.397 --> 39:56.356
I don't even want to know.

39:56.483 --> 40:01.820
IA needed my help to bust a narcotics cop on the take, and
I
said yes.

40:01.905 --> 40:05.449
Why?
To close the books on your bar fight!

40:05.533 --> 40:08.786
So I don't want to hear about
sneaking around and late nights!

40:10.205 --> 40:13.707
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Why didn't you trust me?

40:13.792 --> 40:15.584
Maria, I...

40:18.588 --> 40:21.256
Morgan needs us on site -
double homicide.

40:21.341 --> 40:24.343
- My car's outside.
- I'll ride with Patrol.

40:33.228 --> 40:35.020
Fuck me.

40:35.730 --> 40:37.606
Come on, Liddy.

40:46.699 --> 40:48.450
Lieutenant, any comment?

40:48.535 --> 40:50.494
- Not now.
- Lieutenant LaGuerta...

40:50.578 --> 40:53.038
It's like the fucking
food chain in action in there.

40:53.123 --> 40:55.124
Flies - the blowflies
are attracted by the smell

40:55.208 --> 40:57.751
and they lay eggs, and the beetles,
they're drawn by the larvae,

40:57.836 --> 40:59.503
- and they burrow into every orifice...
- I get it.

40:59.587 --> 41:01.421
What do we know?

41:01.506 --> 41:04.424
The vics' names
are Daniel and Awilda Ortiz.

41:04.509 --> 41:08.512
ATM footage showed Daniel trying to make a maximum
withdrawal about 4 weeks ago.

41:08.596 --> 41:12.266
Officer Manzon and I show up
to interview him, and we find the bodies.

41:12.350 --> 41:14.184
The remains have already
started to mummify,

41:14.269 --> 41:16.145
but the wounds are consistent
with a machete.

41:16.229 --> 41:18.188
I can make sure
when I get them back to the lab.

41:18.273 --> 41:21.108
- We like the Fuentes brothers for this.
- Only weird thing is,

41:21.192 --> 41:24.278
we can't find any Santa Claus Muerte
mumbo jumbo bullshit.

41:24.362 --> 41:27.823
We might be looking
at the Fuentes brothers' first victims.

41:27.907 --> 41:31.451
The defensive wounds and heavy smearing
suggest our killers were still inexperienced.

41:31.536 --> 41:33.036
Beheading requires skill.

41:33.121 --> 41:35.914
So we got their goddamn
training wheels kill?

41:35.999 --> 41:38.333
Means we're back to fucking square one.

41:38.418 --> 41:40.961
A little downwind, please.

41:41.045 --> 41:44.840
Oh, yeah. That's never coming out.
I liked this shirt, too.

41:44.924 --> 41:46.842
I'll get a jacket out of my car.

41:46.926 --> 41:48.760
All right.

42:08.239 --> 42:10.824
It was never a tattoo.
It was a stamp...

42:10.909 --> 42:12.451
from a nightclub.

42:13.620 --> 42:15.412
It was a fucking nightclub!

42:18.082 --> 42:19.541
It's a nightclub!

42:19.626 --> 42:22.836
- What's gotten into her?
- Find out, Sergeant.

42:22.921 --> 42:24.755
I'm gonna go deal with the press.

42:24.839 --> 42:26.173
Nice to have you back, Dexter.

42:26.925 --> 42:28.717
Good to be back, Lieutenant.

42:30.887 --> 42:33.889
Reports on my desk, first thing.

42:35.266 --> 42:38.310
Ah, all together once again.

42:38.394 --> 42:41.772
One big happy family.
Eh, Dexerino?

42:58.206 --> 42:59.539
Yeah.

43:11.010 --> 43:14.137
- You don't have to wait.
- I don't mind.

43:15.848 --> 43:18.767
I can pay you back for the ticket.
I'll send you some money.

43:19.477 --> 43:21.228
Except...

43:21.312 --> 43:23.272
I still don't know who to send it to.

43:27.652 --> 43:29.361
Dexter Morgan.

43:30.488 --> 43:32.864
And it's not necessary.

43:32.949 --> 43:34.741
The ticket.

43:39.414 --> 43:41.832
I came to Miami for a fresh start.

43:43.126 --> 43:45.294
- Somewhere warm.
- You're doing the right thing.

43:45.378 --> 43:47.629
Your parents will be...

43:47.714 --> 43:49.798
happy to see you.

43:50.800 --> 43:52.843
I tried to call them, but I...

43:52.927 --> 43:54.344
I couldn't.

43:55.471 --> 43:57.931
What would I say?

43:59.475 --> 44:01.101
Just give it some time.

44:05.231 --> 44:07.482
I can't tell them what happened to me.

44:08.568 --> 44:11.570
I can't tell anyone.

44:13.448 --> 44:15.699
You're the only one who knows.

44:20.371 --> 44:23.790
You have my number.
Call me if you need to talk about it.

44:29.255 --> 44:31.048
- I should...
- Oh, yeah.

44:34.886 --> 44:36.386
Thank you.

44:46.439 --> 44:48.440
You're welcome.

44:58.576 --> 45:01.244
Go ahead, put it through.
And your bags.

45:05.750 --> 45:10.295
Make sure everything's out of your pockets.
Jewellery, belts.

45:17.345 --> 45:18.845
Step to the mat, ma'am.

45:18.930 --> 45:21.640
- Is there a problem?
- I can't let you through to your gate

45:21.724 --> 45:24.017
unless you consent to a hand search.

45:27.772 --> 45:29.981
Lift your arms.

45:30.066 --> 45:32.067
I need you to stay still.

45:35.321 --> 45:37.072
Spread your legs.

46:35.631 --> 46:37.799
- Are you home?
- Uh...

46:37.884 --> 46:39.843
- Not quite.
- Are you at a bar?

46:39.927 --> 46:43.054
I had to gas up the car.
My fault O'Malley's is on the way?

46:43.139 --> 46:46.057
- So ask me how my day was.
- How was your day?

46:46.142 --> 46:47.934
It was better than yours, slacker,

46:48.019 --> 46:50.770
cos I know where Carlos and his brother
have been hanging out.

46:50.855 --> 46:53.940
- At a local club called the Mayan.
- You got your lead. Congrats.

46:54.025 --> 46:55.859
We stake this place out,
they show up,

46:55.943 --> 46:58.487
then we take these Santa Muerte
no-dicks down for good.

46:58.571 --> 47:00.489
How about I get steaks and beer
and we celebrate?

47:00.573 --> 47:05.285
There's nothing to celebrate just yet,
but I have a good feeling about this one.

47:05.369 --> 47:08.955
- Now get your ass moving, I'm starving.
- On my way.

47:10.416 --> 47:12.209
Thanks for the Cuervo, Stud.

47:13.252 --> 47:15.837
No problem.
I heard what happened.

47:17.840 --> 47:20.425
Fuck those IA rats.

47:20.510 --> 47:23.094
And your boss.

47:23.179 --> 47:26.765
She's the reason I'm here.
Unpaid leave.

47:26.849 --> 47:30.018
Why? For doing my fucking job.

47:30.102 --> 47:32.687
That bitch put handcuffs on me,

47:32.772 --> 47:36.066
then that no-nuts McCourt
parades me around that station

47:36.150 --> 47:37.859
like I'm a goddamn carnival prize.

47:37.944 --> 47:39.945
Well, they can both go fuck the dog.

47:40.029 --> 47:43.073
They think I'm gonna cop a plea,
they're both cracking walnuts up their ass.

47:43.157 --> 47:45.659
I'm gonna fight this thing
to my last damn dime.

47:46.536 --> 47:50.163
You need some extra cash
for those lawyers...

47:51.207 --> 47:54.543
- I might have a job for you.
- Really?

47:54.627 --> 47:57.128
- What would that be?
- Looking into someone.

47:57.213 --> 47:59.130
- Who?
- Guy I work with.

48:00.174 --> 48:02.133
- Interested?
- I don't know if I should be,

48:02.218 --> 48:04.511
considering who's sitting
in front of me making the offer.

48:04.595 --> 48:07.222
What are you talking about?
Have I ever fucked you over?

48:07.306 --> 48:11.059
No, but LaGuerta just taught me
there's always a first time.

48:11.143 --> 48:12.644
Look, Quinn...

48:12.728 --> 48:14.604
you fuck with the bull...

48:14.689 --> 48:16.773
you get the horn.

48:16.857 --> 48:19.943
- You understand?
- Yeah. Do you?

48:28.911 --> 48:31.830
- You got a name?
- Dexter Morgan.

48:31.914 --> 48:33.707
Dexter.

48:34.834 --> 48:36.876
What the fuck kind of name is Dexter?

48:43.301 --> 48:45.760
Rainbows are an illusion -

48:45.845 --> 48:48.888
refracted light to make us think
something's there

48:48.973 --> 48:50.515
when it's really not.

48:50.600 --> 48:52.517
Is there darkness in Harrison?

48:53.394 --> 48:56.646
Or is it just my own fear
being reflected back?

48:59.609 --> 49:02.694
I just know he's the one who scratched Teddy. He was right
next to him.

49:02.778 --> 49:05.322
Did you read about
what happened to his mother?

49:05.406 --> 49:07.282
That boy will never be the same.

49:07.366 --> 49:10.368
There's nothing wrong with my son.

49:18.419 --> 49:20.712
I'm sorry for ever thinking
the worst, Harrison.

49:22.590 --> 49:23.965
You'll always be my son.

49:24.050 --> 49:27.510
Whatever we have to face,
we'll face together, OK?

49:29.555 --> 49:30.972
Ow!

49:32.099 --> 49:36.227
Hello, ma'am. Where you headed
this afternoon? You need a cab?

49:46.197 --> 49:48.031
Welcome to Miami.
