00:06.005 --> 00:12.079
FaceTime with British Models 24/7
www. saucytime. com

00:12.393 --> 00:14.310
So, how the hell was your date
with Rita last night?

00:14.436 --> 00:15.269
Great.

00:15.396 --> 00:17.271
I think I met the right woman for me.

00:17.398 --> 00:20.692
She's perfect, because Rita
is as damaged as me.

00:21.902 --> 00:25.863
I can't believe I found the one good,
truly decent man left on the planet.

00:27.074 --> 00:30.201
- I have a dark side too.
- Somehow I doubt that.

00:31.537 --> 00:34.288
I watched my mother die
when I was three.

00:34.415 --> 00:37.291
She was murdered in front of me.

00:37.418 --> 00:40.503
You have your demons, but I know that
you don't have to be a slave to them.

00:40.629 --> 00:41.754
I wish that were true.

00:41.880 --> 00:45.425
I want to someday be content,
like everyone else.

00:45.551 --> 00:47.510
- I want...
- A normal life.

00:47.636 --> 00:49.762
- I wanna marry you.
- Yes!

00:49.888 --> 00:51.723
You guys are my family.

00:51.849 --> 00:55.184
Now I have a partner for life.
I'm content.

00:55.769 --> 00:57.437
Maybe even happy.

00:58.063 --> 01:01.274
I hope you're not taking
any of this seriously - the wife, the kids.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.442
It's all great camouflage.

01:02.568 --> 01:04.235
It's gotten more
complicated than that.

01:04.361 --> 01:06.237
I'm pregnant.

01:06.363 --> 01:08.281
You want to see him
come into the world.

01:08.407 --> 01:12.201
- Yes. Raise him with Rita.
- I know.

01:12.327 --> 01:14.579
I've never wanted anything
so much in my life.

01:14.705 --> 01:18.040
Wanna know a secret?
Daddy kills people.

01:22.463 --> 01:24.505
There's a monster walking around free.

01:24.631 --> 01:27.800
I call him the Trinity Killer.
Kills in threes.

01:28.427 --> 01:31.637
Trinity's a husband, a father.

01:31.764 --> 01:33.347
He's... like me.

01:33.474 --> 01:36.350
What kind of father
keeps blood slides in his shed?

01:36.477 --> 01:40.897
If I don't figure out how to hide this,
I'm gonna lose my family.

01:41.023 --> 01:43.733
Arthur's kept this up
for, what, 20 years?

01:43.859 --> 01:46.027
My family may not last 20 minutes.

01:46.153 --> 01:47.779
Arthur Mitchell.

01:47.905 --> 01:48.863
Kyle Butler.

01:48.989 --> 01:52.450
Only way it was gonna work
is if I jumped in with both feet.

01:52.576 --> 01:54.410
Jump in with both feet, huh?

01:55.078 --> 01:57.705
This is your new role model, Dex?

01:57.831 --> 01:59.791
Get that axe from him.
Kill him now.

01:59.917 --> 02:02.376
I still have things to learn from him.

02:03.003 --> 02:04.962
You're juggling
too many people, Dexter.

02:05.088 --> 02:07.965
Blood tech, husband, father,
serial killer.

02:08.091 --> 02:09.884
Now Kyle Butler. Which one are you?

02:10.010 --> 02:11.010
All of them.

02:11.136 --> 02:12.345
Hello...

02:12.471 --> 02:13.930
Dexter Morgan.

02:16.391 --> 02:17.809
Hello, Arthur Mitchell.

02:20.437 --> 02:22.855
Hey, sweetie.
The moon tonight is gonna be amazing.

02:22.981 --> 02:25.858
So take a moment.
We love you. Bye.

02:38.330 --> 02:39.956
Rita?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.544
Born in blood. Both of us.

02:45.671 --> 02:47.588
I thought I could change what I am,

02:47.714 --> 02:50.049
keep my family safe.

02:51.093 --> 02:53.094
But it doesn't matter what I do.

02:54.638 --> 02:56.138
This is fate.

05:13.193 --> 05:14.860
Sir, did you call this in?

05:17.364 --> 05:19.740
Sir. What happened here?

05:23.745 --> 05:26.163
I've watched 67 people die,

05:26.289 --> 05:29.709
and at the moment of truth,
I looked into their eyes

05:29.835 --> 05:31.794
and they knew and I knew

05:31.920 --> 05:34.380
they got what they deserved.

05:34.506 --> 05:37.299
But what if that's not
what happens?

05:37.426 --> 05:40.011
If you don't get what you deserve?

05:40.137 --> 05:42.722
If what you deserve
is a white picket fence

05:42.848 --> 05:45.599
and your kids all around

05:45.726 --> 05:48.477
and a husband who loves you?

05:48.603 --> 05:50.980
What if the least you deserve
is a real human being

05:51.106 --> 05:55.192
and what you get instead... is me?

05:56.153 --> 06:00.114
Sir. Sir, we're going to take
the child into safe custody now.

06:00.240 --> 06:03.242
- Sir, hand me the child.
- What are you doing?

06:03.368 --> 06:04.285
- Back off!
- Ma'am!

06:04.411 --> 06:07.705
Miami Homicide. He is too.
I said back the fuck off!

06:07.831 --> 06:09.623
What happened?

06:13.712 --> 06:15.004
Jesus.

06:19.634 --> 06:21.635
Rita's inside.

06:21.762 --> 06:24.138
It was me.

06:31.313 --> 06:33.981
Skin's wrinkled from hours
in the alkaline water.

06:34.107 --> 06:35.816
Rigor mortis full-blown.

06:35.942 --> 06:38.569
Epidermal mottling.

06:38.695 --> 06:42.364
I imagined her naked plenty of times,
but never like this.

06:45.243 --> 06:48.245
Single cut to the femoral artery.
We're looking at Trinity's MO here.

06:48.371 --> 06:50.915
Did he ever kill a married woman
in a bathtub?

06:51.041 --> 06:53.292
First time for everything.

06:53.418 --> 06:55.336
Unfortunately for Dexter.

06:59.257 --> 07:02.259
We're still waiting on the coroner
to move the body.

07:02.385 --> 07:04.386
But overall lividity
puts time of death

07:04.513 --> 07:08.432
somewhere between
eight and twelve hours... ago.

07:18.151 --> 07:19.360
You OK?

07:27.911 --> 07:29.662
Dexter came home to that.

07:30.330 --> 07:32.873
He's gonna need our support here.

07:33.834 --> 07:35.543
Obviously.

07:35.669 --> 07:38.587
What do you want us
to do with him?

07:38.713 --> 07:41.298
The first thing I want you to do
is pack up and get out of there.

07:43.051 --> 07:44.343
- Well...
- What?

07:44.469 --> 07:46.512
The FBI's here. Trinity is their case.

07:46.638 --> 07:48.097
I already ceded jurisdiction.

07:48.223 --> 07:49.890
What are you looking at him for?

07:50.016 --> 07:52.518
It's what I was saying
on the way over.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.729
Rita's one of ours. She's family.

07:55.856 --> 07:57.857
We should be working
on this for Dexter.

07:57.983 --> 08:00.067
Damn it, Angel, it's done!

08:00.193 --> 08:02.194
Just do what I say.

08:02.904 --> 08:05.156
She's stressed. We all are.

08:25.969 --> 08:29.054
My father Harry
taught me a few simple rules.

08:29.181 --> 08:32.433
NeÎ½er hurt an innocent
and never make a scene.

08:35.854 --> 08:37.563
Harry?

08:40.650 --> 08:44.195
Where are you, now,
when I really need you?

08:46.615 --> 08:49.575
When it's my wife in the body bag,
everybody's looking,

08:49.701 --> 08:51.493
and it's the neighbour crying, not me?

09:02.547 --> 09:03.923
Sir?

09:05.967 --> 09:07.843
We're ready for you.

09:12.933 --> 09:16.227
The first responders told me when they
went inside and found your wife

09:16.353 --> 09:18.604
you said, "It was me."

09:20.315 --> 09:21.523
You sure?

09:21.650 --> 09:23.901
That's what was reported to me, yeah.

09:26.446 --> 09:29.406
I don't know what I said. It could have
been anything. I'm very upset.

09:29.532 --> 09:32.409
Of course you are.
Who wouldn't be?

09:32.535 --> 09:36.080
Mr Morgan, before you came home
and found your wife,

09:36.206 --> 09:37.623
where did you say you were again?

09:37.749 --> 09:39.291
Dexter, take off your clothes,
then we're going home.

09:39.417 --> 09:40.626
I was asking him a question.

09:40.752 --> 09:42.419
He already said he came home
and he found her there.

09:42.545 --> 09:44.838
If you wanna help,
why don't you find Trinity?

09:44.965 --> 09:47.883
Or is doing something actually useful
not in your fucking job description?

09:48.009 --> 09:49.260
Detective Morgan.

09:49.386 --> 09:51.845
FBI?
Fucking Bunch of Idiots.

09:51.972 --> 09:53.555
Stop.

09:53.682 --> 09:56.225
Finish up here,
then take your brother home.

09:56.351 --> 09:59.812
You wanna talk to Dexter,
schedule an appointment.

09:59.938 --> 10:01.855
I'll do that.

10:19.291 --> 10:20.582
He can sleep on the floor

10:20.709 --> 10:23.627
until we can bring his crib
over from the house.

10:23.753 --> 10:26.547
- It'll be safest, don't you think?
- Yeah.

10:27.299 --> 10:31.051
I gotta tell you, Dexter,
don't say things like, "It was me."

10:31.177 --> 10:33.220
People will misunderstand.

10:34.139 --> 10:37.266
In fact, I don't understand.
What did you even mean?

10:45.650 --> 10:47.192
Dexter.

10:48.194 --> 10:51.280
This is Dexter Morgan.
3319 Meadow Lane.

10:51.406 --> 10:52.698
What is your emergency?

10:52.824 --> 10:56.035
I just got home and found
my wife dead in the bathtub.

10:57.829 --> 11:00.622
- What is this?
- The 911 call Dexter made.

11:00.749 --> 11:02.416
Listen.

11:02.542 --> 11:05.586
I just got home and found
my wife dead in the bathtub.

11:05.712 --> 11:08.130
- Did you say your wife is dead?
- Yes, I did.

11:08.256 --> 11:10.049
She has an approximately
one-inch incision

11:10.175 --> 11:13.052
midway up her right thigh,
dissecting the femoral artery.

11:13.178 --> 11:15.971
All right. That's enough.
He obviously is in shock.

11:16.097 --> 11:19.141
"Midway up her right thigh"?
"Dissecting her femoral artery"?

11:19.267 --> 11:22.102
- Habit of precision.
- His wife just died.

11:22.228 --> 11:24.271
He's submitting a lab report.

11:24.397 --> 11:27.441
Seriously, the next-door neighbour,
the guy with the, you know, forehead?

11:27.567 --> 11:30.152
He was more broken up about Rita
than Dexter was.

11:30.278 --> 11:32.863
- So?
- So it's weird, that's all.

11:35.658 --> 11:37.785
- What are we working on here?
- Not Rita.

11:39.954 --> 11:41.914
It's Dexter's 911 call.

11:42.874 --> 11:44.124
Did you hear me or not?

11:44.250 --> 11:47.461
I said the case is with the FBI now.

11:51.091 --> 11:53.133
You should have taken her
on a honeymoon.

11:59.057 --> 12:00.349
You were right about one thing -

12:00.475 --> 12:02.976
that neighbour Elliot
being all broken up about Rita.

12:03.103 --> 12:07.439
I'm thinking now there's some things
I shouldn't have told Dexter.

12:07.565 --> 12:11.026
What? What shouldn't you
have told him?

12:11.152 --> 12:13.195
About a significant exchange of saliva

12:13.321 --> 12:16.281
I witnessed at Thanksgiving.

12:16.408 --> 12:19.118
- As in a kiss.
- Elliot and Rita?

12:19.244 --> 12:22.246
Dude was totally
in love with her.

12:22.372 --> 12:24.289
- And Dexter knew?
- Yeah.

12:24.416 --> 12:26.667
If I'd known she was gonna...

12:29.546 --> 12:31.672
I should have kept
my big mouth shut.

12:45.103 --> 12:47.563
Could someone get that? Deb?

12:49.399 --> 12:50.649
Damn it.

12:54.154 --> 12:55.946
Hello.

12:56.072 --> 12:57.990
Dexter, it's Maura.

12:59.033 --> 13:00.200
Hello?

13:00.326 --> 13:04.538
I'm sorry if I woke you,
but I have got two very excited kids here,

13:04.664 --> 13:06.623
and Rita's not answering.

13:06.749 --> 13:09.376
Yeah, there's something
you need to know.

13:09.502 --> 13:10.711
OK. OK, OK.

13:10.837 --> 13:13.964
But first somebody really
wants to talk with you.

13:15.133 --> 13:16.717
Dexter!

13:17.677 --> 13:19.303
Hey, Cody, you OK?

13:19.429 --> 13:23.891
We've been having the best day.
I had cotton candy for breakfast.

13:24.017 --> 13:25.267
That's great.

13:25.393 --> 13:27.394
Here, give me the phone.
Gimme, gimme.

13:27.979 --> 13:29.980
Hi, Dexter. Can I talk to Mom?

13:30.773 --> 13:32.774
- Not now.
- Why not?

13:33.651 --> 13:35.444
She's, uh...

13:35.570 --> 13:37.196
She's in the shower.

13:37.322 --> 13:40.199
Well, can you tell her we miss her?

13:40.783 --> 13:43.368
We miss you too, Dexter,
and Harrison.

13:43.495 --> 13:45.496
Here's my grandmother.

13:45.622 --> 13:49.708
So, there was something
that you needed to tell me?

13:50.835 --> 13:53.462
When you bring them home tonight, uh...

13:53.588 --> 13:58.091
come to Deb's apartment
instead of the house, OK?

13:58.218 --> 14:01.220
What happened,
did you miss your flight?

14:02.222 --> 14:05.891
Something like that.
I'll explain when you get here.

14:11.231 --> 14:13.815
You sure you don't want
to tell them about Rita?

14:15.443 --> 14:18.403
I just want them to have
one more good day.

14:19.322 --> 14:21.532
Look, I know this is really difficult...

14:23.034 --> 14:26.870
but there are a lot of things that need
to happen before Rita can be buried.

14:29.874 --> 14:33.710
I've been on the phone all morning with
a funeral director who does a lot of cops.

14:35.129 --> 14:37.422
And he's willing to see us right away.

14:39.717 --> 14:41.718
You willing to do that?

14:52.939 --> 14:55.065
I'm sorry for your loss.

14:55.817 --> 14:56.942
How does he do that?

14:57.068 --> 14:59.236
My sincere condolences.

14:59.362 --> 15:01.738
He sounds like he actually means it.

15:03.324 --> 15:04.950
Thank you.

15:06.286 --> 15:10.289
Would you like something
to drink? Coffee?

15:11.291 --> 15:12.916
Water?

15:13.042 --> 15:16.128
No. I'm fine.

15:22.176 --> 15:24.428
There are Kleenexes here...

15:24.554 --> 15:26.847
if you need them.

15:30.643 --> 15:32.894
What we need to do now, Dexter...

15:33.021 --> 15:34.855
May I call you that?

15:36.149 --> 15:38.984
What we need to do now, Dexter,
is make some very important decisions

15:39.110 --> 15:42.112
about how your wife Rita
will be remembered.

15:43.156 --> 15:44.531
OK.

15:45.658 --> 15:47.409
We like to start with the obituary.

15:47.535 --> 15:49.453
It's a good way to let people
know about services

15:49.579 --> 15:51.371
and where to send remembrances.

15:51.497 --> 15:53.290
But most importantly,
it's a chance to express

15:53.416 --> 15:55.417
your feelings about Rita
in your own words.

15:56.252 --> 15:57.377
Excuse me.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.052
I'll get you something for the paper.

16:05.178 --> 16:07.220
What else do you need?

16:17.315 --> 16:19.441
So this is how normal people do it.

16:19.567 --> 16:22.611
No hefty bags. No diesel fumes.

16:28.034 --> 16:30.243
This is what she would have wanted -

16:30.370 --> 16:32.454
a grieving spouse...

16:33.456 --> 16:36.166
for once doing what
a person's supposed to do.

16:53.976 --> 16:56.895
- Dexter Morgan?
- Rita?

16:57.021 --> 16:58.397
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:59.649 --> 17:01.024
Sorry I'm late.

17:01.150 --> 17:04.695
- That's no problem.
- There was traffic, of course.

17:06.155 --> 17:10.158
I went to the wrong cafÃ©.
I went to the one in town.

17:10.284 --> 17:12.327
I didn't know there was
anything even out this far.

17:12.453 --> 17:14.162
How did you find this place?

17:14.288 --> 17:16.832
I, uh... tracked it down.

17:22.672 --> 17:24.715
So, I... Your sister...

17:24.841 --> 17:26.550
Debra's told me so much about you.

17:26.676 --> 17:28.552
- Uh-oh.
- Oh.

17:28.678 --> 17:30.512
Nothing bad, of course.

17:30.638 --> 17:33.306
She omitted the fact
that I'm an axe murderer?

17:33.433 --> 17:35.892
No. She said that you were a...

17:36.018 --> 17:38.311
bloodstain pattern analyst.

17:38.438 --> 17:40.272
Which I have no clue what that is.

17:40.398 --> 17:43.442
Believe me, I barely do either,
and I do it 40 hours a week.

17:46.779 --> 17:48.613
She seems nice, your sister.

17:49.574 --> 17:51.783
You seem nice too.

17:53.244 --> 17:54.578
Thank you.

17:57.874 --> 17:59.249
So, um, what's good here?

17:59.375 --> 18:03.378
There must be something special
to bring you all the way out this far.

18:04.005 --> 18:07.424
I... I usually play it safe

18:07.550 --> 18:09.843
and go with a Caesar salad.

18:09.969 --> 18:12.262
But I don't see one on here.

18:12.388 --> 18:15.474
You know, I think
I'm gonna get the special,

18:15.600 --> 18:17.017
the mushroom ravioli.

18:17.518 --> 18:18.810
Dexter?

18:21.230 --> 18:23.774
- Do you know what you want?
- Yes, I do.

18:35.703 --> 18:37.120
Dex.

18:37.914 --> 18:39.956
What are you doing?

18:40.082 --> 18:43.460
I was just thinking about Rita,
how much...

18:45.505 --> 18:47.839
How much you miss her?

18:47.965 --> 18:50.217
How much I lied to her,
from the very beginning.

18:57.391 --> 19:00.185
Funeral's the day after tomorrow.

19:00.311 --> 19:03.522
I chose an oak casket.
I hope that's all right.

19:03.648 --> 19:06.358
White roses.
I think she'd like those.

19:07.235 --> 19:09.319
They want to know
if there's a particular dress

19:09.445 --> 19:11.363
you'd like her to be buried in.

19:12.657 --> 19:14.282
Not really.

19:15.576 --> 19:16.952
OK.

19:17.703 --> 19:19.579
I'll find something.

19:20.832 --> 19:24.251
Quinn called, and the FBI has released
the crime scene at your house,

19:24.377 --> 19:27.587
so there are some things
I want to do there and...

19:27.713 --> 19:31.258
I'm gonna drop you two off
at the apartment. Is that OK?

19:31.384 --> 19:32.676
Yeah, that's fine.

19:35.930 --> 19:37.931
You're worrying me.

20:06.460 --> 20:08.753
I really didn't expect you to come.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.715
We're partners. I'm here.

20:11.841 --> 20:13.925
What are we looking for?

20:14.051 --> 20:15.969
Nothing.

20:16.095 --> 20:19.055
Trinity wouldn't leave
anything behind.

20:19.181 --> 20:21.308
What are we doing, then?

20:28.983 --> 20:31.651
I wanted to clean the place up.

20:32.653 --> 20:35.322
Make sure Dexter
didn't see it like this.

20:35.448 --> 20:38.366
The FBI left it this way.

20:38.492 --> 20:40.994
They have people who'll do that.

21:36.550 --> 21:38.760
This much blood,
usually you call Dexter.

21:42.264 --> 21:43.974
How you holdin' up?

21:48.437 --> 21:50.522
OK. I guess.

21:53.234 --> 21:55.860
I mean, you know my brother.
It's a little hard to tell.

21:55.987 --> 21:58.863
No, I mean you.
How are you holding up?

21:58.990 --> 21:59.990
Oh.

22:03.369 --> 22:04.661
Fine.

22:05.663 --> 22:08.164
Not used to having to be
the strong one, you know?

22:09.500 --> 22:11.418
It's always been Dexter.

22:13.170 --> 22:15.880
- And now...
- He's the strong one?

22:16.007 --> 22:19.342
To me it's always seemed
the other way around.

22:22.680 --> 22:26.891
Swear to God, I can't even
tell what he's thinking.

22:27.018 --> 22:29.728
Sorry. I didn't mean
to make things worse.

22:31.147 --> 22:32.981
It's OK.

22:37.028 --> 22:39.863
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

23:00.176 --> 23:02.594
Open the door! Come on!

23:02.720 --> 23:05.221
Hurry, come on, open up! Dexter!

23:06.766 --> 23:09.768
Are you there?
Open the door!

23:12.271 --> 23:14.314
Dexter, you came back early!

23:15.483 --> 23:17.233
Hey, guys. Did you have fun?

23:17.359 --> 23:19.778
- It was awesome.
- We got you stuff.

23:22.448 --> 23:25.408
- Perfect.
- There's one for Mom too.

23:31.874 --> 23:33.583
Where is she?

23:33.709 --> 23:35.627
She's not here.

23:36.796 --> 23:39.255
Well, where is she?

23:39.381 --> 23:41.007
Just... sit down.

23:41.133 --> 23:43.760
I need to tell you something.

23:45.971 --> 23:47.639
Dexter?

23:48.724 --> 23:50.767
Is everything OK?

23:50.893 --> 23:53.603
What's going on?
You're... You're freaking me out.

23:55.981 --> 23:58.942
Something happened to your mom.

23:59.068 --> 24:00.693
Something bad?

24:06.408 --> 24:08.284
Yeah. Something bad.

24:09.537 --> 24:10.829
Is she OK?

24:12.581 --> 24:15.291
A man came into our house,

24:15.417 --> 24:17.043
and your mother came home

24:17.169 --> 24:18.753
and he killed her.

24:18.879 --> 24:20.463
What?
She got killed?

24:20.589 --> 24:22.132
- Somebody killed her?
- No, she's fine.

24:22.258 --> 24:23.716
Dexter. What...

24:23.843 --> 24:26.511
You're kidding, right?
I don't understand.

24:26.637 --> 24:29.013
You said spend the day
at Disney World.

24:35.396 --> 24:37.313
I'm sorry for your loss.

24:56.083 --> 24:57.834
- Astor?
- Go away.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.044
I mean it! Leave me alone!

25:00.171 --> 25:02.589
Just listen to me.
Everything's gonna be OK.

25:02.715 --> 25:05.842
It won't be. She's dead!

25:06.844 --> 25:08.761
I know.

25:08.888 --> 25:10.430
And it doesn't even matter to you.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.768
- How can you say that?
- Cos it doesn't.

25:15.895 --> 25:18.354
I can tell just by looking
you don't even care.

25:21.775 --> 25:23.651
Where were you?

25:23.777 --> 25:26.905
Where were you
when someone was killing her?

25:27.781 --> 25:31.034
You should have been there
to protect her.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.285
You're right.

25:32.411 --> 25:35.121
- That was your job!
- I know.

25:37.249 --> 25:41.252
I should have been there, and I wish
I could take it all back. I wish...

25:41.378 --> 25:44.297
that none of this had ever happened
and your mom was still alive.

25:44.423 --> 25:46.674
Wanna know what I wish?

25:46.800 --> 25:50.887
That it was just my mom
and me and Cody and Harrison.

25:51.013 --> 25:54.974
Cos we all would have been
so much better off if she hadn't met you!

25:56.185 --> 25:58.478
I wish you were dead!

26:22.253 --> 26:24.337
- Do you mind?
- What?

26:24.463 --> 26:26.756
Look somewhere else.

26:39.645 --> 26:41.896
What are you doing?

26:42.022 --> 26:44.607
Jesus, Quinn, you can't
grab a sheet or something?

26:44.733 --> 26:46.109
Sorry.

26:46.235 --> 26:48.444
So, what are you doing?

26:48.570 --> 26:50.488
Trying to find a dress for Rita.

26:50.614 --> 26:51.990
You gonna bury her in one of those?

26:52.116 --> 26:53.992
You got something better?

26:59.164 --> 27:02.583
Great. I gotta go.
I gotta go home now.

27:03.460 --> 27:06.004
You might wanna
put some pants on there.

27:08.132 --> 27:10.133
You wanna talk about it,
or are you just gonna act weird?

27:10.259 --> 27:13.177
- There's nothing to talk about.
- OK.

27:13.304 --> 27:15.722
I mean, you show up here,

27:15.848 --> 27:17.890
which I didn't even ask you to do, so...

27:18.017 --> 27:19.767
Yeah. To help.

27:19.893 --> 27:21.269
Is that what you call it?

27:21.395 --> 27:23.187
Morgan.

27:39.371 --> 27:41.205
Elliot?

27:41.332 --> 27:43.875
- That's your name, right?
- Yeah.

27:44.001 --> 27:46.753
Hi. Quinn. Metro Homicide.

27:46.879 --> 27:47.962
Hey.

27:48.088 --> 27:49.797
You have kids, I take it.

27:49.923 --> 27:52.550
Yeah. They're with their mother.

27:53.427 --> 27:55.219
We're divorced.

27:55.346 --> 27:59.807
Plus, it just seemed better for them
to get away after what happened next door.

28:01.810 --> 28:06.105
Um... you know, I already talked to the FBI.
I told them I didn't see anything.

28:06.231 --> 28:07.857
What did you need?

28:08.400 --> 28:10.860
How well did you know Rita?

28:11.945 --> 28:13.988
I don't know, you know.
We were neighbours.

28:14.740 --> 28:17.158
Yeah. I just couldn't help but notice

28:17.284 --> 28:19.535
how torn up you were
about her the other night.

28:23.082 --> 28:26.084
She was a friend, you know?
It was upsetting.

28:26.794 --> 28:28.169
A friend.

28:29.213 --> 28:31.839
I, uh, was told she might
have been more.

28:33.008 --> 28:35.802
Christ. All right, look,
I don't know what you've heard,

28:35.928 --> 28:37.845
but just so you understand
the actual facts,

28:37.971 --> 28:40.056
all Rita and I ever did
was kiss... once.

28:40.182 --> 28:41.682
That was it. It was nothing.

28:41.809 --> 28:43.643
Her husband was never around.

28:45.187 --> 28:48.523
Anyway, Dexter found out about
the indiscretion and, uh...

28:48.649 --> 28:51.067
came over and punched me out.

28:52.194 --> 28:53.611
Huh.

29:02.121 --> 29:03.538
- Dexter.
- Shhh.

29:03.664 --> 29:05.248
He's sleeping.

29:10.462 --> 29:13.005
Brought some dresses
for you to look at.

29:17.553 --> 29:20.012
Where are Astor and Cody?

29:20.139 --> 29:22.890
At a hotel with their grandparents.

29:23.016 --> 29:25.184
How'd it go talking with them?

29:27.438 --> 29:29.480
Astor's upset.

29:30.524 --> 29:32.150
They got me a hat.

29:32.693 --> 29:34.402
She'll be OK.

29:35.654 --> 29:38.781
I don't see how.
Her mother's dead because of me.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.533
No, she's not.

29:42.161 --> 29:44.537
She's dead because of Trinity.

29:44.663 --> 29:47.748
I know you keep blaming yourself,
but you can't.

29:47.875 --> 29:50.084
There's nothing you could
have done differently.

29:50.878 --> 29:53.838
I could have killed Arthur Mitchell
the first chance I got.

29:53.964 --> 29:55.882
You loved Rita.

29:57.259 --> 30:00.761
You never would have let
anything hurt her.

30:00.888 --> 30:02.597
She was lucky to have you.

30:02.723 --> 30:05.558
She told me that all the time.

30:06.518 --> 30:09.645
How lucky she felt
to have found you.

30:27.414 --> 30:30.833
I was wondering what you were doing,
sitting here by yourself for so long.

30:30.959 --> 30:32.460
Now I see.

30:34.838 --> 30:36.339
I paid her to say that.

30:38.091 --> 30:39.550
You did?

30:39.676 --> 30:41.928
No, I was... just kidding.

30:42.054 --> 30:43.596
Me too.

30:46.767 --> 30:51.020
So what does a blood spatter analyst
do anyway?

30:53.232 --> 30:54.690
Excuse me.

31:11.250 --> 31:13.543
Is this yours?

31:13.669 --> 31:15.419
What's the deal here?

31:28.517 --> 31:29.725
I have to go.

31:29.851 --> 31:31.477
Is everything OK?

31:31.603 --> 31:33.980
It's a stomach bug.
It's going around the station.

31:34.106 --> 31:35.398
I'm really sorry.

31:35.524 --> 31:38.276
It was nice meeting you.

31:48.161 --> 31:51.163
Lucky to have me.
I wouldn't say so.

31:51.290 --> 31:54.250
She trusted me,
and now she's dead.

32:03.552 --> 32:06.178
Like your sister says, I'm toxic.

32:08.390 --> 32:10.474
You'd all be better off without me.

32:31.997 --> 32:35.249
Delete the past. Leave nothing behind.

32:44.009 --> 32:45.134
You're up early.

32:48.555 --> 32:50.514
What are you doing over there
that's so important?

32:50.641 --> 32:52.892
Getting rid of every trace of me.

32:53.018 --> 32:55.144
- Nothing.
- Dexter...

33:01.818 --> 33:04.987
Look, I know this is tough to talk about,
but the funeral's tomorrow,

33:05.113 --> 33:07.698
and there's still a lot of stuff
you have to do.

33:07.824 --> 33:09.367
Like sign the coroner's release.

33:09.493 --> 33:11.410
I need to grab my tools.

33:11.536 --> 33:13.204
And go over the guest list
one more time.

33:13.330 --> 33:14.622
And torch the container.

33:14.748 --> 33:16.290
And the eulogy, Dexter.

33:16.416 --> 33:19.418
I can't do that for you.
That really has to come from you.

33:19.544 --> 33:22.797
I need to top off my boat.
I'm low on fuel.

33:23.590 --> 33:25.007
Yeah.

33:25.133 --> 33:27.051
And the FBI interview,

33:27.177 --> 33:31.555
or the debriefing or whatever they're
calling it - that's really important.

33:31.682 --> 33:34.225
They're total dicks
for wanting to do it today,

33:34.351 --> 33:38.396
but maybe you're better offjust
going in there and getting it over with.

33:40.482 --> 33:42.358
You sure you don't want me
to come with you?

33:44.903 --> 33:46.612
No. I'm fine.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.617
All right. I'm off.

33:55.247 --> 33:56.872
I've been thinking about Harrison.

33:59.876 --> 34:01.544
How he needs his mother.

34:02.421 --> 34:04.839
Someone decent in his life.

34:04.965 --> 34:07.883
You've done everything for me.

34:08.009 --> 34:10.052
Not just now. My whole life.

34:10.178 --> 34:12.054
But...

34:12.180 --> 34:15.474
I need to ask you
this one more favour.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.436
That that person be you.

34:20.439 --> 34:21.689
That you...

34:23.400 --> 34:25.067
love him...

34:26.361 --> 34:28.404
as if he were your own.

34:33.410 --> 34:35.077
He is my own.

34:36.538 --> 34:39.874
And he has me in his life.
Of course he does.

34:43.003 --> 34:45.421
But more importantly, he has you.

34:47.924 --> 34:50.384
You're decent and good.

34:51.970 --> 34:53.471
I'm not.

34:56.892 --> 35:01.520
You are.

35:37.140 --> 35:39.099
What's her mood?

35:42.312 --> 35:43.437
How would I know?

35:43.563 --> 35:47.525
I don't know, there's this rumour floating
around the two of you are married.

35:48.819 --> 35:51.779
Look, I just need to talk to her
about something.

35:51.905 --> 35:54.406
I was wondering
if this is a good time.

35:55.408 --> 35:57.451
Just remember...

35:57.577 --> 35:59.995
she's the boss.

36:00.121 --> 36:01.914
All right.

36:03.875 --> 36:06.502
No. No further comment.

36:09.464 --> 36:12.383
"Serial killer murders cop's wife."

36:12.509 --> 36:15.261
The press won't let up.
They want all the gory details.

36:15.387 --> 36:18.264
- So what do you tell them?
- Same thing I told you.

36:18.390 --> 36:20.933
It's not our case.

36:21.059 --> 36:22.685
So, what can I do for you?

36:22.811 --> 36:25.980
There's, uh, something
I think you should know,

36:26.106 --> 36:27.773
having to do with Rita.

36:29.860 --> 36:30.943
OK.

36:31.069 --> 36:33.487
And Elliot,
the next-door neighbour.

36:33.613 --> 36:35.614
I was at the house with Debra...

36:35.740 --> 36:38.450
Detective Morgan,
cleaning up.

36:39.494 --> 36:42.288
And this Elliot and I
struck up conversation.

36:43.123 --> 36:47.001
Turns out he and Rita had like a...

36:47.127 --> 36:48.586
mini-fling.

36:48.712 --> 36:50.921
What's that mean exactly?

36:51.047 --> 36:53.799
Well, nothing really happened.

36:53.925 --> 36:56.886
But apparently,
Dexter found out about it.

36:58.054 --> 37:00.639
Why are you telling me this?

37:00.765 --> 37:03.475
What are you implying?

37:03.602 --> 37:05.102
I'm not implying anything.

37:05.228 --> 37:07.313
And what are you doing
interviewing witnesses?

37:07.439 --> 37:09.106
I wasn't interviewing. I was there...

37:09.232 --> 37:11.650
What, cleaning? Please.

37:11.776 --> 37:15.321
Look, if this were anyone but Dexter,

37:15.447 --> 37:17.865
we'd at least be thinking
like detectives.

37:17.991 --> 37:20.993
Which means what?
What do you always say?

37:21.119 --> 37:25.289
When the wife is dead,
90% of the time the husband did it.

37:29.711 --> 37:31.378
LaGuerta.

37:32.297 --> 37:35.299
Um... Hang on for a second.
I need to take this.

37:35.425 --> 37:37.259
We'll finish later.

37:42.974 --> 37:45.434
OK. Can you repeat that?

37:59.783 --> 38:00.699
Yeah.

38:00.825 --> 38:03.535
I just got a call from the FBI
about your brother's interview.

38:03.662 --> 38:05.204
Don't tell me. What'd he say?

38:05.330 --> 38:06.789
Nothing. He didn't show.

38:06.915 --> 38:09.416
So now they're asking
for his personnel files.

38:09.542 --> 38:13.879
God damn it.
I knew I should have gone with him.

38:14.005 --> 38:14.964
Morgan?

38:15.090 --> 38:16.715
I so did not fucking need this.

38:16.841 --> 38:18.258
Yeah, you and me both.

38:18.385 --> 38:21.428
I'm headed home now. I'll figure out what
happened, and I'll get him down there.

38:21.554 --> 38:23.222
OK.

38:27.560 --> 38:29.186
Dexter?

38:30.855 --> 38:32.648
Who the fuck are you?

38:32.774 --> 38:34.274
Excuse me?

38:34.401 --> 38:36.610
Who the fuck are you?

38:37.654 --> 38:39.571
10-A. Downstairs?

38:40.907 --> 38:42.032
You're the sister, right?

38:42.158 --> 38:44.785
- Yeah, I live here.
- Well, I'll be leaving, then.

38:44.911 --> 38:46.453
He said you would know what to do.

38:46.579 --> 38:48.372
He said what? Don't go.

38:48.498 --> 38:50.708
Wait.

38:55.296 --> 38:56.213
Dexter Morgan.

38:56.339 --> 38:58.590
Please leave a message at the tone.

38:58.717 --> 39:01.760
Guess who I just met.
The fucking cat lady from downstairs.

39:01.886 --> 39:03.637
She was feeding ice cream to your son.

39:03.763 --> 39:05.806
So, I don't know
where the fuck you are

39:05.932 --> 39:08.100
or why you think you can
fucking run away from the FBI,

39:08.226 --> 39:11.395
but you better get back here...

39:11.521 --> 39:13.981
Fuck! Dexter, where are you?

39:18.445 --> 39:20.195
Hope you don't mind
I chose that dress.

39:20.321 --> 39:23.073
You were wearing it when...
we first met.

39:23.199 --> 39:26.869
So I thought since I won't be
at the funeral,

39:26.995 --> 39:29.788
since I don't deserve to be...

39:31.291 --> 39:33.292
Kids'll be fine with Deb.

39:34.711 --> 39:38.714
Way better off without me.
I think we agree about that.

39:41.051 --> 39:43.594
I was never really
honest with you.

39:50.560 --> 39:53.312
I'm a serial killer. That's what I am.

39:57.025 --> 40:01.278
I know I led you to believe
I'm a human being, but I'm not.

40:01.404 --> 40:03.363
That's a lie.

40:18.505 --> 40:22.591
There are only a few things you really need
once you decide to moÎ½e on,

40:22.717 --> 40:24.802
what you'll require
wherever you land.

40:25.887 --> 40:27.262
A fine suit of clothing...

40:35.438 --> 40:37.439
the tools of your trade...

40:42.529 --> 40:46.824
and some token of your past,
a reminder of who you really are.

40:53.540 --> 40:55.415
Everything else...

40:57.961 --> 41:00.045
you just don't need.

41:06.886 --> 41:09.012
So, where are you, Harry?

41:10.140 --> 41:13.809
Speak now,
or forever hold your peace.

41:42.797 --> 41:45.841
I've disappeared so many people.

41:45.967 --> 41:49.553
My turn now...
to disappear myself.

42:04.986 --> 42:07.154
Fucking FBI.

42:12.702 --> 42:14.620
Damn it, Dexter, don't do this.

42:32.847 --> 42:35.807
The sea breeze
has always brought me clarity.

42:36.809 --> 42:38.810
It's hard to get enough oxygen on land.

42:38.937 --> 42:42.189
It's hard to... breathe.

43:07.757 --> 43:08.757
Oh.

43:14.764 --> 43:15.681
Hey, you.

43:15.807 --> 43:17.641
Hey... you.

43:17.767 --> 43:19.685
It's Rita.

43:20.603 --> 43:21.520
Yeah, I know.

43:21.646 --> 43:23.438
I was just checking in.

43:23.564 --> 43:25.732
Wanted to see if you were
feeling better.

43:25.858 --> 43:27.776
Much better.

43:27.902 --> 43:29.194
Glad to hear that.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.446
The way you left
the restaurant so quickly,

43:31.572 --> 43:35.325
I don't know, I felt maybe I...
said something to offend you.

43:35.451 --> 43:37.786
No, you were fine.

43:37.912 --> 43:40.372
Uh, very understanding.

43:42.959 --> 43:45.961
I wasn't completely honest with you.

43:46.087 --> 43:47.004
Um...

43:47.130 --> 43:49.548
You didn't really get stuck in traffic?

43:52.969 --> 43:55.387
I have two kids. Astor and Cody.

43:55.513 --> 43:57.597
They're nine and seven.

43:59.058 --> 44:00.559
I like kids.

44:01.769 --> 44:03.103
You do?

44:03.229 --> 44:06.106
Yeah, they're fun.
Besides, Deb already told me.

44:08.026 --> 44:12.946
And my ex-husband and our... problems?
Did she tell you?

44:13.573 --> 44:14.865
Yeah.

44:16.200 --> 44:18.869
So, you know all about me.

44:19.996 --> 44:21.705
I'd like to know more.

44:24.167 --> 44:25.792
So...

44:25.918 --> 44:29.755
So, maybe we should
get together again sometime.

44:31.382 --> 44:34.801
I would like that. A lot.

44:34.927 --> 44:36.219
A lot.

44:37.055 --> 44:41.516
I know I should hang up right now,
but I just need to say it.

44:43.186 --> 44:46.396
I don't know why exactly, but...

44:46.522 --> 44:49.483
you make me feel good.

44:49.609 --> 44:52.277
Like things could be different.

44:53.363 --> 44:55.030
So do you.

44:55.156 --> 44:59.159
Make me feel that way...
too, I mean.

44:59.285 --> 45:00.619
Glad I called.

45:00.745 --> 45:02.662
I don't know, I felt...

45:02.789 --> 45:05.123
up in the air
the way things ended.

45:05.249 --> 45:09.628
You know, like we never
said a proper goodbye, so...

45:10.254 --> 45:12.089
Goodbye, Rita Bennett.

45:13.383 --> 45:15.384
Goodbye, Dexter Morgan.

45:22.850 --> 45:24.643
Goodbye.

45:27.271 --> 45:29.272
I'm sorry.

46:08.896 --> 46:11.440
Where's the key
to the fucking bathroom?

46:11.566 --> 46:14.192
Or should I just dump out
on the floor?

46:19.532 --> 46:21.032
What's your problem?

46:21.159 --> 46:22.159
Nothing.

46:23.453 --> 46:24.786
Fucking retard.

46:24.912 --> 46:26.746
Get the fuck outta here!

46:26.873 --> 46:29.541
He's right. I should keep moving.

46:38.968 --> 46:40.469
Hey. Hey, hey.

46:42.680 --> 46:43.889
I said...

46:44.015 --> 46:45.932
what the fuck is your problem?

46:47.518 --> 46:49.352
I've had a bad week.

46:49.979 --> 46:51.938
My wife died, and it was my fault.

46:52.982 --> 46:55.942
Well, I'm real sorry
for your fuckin' loss,

46:56.068 --> 46:58.862
but your dead wife
can suck my dick.

47:06.662 --> 47:08.663
I never meant to hurt her.

47:47.537 --> 47:51.581
That's the first human thing
I've seen you do since she died, Dexter.

47:53.376 --> 47:56.169
I thought you'd left me.

47:56.295 --> 47:58.421
I'm here.

48:05.513 --> 48:07.514
It's OK, son...

48:09.141 --> 48:11.393
to show what you're feeling.

48:35.751 --> 48:38.503
They're not better off without you.

48:38.629 --> 48:40.714
You're not better off
without them.

48:42.174 --> 48:44.676
You need to go back.

49:02.528 --> 49:04.863
Deb says
she's sure he'll be here.

49:05.990 --> 49:10.785
Better be. If we don't get going soon,
we'll be burying Rita by candlelight.

49:16.208 --> 49:19.169
So you're not talking to me now?
Is that it?

49:20.338 --> 49:22.422
I have been trying to talk to you.

49:26.427 --> 49:28.219
You're right. You have.

49:30.348 --> 49:33.099
I just need you to understand...

49:33.225 --> 49:34.517
So, tell me.

49:34.644 --> 49:37.187
I could have fought
for this case, but...

49:38.272 --> 49:40.482
part of me didn't want to.

49:41.484 --> 49:45.445
Rita... died.

49:47.156 --> 49:50.283
She died, and it scared me.

49:51.577 --> 49:53.912
We'd been married, what, ten hours?

49:55.581 --> 49:58.041
Dexter was the witness
at our ceremony.

49:58.167 --> 50:01.753
For all I know, he was there
with us while she was...

50:01.879 --> 50:04.089
- being...
- I know.

50:06.050 --> 50:09.010
Well, I didn't want
to be reminded of that.

50:09.762 --> 50:12.180
I didn't want to investigate.

50:13.140 --> 50:14.599
I just wanted...

50:14.725 --> 50:17.602
I just wanted it to be our wedding day.

50:20.147 --> 50:22.107
I don't like it, Angel.

50:22.233 --> 50:25.235
I don't like the way this makes me feel.
I don't know what to do with any of it.

50:25.361 --> 50:26.903
Maria.

50:28.864 --> 50:30.073
What?

50:31.867 --> 50:33.868
No one does.

50:42.086 --> 50:46.297
What's more important
than his own wife's funeral?

50:46.424 --> 50:48.425
People are getting restless.

50:49.093 --> 50:52.429
Thank you for reporting in
with the obvious, Quinn.

50:52.555 --> 50:55.807
Like I'm such a moron
that it's lost on me.

50:57.184 --> 50:59.310
You ever given a eulogy?

50:59.437 --> 51:00.311
No.

51:00.438 --> 51:01.938
Well, I can't do it.

51:02.064 --> 51:04.232
And those agents, those vultures,

51:04.358 --> 51:06.818
are just waiting for him.

51:06.944 --> 51:10.905
Look, there's something
you should probably know.

51:11.031 --> 51:12.449
What?

51:12.575 --> 51:15.577
It's not exactly
an easy thing to say.

51:15.703 --> 51:18.455
The next-door neighbour Elliot,
I spoke to him the other day.

51:18.581 --> 51:21.458
- What the fuck?
- I know I shouldn't have...

51:58.871 --> 52:00.872
She had a big heart.

52:03.501 --> 52:05.543
Big enough for both of us.

52:07.838 --> 52:09.255
Had to be.

52:10.341 --> 52:12.759
I wasn't even human...

52:16.388 --> 52:18.515
when we first met.

52:19.558 --> 52:21.976
I never expected that to change.

52:23.020 --> 52:27.398
She reached out and found something
I didn't even know was there.

52:28.275 --> 52:30.819
She never hurt anybody.

52:31.529 --> 52:33.488
She was innocent.

52:36.367 --> 52:38.701
And she died a brutal death and...

52:39.829 --> 52:41.830
and I can't...

52:44.291 --> 52:46.251
fix it.

52:53.467 --> 52:56.761
But I know I have to try...

53:00.224 --> 53:03.142
here in Miami with the people
who knew her

53:03.269 --> 53:05.270
and who...

53:08.399 --> 53:10.400
who cared about her.

53:12.903 --> 53:14.904
And who loved her.

53:21.871 --> 53:23.872
Like I did.
