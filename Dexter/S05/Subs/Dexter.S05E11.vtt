WEBVTT

00:09.973 --> 00:11.307
Previously on Dexter...

00:11.433 --> 00:12.558
Emily Birch?

00:12.685 --> 00:15.269
Is that her? The one whose blood
Jordan wears round his neck?

00:15.396 --> 00:16.729
Yeah.

00:16.855 --> 00:20.108
It was almost 20 years ago.
He was Eugene Greer.

00:20.984 --> 00:22.527
That's Jordan Chase?

00:23.070 --> 00:26.322
No one could ever take your place.
You know that.

00:27.074 --> 00:29.409
You know, I'm glad you didn't touch
any of them.

00:29.535 --> 00:30.535
Really? Why is that?

00:30.661 --> 00:35.289
Because this DNA test will clear you
and leave you all to me and to her.

00:35.416 --> 00:38.084
The men who hurt you,
they made DVDs of everything they did.

00:38.210 --> 00:39.377
Did everyone watch it?

00:39.503 --> 00:41.879
I managed to get it
out of evidence in time.

00:42.005 --> 00:44.882
You think you can just pay me off
like I'm the corner whore?

00:45.592 --> 00:47.427
Stay the fuck away from Deb!

00:47.553 --> 00:49.512
I trusted you.

00:49.638 --> 00:51.139
And while you were fucking me

00:51.265 --> 00:53.725
you were spreading shit about my brother
behind my back.

00:53.851 --> 00:55.351
Fuck you.

00:55.477 --> 00:57.103
- Who'd you say you were?
- A friend of Joey.

00:57.229 --> 00:59.147
I got to pick up a few things
for a stake-out.

00:59.273 --> 01:01.899
It's for Detective Quinn.
You see his name there.

01:02.025 --> 01:05.862
A strange call came into my office
from an Alex Tilden.

01:05.988 --> 01:09.031
Alex Tilden, 3040.

01:09.158 --> 01:10.158
Here it is.

01:10.284 --> 01:12.618
Look at this. Looks like a partial footprint.

01:12.745 --> 01:14.871
What if the vigilante
is one of their victims?

01:14.997 --> 01:18.666
It's all become so... natural.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.211
- You OK?
- Yes.

01:24.381 --> 01:27.592
But with Lumen,
I'm someone different.

01:27.718 --> 01:31.012
In her eyes,
I'm not a monster at all.

03:40.976 --> 03:44.020
- Detectives.
- We appreciate you fitting us in.

03:44.146 --> 03:47.273
We wanted to thank you for your phone call
regarding Alex Tilden.

03:47.399 --> 03:49.191
- It was really helpful.
- That's good to hear.

03:49.318 --> 03:51.819
We followed up immediately.
We went to his house, but...

03:51.945 --> 03:54.196
- it looked like we'd just missed him.
- That's unfortunate.

03:54.323 --> 03:58.242
Yeah, it is, because he seems to have
disappeared off the face of the earth.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.912
- I see.
- Yeah, like Cole Harmon.

04:01.038 --> 04:04.498
- And Boyd Fowler.
- Yeah, him too.

04:04.625 --> 04:07.752
Now, I keep asking myself,
what's the connection?

04:07.878 --> 04:10.046
What do these three people
have in common?

04:11.256 --> 04:14.550
You. You're what they have
in common. You.

04:14.676 --> 04:15.885
Oh, here it comes.

04:16.637 --> 04:20.973
Why don't you just save us a lot of time
and tell us what that connection is?

04:23.477 --> 04:26.854
It's ridiculous that you think
I have anything to do with this.

04:26.980 --> 04:28.397
I gave you my DNA!

04:28.523 --> 04:32.109
What were the results?
Go on, remind me.

04:32.235 --> 04:35.279
Your DNA wasn't found
on any of the barrel girls.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.531
That's correct,
so all this right here

04:37.658 --> 04:39.825
is a colossal waste
of my time and yours.

04:39.952 --> 04:41.369
Well, I've got nothing but time.

04:41.495 --> 04:45.831
So you can keep fooling everybody
in your little seminars, but I'm onto you.

04:45.958 --> 04:49.377
You're obsessed with me.
That's what this is about.

04:49.503 --> 04:51.128
It happens. You achieve a bit of fame

04:51.254 --> 04:54.548
and people latch on to you
in various twisted ways.

04:54.675 --> 04:55.675
I'd be careful, if I were you.

04:55.801 --> 04:57.843
It's typically seen
in someone who's trying to avoid

04:57.970 --> 05:00.846
facing the dismal nature
of her own small life.

05:00.973 --> 05:02.848
- I think you slipped up.
- It's not at all healthy.

05:02.975 --> 05:05.309
- And I think a barrel girl got away.
- It's something I can help you with.

05:05.435 --> 05:08.270
And now she's hunting down
the people that took her.

05:08.397 --> 05:11.941
And people all around you
are dropping like flies.

05:12.067 --> 05:13.401
You could be next.

05:14.152 --> 05:18.155
Seriously, I'll be fine.
It's you I'm concerned about.

05:18.281 --> 05:19.824
Don't say I didn't warn you.

05:25.956 --> 05:30.042
Jordan Chase.
We know exactly where he is.

05:30.168 --> 05:34.588
Yeah, but there's no way
to get to him.

05:34.715 --> 05:36.465
The entire top floor is guarded.

05:36.591 --> 05:38.300
Elevators?

05:39.553 --> 05:40.761
Monitored.

05:42.139 --> 05:43.222
Stairs?

05:44.725 --> 05:47.184
- Locked from the inside.
- Yeah.

05:48.812 --> 05:50.396
But you know how to pick locks.

05:57.404 --> 06:00.364
Not without setting off the fire alarm.

06:04.828 --> 06:06.412
OK.

06:06.538 --> 06:09.832
So we have to figure out a way
to get him to come out.

06:09.958 --> 06:11.584
How?

06:12.419 --> 06:14.420
He has everything he needs up there.

06:15.714 --> 06:18.132
Not everything.

06:18.884 --> 06:21.469
Me. He wants me.

06:22.095 --> 06:23.012
No.

06:23.138 --> 06:25.306
There's got to be a way
to use me as bait.

06:26.475 --> 06:29.393
- It worked with Cole.
- I'm not gonna use you as bait.

06:30.145 --> 06:33.147
- It's too dangerous.
- You know I can do this.

06:33.273 --> 06:35.983
Yeah, I do.
I saw you kill Alex Tilden.

06:36.109 --> 06:37.401
But we have to be extra careful.

06:37.527 --> 06:40.071
Jordan has more than
just our eyes on him.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.866
- The police.
- My sister.

06:45.786 --> 06:50.206
I'm so sorry that I put you in this position,
having to lie to her like that.

06:50.332 --> 06:53.125
I don't like it,
but it's not the first time.

06:54.753 --> 06:56.545
She's never suspected anything?

07:00.258 --> 07:04.512
I don't know. Maybe Deb has a blind spot
when it comes to me.

07:05.555 --> 07:08.933
Sometimes I feel like I'm taking advantage
of her, but it's for the best.

07:09.059 --> 07:11.018
She's not like us.

07:11.978 --> 07:13.062
"Us."

07:25.408 --> 07:26.575
Oh.

07:27.410 --> 07:29.578
There's a camera in the room.

07:30.664 --> 07:33.165
The baby monitor
is picking up the signal.

07:33.291 --> 07:35.292
Somebody's watching us.

07:40.298 --> 07:43.592
Jordan has to be behind this...
and close by.

07:43.718 --> 07:45.970
Wireless cameras
have a limited range,

07:46.096 --> 07:49.098
their signal routed
to a recording unit

07:49.224 --> 07:51.600
in a vacant apartment,

07:51.726 --> 07:53.978
a motor home...

07:56.439 --> 07:57.815
a van.

08:20.714 --> 08:22.506
It could be anywhere.

08:33.476 --> 08:36.353
Jordan Chase is up to
his ball sack in this. I fuckin' know it.

08:36.479 --> 08:38.189
Just means we keep digging.

08:38.315 --> 08:39.315
You coming in?

08:39.441 --> 08:42.776
I got to grab something from my car.
I'll be right up.

08:47.616 --> 08:49.575
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:50.619 --> 08:54.121
- What are you doing here?
- My union appeal's been denied.

08:54.247 --> 08:57.666
I am now officially terminated.

08:57.792 --> 08:59.293
So how's your day?

08:59.419 --> 09:01.503
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I don't want your pity.

09:01.630 --> 09:02.671
Good. Then...

09:02.797 --> 09:04.924
Thirty years of putting bad guys away,

09:05.050 --> 09:07.968
this is what them cocksuckers
upstairs do to me.

09:08.094 --> 09:10.012
Take my pension,
wipe their ass with it

09:10.138 --> 09:12.556
and just flush it right on down the shitter.

09:12.682 --> 09:13.766
Look, I got to get inside.

09:13.892 --> 09:17.228
- I need your help on a bust.
- Bust? What are you talking about?

09:17.354 --> 09:20.814
Something big. Something big enough
to make them stand up and take notice.

09:20.941 --> 09:24.068
Something big enough to make them
give me my job back on the police force.

09:24.194 --> 09:27.112
- Your boy Dexter...
- What the fuck? What are you doing?

09:27.239 --> 09:29.990
Didn't you hear me, Quinn?
I'm not a cop any more.

09:30.116 --> 09:31.951
Now, I need a cop to make this bust.

09:32.077 --> 09:33.702
No. Forget it.

09:35.372 --> 09:37.414
You little fucking wimp.

09:38.250 --> 09:41.877
You're up to your ass in alligators
with this thing, whether you like it or not.

09:42.003 --> 09:44.964
So you're gonna make this bust
and I'm gonna call you,

09:45.090 --> 09:47.132
you'd best come running.

10:04.234 --> 10:07.653
- What are you in the mood for?
- I'm thinking seafood.

10:07.779 --> 10:09.780
It's a perfect night to grill.

10:11.283 --> 10:14.702
I'll go check what's in the fridge.

10:28.508 --> 10:31.719
Harrison's baby monitor made it easy
to pinpoint where this was hidden,

10:31.845 --> 10:33.554
but the bigger problem remains.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.181
What exactly has Jordan heard

10:36.308 --> 10:38.350
and where are those recordings?

10:43.773 --> 10:46.358
On second thought,
let's go out to eat.

10:55.160 --> 10:58.412
It's not Jordan. It's worse.
It's someone from my own station.

10:58.538 --> 11:03.042
What? Why would somebody from the
police department bug your apartment?

11:03.168 --> 11:05.461
I don't know. There's a serial number
on the camera.

11:05.587 --> 11:07.546
I'll go in tomorrow and find out
who checked it out.

11:07.672 --> 11:08.881
I don't understand.

11:09.007 --> 11:12.593
This could have something
to do with my sister's theory.

11:13.511 --> 11:14.970
What are you talking about?

11:15.096 --> 11:20.142
She has this theory about
vigilantes hunting down the rapists.

11:20.268 --> 11:22.227
So you think she planted cameras?

11:22.354 --> 11:25.189
No, it's not her. I'd know.

11:25.315 --> 11:27.316
It could be anyone.

11:28.568 --> 11:30.194
But how could they be onto us?

11:30.320 --> 11:33.280
- We've been so careful.
- I don't know yet.

11:33.406 --> 11:36.492
The one good thing is that no one
has seen those recordings yet.

11:36.618 --> 11:37.993
How do you know?

11:38.119 --> 11:40.287
Because we haven't been arrested.

11:42.290 --> 11:45.292
Jordan is gonna get away with everything
and we're gonna be arrested?

11:45.418 --> 11:47.419
We don't know that.

11:47.545 --> 11:51.382
Look, for now we just pretend
like everything's OK.

11:51.508 --> 11:54.635
If we have something to talk about,
we talk about it out here where it's safe.

11:54.761 --> 11:56.553
But we were so close.

11:58.223 --> 12:01.600
- It can't end this way.
- It's not going to.

12:12.070 --> 12:16.698
I checked with the apartment manager,
then the neighbours.

12:17.575 --> 12:19.451
That motor home is gone.

12:19.577 --> 12:21.412
It's got to be one of these vans.

12:21.538 --> 12:23.455
You said there were four vans last night.

12:23.581 --> 12:24.873
It's down to three now.

12:24.999 --> 12:27.459
I'll keep checking back.

12:28.795 --> 12:32.047
- Sonya, everything all right?
- Everything is great.

12:32.173 --> 12:34.675
Astor and Cody
are spoiling Harrison silly.

12:34.801 --> 12:35.801
Good.

12:35.927 --> 12:39.388
He's taking a little nap now,
so I was just making a list for Sunday,

12:39.514 --> 12:42.099
and I wondered, do you have
any special requests?

12:42.225 --> 12:44.810
- Sunday?
- Harrison's birthday party.

12:44.936 --> 12:46.395
Of course! Right.

12:46.521 --> 12:48.814
Harrison's birthday.

12:48.940 --> 12:51.150
Astor and Cody
can't wait to see you.

12:51.276 --> 12:53.277
I'm looking forward to seeing them too.

12:54.028 --> 12:56.238
But... hold on a second.

12:56.364 --> 12:58.699
It's not safe
to bring everyone here.

12:58.825 --> 13:00.784
- We can go to them.
- You're coming?

13:00.910 --> 13:03.745
I just invited myself.

13:03.872 --> 13:06.415
Sonya, we're gonna have
the party in Orlando.

13:06.541 --> 13:08.625
Oh. OK.

13:08.751 --> 13:12.004
It's just easier than
making everyone drive down here.

13:12.130 --> 13:18.177
Perfect.

13:20.263 --> 13:22.055
Come on, I got to get to work.

13:22.182 --> 13:25.767
Keep an eye on these vans
and call me if you see anything.

13:30.398 --> 13:31.982
No torches, no pitchforks,

13:32.108 --> 13:34.651
no one looking at me
any differently.

13:34.777 --> 13:36.612
Dex, I need you.

13:37.739 --> 13:39.448
In a minute.
I have something I need to do.

13:39.574 --> 13:41.200
Find out who planted
those cameras.

13:41.326 --> 13:43.410
We're all waiting on you.

13:43.536 --> 13:45.537
That doesn't sound good.

13:54.714 --> 13:58.634
So, as I was saying, everything keeps
leading back to Jordan Chase.

13:58.760 --> 14:02.054
Why would he be running
a rape club with these putos?

14:02.180 --> 14:04.431
I don't know.
But I'm pretty fuckin' sure he is.

14:04.557 --> 14:06.642
Where are we on the banker,
Alex Tilden?

14:06.768 --> 14:09.811
- He's gone. He disappeared.
- We got his DNA from a toothbrush.

14:09.938 --> 14:11.813
Ties him to the barrel girls, like the others,

14:11.940 --> 14:14.358
but no connection to Jordan
that we can find.

14:14.484 --> 14:16.985
- Then I suggest you find that connection.
- I'm on it.

14:17.111 --> 14:20.113
- And the dentist, Mendell?
- He's the odd man out.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.658
He doesn't seem to have any connection
to any of the other guys.

14:22.784 --> 14:24.368
Again, let's find that connection.

14:24.494 --> 14:25.953
- Morgan, Quinn.
- We got it.

14:26.079 --> 14:28.830
Phone the neighbours.
Wake the kids. Kick the dog.

14:28.957 --> 14:32.709
Remember that muddy female boot print
outside Tilden's house?

14:32.835 --> 14:34.127
Yeah, we found it.

14:34.254 --> 14:37.506
Well, my brothers in blue, it...

14:39.425 --> 14:41.051
has a twin.

14:41.177 --> 14:43.178
Found it outside
the vacant house next door.

14:43.304 --> 14:44.513
Let me see that.

14:45.390 --> 14:47.099
Naturally, I went inside.

14:47.225 --> 14:50.811
The dining room was spotless, and I mean
recently cleaned kind of spotless,

14:50.937 --> 14:52.646
unlike the rest of the house.

14:52.772 --> 14:55.983
My schnoz also detected
the smell of bleach.

14:56.109 --> 14:58.360
One more day,
and the smell would have dissipated.

14:58.486 --> 15:02.281
My guess, the vigilante brought
your missing banker over

15:02.407 --> 15:04.658
and offed him right there
in the dining room.

15:05.118 --> 15:09.121
Excuse me,
did I hear the word "vigilante"?

15:13.710 --> 15:17.337
It was a theory
I was keeping to myself, but...

15:17.463 --> 15:21.383
It's out there, but we may have
a vigilante on our hands.

15:21.509 --> 15:24.970
I sent Masuka over to Tilden's
to see if he could comb for any evidence

15:25.096 --> 15:26.888
that a homicide had taken place.

15:27.015 --> 15:28.140
Keep going.

15:28.266 --> 15:29.641
Please don't.

15:29.767 --> 15:33.478
There are 13 DVDs
and only 12 victims.

15:33.605 --> 15:37.065
So I'm thinking that
one of the barrel girls escaped

15:37.191 --> 15:39.109
and now she's after the men
that abducted her.

15:39.235 --> 15:41.486
And she is hunting them
and she is killing them.

15:41.613 --> 15:44.364
How is that even possible?

15:44.490 --> 15:46.408
The barrel girls are all slight of build.

15:46.534 --> 15:50.454
- Alex Tilden was, what, 175 pounds?
- Minimum.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.497
Maybe she had help.

15:53.249 --> 15:55.208
- Like who?
- I don't know.

15:55.335 --> 15:56.627
A...

15:56.753 --> 16:00.213
A man. Someone she trusts.

16:01.591 --> 16:05.177
Someone who cares about her.
A father, brother,

16:05.303 --> 16:07.512
husband, boyfriend.

16:10.558 --> 16:13.310
So now it's vigilantes in love.

16:13.436 --> 16:15.187
Yeah, like Romeo and Juliet...

16:15.313 --> 16:17.314
except they didn't kill anyone.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.901
No, more like, uh, Bonnie and... Clyde.

16:21.027 --> 16:21.985
Great.

16:22.111 --> 16:24.988
They ended up dead
in a bullet-riddled car.

16:25.114 --> 16:28.033
We all have our assignments.
Let's go.

16:51.849 --> 16:53.225
Closer to ten minutes.

16:53.351 --> 16:55.977
She likes a cup of coffee
with her smoke.

16:57.689 --> 17:00.399
But that's more than enough time
to see that...

17:01.734 --> 17:04.653
Detective Joseph Quinn
checked out the cameras.

17:04.779 --> 17:08.448
Three cameras, to be exact,
two microphones, a recorder.

17:08.574 --> 17:09.658
Only three days ago.

17:09.784 --> 17:12.077
Maybe no one's seen
the footage yet.

17:15.206 --> 17:17.040
Case number...

17:17.166 --> 17:21.545
It's from 1982, when Quinn was
in grade school eating paste.

17:21.671 --> 17:22.838
It's a fake.

17:31.723 --> 17:35.142
No court orders authorised for my address.
This is off the books.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.405
Quinn's doing this on his own.

17:48.531 --> 17:50.490
Lumen. Plans for lunch?

17:58.916 --> 18:00.959
Start with the hard drive.

18:01.085 --> 18:04.838
Yeah, any storage devices,
video files, flash drives.

18:06.466 --> 18:08.884
Wow, this thing is ancient.

18:09.010 --> 18:10.302
Who is this guy?

18:10.428 --> 18:13.305
Quinn. My sister's partner.

18:14.807 --> 18:15.974
Oh, wow.

18:17.185 --> 18:18.810
Are they... close?

18:18.936 --> 18:21.146
They used to be.

18:21.898 --> 18:23.231
You got anything?

18:23.983 --> 18:26.109
Not much in the way of video files.

18:26.235 --> 18:28.111
Anything of us?

18:29.113 --> 18:30.197
No.

18:30.323 --> 18:33.617
Just a cat that hiccups and farts
at the same time.

18:35.536 --> 18:37.662
Cute.

18:37.789 --> 18:39.790
Check the bedroom.

18:43.503 --> 18:46.797
You take the closet.
I'll check the drawers.

18:56.599 --> 18:58.099
Oh, shit.

18:59.602 --> 19:01.269
What is it?

19:01.395 --> 19:03.396
- Us.
- The marina.

19:03.523 --> 19:05.982
That's the night we dumped Cole.

19:06.108 --> 19:08.610
He's been watching us for weeks.

19:08.736 --> 19:11.238
He knows everything.

19:12.490 --> 19:14.449
Wait. You're not gonna
take them with you?

19:14.575 --> 19:17.577
Tip him off that we found them?
No, he'll just print more.

19:17.703 --> 19:19.287
We have to find the digital source.

19:19.413 --> 19:22.457
Right. Find the recording equipment.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.175
We're not open any more.

19:32.301 --> 19:36.054
- Mrs Mendell? Laura Mendell?
- Yes?

19:36.180 --> 19:38.557
I'm Detective Morgan.
This is Detective Quinn.

19:38.683 --> 19:41.101
We'd like to ask you a couple of questions
about your husband.

19:41.227 --> 19:44.020
Please, OK?
Just no more questions.

19:44.146 --> 19:47.816
We've been through this, OK?
I don't know anything.

19:47.942 --> 19:50.151
- Of course, I should have.
- Why is that?

19:50.278 --> 19:53.822
I was very naive,
but now it all makes sense.

19:53.948 --> 19:55.657
Those week-long fishing trips
he used to take.

19:55.783 --> 19:57.826
- He'd go without you?
- Of course without me.

19:57.952 --> 19:59.452
It was just him and his buddies.

19:59.579 --> 20:01.496
He called it his "man time",

20:01.622 --> 20:04.082
but of course that has
a whole other meaning now.

20:04.208 --> 20:06.418
Did he ever give you names
of the men on those trips?

20:06.544 --> 20:08.795
No. I never met any of them.

20:08.921 --> 20:13.008
He kept me completely in the dark
about his whole closeted gay life.

20:14.218 --> 20:16.636
I mean, why didn't he just tell me?

20:16.762 --> 20:20.640
Actually, Mrs Mendell, we have information
which leads us to believe

20:20.766 --> 20:22.684
your husband wasn't in fact gay.

20:22.810 --> 20:26.396
The crime scene may have been altered
to give that impression.

20:27.356 --> 20:29.858
But he was linked to a series of rapes.

20:29.984 --> 20:31.818
And murders.

20:31.944 --> 20:34.696
My God.

20:36.782 --> 20:39.034
Who is this man I married?

20:40.202 --> 20:42.954
I'm sorry to bring you that news.

20:43.080 --> 20:46.082
But do any of these names
sound familiar?

20:46.208 --> 20:50.337
- Boyd Fowler. Cole Harmon.
- No, I don't know them.

20:50.463 --> 20:52.505
Alex Tilden.

20:52.632 --> 20:55.091
Jordan Chase.

20:55.217 --> 20:56.676
- Jordan Chase?
- Yes.

20:56.802 --> 20:59.471
Well, that's him, right there.

21:00.056 --> 21:03.183
"Best two-man sailing team,
Dan Mendell and Eugene Greer"?

21:03.309 --> 21:06.061
Jordan Chase is Eugene Greer...

21:06.187 --> 21:08.521
or he used to be.

21:08.648 --> 21:12.108
Dan knew him when they were kids.
It was a really big deal to him.

21:12.234 --> 21:13.902
That's our connection.

21:14.028 --> 21:17.197
Why do you think the wife never had a clue
about what was up with her husband?

21:17.323 --> 21:20.825
This barrel girl stuff has gone on
the entire time they were married.

21:20.952 --> 21:23.536
He was probably a really good liar.

21:23.663 --> 21:27.040
Men sometimes have that ability.
It was his fault, not hers.

21:27.166 --> 21:29.501
How do you want
to go at this Eugene Greer thing?

21:29.627 --> 21:33.254
Just pull up everything we can.
School records, juvie records.

21:33.381 --> 21:35.256
I fuckin' knew Chase was full of shit.

21:35.383 --> 21:37.509
Who creates a new identity
for themselves?

21:37.635 --> 21:39.636
A dirt bag who has something to hide.

21:39.762 --> 21:41.763
I've got it.

21:53.275 --> 21:55.860
Jordan Chase lied
about knowing Alex Tilden.

21:55.987 --> 21:59.155
In the past ten years,
Tilden oversaw six properties

21:59.281 --> 22:00.991
purchased by Chase's corporation.

22:01.117 --> 22:03.994
Dan the Dentist also knew him.
And Jordan Chase is an alias.

22:04.120 --> 22:06.997
That whole bullshit persona
that he built for himself is a lie.

22:07.123 --> 22:10.417
His real name's Eugene Greer.
Mendell and Chase were friends as kids.

22:10.543 --> 22:15.922
So, wait. That ties Jordan directly
to each of the barrel girls' rapists.

22:16.048 --> 22:19.217
Yeah, but still all circumstantial.
Not enough to bring him in.

22:19.343 --> 22:22.053
Yeah, but it's enough to bring
his lying ass in for questioning.

22:22.179 --> 22:23.388
We've got to keep pushing at him,

22:23.514 --> 22:25.765
scare him a little bit
till he starts making some mistakes.

22:25.891 --> 22:30.020
Deb's closing in on Chase.
Quinn's closing in on me.

22:30.688 --> 22:32.564
Time's running out for both of us.

22:37.945 --> 22:39.404
Hey, any good news?

22:39.530 --> 22:42.866
Uh, yeah, we've connected Jordan Chase
to all of the rapists,

22:42.992 --> 22:45.618
so I'm about to nail
this fuck to the wall.

22:45.745 --> 22:47.162
Good.

22:48.914 --> 22:50.582
What? What's up? I'm kind of busy.

22:50.708 --> 22:52.584
Just wondering if you want to go with me

22:52.710 --> 22:55.462
to Orlando on Sunday
for Harrison's birthday.

22:55.588 --> 22:57.589
Oh. Wha...

22:57.715 --> 23:01.217
- I do, but...
- You have other plans with Quinn?

23:01.343 --> 23:04.387
What? No, it... It's with work.
It's the case.

23:05.723 --> 23:08.516
Besides, Quinn's the last person
that you'd want to have there.

23:08.642 --> 23:09.851
- Oh?
- Trust me.

23:09.977 --> 23:13.271
- So it's over?
- Yes.

23:15.483 --> 23:18.193
No. Fuck, I don't know.
It's complicated.

23:18.319 --> 23:19.861
You don't have to tell me.

23:20.738 --> 23:24.699
- He lied to me about something.
- Must have been something big.

23:27.495 --> 23:28.870
He lied to me about you.

23:28.996 --> 23:30.914
About me? What do you mean?

23:31.040 --> 23:33.041
Quinn had this...

23:34.043 --> 23:38.421
idiot notion that you were somehow
connected to Rita's death.

23:45.221 --> 23:47.222
- That's...
- It's crazy, I know.

23:47.348 --> 23:49.933
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because...

23:51.060 --> 23:53.520
Because you've been through enough.

23:53.646 --> 23:55.355
And I just found out.

23:57.983 --> 24:01.319
When he finally told me
I felt so betrayed because...

24:03.656 --> 24:07.075
...as much as I don't want to admit it,
I really care about him.

24:08.536 --> 24:10.245
"Care", present tense?

24:11.914 --> 24:13.498
It's complicated, remember?

24:16.710 --> 24:20.421
I thought I knew him,
and he kept telling me he loved me.

24:22.675 --> 24:26.136
But what he did...
I mean, I can't have somebody like that.

24:26.262 --> 24:30.390
You don't lie to somebody that
you're close to. You have their back.

24:30.516 --> 24:33.601
I need someone I can trust 100 per cent.

24:36.939 --> 24:39.107
Like this.

24:39.233 --> 24:41.651
- A boot print?
- The vigilante.

24:42.695 --> 24:46.030
She has someone in her life,
a guy who's helping her,

24:46.157 --> 24:49.701
someone that would do
anything and everything for her.

24:49.827 --> 24:51.911
How do you know that?

24:52.037 --> 24:57.750
Honestly, I don't know,
but... what they're doing takes devotion.

24:57.877 --> 25:00.879
To kill someone together,
that's some pretty serious shit.

25:01.005 --> 25:04.465
Is that what Lumen and I have,
serious shit?

25:04.592 --> 25:06.134
He's risking his life.

25:06.260 --> 25:10.180
He's putting everything on the line
to make what happened to her right.

25:13.392 --> 25:16.060
As crazy as that sounds, what...

25:16.187 --> 25:19.355
what word would you use
to describe that but "love"?

25:25.362 --> 25:27.572
It's pretty fucked up, isn't it?

25:29.283 --> 25:31.451
Yeah, pretty fucked up.

25:34.538 --> 25:36.414
Kind of beautiful too.

25:43.505 --> 25:46.257
Just got this in.
It's handmade. It's very chic.

25:46.383 --> 25:47.467
Um...

25:47.593 --> 25:50.553
- It's not quite me.
- Perhaps one of the rings.

25:50.679 --> 25:53.473
How about... that?

26:01.607 --> 26:04.025
It's nice.

26:04.151 --> 26:07.570
Small enough to carry,
locking pin, stainless-steel blade.

26:07.696 --> 26:10.156
- How does it feel?
- Good.

26:10.282 --> 26:12.742
We'll take it.

26:14.078 --> 26:16.955
- Thank you.
- Sure.

26:23.712 --> 26:27.632
It's just an hour or so
till Quinn gets off work.

26:27.758 --> 26:31.886
If he decides to check his recording
equipment tonight I should be there.

26:35.057 --> 26:38.434
What is Quinn after?
What does he want with us?

26:38.560 --> 26:40.895
He doesn't want us. He wants me.

26:41.021 --> 26:44.065
He was coming after me
before we even met.

26:44.191 --> 26:46.567
I didn't mean for you
to get caught up in this.

26:46.694 --> 26:49.070
You should leave.

26:49.196 --> 26:52.615
You tried that once before, remember?
You tried to ship me away.

26:52.741 --> 26:56.786
That was different.
I don't want you to leave for good.

26:58.998 --> 27:02.166
Just till I deal with this.

27:03.252 --> 27:05.336
Deal with it how?

27:05.462 --> 27:07.547
I don't know.
Whatever needs to be done.

27:09.383 --> 27:13.553
I appreciate the offer,
but... I'm not going anywhere.

27:13.679 --> 27:17.265
- Lumen, it's getting dangerous.
- Getting dangerous?

27:17.391 --> 27:19.475
I'm not walking away.

27:19.601 --> 27:21.602
We're a team.

27:23.147 --> 27:24.981
We have serious shit.

27:25.816 --> 27:27.483
What does that mean?

27:27.609 --> 27:30.069
It's just something Deb said about us.

27:30.195 --> 27:32.530
You told her about... us?

27:32.656 --> 27:35.450
No, she was talking
about the vigilantes.

27:35.576 --> 27:39.620
She was talking about us without
knowing she was talking about us.

27:49.340 --> 27:52.800
Maybe we should both take off.

28:00.893 --> 28:03.102
Get on a cruise ship.

28:03.228 --> 28:05.521
Hop a freighter.

28:05.647 --> 28:08.274
Steal a tugboat.

28:16.367 --> 28:20.203
You said that you didn't
want me to leave.

28:20.329 --> 28:22.330
Does that mean that you want me to stay?

28:23.290 --> 28:24.290
I do.

28:32.633 --> 28:35.093
We should go.

28:39.139 --> 28:44.727
OK, so Eugene Greer grew up
in some redneck town near Tallahassee.

28:44.853 --> 28:47.355
He had a single mom,
now dead, no siblings,

28:47.481 --> 28:49.649
pretty nondescript childhood.

28:49.775 --> 28:52.902
Moved to Miami when he was 18,
dropped about 100 pounds,

28:53.028 --> 28:57.115
changed his name to Jordan Chase,
pretty much reinvented himself.

28:57.241 --> 29:01.536
Take a look at these
before-and-after photos.

29:01.662 --> 29:02.995
Ooh.

29:03.122 --> 29:05.248
Like a different person.

29:05.374 --> 29:07.875
I think he might have had
some plastic surgery along the way.

29:08.001 --> 29:09.001
Look at this.

29:13.090 --> 29:16.926
When they'd be off at the same time,
each of the barrel girls disappeared.

29:17.052 --> 29:19.345
- Fuck, they did this for years.
- Mm-hm.

29:22.224 --> 29:24.267
I gotta take this.

29:39.908 --> 29:44.078
I'm, uh, having a really tough time here.

29:44.204 --> 29:45.830
Doing what?

29:45.956 --> 29:49.167
This. Being with you.

29:49.293 --> 29:51.544
Yeah, well, you should have
thought of that before.

29:51.670 --> 29:54.505
I'm sorry. I fucked up, I know.

29:55.716 --> 29:57.425
I do dumb things.

29:57.551 --> 29:58.968
I'm a dumb guy.

29:59.595 --> 30:01.679
But the one thing I did right

30:01.805 --> 30:04.348
was to get you to almost like me...

30:05.601 --> 30:07.852
- because I really love you.
- Don't, Quinn.

30:07.978 --> 30:09.270
No, I mean it.

30:10.397 --> 30:14.775
There aren't many women like you.
I know that.

30:14.902 --> 30:17.403
You're more like...

30:17.529 --> 30:19.489
- a guy.
- A guy?

30:20.199 --> 30:22.533
You don't play games

30:22.659 --> 30:25.411
where I have to figure out
what it is you're really thinking.

30:25.537 --> 30:27.455
You just say it,

30:27.581 --> 30:29.916
usually with
a lot of really filthy words

30:30.042 --> 30:32.126
that I've never heard before.

30:33.128 --> 30:37.215
You're the first woman
who's ever called me on my bullshit

30:37.341 --> 30:40.092
and made me take
a hard look at myself.

30:40.219 --> 30:42.094
It's made me a better person, I think.

30:44.014 --> 30:46.599
I just don't want to lose you, that's all.

30:47.768 --> 30:49.727
Bad news.

30:50.979 --> 30:54.482
Not only has Jordan declined our request
for another interview,

30:54.608 --> 30:58.277
but he just booked a multi-city
speaking deal in Europe.

30:58.403 --> 30:59.779
Sounds like he's on the run.

30:59.905 --> 31:01.155
No fucking way.

31:01.281 --> 31:03.324
As of tomorrow he is untouchable,

31:03.450 --> 31:06.452
unless we can find a way
to keep him here.

31:06.578 --> 31:09.372
But, like we keep saying,
we still don't have enough to arrest him.

31:09.498 --> 31:13.125
No, but, uh... we can ground him
as a material witness.

31:13.252 --> 31:15.378
We just have to get a court order.

31:15.504 --> 31:18.089
- Should we go to LaGuerta?
- No.

31:18.215 --> 31:22.009
She shoots me down every time.
She won't help. I can get it myself.

31:29.643 --> 31:33.187
The only van that remains after 24 hours
just happens to be a rental.

31:33.855 --> 31:38.025
Judging by the amount of dust,
it's been sitting there close to a week.

31:42.823 --> 31:47.702
And here comes Quinn, checking in
before he heads to the station.

31:51.331 --> 31:53.165
I never wanted it to come to this.

32:00.173 --> 32:02.675
Agh!

32:47.179 --> 32:48.262
Hello.

32:48.388 --> 32:51.766
- Lumen, it's me, Emily.
- What's wrong?

32:51.892 --> 32:54.060
I got a call from Jordan Chase.

32:54.186 --> 32:56.020
He knows I talked to you.

32:56.146 --> 32:57.980
What? How?

32:58.106 --> 33:00.733
I don't know. You tell me.

33:00.859 --> 33:03.277
- I didn't talk to him.
- What is going on?

33:03.403 --> 33:07.198
I'm scared. He scared me.

33:07.324 --> 33:09.200
Emily, I have no idea what's going on.

33:11.953 --> 33:13.162
I'm going to the police.

33:13.288 --> 33:15.414
- I'll tell them everything.
- No, no, don't do that.

33:15.540 --> 33:16.999
Why? They'll protect me.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.835
Emily, it'll just make things worse.
We'll protect you.

33:19.961 --> 33:23.255
How? Jordan is too powerful.

33:23.382 --> 33:25.841
- He has people.
- Emily...

33:25.967 --> 33:28.094
You know what he did to us.

33:28.220 --> 33:32.515
Just stay in your house. Wait for us.
We'll be there as soon as we can.

33:33.225 --> 33:35.476
Please, just tell me
that you'll wait for us.

33:39.022 --> 33:39.980
OK.

33:40.107 --> 33:42.274
I'll wait, but hurry.

33:42.859 --> 33:44.652
Please hurry.

33:48.156 --> 33:49.740
Very nice.

33:52.953 --> 33:54.870
You're quite the actress.

33:56.873 --> 33:57.873
Dexter Morgan.

33:57.999 --> 34:00.209
Please leave
a message at the tone.

34:00.335 --> 34:02.294
Dexter, where are you? Emily called.

34:02.421 --> 34:04.839
Jordan knows she talked to us.
We have to go see her.

34:27.612 --> 34:29.822
I hope you got voicemail.

34:31.825 --> 34:34.994
- You're Quinn's friend.
- That would be me.

34:35.120 --> 34:38.622
FYI, Stan Liddy is my name.

34:40.250 --> 34:43.836
- What are you doing?
- I just need you to relax.

34:43.962 --> 34:48.174
I'm taking us to a little place to
have a little private chat, that's all.

34:48.300 --> 34:51.385
Why? Why are you doing this?

34:51.511 --> 34:54.513
Because our mutual friend Joey Quinn
hired me to look into you

34:54.639 --> 34:56.974
and I guess you know
I found out some things.

34:57.100 --> 34:59.560
So I just need you
to lie there and relax.

34:59.686 --> 35:02.646
I don't want to zap you again,
but I will if I have to.

35:17.412 --> 35:20.122
- What?
- Come on, now, Joey.

35:20.248 --> 35:23.334
Is that any way to talk
to your new best friend?

35:23.460 --> 35:26.045
- I told you, I don't want...
- Shut up and listen up.

35:26.171 --> 35:27.963
You get your ass in your car

35:28.089 --> 35:31.842
and you drive on down to the fuel docks
at Bayfront Park.

35:31.968 --> 35:35.846
That big bust I want you to make,
I need you to come and make it now.

35:35.972 --> 35:38.432
I don't know what you think you're doing,
but you got to stop it with this shit.

35:38.558 --> 35:40.726
Oh, horseshit. Nobody's stopping nothing.

35:40.852 --> 35:43.604
- You're the one who hired me.
- And then I fired you.

35:43.730 --> 35:46.023
Listen, boy. This is going down
with or without you.

35:46.149 --> 35:49.068
Now, you don't get down here
faster than a fuckin' jack rabbit,

35:49.194 --> 35:53.072
I'm calling in another cop and then there's
no telling how this is gonna spin out.

35:53.198 --> 35:56.408
- Jesus, Liddy...
- Jesus ain't got nothing to do with it.

35:56.535 --> 36:00.079
Old fuel docks, Bayfront Park, now.

36:04.125 --> 36:05.668
Fuck.

36:06.753 --> 36:08.462
Your buddy Quinn is on his way.

36:08.588 --> 36:10.631
Didn't sound like he wants to come.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.884
Well, you're a real popular fella.

36:14.511 --> 36:17.221
Sonya. Who's Sonya?

36:17.347 --> 36:19.598
- My nanny.
- Nanny.

36:19.724 --> 36:24.311
Well, Sonya wants to know
if you want a magician for the party.

36:24.437 --> 36:25.938
Of course you do.

36:26.064 --> 36:28.649
"Yes, do magician."

36:31.736 --> 36:33.696
Well, now,

36:33.822 --> 36:36.282
there's something I want to show you.

36:42.956 --> 36:45.165
Looky here at this.

36:52.173 --> 36:53.799
Ain't that neat?

36:54.467 --> 36:57.011
And that's just a tiny bit
of what I recorded.

36:57.929 --> 37:00.139
But I only got one problem here.

37:00.265 --> 37:03.976
I didn't have no search warrant
and these people are sticklers for rules,

37:04.102 --> 37:09.607
which is why... you're gonna give me
a full confession.

37:16.573 --> 37:19.366
- Where's Dexter?
- He's not here.

37:19.492 --> 37:23.871
No, I need you both.
You said you would protect me.

37:23.997 --> 37:25.623
Emily, it's OK. Calm down.

37:25.749 --> 37:29.126
You have to call him.
Make him come. Now.

37:31.296 --> 37:32.796
OK.

37:34.215 --> 37:36.050
OK, maybe I should just go get him.

37:36.176 --> 37:38.093
Maybe not.

37:41.514 --> 37:45.225
I ain't stupid. You're thinking, "I got
no reason to make a full confession."

37:45.352 --> 37:48.479
So I'm gonna give you a reason.
Lumen walks free.

37:48.605 --> 37:50.272
Why should I trust you?

37:50.398 --> 37:53.901
Cos I don't give a shit about her,
and I don't give a shit about you either.

37:54.027 --> 37:57.321
I just want my goddamn job
on the police force back.

37:57.447 --> 38:00.449
I bring in somebody like you,
I get my picture in the news,

38:00.575 --> 38:03.077
everybody thinks I'm a goddamn hero,
everybody loves me,

38:03.203 --> 38:07.247
and they have to hire me back.
So I don't need your girl.

38:08.792 --> 38:10.918
What do you say?

38:11.711 --> 38:12.878
Shit!

38:26.434 --> 38:28.143
Liddy!

38:30.271 --> 38:32.272
Ah!

38:50.709 --> 38:54.837
Go away, Quinn.
Don't make this any worse.

39:03.304 --> 39:05.139
Liddy, where the fuck are you?

39:40.050 --> 39:41.967
Leave a message.

39:42.093 --> 39:46.055
Liddy, it's Quinn. You're really starting
to fucking piss me off.

40:12.582 --> 40:13.832
Dexter, where are you?

40:13.958 --> 40:18.504
Emily called. Jordan knows
she talked to us. We have to go see her.

40:40.985 --> 40:43.403
I don't have time to deal with you.

40:59.796 --> 41:02.256
- Please leave a message.
- I'm on my way.

41:05.009 --> 41:06.009
Morgan.

41:07.220 --> 41:09.138
My office.

41:13.434 --> 41:17.020
I got a call earlier from the judge
you petitioned for your court order.

41:17.147 --> 41:19.648
- When's it coming?
- It's not.

41:20.817 --> 41:22.067
What?

41:22.735 --> 41:26.780
Your request to detain Jordan Chase
as a material witness was denied.

41:26.906 --> 41:30.534
That fuck is scheduled
to fly out of here one-way today.

41:30.660 --> 41:33.203
- This was our shot.
- I understand why you're upset,

41:33.329 --> 41:35.664
but what I don't understand is
why you didn't come to me.

41:35.790 --> 41:38.292
- You're kidding.
- I'm asking.

41:39.043 --> 41:42.045
You are the last person I think of
when I need support.

41:42.172 --> 41:44.756
Detective, you've been
on the force long enough

41:44.883 --> 41:47.676
to know that situations
are rarely black and white.

41:47.802 --> 41:49.636
Politics come into play.

41:49.762 --> 41:51.805
That doesn't mean
that I signed up to be used.

41:51.931 --> 41:55.350
We all get used, and in this instance
you should have used me.

41:55.476 --> 41:58.228
You made it very clear that you don't
support my vigilante theory.

41:58.354 --> 42:01.481
And I'm still not sure
that there's anything to it,

42:01.608 --> 42:05.444
but I have always trusted
your instincts as a cop.

42:11.075 --> 42:13.410
You know, at one point
I actually thought we were friends.

42:15.413 --> 42:17.414
Well, Detect...

42:17.540 --> 42:22.711
Debra, I'm sorry
if I betrayed that friendship.

42:23.546 --> 42:24.880
OK.

42:25.006 --> 42:27.549
- Wait.
- What? What?

42:27.675 --> 42:30.010
- What is it?
- Here.

42:30.136 --> 42:32.429
- What is this?
- It's your court order.

42:32.555 --> 42:35.098
From a different judge
who owed me a favour.

42:38.519 --> 42:41.230
Fuck me.

42:43.608 --> 42:45.442
Now I'm the asshole, right?

42:45.568 --> 42:48.028
You better get going
if you want to catch Jordan.

42:48.154 --> 42:49.529
Right.

43:00.250 --> 43:02.000
Lumen?

43:12.553 --> 43:14.721
What could he be doing
that is so important

43:14.847 --> 43:16.890
that he would let you
come here by yourself?

43:17.475 --> 43:20.227
- I don't know.
- Yes, you keep saying that.

43:21.354 --> 43:23.480
You're surprisingly short of answers.

43:25.566 --> 43:27.317
Maybe you should let me call him.

43:27.443 --> 43:32.030
Yes, brilliant, because you certainly
wouldn't tip him off in any way.

43:32.156 --> 43:34.741
- I could try calling him.
- Quiet, please.

43:34.867 --> 43:39.162
Are you mad at me?
I did exactly what you told me to do.

43:39.289 --> 43:40.580
Please, shut up.

43:40.707 --> 43:42.499
- I'm just trying...
- Shut up!

43:45.878 --> 43:48.922
- It's not my fault.
- Of course it's your fault!

43:51.759 --> 43:53.468
Aah!

43:59.600 --> 44:02.269
I find this profoundly distasteful.

44:02.395 --> 44:04.313
I've never had to do anything before!

44:04.439 --> 44:06.815
Now I've no choice.
I can't leave any witnesses.

44:06.941 --> 44:09.234
No, you said you wouldn't kill her.

44:34.802 --> 44:36.636
Lumen.

44:37.430 --> 44:39.306
Lumen?

44:48.816 --> 44:51.777
Is this the only kind of love
I'll eνer find?

44:53.571 --> 44:55.322
The kind that ends in blood?

45:15.802 --> 45:18.553
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Jordan Chase.

45:18.679 --> 45:20.764
I have a court order that prevents
him from leaving Miami.

45:20.890 --> 45:22.516
Well, I guess I can go home, then.

45:22.642 --> 45:25.310
- Is he on the plane?
- No. I have no idea where he is.

45:25.436 --> 45:29.022
We were scheduled to fly out over
an hour ago and he never showed up.

45:36.656 --> 45:39.032
Emily was killed with two blows.

45:43.788 --> 45:44.955
Lumen was here.

45:45.081 --> 45:48.375
Multiple footprints in the blood,
a scuffle.

45:48.501 --> 45:52.087
More blood, not from Emily,
leading out.

45:55.341 --> 45:56.883
She was running.

46:02.849 --> 46:04.433
She's putting up a fight.

46:04.559 --> 46:06.351
Lumen.
