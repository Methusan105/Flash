WEBVTT

00:10.683 --> 00:12.141
Previously on Dexter...

00:12.267 --> 00:16.187
When the wife is dead, 90 per cent
of the time the husband did it.

00:16.313 --> 00:17.397
Boyd Fowler.

00:17.523 --> 00:21.275
Hobbies - self-improνement
and storing women in formaldehyde.

00:24.822 --> 00:26.489
She saw everything.

00:27.157 --> 00:30.118
This is what happened
to the girls before you.

00:30.244 --> 00:33.705
Boyd wasn't the only one
who did this to me. There were others.

00:33.831 --> 00:37.333
That last fucking bitch is alive.

00:38.752 --> 00:41.587
Someone tried to move the girls
in the barrels.

00:42.798 --> 00:44.882
- Where's the driver?
- He took off.

00:45.008 --> 00:46.843
That means he's still mine to find.

00:46.969 --> 00:49.262
You believe some people deserve to die?

00:50.097 --> 00:51.931
Some people don't deserve to live.

00:52.057 --> 00:54.100
His name's Cole Harmon.

00:55.811 --> 00:59.731
If this is gonna end badly,
will you please just tell me now?

00:59.857 --> 01:02.608
- I might have a job for you.
- And what would that be?

01:02.735 --> 01:06.028
Looking into someone. Dexter Morgan.

01:06.155 --> 01:10.700
As far as Quinn goes, I suspended him.
To protect your brother.

01:10.826 --> 01:12.744
I trusted you.

01:12.870 --> 01:14.454
And while you were fucking me

01:14.580 --> 01:17.373
you were spreading shit
about my brother behind my back.

01:17.499 --> 01:19.041
Fuck you.

01:19.168 --> 01:22.420
You're backing off this thing
cos you're porking that guy's sister.

01:22.546 --> 01:24.630
- Your blood results are in.
- Emily Birch.

01:24.757 --> 01:26.299
She's not a victim. She's alive.

01:26.425 --> 01:29.802
It was almost 20 years ago.
He was Eugene Greer.

01:29.928 --> 01:31.763
That's Jordan Chase?

01:31.889 --> 01:34.140
With Lumen, I'm someone different.

01:34.266 --> 01:36.893
In her eyes... I'm not a monster at all.

01:37.019 --> 01:39.729
- I'm glad you didn't touch any of them.
- Why is that?

01:39.855 --> 01:42.815
Because this DNA test will clear you
and leave you all to me.

01:42.941 --> 01:44.734
We may have a vigilante on our hands.

01:44.860 --> 01:46.652
One of the barrel girls escaped

01:46.779 --> 01:49.822
and now she's after the men
that abducted her.

01:49.948 --> 01:53.451
Maybe she had help.
A husband, boyfriend...

01:55.078 --> 01:56.913
Argh!

01:58.081 --> 02:00.208
You're gonna give me a full confession.

02:01.418 --> 02:02.835
Liddy!

02:05.714 --> 02:09.258
Liddy, it's Quinn.
You're really starting to fuckin' piss me off.

02:10.177 --> 02:11.844
You said you wouldn't kill her.

02:14.473 --> 02:16.057
Lumen!

02:16.183 --> 02:18.643
Is this the only kind of love I'll ever find?

02:19.645 --> 02:21.979
The kind that ends in blood?

02:22.105 --> 02:23.397
Where are you?

02:25.005 --> 02:31.079
FaceTime with British Models 24/7
www. saucytime. com

04:18.597 --> 04:20.723
You've been in this situation before, Dexter,

04:20.849 --> 04:23.267
and I don't need to tell you how it ended,
with Rita dead.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.770
I haven't forgotten.

04:25.896 --> 04:27.813
Those aren't gonna do you
a lot of good without Jordan.

04:27.940 --> 04:29.857
- I'll find him.
- How?

04:29.983 --> 04:33.110
All the girls were raped and tortured
at the same location.

04:33.236 --> 04:35.738
I'm pretty sure
that's where he's taking Lumen.

04:35.864 --> 04:38.574
Pretty sure.
That sounds like an assumption.

04:38.700 --> 04:41.410
It's more than that. Jordan's like me.

04:41.536 --> 04:43.537
He needs his routine.

04:45.332 --> 04:48.334
Deb put together a file
with all of Jordan's real-estate holdings.

04:48.460 --> 04:49.585
It has to be one of them.

04:49.711 --> 04:53.214
- Another assumption, Dexter?
- It's all I have to go on.

04:53.966 --> 04:56.342
Lumen sees me for what I really am,

04:56.468 --> 04:59.428
and she hasn't turned away from me,
she hasn't turned against me.

04:59.554 --> 05:02.098
She's someone I could share my life with.

05:02.224 --> 05:03.849
I will not let her die.

05:04.810 --> 05:07.937
Surprise!
Dexter!

05:08.063 --> 05:09.730
What are you guys doing here?

05:09.856 --> 05:11.232
It was Astor's idea.

05:11.358 --> 05:14.944
I thought we'd come surprise you and have
Harrison's birthday party here in Miami.

05:15.070 --> 05:18.197
- Are you surprised?
- Boy, am I!

05:18.323 --> 05:20.616
I've been telling him all morning
he's gonna see his father.

05:20.742 --> 05:24.870
- He couldn't sleep, he was so excited.
- So happy to see his dad.

05:24.997 --> 05:29.000
Don't worry, we're not moving in. We're
staying at the Econo Lodge down the street.

05:29.126 --> 05:33.045
- Do you want to have breakfast with us?
- Yeah, come on, Dex!

05:33.171 --> 05:37.174
I wish I could, but there's a situation
at work. I really have to go.

05:37.300 --> 05:41.303
Oh, well, Astor and Cody had something
they wanted to ask you.

05:41.430 --> 05:44.015
Can we do it later?
I just don't have time right now.

05:44.141 --> 05:48.853
All I heard on the trip was Dexter,
Dexter, Dexter. It'll just take a minute.

05:50.731 --> 05:52.481
What is it?

05:52.607 --> 05:54.608
We want to stay with you for the summer.

05:54.735 --> 05:58.446
Can we please, Dex?
We really, really miss you.

05:59.656 --> 06:01.282
Sure you can.

06:03.326 --> 06:06.037
I really miss you guys too.

06:10.876 --> 06:13.836
Chase's private jet was fuelled
and sitting on the runway.

06:13.962 --> 06:15.755
His pilot was all dressed up
with nowhere to go

06:15.881 --> 06:18.007
because Chase never showed up
at the airport.

06:18.133 --> 06:20.342
- You checked his home?
- And his office.

06:20.469 --> 06:22.344
I think he knows we're onto him.

06:22.471 --> 06:24.972
Probably holed up somewhere
or he's on the run.

06:25.098 --> 06:28.434
I want to put out an APB,
throw out the net, see if we snag him.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.020
We'll need an arrest warrant for that,
and no judge would grant it.

06:31.146 --> 06:32.855
- We don't have enough evidence.
- We gotta try.

06:32.981 --> 06:36.358
We can't just let that fucker
slip through our fingers.

06:36.485 --> 06:38.486
We could issue a stake and notify.

06:38.612 --> 06:41.155
Locate him, put him
under 24-hour surveillance

06:41.281 --> 06:43.574
until we've got enough to bust him.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.618
That's fucking great.

06:50.582 --> 06:51.957
Where were you last night?

06:52.084 --> 06:55.002
I had a couple things crash down on me.

06:56.046 --> 06:58.589
I heard about Chase.
The fucker vanished?

06:58.715 --> 07:00.758
Yeah, but LaGuerta just OK'd
a stake and notify.

07:00.884 --> 07:03.594
Do you think your vigilantes in love
got to him?

07:04.513 --> 07:07.848
Killing Jordan Chase
is not the same as killing Boyd Fowler.

07:07.974 --> 07:10.976
This guy doesn't take a piss
without bodyguards holding his dick.

07:11.103 --> 07:14.146
- So it's still a race.
- A race?

07:14.272 --> 07:16.148
To see which couple gets to him first.

07:16.274 --> 07:19.318
Us or the vigilantes.
Assuming they're a couple.

07:20.362 --> 07:22.196
Assuming we're a couple.

07:23.907 --> 07:25.908
I can't assume anything right now.

07:26.952 --> 07:28.744
I'm gonna go review the rape DVDs.

07:28.870 --> 07:31.956
- What for?
- In case we missed anything.

07:32.082 --> 07:34.041
Or something can get us Jordan.

07:49.933 --> 07:52.810
Hello, Dexter. Nice to hear from you.

07:53.603 --> 07:56.147
Whatever you're thinking of doing,
it's not necessary.

07:56.273 --> 07:59.358
- We can work something out.
- Nice try.

07:59.484 --> 08:02.820
- What do you mean?
- The unemotional approach.

08:02.946 --> 08:05.906
But it's not working for you.
You're stressed. I can hear it in your voice.

08:06.533 --> 08:10.035
- She really means a lot to you, doesn't she?
- Yes.

08:10.162 --> 08:13.497
It must be terrible,
going through this again.

08:13.623 --> 08:16.167
Losing your wife, the woman you loved.

08:16.293 --> 08:17.793
And now Lumen.

08:17.919 --> 08:19.795
It's...

08:19.921 --> 08:23.716
I imagine it seems to you
like some kind of terrible curse.

08:25.218 --> 08:27.261
Think whatever you want.
Just listen to me.

08:27.387 --> 08:28.888
I'll turn myself over to you.

08:29.014 --> 08:32.474
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm afraid I must decline.

08:32.601 --> 08:35.394
- Then tell me what you want.
- I have what I want.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.731
And the longer I stay on the phone,
the better your chances of finding me.

08:38.857 --> 08:41.066
- So this conversation's over.
- Jordan.

08:41.193 --> 08:43.027
Tick-tick-tick, Dexter.

08:43.153 --> 08:45.571
That's the sound
of Lumen's life running out.

08:45.697 --> 08:47.990
So Lumen's still alive.

08:52.537 --> 08:55.664
Let me out!

09:08.553 --> 09:10.346
¡Oye! ¿Fruta?

09:11.932 --> 09:13.057
Shit.

09:22.609 --> 09:24.276
Jordan Chase!

09:32.953 --> 09:34.495
Come on, come on.

09:37.374 --> 09:39.250
¡Oye!

09:39.376 --> 09:40.334
¿Qué coño es eso?

10:35.432 --> 10:38.892
Jordan's real-estate holdings.
Lumen has to be at one of them.

10:39.019 --> 10:40.394
Hey.

10:41.604 --> 10:45.024
- Hey.
- Please! Stop!

10:45.150 --> 10:47.985
- Any luck on Jordan?
- No, not really.

10:48.945 --> 10:50.696
Except for that. You see that?

10:50.822 --> 10:54.908
You see how Cole keeps looking off
at somebody behind the camera?

10:55.744 --> 10:58.037
- You're right.
- He's not the only one, either.

10:58.163 --> 10:59.538
In all these videos, these bastards,

10:59.664 --> 11:04.084
they keep looking off as if to get approval
or instruction or something.

11:04.210 --> 11:07.463
- You think they're looking at Jordan?
- Who else would it be?

11:07.589 --> 11:12.217
It's what this guy does for a living. He tells
people what to do, how to live their lives.

11:12.344 --> 11:17.097
I know it's not any evidence or anything,
but he's there, he's there, I can feel it.

11:19.851 --> 11:23.687
- You shouldn't look at those any more.
- I have to fuckin' look at these things.

11:23.813 --> 11:27.483
I understand what these women
went through. Part of it, at least.

11:29.652 --> 11:33.030
I know what it is to be taken
by some sick bastard...

11:33.782 --> 11:35.240
She can't even say his name.

11:35.367 --> 11:37.242
Rudy. My brother.

11:37.369 --> 11:39.703
to know you're gonna die.

11:39.829 --> 11:44.166
Is this what I do?
Curse everyone around me?

11:44.292 --> 11:47.378
I have to work. If Jordan gets away with this
I can't live with myself.

11:47.504 --> 11:49.755
I know.

12:01.101 --> 12:03.435
Commercial real estate.

12:03.561 --> 12:06.105
Strip mall. Condos.

12:06.231 --> 12:08.232
Parking garages.

12:08.358 --> 12:10.901
Would you keep a hostage
in any of those places for two weeks?

12:11.027 --> 12:13.195
Where? Next to the doughnut shop?

12:13.321 --> 12:18.742
It's all too exposed.
Jordan must own other properties.

12:18.868 --> 12:21.453
- It's right in front of you.
- What?

12:21.579 --> 12:25.457
Remember your target,
where he came from, who he was.

12:26.751 --> 12:29.002
Jordan wasn't always Jordan Chase.

12:41.975 --> 12:43.392
Office of County Records.

12:43.518 --> 12:45.853
This is Dexter Morgan
with Miami Metro Homicide.

12:45.979 --> 12:47.938
I need a property records check.

12:48.064 --> 12:50.107
- Name?
- Eugene Greer.

12:50.233 --> 12:53.694
- Spell it.
- G-R-E-E-R.

12:53.820 --> 12:55.237
Check back with me tomorrow morning.

12:55.363 --> 12:57.156
No, this is an emergency.
I need it right away.

12:57.282 --> 12:58.991
There's no right away in this equation.

12:59.117 --> 13:01.618
I got a pile of shit ahead of me
and they're all emergencies.

13:01.744 --> 13:04.496
This isn't some developer
who's about to miss a filing deadline.

13:04.622 --> 13:08.375
A woman's life is on the line.
If you don't do this now, she will die

13:08.501 --> 13:11.670
and you could have done something
to stop it. Understand me? This can't wait.

13:11.796 --> 13:13.839
Everyone, I need your attention.

13:15.258 --> 13:16.633
Hello?

13:16.759 --> 13:21.430
Yeah. OK. I got your number. I'll get back
to you as soon as I have something.

13:21.556 --> 13:22.598
Thanks.

13:22.724 --> 13:25.100
We're rolling out to Bayfront Park.

13:25.226 --> 13:27.936
We have an officer down. Stan Liddy.

13:30.148 --> 13:32.691
- Liddy?
- Yes. He's dead.

13:32.817 --> 13:34.193
What do we know, Lieutenant?

13:34.319 --> 13:38.197
A pedestrian spotted blood coming
out of a parked van, called it in.

13:38.323 --> 13:40.365
Unis found Liddy's body inside.

13:41.117 --> 13:44.536
Morgan, Quinn, you're running point
on this, so take whoever you need.

13:44.662 --> 13:46.455
Anyone but me.

13:46.581 --> 13:50.167
Dexter, grab your kit.
There's a lot of blood.

13:50.293 --> 13:51.502
OK, that's all, people.

13:51.628 --> 13:54.296
Our crime scene's right across the bay
so we're taking the boat.

13:54.422 --> 13:56.465
Grab your gear and load up.

13:57.675 --> 13:59.843
Dex. Blood.

14:01.346 --> 14:05.641
Come on. The sooner we get this cleaned
up, the sooner I can get back on Chase.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.278
Sorry. You can't rest here.

14:59.404 --> 15:02.531
I know you're tired,
but it's just a little further.

15:37.609 --> 15:39.610
Jordan's had Lumen for 12 hours.

15:40.445 --> 15:42.529
Each second
I'm stuck on this slow boat

15:42.655 --> 15:46.241
going to my own crime scene
takes her farther away from me.

15:46.367 --> 15:49.161
Fate is hardly lending a hand.

15:57.629 --> 15:59.129
You OK?

16:03.718 --> 16:05.677
I know you and Liddy were friends.

16:05.803 --> 16:10.515
I helped him with a couple of things
but I wouldn't say he was an actual friend.

16:10.642 --> 16:13.727
It's just that you looked a little pale
when we left the station.

16:13.853 --> 16:15.812
I'm fine.

16:15.938 --> 16:18.190
You have any idea what
might have happened to him?

16:19.525 --> 16:22.527
Not a clue.
What about you?

16:22.654 --> 16:24.946
Any theories?

16:25.073 --> 16:27.199
I haven't examined the crime scene.

16:28.368 --> 16:29.868
Wild guess?

16:29.994 --> 16:34.289
I heard Liddy was kind of shady.
Maybe something came back to bite him.

16:35.249 --> 16:37.209
It's possible, I guess.

16:55.395 --> 16:58.230
Lieutenant, there's something
you really need to see.

16:58.356 --> 16:59.898
Holy shit.

17:01.609 --> 17:03.610
Someone really did a number on him.

17:05.154 --> 17:08.073
- Did you bring your full kit, Dex?
- Yep.

17:08.199 --> 17:10.575
And all my kill tools.

17:16.958 --> 17:19.960
Hey, if you're not up to this,
I can handle it.

17:23.131 --> 17:26.007
- What is it?
- I don't know how to say it.

17:27.093 --> 17:30.762
- Say what?
- Quinn, come with me, please.

17:33.725 --> 17:36.977
- What's going on?
- It's OK, Deb.

17:37.103 --> 17:40.647
You have a homicide to work, Detective.
Get to it.

17:48.948 --> 17:51.700
Looks like the van was rigged
with surveillance equipment.

17:51.826 --> 17:53.243
What the hell was Liddy watching?

17:53.369 --> 17:55.162
- Me.
- No way to tell.

17:55.288 --> 17:58.290
- Everything's been stripped clean.
- The killer covering his tracks.

17:58.416 --> 18:02.002
Seems to me we find out
who Liddy was spying on, we find our killer.

18:04.464 --> 18:06.548
The unis found Liddy's cellphone.

18:06.674 --> 18:09.342
The last five calls he made
were all to you.

18:09.469 --> 18:11.219
Want to tell me what that's about?

18:14.056 --> 18:16.099
The man had demons, Lieutenant.

18:16.225 --> 18:20.020
Your firing him didn't help. He just needed
someone to hear him out.

18:20.146 --> 18:21.772
I was the only friend he had left.

18:21.898 --> 18:24.858
OK, but he must have
kept calling you for a reason.

18:24.984 --> 18:27.611
- What was it?
- I didn't pick up.

18:27.737 --> 18:31.490
Then he would have left messages.
I need to hear them.

18:35.077 --> 18:36.745
Detective...

18:41.167 --> 18:42.626
That looks like blood.

18:51.677 --> 18:54.596
Quinn, you'd better start talking to me.

18:54.722 --> 18:58.058
I don't think I should say anything else.

18:58.184 --> 18:59.935
Not until I speak to a lawyer.

19:00.937 --> 19:02.687
A lawyer?

19:03.731 --> 19:05.023
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

19:12.949 --> 19:14.908
You can talk to your lawyer
back at the station.

19:15.034 --> 19:16.451
Officer.

19:17.495 --> 19:20.038
Escort Detective Quinn
back to Metro Homicide.

19:24.085 --> 19:26.670
- Dexter?
- Well, there's no castoff.

19:26.796 --> 19:30.257
We're looking at a single thrust,
expertly applied.

19:30.383 --> 19:31.842
Good to see I did something right.

19:31.968 --> 19:33.301
Passive blood pooling.

19:34.428 --> 19:37.848
I guess he was probably held down
as the knife went in.

19:37.974 --> 19:39.349
Died instantly.

19:40.726 --> 19:44.855
- So the killer knew what he was doing.
- Sure felt like it at the time.

19:50.736 --> 19:54.531
- Any idea what that's all about?
- None.

20:00.496 --> 20:01.580
Are you finished?

20:01.706 --> 20:05.542
Yeah, I got to catch a ride
back to the lab, run some tests.

20:05.668 --> 20:07.127
OK.

20:08.004 --> 20:10.547
Am I the only one who's
interested in this goddamn murder?

20:11.257 --> 20:13.174
- Hello?
- I got a hit.

20:13.301 --> 20:16.678
There's one property
belonging to a Eugene Greer.

20:16.804 --> 20:20.265
It's listed as a River Jordan Camp
for Boys and Girls.

20:20.391 --> 20:23.935
- River Jordan?
- It went bankrupt, like, 20 years ago.

20:24.061 --> 20:25.645
A camp.

20:25.771 --> 20:29.858
Jordan took Lumen back
to where it all started with Emily.

20:29.984 --> 20:32.611
- You still there?
- Yeah. You have an address?

20:32.737 --> 20:36.156
1530 Muralia Road.

20:36.282 --> 20:38.450
- Thanks.
- Any time.

20:44.832 --> 20:47.083
Where's Quinn going?

20:47.209 --> 20:49.044
- The station.
- Why?

20:49.629 --> 20:52.464
It looks like he may be
involved in Liddy's murder.

20:52.590 --> 20:54.925
- That's crazy.
- I know. It is.

20:55.051 --> 20:57.344
- But he requested an attorney.
- An attorney?

20:57.470 --> 21:00.764
Has Quinn said anything to you about Liddy,
anything I should know about?

21:00.890 --> 21:03.224
No. Nothing.

21:03.351 --> 21:04.935
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No.

21:05.061 --> 21:07.520
You're gonna stay here and do your job.

21:07.647 --> 21:09.314
I hope I'm wrong about Quinn,

21:09.440 --> 21:13.902
but right now we need to process the scene
and find out what really happened.

21:43.975 --> 21:46.059
You remember this place?

21:47.812 --> 21:49.688
Should feel like home.

22:00.574 --> 22:04.411
Well, don't worry.
It'll all come back to you.

22:07.748 --> 22:10.500
- What are you gonna do to me?
- What do you think?

22:12.503 --> 22:14.504
What choice have you left me?

22:14.630 --> 22:17.298
The two of you. Hm?

22:19.093 --> 22:21.636
I spoke with Dexter on the phone.

22:23.806 --> 22:26.516
I let him know that you're alive...

22:26.642 --> 22:28.643
in need.

22:30.354 --> 22:32.355
I motivated him.

22:33.107 --> 22:34.649
Hm!

22:36.360 --> 22:37.902
Now, will he come for you?

22:41.907 --> 22:45.493
You know best, but I believe he will.

22:49.081 --> 22:50.582
And then what?

22:52.626 --> 22:55.378
We'll be joyously reunited.

22:56.255 --> 22:57.756
The three of us.

23:12.396 --> 23:13.688
Hm!

23:14.982 --> 23:16.191
Mm.

23:17.068 --> 23:20.779
You've changed since I saw you here
last time. You know that?

23:22.239 --> 23:26.326
You... You've got this look in your eye.

23:29.455 --> 23:32.040
Did you learn that from him?

23:44.929 --> 23:46.471
Well?

23:49.475 --> 23:53.144
- I thought you just liked to watch.
- Well, maybe I'm changing.

23:53.270 --> 23:55.438
Like you.

24:18.045 --> 24:19.754
Oh, God!

24:25.553 --> 24:28.096
- Where's Quinn?
- Interrogation room.

24:28.222 --> 24:29.806
Waiting for his attorney.

24:29.932 --> 24:32.684
- Did he say anything?
- No.

24:32.810 --> 24:35.353
It's not getting any better for him.

24:35.479 --> 24:37.480
What does that mean?

24:40.693 --> 24:43.027
His name's on the requisition forms

24:43.154 --> 24:46.865
for the surveillance equipment
we found in Liddy's van.

24:46.991 --> 24:49.409
What about the fingerprints
we lifted off the van?

24:49.535 --> 24:51.828
Aside from Liddy's they're all Quinn's.

24:52.496 --> 24:54.956
- I want to talk to him.
- Feel free to try.

24:55.082 --> 24:57.083
He won't speak to any of us.

25:13.142 --> 25:14.726
You shouldn't be here, Deb.

25:14.852 --> 25:18.855
- LaGuerta says you asked for a lawyer.
- That's right.

25:18.981 --> 25:22.942
Before your lawyer gets here, why don't you
tell me what the fuck is going on?

25:24.361 --> 25:26.529
I think I'd better just keep my mouth shut.

25:27.698 --> 25:30.200
I'm not asking you as a detective.

25:31.785 --> 25:36.247
I'm asking you as someone you live with,
someone that you said you loved.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.628
I think I deserve to know
what the fuck is going on.

25:43.547 --> 25:47.258
All I can tell you
is that I didn't kill Liddy.

25:47.384 --> 25:50.803
- But you were there.
- It's not what it looks like.

25:50.930 --> 25:54.015
- It looks like you did it.
- I know.

25:56.060 --> 25:58.311
If you didn't kill Liddy, who did?

26:01.190 --> 26:04.442
I can't say anything else. I'm sorry.

26:04.568 --> 26:06.527
Don't say you're sorry.

26:07.988 --> 26:10.156
Just tell me the fucking truth.

26:12.910 --> 26:15.245
You should go work on finding Jordan.

26:36.558 --> 26:38.810
Jordan Chase was goading you
on the phone,

26:38.936 --> 26:40.728
trying to get you to make a mistake.

26:40.854 --> 26:42.647
- He'll be waiting for you.
- I know.

26:42.773 --> 26:44.857
You need to stay alert, pay attention.

26:44.984 --> 26:46.651
You don't know what he's planning for you.

26:46.777 --> 26:48.278
Same thing I'm planning for him.

26:48.404 --> 26:50.154
Yeah, but on his home turf.

26:50.281 --> 26:53.116
Don't underestimate your adversary,
Dexter, not again.

26:53.242 --> 26:55.535
Could you just trust me for once?

26:55.661 --> 26:57.120
Shit!

27:48.172 --> 27:49.797
Surprise.

27:57.681 --> 27:58.931
Get up.

28:07.399 --> 28:11.235
- Hey. You OK?
- Yeah. Fine.

28:12.529 --> 28:15.239
- You look tired.
- Thanks.

28:16.492 --> 28:18.618
Look, like I said,

28:18.744 --> 28:22.663
we'll know more after Dexter
tests the blood on Quinn's shoe.

28:22.790 --> 28:25.958
In the meantime, have some faith.

28:27.711 --> 28:28.711
Faith?

28:28.837 --> 28:32.256
Whatever you call it.
Don't assume the worst.

28:46.605 --> 28:48.606
- Detective Morgan?
- Yeah.

28:48.732 --> 28:51.442
Sorry for intruding.
It's from your stake and notify.

28:51.568 --> 28:53.611
- Should I put it on your desk?
- What is it?

28:53.737 --> 28:55.863
Someone said
they spotted Jordan Chase.

28:57.282 --> 29:00.076
- A street vendor?
- Yeah, up by Muralia Road.

29:00.202 --> 29:04.038
He thought he heard noises coming from
the trunk. That's why he called it in.

29:04.164 --> 29:05.998
I know, sounds unlikely.

29:06.125 --> 29:08.709
Yeah. Maybe I'll check it out. Thanks.

29:35.946 --> 29:38.698
It was inevitable that this would happen.

29:40.367 --> 29:42.118
Two broken people

29:42.244 --> 29:45.913
going through intense shared experience
against a common enemy.

29:46.039 --> 29:48.124
I do it in my seminars all the time.

29:48.250 --> 29:52.086
It produces a sense of deep, deep bonding.

29:52.212 --> 29:57.258
I'm sure you feel like you actually
have something, even... love,

29:57.384 --> 29:58.551
doesn't it?

29:58.677 --> 29:59.677
Let her go.

29:59.803 --> 30:03.264
You lost your wife, Rita.
You blamed yourself, sure.

30:04.349 --> 30:08.686
And you thought what? That you could
make up for that by helping her?

30:09.771 --> 30:12.398
- No.
- Well, then, what were you thinking?

30:12.524 --> 30:14.275
That you could be a hero?

30:16.653 --> 30:21.491
Hm. You can't save one thing
to make up for another, Dexter.

30:21.617 --> 30:24.494
It's not the way the world works.

30:28.624 --> 30:30.333
Wow.

30:35.422 --> 30:37.798
I look at these, and...

30:37.925 --> 30:41.636
I can't help but think that you
have a kind of greatness in you.

30:41.762 --> 30:45.306
Then I look at you,
and you're no different

30:45.432 --> 30:47.808
than the idiots
that show up at my seminars.

30:48.519 --> 30:50.019
Totally lost.

30:54.107 --> 30:56.651
I'm gonna put you out of your misery.

31:01.907 --> 31:03.115
Both of you.

31:18.173 --> 31:21.300
You fucking,
motherfucking...

31:33.480 --> 31:38.693
Era él, el hombre en la televisión.
Jordan Chase. Estaba esperando las luces.

31:38.819 --> 31:42.238
- He was waiting for the traffic light?
- Sí.

31:42.364 --> 31:48.035
And what about the noise in the trunk?
I fuckin' swear I'm taking Spanish after this.

31:48.161 --> 31:50.913
The sound in the... uh...

31:51.039 --> 31:52.331
uh... trunko?

31:52.457 --> 31:56.669
Oh, sí, tiene algo en el maletero.
¡Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!

31:56.795 --> 31:58.629
- Bang, bang, bang! From the trunk?
- Sí.

31:58.755 --> 32:00.756
Which... Which way did... Uh...

32:00.882 --> 32:02.508
¿Don... Donde fue?

32:03.218 --> 32:04.719
What's down that way?

32:07.389 --> 32:09.473
- ¿Qué?
- Nada mucho, un campamento.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.434
A campamento?

32:11.560 --> 32:13.436
- A camp?
- Sí, camp.

32:14.479 --> 32:15.771
Thank you.

32:15.897 --> 32:17.148
Uh... Gracias.

32:26.533 --> 32:28.159
You'll want to be awake for this.

32:30.120 --> 32:33.581
What do you call it?
Being present in the moment?

32:33.707 --> 32:35.708
So you were listening? Mm?

32:35.834 --> 32:39.837
I heard the words, but to be honest...

32:41.340 --> 32:44.091
you have to consider the source.

32:55.228 --> 32:57.313
You should be the one to do it.

32:59.900 --> 33:01.484
Is that OK with you?

33:03.153 --> 33:04.487
He's yours.

33:04.613 --> 33:06.906
Oh!

33:07.032 --> 33:08.157
Please!

33:09.576 --> 33:14.872
You're acting like there's some polite way
to do this, some-some etiquette.

33:16.083 --> 33:20.586
Killing is killing, Dexter.
Let's at least be honest about that.

33:20.712 --> 33:23.464
You're being honest, Eugene?

33:24.341 --> 33:27.885
You think that's an insult?
It's a compliment.

33:28.011 --> 33:30.638
It's a reminder of how far I've come.

33:30.764 --> 33:32.139
And how far is that?

33:32.265 --> 33:35.559
You're right back where you started,
only this time you're strapped to a table.

33:35.686 --> 33:38.104
- I'm transformed.
- You will be soon.

33:38.230 --> 33:41.273
Not just me. You, Lumen...

33:44.027 --> 33:46.404
You don't get to use my name.

33:48.824 --> 33:53.703
Really? If we're not on a first-name basis,
the three of us, then who is?

33:53.829 --> 33:55.037
Look at you.

33:55.163 --> 33:58.040
You're transformed too.
You're beautiful.

33:58.166 --> 33:59.375
And you know what?

33:59.501 --> 34:02.837
If you hadn't met me, you would
never have known you had it in you.

34:02.963 --> 34:05.798
- I wouldn't have had it in me...
- Well, now you do!

34:05.924 --> 34:07.216
Shut up!

34:12.264 --> 34:15.683
It's truly amazing.
You should thank me.

34:15.809 --> 34:17.977
That's not what's gonna happen.

34:18.103 --> 34:21.230
I watched you so carefully
the last time you were here.

34:21.356 --> 34:23.524
You used to just cower and cry!

34:27.821 --> 34:31.031
That's not just for me.
That's for everyone that you hurt.

34:31.992 --> 34:34.785
Even Emily. Do you hear me?

34:36.705 --> 34:37.955
Do you hear me?

34:53.221 --> 34:56.766
I'm sorry. I know that's not
how you're supposed to do it.

34:58.185 --> 35:02.772
Well, he was right about that part.
There is no polite way.

35:30.926 --> 35:33.385
Maybe we should just
leave the body here.

35:33.512 --> 35:35.805
We don't want a murder investigation.

35:36.765 --> 35:39.266
We want closure.

35:40.352 --> 35:41.936
So he just vanishes like the others?

35:42.062 --> 35:45.481
Jordan's car is outside.
We'll use it to move the body.

35:46.107 --> 35:48.150
Then maybe a month from now

35:48.276 --> 35:51.278
we'll tip off Miami Metro
about this place.

35:52.405 --> 35:54.865
Everyone will know what he's done.

36:40.245 --> 36:42.246
Don't move.

36:42.372 --> 36:43.998
Don't fucking move.

36:46.626 --> 36:49.169
Whatever's in your arms, drop it now.

36:50.839 --> 36:52.423
Both of you.

37:05.020 --> 37:06.770
I know who you are.

37:09.733 --> 37:11.525
Number 13.

37:11.651 --> 37:14.320
And I know what they did to you.

37:15.780 --> 37:17.448
I've seen the tapes.

37:18.241 --> 37:20.576
I watched them over and over.

37:25.290 --> 37:27.291
It's a miracle you survived.

37:28.668 --> 37:30.669
A fucking miracle.

37:31.546 --> 37:37.384
And you, whoever you are,
you know that too.

37:43.934 --> 37:47.645
I said, don't fucking move!

37:51.733 --> 37:54.693
Maybe it's true
some people deserve to die,

37:56.112 --> 37:59.657
but I'm a cop, and I don't
make that fucking decision.

38:01.284 --> 38:03.661
So I'm gonna call this in.

38:05.956 --> 38:09.625
In an hour, this place
will be swarming with police.

38:16.549 --> 38:18.926
If I were you, I'd be gone by then.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.227
I don't know what you did or didn't do.

39:10.353 --> 39:13.147
And for some reason you're not saying.

39:14.733 --> 39:16.775
But I'm not judging.

39:19.112 --> 39:23.198
I can't judge. Not any more.

39:26.077 --> 39:28.412
What do you mean?

39:28.538 --> 39:30.330
Did something happen?

39:33.251 --> 39:35.002
Yes.

39:36.963 --> 39:39.923
A lot, actually.
A lot that I don't understand.

39:41.968 --> 39:45.763
You know how LaGuerta keeps
saying everything's complicated?

39:48.224 --> 39:50.100
I'm starting to believe her.

39:52.270 --> 39:55.606
- I'm glad you're here.
- Are you?

39:57.358 --> 39:59.234
More than you know.

40:00.361 --> 40:02.946
I'll be here, no matter what happens.

40:28.431 --> 40:30.766
Did you ever think we'd get here?

40:33.561 --> 40:36.939
- You didn't?
- Not really, no.

40:37.065 --> 40:40.359
I mean, for a while there I wasn't sure.

40:42.654 --> 40:45.239
It's like what your sister said.

40:46.116 --> 40:48.617
It's a miracle.

40:48.743 --> 40:51.078
It's a fucking miracle.

41:08.471 --> 41:10.097
Home?

42:52.075 --> 42:55.827
I thought you'd be getting ready
for Harrison's birthday.

42:55.954 --> 42:57.913
LaGuerta said this couldn't wait.

42:58.039 --> 43:01.208
She also said
you broke the barrel girls case.

43:01.334 --> 43:02.626
I didn't break it.

43:02.752 --> 43:07.214
I found the place
where they shot the DVDs,

43:07.340 --> 43:09.800
this camp where everything happened.

43:09.926 --> 43:13.804
Jordan's missing, though.
Just like the rest of them.

43:13.930 --> 43:16.181
Think it was your vigilantes?

43:18.726 --> 43:20.310
Maybe.

43:21.479 --> 43:24.147
At least then we'd know he was dead.

43:25.191 --> 43:27.276
That's just a crazy theory.

43:33.241 --> 43:34.658
What about that?

43:34.784 --> 43:37.577
The blood on Quinn's shoe,
is it Liddy's?

43:40.081 --> 43:42.040
I haven't run it yet.

43:42.166 --> 43:44.668
Do you think it is?

43:46.337 --> 43:47.796
I don't know.

43:51.634 --> 43:53.760
You think you know someone...

43:56.431 --> 43:58.515
and then it turns out you don't.

44:00.810 --> 44:03.979
You think someone's a good cop
and then they...

44:06.566 --> 44:08.608
do something.

44:11.154 --> 44:15.824
I don't know. All I'm saying is...
nothing is as simple as it seems.

44:17.827 --> 44:19.995
You're right about that.

44:20.705 --> 44:22.706
Tell me as soon as you know.

44:40.850 --> 44:42.893
I know already.

44:48.024 --> 44:50.317
Hey, you're up.

44:50.443 --> 44:55.197
I bought some stuff for pancakes.

44:55.323 --> 44:59.826
You don't know this about me, but I'm
actually kind of a breakfast connoisseur.

45:01.412 --> 45:04.748
The party's today. Harrison's birthday.

45:05.333 --> 45:07.042
You'll get to meet Cody, finally.

45:07.168 --> 45:09.503
Actually, you'll get to meet a lot of people.

45:09.629 --> 45:11.838
Everybody from the station.

45:11.964 --> 45:15.675
Oh, and the kids want to spend
the whole summer here,

45:15.802 --> 45:19.221
so we should probably talk about that.

45:24.769 --> 45:28.188
What? What is it?

45:32.443 --> 45:34.778
I didn't sleep at all last night.

45:36.239 --> 45:39.533
First I was wondering
what was happening to me,

45:39.659 --> 45:45.080
and then I was...
wondering how I could possibly tell you.

45:45.748 --> 45:47.249
Tell me what?

45:51.254 --> 45:53.171
I have to leave.

45:56.050 --> 45:58.427
- What?
- Today.

46:01.347 --> 46:03.974
- You can't.
- I have to.

46:06.185 --> 46:10.397
When I saw Jordan Chase's body
disappearing into the ocean, I...

46:11.524 --> 46:13.108
Something happened.

46:13.734 --> 46:15.944
And...

46:16.070 --> 46:18.989
all night I was trying to figure out...

46:19.115 --> 46:21.158
what was happening,

46:22.618 --> 46:25.287
and I tried to hold on to it.

46:27.206 --> 46:30.584
But... this morning I...

46:32.962 --> 46:35.255
I could tell it was gone.

46:38.759 --> 46:40.760
I don't feel it any more.

46:42.847 --> 46:44.681
The need.

46:45.766 --> 46:49.186
Her dark passenger. It's vanished.

46:51.230 --> 46:53.231
Say something.

46:55.234 --> 46:56.776
Please?

46:58.946 --> 47:02.574
Anything. Just...
Just talk to me.

47:05.745 --> 47:08.413
Don't go. You can't.

47:08.539 --> 47:10.957
I don't want to.

47:11.876 --> 47:14.336
Then don't. Stay here.

47:15.588 --> 47:19.007
I can't do it any more,
what we've been doing.

47:19.133 --> 47:21.176
You don't have to.

47:21.302 --> 47:24.513
But you do. Right?

47:27.099 --> 47:29.184
We both know that.

47:34.607 --> 47:36.608
It's who you are.

48:09.058 --> 48:11.059
You're right.

48:15.314 --> 48:18.024
About everything, you're right.

48:23.364 --> 48:25.365
We're not the same.

48:28.953 --> 48:30.579
I'm so sorry.

48:32.081 --> 48:33.873
Don't be.

48:37.086 --> 48:39.838
Don't be sorry your darkness is gone.

48:46.429 --> 48:48.430
I'll carry it for you.

48:50.057 --> 48:51.933
Always.

48:56.439 --> 48:58.440
I'll keep it with mine.

49:23.966 --> 49:25.967
Happy birthday, Harrison.

49:37.104 --> 49:39.230
Happy anniversary.

49:40.524 --> 49:44.110
Thank you.
Only it's not our anniversary.

49:45.196 --> 49:49.699
I saw you. With Deb. Trying so hard.

49:51.327 --> 49:53.828
It makes me want to do the same.

49:55.665 --> 49:58.291
Want to give it another shot?
Go back to the beginning?

49:58.417 --> 50:00.418
Yes.

50:02.546 --> 50:04.339
Yes.

50:19.271 --> 50:21.648
Dexterous!

50:23.651 --> 50:27.487
So, Dex, be honest with me.

50:27.613 --> 50:30.490
Is it weird to bring a date
to a first birthday party?

50:31.742 --> 50:35.453
No, Vince. I'm glad you brought her.

50:35.579 --> 50:38.957
Oh, no, I didn't mean me.
I meant your sister.

50:42.211 --> 50:47.590
There she is! The detective
who solved the barrel girls case.

50:55.307 --> 50:56.474
Thank you.

50:58.394 --> 51:01.271
- For what?
- The blood work.

51:02.398 --> 51:03.940
Just doing my job.

51:04.066 --> 51:07.694
Yeah, well, that was
the one thing hanging me up.

51:07.820 --> 51:09.237
I owe you one.

51:12.616 --> 51:14.200
I'm gonna go get a drink.

51:19.415 --> 51:22.417
You could have told me sooner
that the blood work cleared him.

51:22.543 --> 51:26.713
Channels. LaGuerta wanted
to give you the good news.

51:30.760 --> 51:33.928
- You don't like Quinn much.
- I don't like Quinn at all.

51:35.890 --> 51:38.057
But I want you to be happy.

51:39.059 --> 51:41.478
I am. I'm happy.

51:43.272 --> 51:44.939
You must be too.

51:45.858 --> 51:48.443
Now that this is all over, I mean.

51:54.492 --> 51:56.493
They make it look so easy...

52:02.041 --> 52:04.626
connecting with another human being.

52:08.422 --> 52:11.883
It's like no-one told them
it's the hardest thing in the world.

52:53.384 --> 52:54.592
Where is she?

52:56.178 --> 52:58.763
Your tenant
who was staying at the house.

53:00.724 --> 53:02.684
She left.

53:02.810 --> 53:04.519
I'm sorry.

53:06.480 --> 53:08.314
Did you do it?

53:09.275 --> 53:10.984
What you wanted to do?

53:11.110 --> 53:13.278
You said she needed your help.

53:14.113 --> 53:15.363
Did you help her?

53:18.200 --> 53:20.201
Yeah. I think I did.

53:21.287 --> 53:23.371
And did it work?

53:24.331 --> 53:26.875
Did it make you feel better?

53:27.001 --> 53:28.835
About what happened to Mom?

53:29.962 --> 53:32.338
You can't do one thing
to make up for another.

53:32.464 --> 53:35.008
That's what Jordan Chase says.

53:35.134 --> 53:38.094
But he's wrong,
because we do that all the time.

53:39.179 --> 53:42.932
That is the way the world works.
We try to make things right.

53:44.518 --> 53:46.311
Even me.

53:47.104 --> 53:50.273
Come on, everybody,
it's time for the cake.

53:50.399 --> 53:51.441
Dexter.

53:57.239 --> 53:59.198
Are you ready?

53:59.992 --> 54:01.951
Lumen said I gave her
her life back,

54:02.077 --> 54:04.287
a reversal of my usual role.

54:04.413 --> 54:07.165
Well, the fact is,
she gave me mine back too.

54:07.291 --> 54:11.586
And I'm left not with what she took from me,
but with what she brought.

54:12.171 --> 54:16.466
Eyes that saw me, finally,
for who I really am.

54:16.592 --> 54:21.054
And this certainty that nothing,
nothing is set in stone.

54:21.180 --> 54:23.473
Not even darkness.

54:24.808 --> 54:26.726
While she was here,
she made me think,

54:26.852 --> 54:30.480
for the briefest moment, that I might even
have a chance to be human.

54:30.606 --> 54:33.107
Make a wish. Make a wish.

54:33.233 --> 54:36.653
One, two...

54:36.779 --> 54:38.446
Make a wish.

54:38.572 --> 54:41.991
But wishes, of course, are for children.

54:42.117 --> 54:44.535
three!
