WEBVTT

00:10.321 --> 00:11.354
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

00:11.889 --> 00:13.556
We are going to...

00:13.590 --> 00:15.057
All: Take it!

00:15.092 --> 00:18.094
Cole Harmon,
Chase's chief of security...

00:18.128 --> 00:20.663
torturer, rapist, killer.

00:20.697 --> 00:22.798
It's time to tap into
my primal self.

00:22.833 --> 00:23.966
Why did you want to see me?

00:24.001 --> 00:25.668
I am very interested
in what happened to you.

00:25.702 --> 00:29.071
I would like to discuss your
situation in-depth at another time.

00:29.106 --> 00:32.141
Our informant, Yasmin Aragon,
was shot and killed.

00:32.176 --> 00:33.910
This is a fucking disaster!

00:33.944 --> 00:36.512
If mistakes were made, they
most certainly were not mine.

00:36.547 --> 00:38.314
I can confirm
that Detective Morgan

00:38.348 --> 00:39.916
was in charge of the operation.

00:39.950 --> 00:41.684
As of today, she's being placed

00:41.718 --> 00:43.686
on immediate suspension
with pay.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.588
It's just your word
against mine.

00:45.622 --> 00:48.658
Some people don't agree
with your version of the events.

00:48.692 --> 00:50.760
Who did you get to lie for you?

00:50.794 --> 00:52.995
It was you.

00:53.030 --> 00:54.263
Don't you want to know
about this girl

00:54.298 --> 00:55.665
shacked up with Dexter Morgan?

00:55.699 --> 00:58.034
Name: Lumen Pierce.

00:58.068 --> 01:00.870
Lumen shows up here
in Miami one week

01:00.904 --> 01:04.807
before your boy's wife,
Rita Morgan, is murdered.

01:04.841 --> 01:06.676
Aah!

01:06.710 --> 01:08.377
You fuckin' bitch!

01:10.447 --> 01:11.547
Who are the others?

01:11.582 --> 01:14.183
The guy who held a watch
up to my ear.

01:14.218 --> 01:15.685
Tick-tick-tick.

01:15.719 --> 01:17.653
"That's the sound
of your life running out. "

01:21.558 --> 01:23.526
It's what I tell my clients.

01:23.560 --> 01:24.860
Tick-tick-tick.

01:24.895 --> 01:27.897
That's the sound
of your life running out.

01:27.931 --> 01:29.498
Jordan Chase is one of them.

01:29.533 --> 01:31.734
We're gonna take down
Jordan Chase?

03:31.166 --> 03:34.968
On a good day, when I run, the
voices in my head get quieter

03:35.003 --> 03:40.040
until it's just me, my breath,
and my feet on the sand.

03:45.180 --> 03:46.914
Pick up the pace, Dexter.

03:46.948 --> 03:51.251
Today is not one of those days.

03:51.286 --> 03:53.921
When I scheduled a private
session with Jordan Chase,

03:53.955 --> 03:56.523
I wasn't looking for advice.
Just proof.

03:56.558 --> 04:00.527
Evidence of exactly how he was
involved in Lumen's torture,

04:00.562 --> 04:03.297
because the code
requires certainty.

04:03.331 --> 04:04.431
Faster, Dex.

04:04.466 --> 04:06.467
I just wanted access
to his office,

04:06.501 --> 04:09.369
the inner sanctum
where I could find clues.

04:09.404 --> 04:13.173
Instead, I'm stuck here,
running in place.

04:13.208 --> 04:16.777
Look, I get it.
You're frustrated.

04:16.811 --> 04:19.113
You feel like you're not getting
what you came here for.

04:19.147 --> 04:21.014
Yeah, a bit.

04:21.049 --> 04:22.716
Intense exercise works.

04:22.751 --> 04:26.887
Tears down your defenses,
brings out your feelings.

04:26.921 --> 04:29.156
Well, I have the feeling
that I'd be more comfortable

04:29.190 --> 04:30.524
talking on a couch.

04:34.195 --> 04:37.498
Trust me, this is the way
to build a new you.

04:39.534 --> 04:44.571
At the seminar, we went over how
tragedy fractures us, right?

04:44.606 --> 04:45.572
Yeah.

04:45.607 --> 04:47.875
We're like Humpty Dumpty.

04:47.909 --> 04:48.976
And the big fall.

04:49.010 --> 04:53.914
What I'm telling you now is
trauma is also opportunity.

04:53.948 --> 04:56.583
Tragedy tears us apart, sure.

04:56.618 --> 04:59.186
But it's your one chance
to recreate yourself.

04:59.220 --> 05:01.889
You get to put yourself back
together again any way you want.

05:01.923 --> 05:04.224
Okay.

05:04.259 --> 05:06.426
Don't be skeptical.
I know it for a fact.

05:07.595 --> 05:09.296
How?
What happened to you?

05:09.330 --> 05:11.165
You didn't come here
to talk about me.

05:11.199 --> 05:12.733
Something big
must have happened

05:12.767 --> 05:14.768
if it inspired
your entire philosophy.

05:18.573 --> 05:20.808
Okay, I'll tell you
where it started

05:20.842 --> 05:22.509
if you promise
to keep it between us.

05:25.513 --> 05:26.480
Plato.

05:26.514 --> 05:28.315
What?

05:28.349 --> 05:30.083
The notion of a fractured self.

05:30.118 --> 05:32.219
<i>It's from Plato's Symposium.
You ever read it?</i>

05:32.253 --> 05:34.555
Maybe in college.

05:34.589 --> 05:35.889
But you don't remember it,
right?

05:35.924 --> 05:37.257
Most people don't.

05:37.292 --> 05:39.493
But for me,
it was a revelation.

05:39.527 --> 05:41.562
It was exactly what
I needed at the time.

05:41.596 --> 05:45.032
So... I took it.

05:45.066 --> 05:47.568
I took Plato's idea
that we are fractured creatures,

05:47.602 --> 05:49.970
trying to become whole,
and I ran with it.

05:50.004 --> 05:52.139
Boom, a million copies sold.

05:56.578 --> 05:58.946
So... Now you know my secret.

05:58.980 --> 06:01.615
You ready to tell me yours?

06:03.718 --> 06:06.220
Over your dead body.

06:06.254 --> 06:08.655
An hour on the treadmill,
and I came up empty.

06:08.690 --> 06:10.524
Not a clue.

06:10.558 --> 06:13.493
Only upside is I got in
my cardio for the day.

06:13.528 --> 06:15.796
Jordan is one tough nut
to crack.

06:15.830 --> 06:18.599
You're one tough nut to crack,
you know that, Dexter?

06:18.633 --> 06:20.033
I wish he'd stop doing that.

06:20.068 --> 06:23.337
We ran for an hour.
You didn't give up anything.

06:23.371 --> 06:26.373
I know you're in killer shape,
but you can't outrun me forever.

06:26.407 --> 06:29.710
You have to give me
something to work with.

06:29.744 --> 06:32.913
Otherwise...
How can I help you?

06:32.947 --> 06:35.182
Maybe you can't.

06:35.216 --> 06:37.217
Or maybe you can.

06:37.252 --> 06:38.852
Is that blood?

06:41.322 --> 06:42.456
No pressure.

06:42.490 --> 06:45.792
It can take several meetings for
us to have a real breakthrough.

06:45.827 --> 06:47.995
But I do need your commitment.

06:48.029 --> 06:49.897
I need to get my hands
on that vial.

06:49.931 --> 06:53.367
Otherwise, we're just
wasting our time.

06:53.401 --> 06:56.270
I really think
I can help you, though.

06:56.304 --> 06:57.704
I think so too.

06:57.739 --> 06:59.673
When can I get in
to see you again?

06:59.707 --> 07:01.541
Check with my receptionist
on the way out.

07:01.576 --> 07:03.844
I think I may have an opening
tomorrow morning.

07:16.124 --> 07:17.090
Well, that was lucky.

07:17.125 --> 07:18.892
10:00 A. M. tomorrow.

07:18.927 --> 07:21.528
He doesn't have anything else
for the next two weeks.

07:21.562 --> 07:24.498
- Perfect.
- See you tomorrow.

07:24.532 --> 07:26.600
I didn't notice you last time.
You new here?

07:26.634 --> 07:28.268
Just started three days ago.

07:28.303 --> 07:30.938
I don't remember
so much security either.

07:30.972 --> 07:34.341
Mr. Chase says
he's beefing things up.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.310
That's no surprise.

07:36.344 --> 07:40.614
Lumen and I have been knocking
off his friends one by one.

07:42.150 --> 07:43.984
How many security guards?

07:44.018 --> 07:46.186
I don't know.
Maybe a dozen.

07:46.220 --> 07:47.554
But you think
that you can still

07:47.588 --> 07:49.389
get to the blood
necklace thing, right?

07:49.424 --> 07:51.291
Yeah. While Jordan's
in the shower.

07:51.326 --> 07:53.327
Won't he notice
if it's missing?

07:53.361 --> 07:54.561
No, I'm not gonna swipe it.

07:54.595 --> 07:56.563
I'm just gonna extract
a sample.

07:56.597 --> 07:58.732
I'll run it for DNA,
hopefully get an I. D.

07:58.766 --> 08:00.367
Run it for DNA.

08:00.401 --> 08:03.103
God, I love that
you can do that.

08:03.137 --> 08:05.272
So whose blood
do you think it is?

08:05.306 --> 08:08.208
- If it is blood.
- Most likely a victim.

08:08.242 --> 08:09.910
Whatever it is,
it's important to him.

08:09.944 --> 08:12.112
He's wearing it around his neck.

08:12.146 --> 08:13.780
It's definitely
some kind of trophy.

08:16.684 --> 08:18.785
Are you there?

08:18.820 --> 08:20.787
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

08:20.822 --> 08:22.956
There's someone
at the kitchen door.

08:24.892 --> 08:27.027
- They're trying to get in.
- Go out the front door.

08:27.061 --> 08:30.030
I'll be there in a few minutes.

08:30.064 --> 08:31.865
Dexter, there's someone
there too.

08:31.899 --> 08:33.033
Hide.

08:33.067 --> 08:34.601
- Where?
- In the bathroom.

08:34.635 --> 08:36.336
I'll get there
as fast as I can.

08:45.246 --> 08:46.980
What's happening?

08:49.384 --> 08:51.118
They're inside.

08:51.152 --> 08:52.652
What?

08:59.560 --> 09:01.128
They're coming!

09:01.162 --> 09:03.930
Put the phone down.
Leave the line open.

09:26.687 --> 09:28.221
Jesus!

09:28.256 --> 09:29.456
Who the fuck are you?

09:29.490 --> 09:30.891
Who the fuck are you?

09:30.925 --> 09:33.326
Who the fuck is she?

09:33.361 --> 09:35.595
You wanna try that again,
Astor?

09:35.630 --> 09:37.998
Who is she?

09:38.032 --> 09:40.000
Her name is Lumen.

09:40.034 --> 09:41.868
I mean who is she?
Why is she here?

09:41.903 --> 09:44.571
She's... Renting the house.

09:44.605 --> 09:45.839
You said the house was empty.

09:45.873 --> 09:48.175
Thought it was.

09:48.209 --> 09:51.178
How was I supposed to know
he got a girlfriend so fast?

09:51.212 --> 09:52.345
First of all,
she's not my girlfriend.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.281
She's a tenant, like I said.

09:54.315 --> 09:56.149
Second of all, who are you?

09:56.184 --> 10:00.153
I'm Olivia.
I live near her grandparents.

10:00.188 --> 10:02.055
Anyone wanna tell me
how you got here?

10:02.090 --> 10:03.423
Taxi.

10:03.458 --> 10:05.025
It's 215 miles.

10:05.059 --> 10:08.295
From a bus station.

10:09.430 --> 10:11.364
Where'd you get the liquor?

10:11.399 --> 10:14.000
- Does it matter?
- Yeah, I'd say so.

10:14.035 --> 10:17.437
- You're 12.
- You said you were 14!

10:17.472 --> 10:19.439
Thanks a lot.

10:19.474 --> 10:23.210
If you really wanna know,
we stole it from my house.

10:23.244 --> 10:25.178
That's reassuring.

10:25.213 --> 10:27.681
I think I need to sit down.

10:31.185 --> 10:33.753
Do your parents know
where you are?

10:33.788 --> 10:35.422
My mom thinks I'm at Astor's.

10:35.456 --> 10:39.059
Oh. Let me guess, your grandparents
think you're at Olivia's.

10:39.093 --> 10:40.861
Don't call 'em.

10:40.895 --> 10:42.729
Please.

10:42.763 --> 10:45.265
At least not until tomorrow.

10:45.299 --> 10:49.136
They should really
stay the night and sober up.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.670
Then I'll stay too.

10:50.705 --> 10:53.173
With her?

10:53.207 --> 10:55.208
Oh.

10:55.243 --> 10:59.546
I think I'm gonna... |

10:59.580 --> 11:01.715
Here. Come with me.

11:01.749 --> 11:04.217
I'll get you to bed, okay?

11:14.962 --> 11:18.064
Quite a situation we have here.

11:18.099 --> 11:20.734
Unless you have advice
on dealing with teenage girls,

11:20.768 --> 11:22.302
I don't want to hear it.

11:22.336 --> 11:24.738
My advice...
Get Astor out of here.

11:24.772 --> 11:27.407
Tomorrow morning
you're collecting evidence

11:27.441 --> 11:30.076
on a violent murderer
you plan to kill.

11:30.111 --> 11:32.279
You really want a hung-over
preteen in the middle of that?

11:32.313 --> 11:35.215
- She came here.
- Drunk!

11:35.249 --> 11:36.783
I can't just turn her away.

11:36.817 --> 11:40.654
Dexter, there's a reason serial
killers don't have children.

11:40.688 --> 11:44.157
You can't be killer and dad.
Haven't you learned anything?

11:44.192 --> 11:45.992
Her mother is dead
because of you.

11:46.027 --> 11:49.196
Which is why I need to make things
right and be a good father.

11:49.230 --> 11:53.600
A good father would get those
girls as far away as possible.

11:59.574 --> 12:01.508
Harrison's still
at the apartment with Sonya.

12:01.542 --> 12:03.910
I'm gonna go get him,
bring him back here.

12:13.154 --> 12:15.589
Deb.

12:15.623 --> 12:17.457
You're gonna break something.
Relax.

12:17.491 --> 12:18.725
You relax.
You're not about to have

12:18.759 --> 12:20.560
the worst meeting
of your career.

12:20.595 --> 12:22.596
It's a union rep.
He's on your side.

12:22.630 --> 12:25.165
You know, just be professional
and don't freak out

12:25.199 --> 12:26.666
until you actually know
what's gonna happen.

12:26.701 --> 12:29.002
I know what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna get fired...

12:29.036 --> 12:30.170
No, you're not.

12:30.204 --> 12:31.671
Even Laguerta said
this isn't gonna stick.

12:31.706 --> 12:33.974
- I'm supposed to trust her?
- No.

12:34.008 --> 12:36.509
But you can trust me.

12:36.544 --> 12:38.511
Everything's gonna be okay.

12:38.546 --> 12:40.247
You know why?

12:40.281 --> 12:41.948
'Cause you're gonna get
your job back.

12:41.983 --> 12:43.917
You got everyone
at the station on your side.

12:43.951 --> 12:46.086
You got a boyfriend
who loves you.

12:50.124 --> 12:52.926
Seriously? You're gonna
drop that on me now?

12:52.960 --> 12:54.995
It's just an expression.
It slipped out.

12:55.029 --> 12:57.964
- I gotta go.
- Fine. Forget I said it.

13:03.104 --> 13:04.304
What?

13:04.338 --> 13:07.007
Good morning to you, too,
sunshine.

13:07.041 --> 13:09.175
- You alone?
- Yeah. What's up?

13:09.210 --> 13:10.877
Your pecker.
Soon as you take a look

13:10.911 --> 13:14.047
at these snaps I took
of your boy Dexter Morgan

13:14.081 --> 13:17.684
and his gal pal on some kind of
middle of the night boat run.

13:17.718 --> 13:19.886
- Wanna meet for a beer?
- It's 7:00 A. M.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.221
Beer is good anytime.

13:21.255 --> 13:24.157
- Yeah. I gotta work.
- Then I'll come to you.

13:24.191 --> 13:26.159
What'd I just say?
I can't now!

13:26.193 --> 13:27.827
I'll call you later.

13:46.681 --> 13:49.449
You sure you wanna keep
your appointment with Jordan?

13:49.483 --> 13:51.384
Well, I need to.

13:51.419 --> 13:54.054
There's not gonna be another
chance to get the blood.

13:54.088 --> 13:57.624
Besides, it's something
I actually know how to do.

13:57.658 --> 14:01.027
You were a teenage girl,
right?

14:01.062 --> 14:03.129
How do I deal with Astor?

14:03.164 --> 14:04.798
Try talking to her.

14:04.832 --> 14:06.032
Last time I did that,

14:06.067 --> 14:07.901
she said she hated me
and moved to Orlando.

14:07.935 --> 14:09.869
Well, now you get
a second chance.

14:14.875 --> 14:18.211
Share something with her...
What you did when you were her age.

14:18.245 --> 14:19.879
I killed the neighbor's dog.

14:19.914 --> 14:22.916
Well, don't tell her that.

14:24.685 --> 14:26.453
Seriously, what do I do?

14:26.487 --> 14:29.055
Just... Cut her some slack.

14:29.090 --> 14:31.257
All kids that age
make mistakes.

14:31.292 --> 14:33.993
Trust me, the hangover
will be punishment enough.

14:34.028 --> 14:37.997
Oh, is that your brother?

14:38.032 --> 14:41.034
Harrison.

14:41.068 --> 14:43.903
He doesn't even recognize me.

14:43.938 --> 14:49.275
Well... You didn't look like a
raccoon the last time he saw you.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.681
Eat.
It's hangover food.

14:54.715 --> 14:57.150
It'll soak up the alcohol.

14:57.184 --> 14:59.686
Talk to her.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.389
Share something.

15:02.423 --> 15:06.626
So I need to go
to a meeting in a few minutes.

15:06.660 --> 15:11.097
But I was hoping after that we
could spend the day together,

15:11.132 --> 15:15.068
'cause we really should talk.

15:17.738 --> 15:19.706
So is that okay?

15:19.740 --> 15:21.941
Can Harrison come?

15:21.976 --> 15:23.309
Sure.
I'll call the babysitter,

15:23.344 --> 15:25.245
tell her
there's a change of plans.

15:33.754 --> 15:35.588
Mama.

15:38.359 --> 15:40.260
Mama.

15:41.662 --> 15:44.063
I have no idea
why he said that.

15:44.098 --> 15:46.633
- I barely know him.
- Stop lying, okay?

15:46.667 --> 15:49.169
I'm not stupid.

15:49.203 --> 15:51.738
She's not your mama.

15:51.772 --> 15:54.974
- Your mama's dead.
- Astor.

15:55.009 --> 15:56.743
I'll tell you this.

15:56.777 --> 16:00.180
If you were the one who died, I
really doubt my mom would have

16:00.214 --> 16:02.649
brought in a tenant so fast.

16:06.954 --> 16:09.255
- I should go.
- I know.

16:09.290 --> 16:11.057
We'll only be a couple hours.

16:11.091 --> 16:12.692
I can handle it.

16:16.597 --> 16:20.033
My family is pretty weird too.

16:25.806 --> 16:26.840
Hey.

16:37.084 --> 16:39.085
How'd it go
with the union suit?

16:39.119 --> 16:41.387
They're sticking me
in the file room.

16:41.422 --> 16:42.889
Till after my hearing.

16:42.923 --> 16:45.058
You're not fired.
It's good news.

16:45.092 --> 16:46.292
Yeah, it's great.

16:46.327 --> 16:47.961
Except everybody still thinks

16:47.995 --> 16:49.896
I'm responsible
for that girl dying

16:49.930 --> 16:52.966
and all those kids getting
wounded in that nightclub.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.136
For the record, my report
backed your story 100%.

16:57.171 --> 16:58.972
Not that it mattered.

16:59.006 --> 17:00.807
The brass backed my wife.

17:00.841 --> 17:02.876
Matters to me.

17:02.910 --> 17:05.578
Thank you.

17:06.847 --> 17:08.548
Anybody needs
a real fucking detective,

17:08.582 --> 17:10.950
I'll be in the file room.

17:13.854 --> 17:16.322
Detective scapegoat
reporting for duty.

17:16.357 --> 17:19.292
They said you'd be joining me.

17:19.326 --> 17:22.829
Come on.
I can get you started.

17:22.863 --> 17:24.831
Right over there.

17:24.865 --> 17:28.167
So... How's it going
with that man of yours?

17:28.202 --> 17:32.171
This morning out of the blue, he...
Told me he loved me.

17:32.206 --> 17:33.273
Oh!

17:33.307 --> 17:34.340
You say it back?

17:34.375 --> 17:36.175
No. I ran.

17:36.210 --> 17:37.911
What? What's the problem?

17:37.945 --> 17:39.412
You don't feel the same way?

17:39.446 --> 17:43.449
No, the problem is is that...
I'm afraid I might.

17:43.484 --> 17:44.851
Oh!|

17:44.885 --> 17:46.653
What is this,
the barrel girls case?

17:46.687 --> 17:49.756
- File it under creepy?
- Under closed cases.

17:49.790 --> 17:51.491
Not read, honey. File.

17:51.525 --> 17:55.495
That's what I get paid to do,
and for the next few weeks,

17:55.529 --> 17:57.297
So do you.

18:09.777 --> 18:10.944
Good session.

18:10.978 --> 18:13.446
Another hour
of running in place.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.915
You seem more open.
You feel the difference?

18:15.950 --> 18:17.116
Yeah.

18:17.151 --> 18:21.120
I feel like I might...
Take away something valuable this time.

18:21.155 --> 18:23.456
Mm. Good.

18:23.490 --> 18:25.692
Well, I gotta tell ya.

18:25.726 --> 18:29.796
I still feel like you're not
being completely honest with me.

18:31.999 --> 18:34.367
Really?|

18:34.401 --> 18:37.136
- 'Bout what?
- About what you really want.

18:37.171 --> 18:41.140
What I really want...
Just a drop.

18:41.175 --> 18:43.643
A 30-gauge needle should
slide right in undetected.

18:46.046 --> 18:48.548
He won't even notice
it's missing.

18:48.582 --> 18:50.783
What do you mean?

18:50.818 --> 18:53.486
What you want out of life.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.455
Whatever it is,
you have to tell me

18:55.489 --> 18:58.191
so that I can help you
construct a plan to get there.

18:58.225 --> 18:59.726
I have a plan to get there.

18:59.760 --> 19:01.728
Lumen and I follow
this blood trail.

19:01.762 --> 19:03.129
We take you out.

19:03.163 --> 19:06.399
Believe it or not,
you're helping me already.

19:06.433 --> 19:09.535
I hope so.
I really do.

19:16.777 --> 19:21.247
Each of us...
Deep down, we know what we really want.

19:21.281 --> 19:24.183
It's just a matter
of actually doing it.

19:24.218 --> 19:25.318
Yeah.

19:27.254 --> 19:29.489
Oh.
I gotta get back to work.

19:29.523 --> 19:32.058
New evidence to process.

19:32.092 --> 19:35.028
But, uh, thanks again
for everything.

19:35.062 --> 19:37.130
So when's our next appointment?

19:37.164 --> 19:39.932
I'll check with
the receptionist.

20:37.658 --> 20:39.559
What did I tell you?

20:39.593 --> 20:44.330
You're supposed to be filing
things away, not makin' a mess.

20:44.364 --> 20:45.932
Wait, wait.
I was reading that.

20:45.966 --> 20:49.335
- Yeah, that's the problem.
- Just give me one more second.

20:52.973 --> 20:54.907
Holy shit!
Look at this.

20:54.942 --> 20:56.509
What am I lookin' at?

20:56.543 --> 20:59.479
DNA results.
Multiple DNA results.

20:59.513 --> 21:01.547
- The barrel girlsase?
- Mm-hmm.

21:01.582 --> 21:04.884
We pinned this on one guy
and...

21:04.918 --> 21:07.553
Looks like there are
multiple perps.

21:07.588 --> 21:11.891
I'm just gonna...
Tell me what you see.

21:11.925 --> 21:14.627
DNA sequencing report, uh...

21:14.661 --> 21:17.363
Partial sequences on three,
maybe four perps?

21:17.397 --> 21:19.332
What case is this?

21:19.366 --> 21:21.334
Barrel girls.

21:21.368 --> 21:23.469
Didn't we... Didn't we
pin this on one guy?

21:23.504 --> 21:25.104
Yes. Boyd Fowler.

21:25.139 --> 21:29.408
But the coroner found trace DNA
on the girls that wasn't Boyd's.

21:29.443 --> 21:32.011
There were partial sequences
from multiple people.

21:32.045 --> 21:33.880
It's all in the file.

21:33.914 --> 21:36.349
Why am I only hearing
about this now?

21:36.383 --> 21:38.951
Because by the time the final
coroner report came through,

21:38.986 --> 21:40.419
we'd already closed the case.

21:40.454 --> 21:42.088
The only reason
I came across this

21:42.122 --> 21:43.790
was because I was
filing it all away.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.825
Look.

21:45.859 --> 21:48.728
This is Cole Harmon,
our original suspect.

21:48.762 --> 21:50.897
Jordan Chase's security guy.
We let him go.

21:50.931 --> 21:54.801
We got DNA samples on him.
Tell me what you see.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.936
There are enough common markers

21:56.970 --> 21:58.771
that Cole Harmon
is looking pretty good

21:58.806 --> 22:00.706
for the barrel girls' murders.

22:00.741 --> 22:02.308
At the very least,
he can't be excluded.

22:02.342 --> 22:04.977
What are you saying, that Cole
and Boyd did this together?

22:05.012 --> 22:07.146
Yeah.

22:07.181 --> 22:10.583
With maybe three
or four others.

22:10.617 --> 22:12.785
We gotta reopen this case.

22:12.820 --> 22:15.888
I know.
But I can't tell Laguerta.

22:15.923 --> 22:17.957
I'm supposed to be
on file clerk duty.

22:20.460 --> 22:22.395
Wh... I'm not tellin' her.

22:22.429 --> 22:24.864
This case was solved.

22:24.898 --> 22:29.001
If I ask her to reopen it, I may
as well put my balls in a vice.

22:29.036 --> 22:31.737
And not in a hot way either.

22:31.772 --> 22:35.374
Well, that just leaves... Me.

22:45.118 --> 22:48.287
Hey. You're late.

22:48.322 --> 22:50.623
Yeah. Tough morning.

22:50.657 --> 22:55.862
Astor showed up on my doorstep
last night drunk with a friend.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.496
How old's the friend?

22:59.967 --> 23:02.001
Just kidding.

23:07.241 --> 23:08.875
What's that?
Blood sample?

23:08.909 --> 23:11.010
Yes. It's a blood sample.

23:13.547 --> 23:15.281
Top secret, huh?
I get it.

23:15.315 --> 23:19.051
So... What is it?
Blood alcohol for Astor?

23:19.086 --> 23:20.653
She vomited all over the floor.

23:20.687 --> 23:22.855
Further testing's
kind of unnecessary.

23:22.890 --> 23:25.124
STD panel?

23:25.158 --> 23:26.993
Vince, she's 12.

23:27.027 --> 23:28.461
I meant for you.

23:30.530 --> 23:34.300
It's a homicide victim I'm supposed
to have processed already.

23:34.334 --> 23:37.970
I made a mistake,
forgot to submit it, okay?

23:38.005 --> 23:39.705
Morgan.

23:39.740 --> 23:41.707
Dexter, the girls are gone.

23:41.742 --> 23:43.876
Gone where?

23:43.911 --> 23:45.144
I don't know.
But they're missing.

23:45.178 --> 23:48.514
They felt terrible, and we didn't
have any Advil in the house,

23:48.548 --> 23:50.149
so I took Harrison
to the store.

23:50.183 --> 23:51.784
- You left them alone?
- I was trying to be nice.

23:51.818 --> 23:53.419
And when I got back,
they were gone.

23:53.453 --> 23:56.055
- Maybe they went for a walk.
- I don't think so.

23:56.089 --> 23:57.256
The back door was wide open,

23:57.291 --> 23:59.358
and their cell phones
are still here.

23:59.393 --> 24:00.993
Dexter, what 14-year-old girl

24:01.028 --> 24:02.728
willingly leaves
her cell phone behind?

24:02.763 --> 24:04.697
Don't move.
I'll be right there.

24:04.731 --> 24:06.532
I'm so sorry.|

24:19.546 --> 24:20.980
What's going on?

24:21.014 --> 24:23.582
I went to the neighbor's house
to see if he saw anything.

24:23.617 --> 24:25.084
- What?
- Hey.

24:25.118 --> 24:27.086
So I saw some guy
near the house.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.722
Light hair, average build,
mid-30s.

24:29.756 --> 24:32.558
Like Cole and Boyd and Dan.

24:32.592 --> 24:34.060
Oh, he had a white panel van.

24:34.094 --> 24:35.695
And it was weird enough
I checked out the plate.

24:35.729 --> 24:37.029
N4b something.

24:37.064 --> 24:38.497
Why didn't you stop him?

24:38.532 --> 24:40.099
I didn't know
the girls were in the house.

24:40.133 --> 24:42.001
I mean, I didn't even know
you had a tenant.

24:42.035 --> 24:43.836
Just thought he was a...
a painter or something.

24:43.870 --> 24:45.905
Which is why you thought
to check the license plate?

24:45.939 --> 24:48.040
Well, no, that's just habit
from neighborhood watch.

24:48.075 --> 24:49.475
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

24:52.145 --> 24:53.379
What are you doing?

24:53.413 --> 24:56.682
Looking for signs
of a break-in.

24:56.717 --> 24:58.851
An abduction... That's what
we're thinking here, right?

24:58.885 --> 25:00.353
Yeah. But it doesn't
make any sense.

25:00.387 --> 25:02.688
It does if someone
came looking for us.

25:02.723 --> 25:04.457
Like one of Jordan's guys.

25:04.491 --> 25:06.125
There's a reason
you were worried last night

25:06.159 --> 25:07.526
when you heard noises
in the house.

25:07.561 --> 25:09.562
But I overreacted.
It was nothing.

25:09.596 --> 25:12.865
Only this time there was someone
lurking around the house.

25:14.434 --> 25:15.835
I shouldn't have stolen
that blood sample.

25:15.869 --> 25:17.536
Not with the girls here.

25:20.674 --> 25:22.208
We need to call the cops.

25:24.177 --> 25:26.278
They'll just start
asking questions.

25:26.313 --> 25:27.913
And if it does have to do
with Jordan,

25:27.948 --> 25:30.216
they'll probably trace it
all back to us.

25:33.787 --> 25:35.788
Metro.

25:35.822 --> 25:37.723
This is Dexter Morgan
from Homicide.

25:37.758 --> 25:40.726
I'd like to report
a probable child abduction.

25:40.761 --> 25:43.896
It's a white panel van.
I have a partial plate.

25:47.267 --> 25:49.001
We've issued a blanket
APB on the van.

25:49.036 --> 25:52.004
NCIC has started a file
on the girls.

25:52.039 --> 25:53.672
Until we get them back safely,

25:53.707 --> 25:56.609
Detective linker will be
our liaison to missing persons.

25:56.643 --> 25:58.244
Did you call Olivia's parents?

25:58.278 --> 25:59.779
I tried.
I couldn't get a hold of them.

25:59.813 --> 26:01.580
What about Astor's
grandparents?

26:01.615 --> 26:03.015
They hadn't heard from her.

26:03.050 --> 26:04.817
I didn't tell them
she was missing, though.

26:04.851 --> 26:06.118
Didn't want to worry them.

26:06.153 --> 26:08.154
- Yet.
- Most missing children

26:08.188 --> 26:10.289
are abducted by someone
the parents know.

26:10.323 --> 26:12.191
Is there anyone
you can think of?

26:12.225 --> 26:13.659
No. Nobody.

26:13.693 --> 26:16.829
You sure?
No one new?

26:16.863 --> 26:19.665
Where were you, anyway,
when they were taken?

26:19.699 --> 26:21.200
I can't lie about this.

26:21.234 --> 26:23.669
Not with Astor's life
on the line.

26:23.703 --> 26:26.138
I was with Jordan Chase.

26:29.709 --> 26:34.713
He... offered me some private
sessions to help deal with...

26:34.748 --> 26:36.782
Rita's death.

26:39.319 --> 26:40.486
What?

26:42.189 --> 26:44.790
A lot of fucked up people
circling that guy, Dex.

26:44.825 --> 26:47.359
A lot? Who?

26:47.394 --> 26:48.794
Besides Boyd Fowler.

26:48.829 --> 26:50.729
Well, his head of security
for one.

26:50.764 --> 26:52.998
I thought we cleared him.

26:53.033 --> 26:54.667
May have been premature.

26:54.701 --> 26:56.402
Okay... What's going on?

26:56.436 --> 26:59.405
The barrel girls case might
not be as closed as we thought.

26:59.439 --> 27:01.640
Can we just find the van?

27:26.800 --> 27:28.267
- Don't move!
- Show me your hands!

27:28.301 --> 27:30.002
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What... what's going on?

27:30.036 --> 27:32.171
On your knees!
Hands on your head now!

27:32.205 --> 27:34.006
Yeah, right there.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.674
Who is he?

27:35.709 --> 27:37.176
Name's Barry Kurt.
No priors.

27:37.210 --> 27:39.912
They found him at
a gas station on Coral.

27:43.383 --> 27:44.884
- Where's Astor?
- Hey... Easy!

27:44.918 --> 27:46.452
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.

27:46.486 --> 27:47.820
- I'll kill you.
- Get your hands off of me.

27:47.854 --> 27:50.356
- You understand me?
- He's looking for the girls

27:50.390 --> 27:52.191
- just like you.
- He's what?

27:52.225 --> 27:54.093
I'm Olivia's father.
Sort of, anyway.

27:54.127 --> 27:55.928
I live with her mom.

27:57.898 --> 28:00.166
I'm Astor's stepfather,
Dexter Morgan.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.734
Yeah. You should
try to calm down.

28:01.768 --> 28:03.736
He thought something
happened to his daughter.

28:03.770 --> 28:06.438
Something is gonna happen
to them when I find them.

28:06.473 --> 28:08.741
Olivia broke into
our liquor cabinet,

28:08.775 --> 28:10.609
stole money from her mother,
and took off.

28:10.644 --> 28:12.745
We've got GPS tracking
on her mobile phone.

28:12.779 --> 28:15.247
I followed it to your house,
but they weren't there.

28:15.282 --> 28:17.449
I figured I'd gas up the van
and go back.

28:17.484 --> 28:19.952
Next thing I know,
I'm on my knees in cuffs

28:19.986 --> 28:22.721
<i>like some loser on cops.</i>

28:22.756 --> 28:24.390
So where are they?

28:24.424 --> 28:26.091
Probably causing trouble
somewhere.

28:26.126 --> 28:27.526
Ever since Astor
moved down the block,

28:27.561 --> 28:31.063
Olivia's been nothing
but a pain in the ass.

28:32.966 --> 28:34.133
Morgan.

28:34.167 --> 28:36.468
Is he always this violent?

28:38.004 --> 28:39.872
They found the girls
at Bayside.

28:39.906 --> 28:41.407
They're holding them
for shoplifting.

28:53.820 --> 28:55.254
Astor?

28:56.957 --> 28:58.157
Thank God.

28:58.191 --> 29:00.159
We had the whole department
looking for you.

29:00.193 --> 29:01.460
We were so worried.

29:01.494 --> 29:02.962
You have no idea what you
put us through today.

29:02.996 --> 29:05.931
- I'm sorry.
- What were you even thinking

29:05.966 --> 29:08.300
- running off like that?
- Shoplifting?

29:08.335 --> 29:09.568
That figures.

29:09.603 --> 29:10.769
We didn't steal anything.
I swear.

29:10.804 --> 29:12.671
I just tried on a ring
and forgot about it.

29:12.706 --> 29:15.741
It was a mistake.
I gave it back.

29:15.775 --> 29:18.677
I'm Detective Debra Morgan
from Miami Metro Homicide.

29:18.712 --> 29:20.846
Mind if I take it from here?

29:20.880 --> 29:24.083
Just make sure I don't
see these two again.

29:28.722 --> 29:30.322
- Come on, we're going home.
- No!

29:30.357 --> 29:32.057
- Now.
- My stuff's at Astor's.

29:32.092 --> 29:34.159
- I need to go with her.
- You need to come with me.

29:34.194 --> 29:36.262
- I don't want to.
- Tell you what.

29:36.296 --> 29:37.563
Their stuff is at my house.

29:37.597 --> 29:39.231
Why don't I take them there,
get them packed.

29:39.266 --> 29:40.699
We'll meet you in an hour.

29:40.734 --> 29:43.402
You're gonna need to get your
van out of impound anyway.

29:43.436 --> 29:45.537
Which you're paying for,
by the way.

29:45.572 --> 29:47.006
We'll meet you
at the Roadside Cafe.

29:47.040 --> 29:50.142
- It's right near impound.
- Great.

29:51.444 --> 29:54.246
Teenagers.
They can make you homicidal.

29:54.281 --> 29:56.348
I know what you mean.

30:04.457 --> 30:05.958
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

30:05.992 --> 30:10.062
You wanna tell me what's going on
with you and Detective Morgan?

30:10.096 --> 30:12.598
Nothing.
What do you mean?

30:12.632 --> 30:16.001
Obviously, you've been talking
about the barrel girls case.

30:16.036 --> 30:18.203
We found some new evidence.

30:18.238 --> 30:20.506
You and Detective Morgan.

30:20.540 --> 30:22.441
She did.
In the file room.

30:22.475 --> 30:26.178
I was going to tell you.

30:26.212 --> 30:27.680
What?

30:27.714 --> 30:29.248
You really don't see
what's going on?

30:29.282 --> 30:33.585
I send her to the file room
with one assignment... file.

30:33.620 --> 30:35.788
And then she magically
finds evidence

30:35.822 --> 30:38.557
to reopen a case
she knows I personally closed.

30:38.591 --> 30:41.327
Maria... It's DNA.

30:41.361 --> 30:43.162
It's not like she made it up.

30:43.196 --> 30:46.899
She's trying to get back at me.

30:46.933 --> 30:49.702
We pinned this on Boyd Fowler.

30:49.736 --> 30:52.204
I had five detectives
tell me he's the one.

30:52.238 --> 30:55.274
And now I am telling you
that it's more complicated.

30:55.308 --> 30:58.944
- You need to reopen the case.
- I disagree.

30:58.978 --> 31:02.014
Changing five names
on the murder board

31:02.048 --> 31:04.583
from black to red isn't
gonna help this department.

31:04.617 --> 31:07.453
The department?
Or you?

31:13.093 --> 31:14.560
What happened?

31:14.594 --> 31:17.463
Uh... There were at Bayside.

31:17.497 --> 31:19.865
- Oh, thank God.
- Shoplifting.

31:21.735 --> 31:24.737
You gonna introduce us?

31:26.673 --> 31:28.040
That's the one I was
telling you about.

31:28.074 --> 31:30.876
His new girlfriend.

31:30.910 --> 31:32.277
She's my tenant.

31:33.613 --> 31:36.048
Lumen, this is my sister Debra.

31:36.082 --> 31:38.050
Deb, Lumen.

31:40.086 --> 31:41.587
I didn't know he had a tenant.

31:41.621 --> 31:43.756
Didn't know he had a sister.

31:49.662 --> 31:54.433
I'm gonna...
Go check on the girls.

31:57.203 --> 31:59.671
Seriously?

31:59.706 --> 32:01.006
That's your tenant?

32:01.040 --> 32:03.542
- Yes.
- Oh.

32:03.576 --> 32:06.211
Where's all her stuff?

32:06.246 --> 32:09.314
She hasn't really moved in yet.

32:09.349 --> 32:12.284
But you know her well enough
to trust her with your son.

32:12.318 --> 32:13.485
It was an emergency.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.087
I thought the girls
had been taken.

32:15.121 --> 32:16.855
Why are you keeping her
a secret?

32:16.890 --> 32:17.990
I'm not.

32:18.024 --> 32:19.425
Really?
'Cause at the station

32:19.459 --> 32:20.993
we asked you who you were
spending your time with.

32:21.027 --> 32:22.661
You didn't think to mention
the hot blonde

32:22.695 --> 32:24.596
that's living in your house?

32:24.631 --> 32:26.432
Didn't seem...
Like it mattered.

32:26.466 --> 32:28.567
Obviously,
she didn't take the girls.

32:28.601 --> 32:31.470
That's not the point.

32:31.504 --> 32:33.071
I'm not judging you.

32:33.106 --> 32:35.073
Believe me, I understand rebound
as much as anybody.

32:35.108 --> 32:37.142
But don't you think
it's a little soon?

32:37.177 --> 32:38.477
I'm not on any rebound.

32:38.511 --> 32:40.546
Come on.
She's your tenant?

32:40.580 --> 32:42.080
Really?

32:42.115 --> 32:44.817
There's nothing going on.

32:44.851 --> 32:46.652
Fine.

32:46.686 --> 32:48.720
I give up.

32:48.755 --> 32:52.324
I gotta get back
to the station.

32:53.793 --> 32:56.528
Deb knows about
my partner in crime.

32:56.563 --> 32:59.598
The whole station knows
I'm seeing Jordan Chase.

32:59.632 --> 33:02.234
This is not my day.

33:02.268 --> 33:04.169
Astor!

33:04.204 --> 33:06.705
Just... Stay cool.

33:06.739 --> 33:09.341
No matter what.

33:22.288 --> 33:24.690
You want to tell me
what's going on with you?

33:24.724 --> 33:26.458
No.

33:26.493 --> 33:27.960
'Cause nothing
is going on with me.

33:27.994 --> 33:30.195
Something is.

33:30.230 --> 33:33.732
You're drinking, shoplifting.

33:33.766 --> 33:35.968
I already told you,
we didn't steal anything,

33:36.002 --> 33:37.402
and it wasn't me anyway.

33:37.437 --> 33:38.670
You want to tell me
why Barry thinks

33:38.705 --> 33:40.038
you're the bad influence here?

33:40.073 --> 33:41.306
'Cause he's an asshole.

33:41.341 --> 33:42.374
Stop.

33:44.410 --> 33:46.879
This is not a good path
you're headed down here.

33:49.249 --> 33:53.485
Look, just tell me
what's wrong, okay?

33:53.520 --> 33:55.387
I'm actually a good listener.

34:04.464 --> 34:06.798
You want to know what's wrong?

34:06.833 --> 34:10.002
<i>My mom got murdered,
and you move her into our house</i>

34:10.036 --> 34:11.270
and tell me she's your tenant?

34:11.304 --> 34:12.371
She is.

34:12.405 --> 34:14.907
She's more.
I can fucking tell.

34:14.941 --> 34:16.508
Astor, you cannot
talk to me that way.

34:16.543 --> 34:18.143
Oh.

34:18.177 --> 34:23.815
I thought you said
you were this great listener.

34:23.850 --> 34:26.285
I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

34:26.319 --> 34:29.922
Then we'll just sit here
till you do.

34:38.865 --> 34:40.632
You ready to go home?

34:40.667 --> 34:42.801
Not really.

34:42.835 --> 34:46.271
You know I ran away once, too.

34:46.306 --> 34:48.273
I ditched out
on my own wedding.

34:48.308 --> 34:49.841
I didn't run away.

34:55.014 --> 34:56.949
Who did that to you?

34:59.519 --> 35:01.186
The bruises on your stomach.

35:01.220 --> 35:03.956
You don't know
what you're talking about.

35:05.858 --> 35:09.628
Actually, I really do.

35:24.110 --> 35:26.044
I think we have a problem.

35:26.079 --> 35:27.346
Yeah, I'm in a battle of wills

35:27.380 --> 35:29.681
with my drunk, shoplifting
teenage step-daughter,

35:29.716 --> 35:31.550
and she's going to win.

35:31.584 --> 35:34.486
Olivia has bruises
all over her stomach and back.

35:35.788 --> 35:37.589
Someone's been hurting her.

35:37.624 --> 35:39.725
She told you?

35:39.759 --> 35:41.193
No, I saw.

35:41.227 --> 35:42.527
Wait, you knew about this?

35:42.562 --> 35:44.663
Don't be mad.

35:44.697 --> 35:45.897
I'm not mad.

35:45.932 --> 35:51.169
I'm just, um...
I don't know what I am.

35:51.204 --> 35:53.005
I'll be with Olivia.

35:56.476 --> 35:58.243
Promise you won't say anything?

35:58.277 --> 36:00.045
I don't want him
to hurt her more.

36:00.079 --> 36:01.313
Who?

36:01.347 --> 36:02.914
Barry.
Who do you think?

36:02.949 --> 36:04.182
<i>He is an asshole.</i>

36:06.519 --> 36:07.886
Does her mom know?

36:07.920 --> 36:10.255
He only hits her
in places that don't show.

36:10.289 --> 36:12.524
He gets all crazy over nothing.

36:12.558 --> 36:15.994
He doesn't like her hair,
she's two minutes late.

36:17.063 --> 36:21.166
I thought she'd be safe here,
but then there's Lumen,

36:21.200 --> 36:24.903
and Barry showed up,
and we just... ran.

36:24.937 --> 36:26.738
Why didn't you tell me?

36:26.773 --> 36:28.540
'Cause I didn't think
you'd care.

36:31.811 --> 36:33.278
Of course I care.

36:33.312 --> 36:35.247
Even when we all lived here,

36:35.281 --> 36:38.016
you were so busy
out doing stuff all the time.

36:43.089 --> 36:45.590
Olivia's my friend.

36:45.625 --> 36:48.760
My only friend since mom died.

36:48.795 --> 36:54.099
I wanted to help her, and...
I didn't know what to do.

36:54.133 --> 36:57.202
You did know what to do.
You came home.

37:02.709 --> 37:04.409
I'm gonna take care of this.

37:04.444 --> 37:05.844
Okay?

37:15.955 --> 37:17.522
Everything okay with Astor?

37:17.557 --> 37:18.957
Nothing turning 20 won't fix.

37:18.991 --> 37:20.025
What'd Laguerta say?

37:20.059 --> 37:22.594
She's not gonna
reopen the case.

37:22.628 --> 37:25.964
She thinks that you have some
kind of vendetta against her.

37:25.998 --> 37:27.566
That's fucking ridiculous.

37:27.600 --> 37:28.834
Give her a day to cool off.

37:28.868 --> 37:30.202
We'll try again tomorrow.

37:36.943 --> 37:38.510
You're not gonna
reopen the case?

37:38.544 --> 37:39.578
Are you serious?

37:39.612 --> 37:41.079
Come right in, detective.

37:41.114 --> 37:44.649
There are at least
five dead girls in barrels.

37:44.684 --> 37:46.985
And now there's DNA evidence

37:47.019 --> 37:48.954
saying that some of the people
that are responsible

37:48.988 --> 37:50.822
are still out there.

37:50.857 --> 37:55.660
And you think that's about me
trying to get back at you?

37:55.695 --> 37:58.830
Did you even read the file?

37:58.865 --> 38:00.165
There's fucking proof.

38:00.199 --> 38:01.399
Just watch your tone.

38:04.137 --> 38:07.339
You know...

38:07.373 --> 38:09.841
You throwing me under the bus
for the Fuentes brothers,

38:09.876 --> 38:13.078
using your husband
as a chess piece,

38:13.112 --> 38:14.780
putting Quinn
on bogus vacation days

38:14.814 --> 38:16.715
so that I don't have
a fucking partner?

38:16.749 --> 38:19.618
If that's all just some game to
you, I'll try to understand it,

38:19.652 --> 38:23.054
but those girls are dead.

38:23.089 --> 38:25.257
Don't you want to make sure
that that doesn't happen again?

38:27.794 --> 38:30.095
I mean, what the fuck
are we doing here?

38:30.129 --> 38:31.263
Enough!

38:32.532 --> 38:34.466
Okay.

38:34.500 --> 38:35.767
Okay what?

38:37.436 --> 38:39.371
I'm reopening the case.

38:39.405 --> 38:41.473
But you need to hear me,

38:41.507 --> 38:44.309
because you have no idea
what you're talking about.

38:44.343 --> 38:49.548
I made the Fuentes situation
go away.

38:49.582 --> 38:50.615
I was trying to help Batista.

38:50.650 --> 38:54.519
As far as Quinn goes,
he wasn't on vacation.

38:54.554 --> 38:57.622
I suspended him.

38:57.657 --> 38:59.958
To protect your brother.

39:06.465 --> 39:08.133
Protect him from what?

39:11.404 --> 39:15.040
You're so interested in
the truth, ask Quinn.

39:25.785 --> 39:26.751
Hey.

39:26.786 --> 39:27.819
Can I talk to you?

39:27.854 --> 39:30.455
In private?

39:33.059 --> 39:35.727
Look, if this
is about this morning...

39:35.761 --> 39:37.395
Last month, when you told me

39:37.430 --> 39:39.231
that you were taking
some vacation days,

39:39.265 --> 39:43.602
were you actually
on suspension?

39:43.636 --> 39:45.003
Why?

39:45.037 --> 39:46.004
Who told you that?

39:46.038 --> 39:47.005
Were you?

39:47.039 --> 39:49.708
Did Laguerta say something?

39:49.742 --> 39:51.643
She told me
I should talk to you.

39:53.913 --> 39:55.513
Did it have something
to do with my brother?

39:57.984 --> 39:59.384
Yeah.

39:59.418 --> 40:01.286
But it was nothing.

40:01.320 --> 40:02.654
Then why did you lie?

40:06.325 --> 40:11.563
I was investigating Rita's
murder, trying to help.

40:11.597 --> 40:14.065
I had a lead on Kyle Butler.

40:14.100 --> 40:18.069
I figured if we could find
the person who knew Trinity,

40:18.104 --> 40:20.772
then maybe we could
track down the creep

40:20.806 --> 40:23.842
who killed
your sister-in-law.

40:23.876 --> 40:26.511
Laguerta told me to back
off, leave it to the FBI.

40:28.281 --> 40:31.883
When I didn't,
she suspended me.

40:31.918 --> 40:33.184
What was the lead?

40:33.219 --> 40:36.288
It doesn't matter.
It didn't pan out.

40:36.322 --> 40:40.759
Laguerta told me that she
was protecting Dexter from you.

40:43.462 --> 40:44.829
Why would she say that?

40:47.466 --> 40:51.836
You remember those composite
sketches of Kyle Butler?

40:51.871 --> 40:58.176
I got this crazy idea that
maybe it was your brother.

41:00.913 --> 41:04.282
Nothing came of it,
so I dropped it.

41:04.317 --> 41:07.552
I'm an idiot, okay?

41:09.889 --> 41:11.423
Yeah, you are.

41:11.457 --> 41:13.558
Deb, I...

41:25.438 --> 41:27.172
Shit.

41:43.856 --> 41:45.357
What's this?

41:45.391 --> 41:46.791
Where's Olivia?

41:46.826 --> 41:51.129
I just wanted to...
Speak to you first, parent to parent.

41:51.163 --> 41:54.132
Oh.
You talk to Astor?

41:54.166 --> 41:56.901
Yeah, I did.

41:58.137 --> 42:00.805
Honestly, I'm not sure
what I should do.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.407
I feel for you, man.

42:02.441 --> 42:05.310
It's tough looking after
somebody else's kids.

42:05.344 --> 42:09.314
Sometimes you just gotta
show 'em who's boss.

42:09.348 --> 42:14.285
Is that what you do with
Olivia, show her who's boss?

42:14.320 --> 42:15.387
What's that supposed to mean?

42:15.421 --> 42:21.593
I know about Olivia's bruises,
how they're strategically placed

42:21.627 --> 42:23.261
so they won't show.

42:25.531 --> 42:27.098
I don't know
what you're talking about.

42:28.834 --> 42:31.302
No?

42:31.337 --> 42:33.104
Let me show you?

42:36.342 --> 42:38.043
That's your solar plexus.

42:39.345 --> 42:41.746
Right now, your diaphragm
is partially paralyzed,

42:41.781 --> 42:44.215
which is why you're having
trouble catching your breath.

42:44.250 --> 42:46.751
What are you, man,
some kind of psycho?

42:46.786 --> 42:48.820
Not today.
Just a concerned parent.

42:48.854 --> 42:49.821
Aah!

42:49.855 --> 42:51.122
Ohh!

42:51.157 --> 42:52.791
That's your liver.

42:54.226 --> 42:55.994
The nice thing
about the liver is

42:56.028 --> 42:58.463
if you hit it just right,
you get the vagus nerve,

42:58.497 --> 43:00.231
which tentacles out
to the rest of your body.

43:01.667 --> 43:05.203
Your brain short-circuits,
your body shuts down,

43:05.237 --> 43:08.606
and you feel,
what's the word, terror?

43:08.641 --> 43:11.576
Which is what Olivia felt
every time you hit her there

43:11.610 --> 43:13.511
just so the bruises
wouldn't show.

43:14.780 --> 43:17.048
I want you to listen
to me carefully.

43:17.083 --> 43:19.317
Listen to me carefully, because
this is what you're gonna do.

43:19.351 --> 43:21.319
You're gonna call
Olivia's mother.

43:21.353 --> 43:23.922
You're gonna tell her
you're sick of her fat ass.

43:23.956 --> 43:26.391
You can't stand
to look at it anymore.

43:26.425 --> 43:28.593
And you're gonna
make her believe it,

43:28.627 --> 43:30.962
because if you don't,
she may take you back one day

43:30.996 --> 43:33.164
and let you near her kid
or mine.

43:33.199 --> 43:34.666
And I can't let that happen.

43:38.037 --> 43:39.904
You're not even gonna swing by
to pick up your stuff.

43:39.939 --> 43:41.106
You're just gonna leave.

43:41.140 --> 43:48.947
Tomorrow, when I drop Olivia
off, you will be gone.

43:48.981 --> 43:55.487
If you ever come back, believe me,
I won't go so easy next time.

43:57.623 --> 44:00.458
By the way, that's your kidney.

44:06.532 --> 44:08.032
I can't believe it.

44:08.067 --> 44:09.300
I don't want to hear it, okay?

44:09.335 --> 44:11.136
"This isn't your business,
Dexter.

44:11.170 --> 44:12.804
"Don't get involved, Dexter.

44:12.838 --> 44:14.739
You put too much
at risk, Dexter. "

44:14.773 --> 44:16.541
That's not
what I was gonna say.

44:19.845 --> 44:21.045
I'm proud of you.

44:23.382 --> 44:25.884
You are?

44:25.918 --> 44:30.755
You protected Astor, put yourself
out there for another person.

44:30.789 --> 44:34.526
I had no idea
you had that in you.

44:36.729 --> 44:38.062
I underestimated you.

44:38.097 --> 44:42.500
Assumed you were a monster
when you were capable

44:42.535 --> 44:44.769
of so much more.

44:47.006 --> 44:48.406
If only I'd seen that,

44:48.440 --> 44:50.375
maybe I wouldn't have
led you down this path.

45:05.424 --> 45:06.524
Deb?

45:06.559 --> 45:08.226
Hi, honey.

45:16.335 --> 45:17.936
Get the fuck
out of my apartment.

45:17.970 --> 45:19.037
I brought you a present.

45:19.071 --> 45:20.972
Don't you
want to see what it is?

45:21.006 --> 45:22.840
Your boy Dexter Morgan
and his lady friend

45:22.875 --> 45:25.810
on his boat
at 3:00 A. M. in the morning,

45:25.844 --> 45:27.812
and they are not fucking.

45:27.846 --> 45:29.280
What's in the bags?

45:29.315 --> 45:30.381
Something heavy.

45:30.416 --> 45:31.816
I'm thinking narcotics,
maybe a body.

45:34.620 --> 45:35.753
Are you crazy?

45:35.788 --> 45:37.822
Yeah, but that's
beside the point.

45:37.856 --> 45:41.359
Point is that when they came
back, those bags were gone,

45:41.393 --> 45:43.595
so whatever they're hiding,
it's something big.

45:43.629 --> 45:46.264
This was a bad idea.

45:47.800 --> 45:50.868
Here. Consider this
your severance package.

45:50.903 --> 45:52.604
We're done.

45:53.739 --> 45:55.740
Really?

45:55.774 --> 45:58.643
What? You think you
can just pay me off

45:58.677 --> 46:00.011
like I'm the corner whore?

46:00.045 --> 46:02.480
I'm just saying,
it's time to stop.

46:02.514 --> 46:05.516
And I'm sayin' bullshit.

46:05.551 --> 46:07.685
If this thing is as big
as I think it is,

46:07.720 --> 46:10.255
Laguerta and all them
other douchebags in homicide

46:10.289 --> 46:11.756
are gonna be kissing my ass.

46:11.790 --> 46:13.091
Back off, Liddy.

46:13.125 --> 46:14.359
I mean it.

46:14.393 --> 46:17.595
I told you don't fuck with me.

46:19.398 --> 46:23.768
You know, I just think I may
call up that sister.

46:23.802 --> 46:26.170
Give her a ring, see
if she wants to get together,

46:26.205 --> 46:28.306
have a drink,
maybe talk about the brother.

46:28.340 --> 46:29.307
What do you say?

46:29.341 --> 46:31.809
Stay the fuck away from me!

46:31.844 --> 46:34.345
And stay the fuck
away from Deb!

47:09.381 --> 47:12.450
So you really did
change your mind.

47:12.484 --> 47:14.185
I read the report.

47:16.121 --> 47:17.422
Thank you.

47:17.456 --> 47:18.690
Does this mean...

47:21.126 --> 47:23.194
You'll stop sleeping
on the couch?

47:25.531 --> 47:28.199
We still got a long way to go

47:28.233 --> 47:30.835
between the couch
and the bedroom, Maria.

47:38.644 --> 47:40.745
So, what, now you're
not even talking to me?

47:44.216 --> 47:49.654
Deb, look, I had an idiot
theory and I dropped it.

47:49.688 --> 47:51.622
Yeah, because
Laguerta suspended you.

47:51.657 --> 47:54.559
No, because I was wrong.

47:54.593 --> 47:56.961
Look, what I said
yesterday is true.

47:56.995 --> 48:00.031
I love you, and I'm
not taking it back.

48:02.401 --> 48:03.935
You don't even know
what that means.

48:03.969 --> 48:06.204
It means I'd never do
anything to hurt you.

48:06.238 --> 48:08.406
Ever.

48:08.440 --> 48:10.742
I trusted you.

48:10.776 --> 48:12.176
And while you were fucking me,

48:12.211 --> 48:14.278
you were spreading shit
about my brother behind my back.

48:14.313 --> 48:16.814
You think
that's not hurting me?

48:16.849 --> 48:18.416
Fuck you.

48:38.804 --> 48:40.838
You want us
to come inside with you?

48:40.873 --> 48:42.707
No, I'll be okay.

48:42.741 --> 48:44.509
I could barely understand
my mom on the phone

48:44.543 --> 48:46.077
with all the crying,

48:46.111 --> 48:49.113
but she actually said
Barry did her a favor leaving.

48:49.148 --> 48:50.748
He definitely did me a favor.

48:50.783 --> 48:52.417
He told her she has a fat ass.

48:53.552 --> 48:54.986
He is not coming back.

49:03.162 --> 49:04.228
Thank you.

49:04.263 --> 49:06.397
Call you later.

49:30.689 --> 49:32.590
Are you gonna tell
grandma and grandpa?

49:32.624 --> 49:37.361
About you getting drunk
in Miami and shoplifting?

49:37.396 --> 49:38.796
Nah, that's up to you.

49:41.900 --> 49:44.335
We all have our secrets, right?

49:44.369 --> 49:46.170
Thanks.

49:46.205 --> 49:50.308
- But if it ever happens again...
- It won't.

49:50.342 --> 49:54.846
- And if Barry ever shows up...
- I'll tell you, I promise.

50:01.019 --> 50:02.220
I'm proud of you.

50:03.388 --> 50:04.622
You are?

50:04.656 --> 50:10.795
Yeah. You... put yourself out
there for another person.

50:13.832 --> 50:15.366
I want you to know something.

50:15.400 --> 50:18.469
If Lumen's your girlfriend,
I want you to tell me.

50:18.504 --> 50:21.172
Okay.

50:21.206 --> 50:22.573
But she's not.

50:22.608 --> 50:24.575
She's not just
your tenant, though.

50:24.610 --> 50:31.849
She's a friend who's been
through some really...

50:31.884 --> 50:33.150
Really bad stuff.

50:33.185 --> 50:36.420
I'm helping her deal with it.

50:36.455 --> 50:39.657
Does it make you feel better?

50:39.691 --> 50:41.359
What do you mean?

50:41.393 --> 50:42.927
About mom.

50:42.961 --> 50:44.495
Being there for Lumen,

50:44.530 --> 50:47.765
does it make you feel better
about what happened to mom?

50:58.510 --> 51:00.177
I love you.

51:02.381 --> 51:04.015
You know that?

51:07.052 --> 51:11.322
You should come in, say hi to Cody.

51:11.356 --> 51:14.358
It'll blow your cover, about Miami.

51:26.705 --> 51:27.705
Mama.

51:28.974 --> 51:30.975
This is mama?

51:32.110 --> 51:33.578
Mama.

51:36.582 --> 51:37.915
Okay, bud.

51:41.386 --> 51:46.057
Jordan Chase told me to
figure out what I want most.

51:46.091 --> 51:48.326
The answer is simple.

51:48.360 --> 51:52.196
To be a good dad.

51:52.230 --> 51:53.531
But now that Astor's safe,

51:53.565 --> 51:56.400
what I want most
is Jordan on my table.

51:56.435 --> 51:58.769
I need to get
an I. D. on that blood.

52:00.639 --> 52:02.373
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:02.407 --> 52:04.408
How was Orlando?

52:04.443 --> 52:06.877
Uh, it was
pleasantly uneventful.

52:06.912 --> 52:10.481
Astor's back with her grandparents,
Cody grew about a foot.

52:10.515 --> 52:13.718
Oh. Glad to hear it.

52:13.752 --> 52:15.886
Your blood results
are in, by the way.

52:27.065 --> 52:30.434
So did you get back an I. D.
on your homicide victim?

52:30.469 --> 52:32.603
No.

52:33.972 --> 52:35.072
Then what's that?

52:35.107 --> 52:37.341
She's not a victim.

52:37.376 --> 52:39.577
She's alive, boozing it up
in Coral Gables.

52:39.611 --> 52:41.579
Two D. U. I. s in three years.

52:41.613 --> 52:43.280
I guess I messed up.

52:43.315 --> 52:45.883
If she's not a victim,
then who is she?

52:45.917 --> 52:46.917
No worries.

52:46.952 --> 52:50.454
When you mess up, it makes
me feel better about me.

53:05.170 --> 53:06.671
Dexter?

53:06.705 --> 53:08.673
No, it's Jordan Chase.

53:08.707 --> 53:10.775
But I'm looking for Dexter.
Is he there?

53:13.378 --> 53:16.947
He...
He's not available right now.

53:16.982 --> 53:18.949
Can I leave a message?

53:20.485 --> 53:21.452
Uh-huh.

53:23.989 --> 53:25.690
Tell him I'm just checking in,

53:25.724 --> 53:27.958
and I'd like him to schedule
another appointment

53:27.993 --> 53:29.960
as soon as possible.

53:31.997 --> 53:33.431
Okay.

53:33.465 --> 53:35.032
I will. Bye.

53:35.067 --> 53:37.601
Hang on a second.

53:37.636 --> 53:39.804
Tell Dexter one more thing.

53:41.807 --> 53:42.807
Okay.

53:42.841 --> 53:46.343
Tell him time
is of the essence.

53:46.378 --> 53:50.014
Tick tick tick.

53:50.048 --> 53:53.818
That's the sound
of his life running out.

53:53.852 --> 53:55.886
Could you be sure
to tell him that?

53:59.591 --> 54:00.825
Take care, Lumen.

54:01.005 --> 54:04.145
