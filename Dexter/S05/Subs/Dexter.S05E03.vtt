WEBVTT

00:10.516 --> 00:13.726
Previously on Dexter...

00:15.437 --> 00:17.397
My wife died and it was my fault.

00:17.523 --> 00:20.483
Your dead wife can suck my dick.

00:22.152 --> 00:25.405
That's the first human thing
I've seen you do since she died, Dexter.

00:28.075 --> 00:29.409
I don't want to live with you.

00:29.535 --> 00:31.369
I want to live with Grandma and Grandpa.

00:31.495 --> 00:33.955
FBI? Fucking Bunch of Idiots.

00:34.081 --> 00:35.873
We know you didn't
kill your wife.

00:35.999 --> 00:38.459
We're just looking for a reason
why Arthur Mitchell might have targeted her.

00:38.585 --> 00:39.627
We all good here?

00:39.753 --> 00:42.296
The only lead we have now
is this Kyle Butler.

00:42.923 --> 00:44.674
It looks like Santa Muerte, the cult.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.677
- Who are you?
- Officer Manzon, Cira.

00:47.803 --> 00:49.721
We have sex one day, and then...

00:49.847 --> 00:52.390
I'm sorry, I'm not the kind of person
who would ever have sex with you.

00:52.516 --> 00:55.143
- OK, we had sex.
- Was it good sex?

00:55.269 --> 00:57.103
I've said all I'm gonna say.

00:57.229 --> 01:01.190
You're welcome to stay here for
as long as you want, whenever you want.

01:01.316 --> 01:03.234
I heard the FBI interview went well.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.570
They're looking for someone
named Kyle Butler.

01:05.696 --> 01:08.322
He's a friend of Arthur Mitchell's.
They're having sketches done.

01:08.449 --> 01:11.284
The Mitchell family
all gave very different versions.

01:11.410 --> 01:12.869
Do you mind if I keep a copy of these?

01:12.995 --> 01:16.289
You married Maria LaGuerta?
Such a fine piece of ass.

01:16.415 --> 01:17.874
You fuck!

01:20.419 --> 01:21.919
Boyd Fowler.

01:22.045 --> 01:24.172
You're probably used to
seeing dead things though, huh?

01:24.298 --> 01:26.007
Can't say I ever get used to it.

01:29.261 --> 01:31.179
You want that nice house
on the beach.

01:31.305 --> 01:32.221
Take it!

01:32.347 --> 01:34.932
I can see having
an old girlfriend's lock of hair...

01:35.058 --> 01:37.185
but identified by only a number?

01:39.005 --> 01:45.079
FaceTime with British Models 24/7
www. saucytime. com

03:41.727 --> 03:43.853
I'm just trying to get to the truth.

03:43.979 --> 03:45.646
However long that takes is up to you.

03:45.772 --> 03:47.732
I'm telling you the truth.
I'm not lying.

03:47.858 --> 03:49.984
First you said you didn't do drugs,
and then you said you did.

03:50.110 --> 03:52.987
I said I might have tried some
at a Tri Delt party once.

03:53.113 --> 03:55.740
You might have?
What the fuck does that even mean?

03:55.866 --> 03:58.159
You did or you didn't.
You can't kind of do blow.

03:58.285 --> 04:00.953
But that was six years ago in college.

04:01.079 --> 04:02.830
And I'm supposed to believe
you're not on anything now?

04:02.956 --> 04:05.207
- I'm totally clean.
- Then why are you so nervous?

04:05.334 --> 04:08.127
Because I wasn't expecting
on getting these kinds of questions.

04:08.253 --> 04:10.212
I mean, you sound like a cop.

04:10.339 --> 04:13.966
I am a cop.
I work for Miami Metro Homicide.

04:14.092 --> 04:16.761
Look, I don't know what's going on here.

04:16.887 --> 04:18.721
I came for a nanny job.

04:18.847 --> 04:22.308
I'm not, like,
planning to kill the president.

04:23.310 --> 04:26.270
Harrison needs a nanny
and Deb insisted on running point.

04:26.396 --> 04:30.149
The way it's going,
only Mary Poppins would make the cut.

04:30.275 --> 04:34.862
I don't care what doctors say. I think it's
important for children to eat a lot of cheese.

04:37.950 --> 04:39.659
Well, if a child's choking,

04:39.785 --> 04:42.370
I just do what my mama always did.

04:42.496 --> 04:44.246
You get ahold of it by the legs

04:44.373 --> 04:46.749
and you give it a little knuckle-slap.

04:49.878 --> 04:52.380
No, I've never had martial-arts training,

04:52.506 --> 04:54.548
but I can scream real loud.

05:01.682 --> 05:02.974
I have a nursing degree

05:03.100 --> 05:06.978
with an emphasis
on infant-toddler growth and development.

05:07.104 --> 05:08.437
Why not work at a hospital?

05:08.563 --> 05:11.023
Well, I did,
but there were budget cuts,

05:11.149 --> 05:12.984
and my ward was downsized.

05:13.860 --> 05:15.403
I live alone.
I don't need a big salary.

05:15.529 --> 05:18.864
So a nanny position would work
very well for me.

05:23.328 --> 05:25.538
He's tired.

05:25.664 --> 05:27.790
May I?

05:30.002 --> 05:32.336
- I don't bite.
- OK.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.963
Hi.

05:34.089 --> 05:35.673
Oh.

05:36.883 --> 05:38.926
What a little prince you are.

05:39.845 --> 05:41.637
Mmm.

05:43.724 --> 05:46.142
♪ Bye, baby Bunting

05:46.977 --> 05:49.353
♪ Daddy's gone a-hunting

05:50.856 --> 05:53.899
♪ Gone to find a rabbit skin

05:54.026 --> 05:56.944
♪ To wrap the baby Bunting in ♪

05:57.696 --> 06:01.824
And then there was Sonya.
Practically perfect in every way.

06:01.950 --> 06:04.869
Well, you have my number.
I'll look forward to your call.

06:04.995 --> 06:06.746
Again, my condolences for your loss.

06:06.872 --> 06:08.622
Thanks. We'll be in touch.

06:08.749 --> 06:10.041
Bye, prince Harry.

06:14.171 --> 06:15.755
She's the one.

06:15.881 --> 06:18.174
Are you sure you don't want
to keep looking, Dex?

06:18.967 --> 06:20.843
I just don't want to lose her.

06:20.969 --> 06:22.970
Prince Harry likes her.

06:24.056 --> 06:26.557
- Ditto me.
- Then call her.

06:29.853 --> 06:31.479
Don't forget, you and Harrison...

06:31.605 --> 06:33.397
Crisis counsellor.
I won't forget.

06:34.566 --> 06:35.816
Love you, bro.

06:39.654 --> 06:41.697
Me too.

06:51.416 --> 06:53.876
Emptiness wasn't always a problem.

06:54.002 --> 06:56.253
I used to cherish it.

06:56.963 --> 06:59.131
But now it feels like
something to overcome.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.969
Emptiness is all she has left.

07:07.933 --> 07:10.768
Boyd Fowler. Department of Sanitation.

07:10.894 --> 07:12.895
Division of Dead Animal Pickup.

07:14.439 --> 07:18.359
Hobbies - self-improνement
and storing women in formaldehyde.

07:19.486 --> 07:21.612
I don't know if killing you
will fill the void,

07:21.738 --> 07:23.989
but it's a place to start.

07:29.788 --> 07:32.289
- What's this?
- ATM surveillance video.

07:32.415 --> 07:35.126
The bank sent it over.
This is our shotgun guy.

07:35.252 --> 07:36.710
- Francisco Alfaro?
- Yeah.

07:36.837 --> 07:38.838
It's what he looked like
when he had a face.

07:39.714 --> 07:40.840
When was this taken?

07:40.966 --> 07:44.051
Two hours before he killed his wife
and blew his own head off.

07:44.177 --> 07:45.970
Trying to get cash,

07:46.096 --> 07:48.222
but he keeps putting in
the wrong PIN number.

07:48.348 --> 07:51.767
- 0371. His wife's birthday.
- Ouch.

07:51.893 --> 07:53.936
Good thing she's dead.

07:54.062 --> 07:56.438
He never would have
lived that down.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.651
What the hell happened to you guys?

08:01.486 --> 08:02.528
Battle scars.

08:03.905 --> 08:06.699
We had to get ghetto on some dirt-bag
at the club last night.

08:06.825 --> 08:09.493
- You guys got in a bar fight?
- It's not worth talking about.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.745
True warriors are humble men.

08:11.872 --> 08:14.331
Oh, please.
You got a reason to be humble.

08:14.457 --> 08:16.834
You got fucked up
running the other way.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.378
You're confusing cowardice
with a tactical retreat.

08:19.504 --> 08:20.462
Hermano, back me up here.

08:20.589 --> 08:22.882
You backed up just fine on your own.

08:23.008 --> 08:25.009
OK, let's focus on the case, people.

08:25.135 --> 08:28.512
- Remember why we're getting paid.
- OK. I'll go first.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.806
Guy offs his wife,
wants to skip the country.

08:30.932 --> 08:33.934
Needs cash, but he's so wigged out,
he can't remember the PIN.

08:34.060 --> 08:35.769
Gives up, goes home, kills himself.

08:35.896 --> 08:40.065
Only problem with that theory is
Alfaro doesn't have a motive to kill his wife.

08:40.192 --> 08:42.109
- Maybe he's just sick of her.
- Oh, yeah, he got sick of her?

08:42.235 --> 08:43.903
Got sick of her,
so he cut off her head

08:44.029 --> 08:46.071
and put it in a park
and put candles all around it?

08:46.198 --> 08:49.366
Yeah. Have you watched the video?
Cos he's a little fucking crazy.

08:49.492 --> 08:51.952
Crazy does not explain why he doesn't
have a drop of blood on his clothes.

08:52.078 --> 08:53.329
Why don't you think
about that for a second?

08:53.455 --> 08:55.831
How do you cut somebody's head off
and not get a drop of blood on you?

08:55.957 --> 08:57.041
What'd he do? Wear a bib?

08:57.167 --> 09:00.836
As much fun as this is,
we're not gonna hash this out in the room.

09:00.962 --> 09:02.796
I would like to re-canvass
the neighbourhood

09:02.923 --> 09:04.673
where Mrs Alfaro's body was found.

09:04.799 --> 09:07.843
There are a lot of houses facing that park.
Somebody's bound to talk.

09:07.969 --> 09:10.638
- Start today.
- And I think Batista should be there.

09:10.764 --> 09:13.599
Hispanic neighbourhood.
Hispanic cop.

09:13.725 --> 09:15.476
Might raise the comfort level,
loosen tongues.

09:15.602 --> 09:17.770
I get it. OK.

09:17.896 --> 09:21.023
The rest of you, stay with the case.
Work your leads.

09:21.608 --> 09:23.567
- Thanks.
- Beautiful.

09:24.569 --> 09:26.362
Angel?

09:26.488 --> 09:28.781
Just how big was this fight?

09:28.907 --> 09:31.867
Like I told you this morning,
it was a disagreement that got out of hand.

09:31.993 --> 09:34.161
Too much booze.
Too much testosterone.

09:34.287 --> 09:35.537
Espérate.

09:35.664 --> 09:37.289
Uh...

09:38.375 --> 09:42.127
You punched another cop.
I mean, qué pasó?

09:42.254 --> 09:45.047
- What started it?
- We hashed it out.

09:45.173 --> 09:46.799
Hombre a hombre.

09:46.925 --> 09:49.134
It's settled.

09:53.682 --> 09:55.891
Pretty sure his appetite's
about the same.

09:56.017 --> 09:58.978
He's always been
kind of a messy eater.

09:59.104 --> 10:00.604
It's hard to tell.

10:00.730 --> 10:03.274
- His sleeping pattern?
- Same.

10:04.359 --> 10:08.028
Unfortunately, he cries
about three times a night,

10:08.154 --> 10:11.073
on a good night.

10:11.199 --> 10:15.077
So you're not surprised
that he's acting pretty much normal?

10:15.203 --> 10:16.912
No.

10:17.038 --> 10:20.040
You and Harrison suffered
a terrible tragedy.

10:20.166 --> 10:21.917
It's no getting around that,

10:22.043 --> 10:24.712
but there is something
to be thankful for.

10:25.505 --> 10:27.172
- Thankful?
- Yes.

10:28.049 --> 10:32.553
Harrison's cognitive abilities
are really just developing.

10:34.556 --> 10:37.850
So you're saying he might not be
affected by what he saw?

10:37.976 --> 10:40.269
There's just simply no chance
that he was able

10:40.395 --> 10:42.187
to comprehend what was happening.

10:46.276 --> 10:49.820
I saw something pretty traumatic
when I was three.

10:49.946 --> 10:53.073
Harrison's only ten months.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.201
It affected me a lot.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.165
You don't have any idea.

11:01.291 --> 11:03.834
I've seen a lot of children.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.253
We'll keep an eye on Harrison, but...

11:06.379 --> 11:09.715
I really think your son
is gonna be perfectly fine.

11:16.348 --> 11:17.848
Ooh.

11:18.516 --> 11:20.893
He wants his head back.

11:22.103 --> 11:23.062
Ahh.

11:23.188 --> 11:25.189
Children Harrison's age can exhibit

11:25.315 --> 11:28.359
what might seem like violent behaviour,

11:28.485 --> 11:30.277
but they're just releasing energy.

11:30.403 --> 11:32.571
It's important not to read into it.

11:32.697 --> 11:34.823
I'll try not to.

11:36.159 --> 11:39.161
The most important thing
you can do right now,

11:39.287 --> 11:41.330
is take care of yourself.

11:41.456 --> 11:43.957
Find some time
to release your own energy.

11:44.084 --> 11:46.835
Do something for Dexter.

11:49.255 --> 11:51.298
Dexter will.

11:52.717 --> 11:56.011
I have nothing to say.
I didn't see no one.

11:56.137 --> 11:59.848
Well, if you remember anything,
or if you hear anything...

11:59.974 --> 12:03.477
Yes, mm-hm. I call you.
Córrele, mi hija.

12:05.647 --> 12:07.272
We're never gonna hear from her.

12:07.399 --> 12:09.775
All this no talking
is fucking frustrating.

12:09.901 --> 12:11.235
Yeah.

12:12.028 --> 12:13.195
You know what's frustrating?

12:13.321 --> 12:15.948
Nine days, 13 hours.

12:16.074 --> 12:18.492
- What?
- Since we, you know?

12:18.618 --> 12:20.035
- Just...
- You're counting?

12:20.161 --> 12:22.121
I can't help it.
I have an internal clock.

12:22.247 --> 12:24.164
Well, unplug it.

12:24.290 --> 12:27.126
I'm just saying, at this point,
we might as well be married.

12:27.252 --> 12:30.129
Shit on my face.
You ever use words like "we" and "married"

12:30.255 --> 12:32.047
in the same fucking sentence again...

12:33.216 --> 12:35.509
Another case of temporary blindness.
Anything?

12:35.635 --> 12:37.428
These people are all afraid of something.

12:37.554 --> 12:39.346
Yeah, I'm getting that too.

12:39.472 --> 12:40.806
Maybe they just
don't want to get involved.

12:40.932 --> 12:42.182
No, I think it's more than that.

12:42.308 --> 12:44.017
If the killer's dead, what are they afraid of?

12:44.144 --> 12:45.436
I thought I could make some headway,

12:45.562 --> 12:48.230
but the reality is,
this is a Venezuelan neighbourhood.

12:48.356 --> 12:49.940
- So?
- I'm Cuban.

12:51.234 --> 12:54.111
- Officer Manzon's from this neighbourhood.
- Manzon?

12:54.237 --> 12:56.196
She's a uniform,
but she might be worth bringing in.

12:56.322 --> 12:58.240
She thinks these are
about religious murders.

12:58.366 --> 13:00.284
"Santa Mierda."

13:00.410 --> 13:01.410
Ha!

13:01.536 --> 13:03.704
That's Santa Muerte.

13:03.830 --> 13:06.623
It's "Saint Death",
not "Saint Shit".

13:07.333 --> 13:11.420
And Manzon might be onto something.
Might explain why no one's talking.

13:11.546 --> 13:13.297
Shut up.

13:34.611 --> 13:36.361
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Dexter.

13:36.488 --> 13:37.404
Hi.

13:37.530 --> 13:39.740
Yeah, I don't know if I mentioned,
but for his nap,

13:39.866 --> 13:43.785
Harrison likes the puppy blanket
just touching his face.

13:43.912 --> 13:45.579
It's on your checklist.

13:45.705 --> 13:49.291
Uh, item eight
under "sleep preferences".

13:49.417 --> 13:52.544
OK, good. How's he doing?

13:52.670 --> 13:55.088
We just read
The Very Hungry Caterpillar,

13:55.215 --> 13:57.007
for the seventh time.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.969
Don't worry. He usually gets sick of it
around the 20th read.

14:04.098 --> 14:06.350
I gotta go.

14:08.228 --> 14:10.437
Yeah, you call me
if there's anything.

14:10.563 --> 14:12.731
Thought he'd never spot me.

14:17.737 --> 14:20.405
Some coinkidink, huh?

14:20.532 --> 14:22.157
You find any more dead animals?

14:23.284 --> 14:24.993
Looks like you're working on something.

14:25.119 --> 14:27.079
Tastes a lot better than it looks.

14:28.414 --> 14:30.415
Have a seat.

14:35.213 --> 14:37.673
- Boyd Fowler.
- Daryl Tucker.

14:41.052 --> 14:42.261
You work around here?

14:42.387 --> 14:44.471
I just love the arabica.

14:48.017 --> 14:51.770
Actually, I'm between jobs.
Hence the want ads.

14:53.731 --> 14:56.775
- What kind of work you looking for?
- Oh, not choosy.

14:56.901 --> 14:59.611
Whatever pays
and gets me out of the house.

15:01.406 --> 15:04.116
- You like what you do?
- I love it.

15:05.577 --> 15:08.078
Probably wouldn't think so,
driving around, picking up dead animals.

15:08.204 --> 15:11.206
Ah, beats working in a cubicle.

15:11.332 --> 15:13.542
You get out in the fresh air.

15:13.668 --> 15:15.711
Well, I guess most of the time it's fresh.

15:16.713 --> 15:19.131
It's not boring.

15:19.257 --> 15:21.675
Never know what's
around the next bend.

15:21.801 --> 15:23.802
Full of surprises.

15:27.140 --> 15:29.016
You know...

15:29.142 --> 15:31.560
If you're interested,
we might have an opening at animal pickup.

15:31.686 --> 15:35.439
- Really?
- Yeah, there ain't exactly a line either.

15:37.358 --> 15:40.110
You should take a ride with me.
See if you like it.

15:40.236 --> 15:43.322
You got to be OK
around dead things though.

15:44.574 --> 15:46.617
I don't think that's a problem.

15:46.743 --> 15:48.452
Great.

15:48.578 --> 15:49.911
Tomorrow morning, eight sharp.

15:50.038 --> 15:53.498
I would have settled
for your work schedule,

15:53.625 --> 15:55.709
but this could be better.

15:56.961 --> 15:58.962
Only 24 hours to get ready.

16:00.590 --> 16:02.466
Boyd's patrol route.

16:02.592 --> 16:05.844
Need to find a place
where we can spend some quality time.

16:08.681 --> 16:09.681
There.

16:19.484 --> 16:21.276
An old tourist welcome centre.

16:23.946 --> 16:25.822
Not very welcoming now.

16:40.838 --> 16:42.381
Totally isolated.

16:43.549 --> 16:45.759
Thank you, City of Miami.

16:45.885 --> 16:48.345
You're gonna kill him in daylight?

16:48.471 --> 16:50.180
Doesn't matter out this far.

16:50.306 --> 16:53.350
It's still very risky.
What if someone comes by?

16:54.519 --> 16:56.603
That could also happen at night.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.272
But it's a lot less likely.

17:01.025 --> 17:02.859
You have to do this right, Dexter.

17:02.985 --> 17:04.945
It's important.

17:05.071 --> 17:06.571
It's your first kill since...

17:06.698 --> 17:08.615
You don't have to tell me
how much I need this.

17:08.741 --> 17:10.826
That's the problem.

17:10.952 --> 17:11.910
What?

17:12.036 --> 17:13.995
This kill won't put everything right.

17:14.122 --> 17:16.289
It won't bring Rita back.

17:16.416 --> 17:18.333
It might bring me back.

17:18.459 --> 17:20.961
If you make it mean so much,
you'll only invite mistakes.

17:21.087 --> 17:23.797
I won't make any mistakes.
I'm following the code.

17:23.923 --> 17:25.632
Are you gonna help me or not?

17:25.758 --> 17:27.718
I only want to help you, Dex.

17:30.346 --> 17:32.139
This is a big room.

17:32.265 --> 17:34.266
I hope you brought enough plastic.

17:38.938 --> 17:41.606
It feels good
getting the details right.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.778
It's more than just
preparing a kill room.

18:06.507 --> 18:09.176
It's like I'm putting
my life back in order.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.641
And it's almost enough.

18:20.271 --> 18:22.022
Almost.

18:24.942 --> 18:27.611
If anyone knows
about these murders, it's Fauzi.

18:27.737 --> 18:29.988
He knows everybody
in this neighbourhood.

18:32.617 --> 18:34.284
You really grew up around here?

18:34.410 --> 18:36.203
You make it sound
like a disability.

18:36.329 --> 18:39.498
I'm asking a question.
I'm not about to burn a cross.

18:40.875 --> 18:44.044
I used to ride my bike around this block.
There was this mean dog that lived there.

18:44.170 --> 18:46.713
I mean, I used to pray to Saint Anthony
to make me invisible.

18:46.839 --> 18:47.964
I never got bit.

18:48.090 --> 18:50.050
You think prayer was the reason?

18:50.176 --> 18:51.092
Yeah.

18:51.219 --> 18:53.637
That and some
homemade pepper spray.

19:06.526 --> 19:08.068
¿Podemos hablar con Fauzi?

19:08.194 --> 19:09.194
¿Por qué razón?

19:09.320 --> 19:11.947
Policía. Es importante. Por favor.

19:13.241 --> 19:14.783
Un momento.

19:20.164 --> 19:21.665
I was surprised you called.

19:21.791 --> 19:24.292
Thought you didn't believe
what I said at the crime scene.

19:24.418 --> 19:26.253
Who says I do?

19:26.379 --> 19:28.547
At this point,
I can't rule anything out.

19:28.673 --> 19:30.966
Well, bringing me in
was the best move, Detective.

19:31.092 --> 19:33.093
You won't be sorry.

19:51.362 --> 19:54.406
Me llamo Manzon. Es el Detective Morgan.

19:55.992 --> 19:58.702
Ask him if he's heard
of the deaths of Mr and Mrs Alfaro.

20:03.332 --> 20:06.042
Sí. Qué cosa tan terrible.

20:07.211 --> 20:09.671
This was found
at the crime scene.

20:11.591 --> 20:12.757
Did he sell it to Mr Alfaro?

20:25.563 --> 20:27.063
He says Alfaro was a strict Catholic.

20:27.189 --> 20:29.524
Came into the store now and then
to buy some things,

20:29.650 --> 20:31.484
but he wouldn't have been
caught dead back here.

20:31.611 --> 20:33.111
Did he sell it to anyone else?

20:40.912 --> 20:43.538
He says he doesn't keep track
of who buys what,

20:43.664 --> 20:45.582
and he doesn't even believe in this shit.

20:45.708 --> 20:47.626
Is that why he has the tattoo?

20:47.752 --> 20:52.005
I got drunk one night,
woke up, it was there.

20:52.131 --> 20:53.715
You tell me.

20:57.136 --> 20:59.888
- ¿Te llamas Manzon?
- Sí. Cira.

21:00.014 --> 21:01.848
Ah, coño.

21:01.974 --> 21:03.516
Eres la hija de Andrés.

21:03.643 --> 21:05.352
Hey, hey. We're doing great in English.

21:05.478 --> 21:09.481
You live in Miami.
Why you no learn Spanish?

21:09.607 --> 21:12.943
Because me too busy
making a living.

21:13.945 --> 21:16.196
Is there anything else
you can tell us?

21:16.322 --> 21:18.615
Anything that will help us
with this case?

21:18.741 --> 21:20.575
Yo no sé nada.

21:23.788 --> 21:25.330
Fauzi's holding back.

21:25.456 --> 21:26.998
I should have talked
to him by myself.

21:27.124 --> 21:29.125
Might have been in a more sharing mood
with someone he knows.

21:29.251 --> 21:30.543
Oh, yeah?
Maybe he would have said nothing,

21:30.670 --> 21:32.712
like everyone else
in this neighbourhood.

21:35.383 --> 21:37.425
Hey, I know you're up against it,

21:37.551 --> 21:39.678
but you might just want
to take a breath.

21:44.725 --> 21:46.267
Why don't we give him the night
to stew over this

21:46.394 --> 21:48.812
and then you come
visit him tomorrow alone?

21:48.938 --> 21:50.855
Fine.

22:11.669 --> 22:16.798
Sonya?

22:20.386 --> 22:22.387
Where are they?

22:25.391 --> 22:27.767
Hi, this is Sonya.
Leave a message.

22:27.893 --> 22:29.644
Yeah, it's Dexter.
I just got back and you're not here,

22:29.770 --> 22:32.397
and not answering your cell.
Call me now.

22:33.190 --> 22:35.900
Can't help but think the worst.
Harrison's been stolen.

22:36.027 --> 22:38.945
I shouldn't have left him
with a stranger.

22:39.071 --> 22:41.114
Rita would have never allowed it.

22:43.701 --> 22:47.162
Hi. Finally fallen asleep.

22:50.791 --> 22:51.750
Where were you?

22:51.876 --> 22:54.753
Well, he was keyed up after
his Yo Gabba Gabba! Videos.

22:54.879 --> 22:56.838
I thought some fresh air
would make him drowsy.

22:56.964 --> 22:59.257
It worked.

22:59.383 --> 23:02.385
- You didn't answer your cell.
- Well, I had my hands full.

23:04.263 --> 23:07.307
Oh, I left a note on the fridge.

23:08.392 --> 23:10.185
Oh, I didn't mean to worry you.

23:10.311 --> 23:12.437
No, it's fine. I'm just...

23:13.606 --> 23:15.899
I'm not used to checking
the fridge for notes.

23:16.025 --> 23:18.443
Just messages
from other serial killers.

23:20.237 --> 23:23.448
- Oh, I feel terrible.
- Don't. You were just doing your job.

23:24.575 --> 23:27.118
Hey, I'm lucky to have you.

23:27.244 --> 23:28.578
We both are.

23:37.713 --> 23:40.090
Oh! A little courtesy, please.

23:41.884 --> 23:43.259
Thanks.

23:45.930 --> 23:47.931
You hitting the club tonight?

23:49.558 --> 23:50.767
No. Home.

23:51.644 --> 23:54.104
Oh, good. Cos I won't be there
to watch your back.

23:54.230 --> 23:56.481
There could be wingmen out there
looking to settle the score.

23:56.607 --> 23:58.691
Just drop it.

23:58.818 --> 24:02.320
With all due respect,
this man is a knight in shining armour.

24:02.446 --> 24:04.781
You should be polishing his lance.

24:04.907 --> 24:06.699
Excuse me?

24:08.911 --> 24:11.079
I meant that metaphorically.

24:11.205 --> 24:14.249
Not... how it sounded.

24:17.211 --> 24:19.212
Good night.

24:25.553 --> 24:29.889
OK, I want to know exactly
what happened at the bar.

24:30.641 --> 24:33.893
I told you it's settled, tesoro.

24:37.314 --> 24:39.315
I'm not asking as your wife.

24:40.985 --> 24:43.987
Vince and I were having drinks,
keeping to ourselves.

24:44.113 --> 24:46.531
And then out of the blue,
Sergeant Lopez starts talking shit.

24:46.657 --> 24:49.200
- What shit?
- You know... shit.

24:49.326 --> 24:52.245
- He was out of line.
- Specifics.

24:59.253 --> 25:00.962
He asked if you and I were married.

25:01.088 --> 25:04.382
Then he said you were
a fine piece of ass.

25:06.594 --> 25:09.095
- And you were my sugar mama.
- Sugar mama?

25:09.221 --> 25:12.056
Yeah, cos you're my boss
and your paycheck has more zeros.

25:12.183 --> 25:14.517
- Does that really bother you?
- A little.

25:14.643 --> 25:17.020
Do you know any guys
it wouldn't bother?

25:18.022 --> 25:19.856
- So you hit him?
- No, there's more.

25:19.982 --> 25:22.567
- More?
- You wanted to know everything.

25:24.195 --> 25:28.114
He then said you gave
the best blowjobs in Miami.

25:32.703 --> 25:35.079
And then I hit him.

25:35.206 --> 25:37.207
And he's lucky that's all I did.

25:45.466 --> 25:49.219
Angel, I'm a woman
in a position of power.

25:49.345 --> 25:51.888
Some men have trouble
dealing with that,

25:52.014 --> 25:55.225
- so they spread garbage around.
- I know. I know.

25:57.895 --> 25:59.562
And I'm trying to work through it.

26:02.399 --> 26:05.151
Could you work through it
without the bar fights?

26:05.277 --> 26:08.071
I'll keep the bar fights
at a minimum.

26:14.787 --> 26:16.412
He sleeping?

26:16.538 --> 26:18.539
Like a baby.

26:22.461 --> 26:24.128
How was work?

26:25.089 --> 26:26.881
Dire.

26:27.007 --> 26:29.801
I've been saddled with this uniform
on a homicide case,

26:29.927 --> 26:32.595
and she's driving me
ape-ass crazy.

26:34.265 --> 26:38.601
- How's the nanny?
- Aside from a little message hiccup...

26:38.727 --> 26:42.397
It was totally my fault.
She did great.

26:42.523 --> 26:44.607
I wonder why she left Ireland.

26:46.277 --> 26:48.361
- Maybe she's running from something.
- I don't know, Deb.

26:48.487 --> 26:50.363
Maybe you better check Interpol.

26:53.158 --> 26:55.159
What about you?
What'd you do today?

26:55.286 --> 26:58.079
Not much. Cody called.

26:58.205 --> 27:01.874
He wanted me to send
my recipe for pancakes.

27:02.835 --> 27:04.919
How are they?

27:05.045 --> 27:07.380
Cody sounds...

27:07.506 --> 27:09.382
happier.

27:10.301 --> 27:12.385
Astor wouldn't come to the phone.

27:14.138 --> 27:15.847
She'll come around, Dex.

27:17.766 --> 27:20.643
Well, other than that,
I ran some errands.

27:20.769 --> 27:21.894
That's good.

27:23.272 --> 27:25.148
Get back in your routine.

27:25.274 --> 27:27.900
When you lose someone close,
routine can be a ladder

27:28.027 --> 27:30.737
that can help you climb back
into some kind of normalcy.

27:35.617 --> 27:39.287
- Where'd you hear that?
- I am capable of independent thought.

27:42.249 --> 27:44.083
Oprah.

27:44.209 --> 27:46.419
I watched her
when I was laid up.

27:47.212 --> 27:48.254
That's good.

27:49.381 --> 27:51.007
Keep getting better, Dex.

27:52.301 --> 27:53.718
I'll try.

27:57.389 --> 27:59.932
Yeah, I'd like to report
a dead animal.

28:01.310 --> 28:04.145
Uh, County Road five,
mile marker 31.

28:05.689 --> 28:08.691
I'm not sure.
I think it was a gator.

28:08.817 --> 28:10.818
It was long and scaly.

28:11.945 --> 28:13.988
Yeah. Thank you.

28:16.742 --> 28:20.078
It's on Boyd's circuit,
so he'll get the call.

28:20.204 --> 28:21.829
When he does,
Boyd will take a little nap

28:21.955 --> 28:24.749
and wake up
in the tourist welcome centre.

28:24.875 --> 28:27.418
But he won't be collecting
any brochures.

28:30.047 --> 28:32.090
Wasn't sure you'd be here.

28:32.216 --> 28:33.758
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

28:33.884 --> 28:35.802
Hey, I'm a safety guy.

28:37.054 --> 28:38.596
Right.

28:38.722 --> 28:41.516
Never be too safe.

28:41.642 --> 28:46.312
- Where we off to first?
- Dead cat on Lindgren. Boring.

28:46.438 --> 28:48.106
Pretty neighbourhood though.

28:48.232 --> 28:52.276
Lot of trophy wives
out jogging at this hour.

28:52.403 --> 28:54.153
There's a bonus.

28:54.988 --> 28:57.490
You have to embrace the now.
Every second you waste

28:57.616 --> 29:00.410
is one more second
you'll never get back.

29:00.536 --> 29:01.828
Ever hear this guy?

29:01.954 --> 29:03.788
When I was searching your house.

29:03.914 --> 29:07.333
Changed my life.
Really helped me see what's important.

29:08.377 --> 29:10.336
Do the same for you.

29:10.462 --> 29:12.588
Ease you through that divorce.

29:13.632 --> 29:15.258
Divorce?

29:15.384 --> 29:16.467
Ring dent.

29:18.178 --> 29:20.346
I didn't want Boyd
to know that part of my life.

29:20.472 --> 29:22.890
For a roadkill janitor,
he doesn't miss much.

29:23.016 --> 29:24.892
Hope it's not a touchy subject.

29:26.270 --> 29:27.895
No, it just didn't work out.

29:28.021 --> 29:31.274
If you need help moving on,
listen to these CDs.

29:32.776 --> 29:34.986
- Take it.
- Take it now.

29:35.112 --> 29:37.113
That's the main idea.

29:38.157 --> 29:40.867
- Take it now?
- There's more to it than that,

29:40.993 --> 29:42.869
but it really makes a difference.

29:42.995 --> 29:47.623
Of course, you got to know
what it is you want to take.

29:49.626 --> 29:51.294
What is it you want, Daryl?

29:55.382 --> 29:57.425
That's kind of
a hard question to answer.

29:58.260 --> 29:59.177
Yes, it is.

29:59.303 --> 30:02.889
But I really think it's what
we're on this earth to find out.

30:27.456 --> 30:28.873
Justin Bieber.

30:31.293 --> 30:33.836
Not that I know who that is.

30:39.843 --> 30:42.178
I know who purchased
the Santa Muerte icons,

30:42.304 --> 30:44.222
and it wasn't our dead husband.

30:44.348 --> 30:46.641
- Fauzi talked?
- I was right. He was holding back.

30:46.767 --> 30:49.602
- What'd you get?
- No names, but a description.

30:49.728 --> 30:51.771
Two guys in their 30s,
strong accents,

30:51.897 --> 30:54.273
possibly recent immigrants
from Venezuela.

30:54.399 --> 30:56.192
Criminal types.
Those were his words.

30:56.318 --> 30:58.110
And big into Santa Muerte.

31:00.447 --> 31:03.783
What if Alfaro isn't freaked out
because he just murdered his wife?

31:04.618 --> 31:07.662
What if he's freaked out
because someone's got his wife?

31:07.788 --> 31:09.705
And they'll kill her
unless he pays cash.

31:09.831 --> 31:11.874
This isn't drug related.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.669
Maybe she was fucking
held hostage for ransom.

31:14.795 --> 31:16.963
You think Fauzi spilled
everything he knows?

31:17.089 --> 31:19.340
He's been asking around.
Thinks he can dig up some more.

31:19.466 --> 31:21.717
Well, let's fucking find out.

31:22.469 --> 31:25.012
Sometimes it gets so hot,

31:25.138 --> 31:28.474
these things actually start frying.
And you got to...

31:28.600 --> 31:31.769
you got to scrape 'em off
like diner food.

31:31.895 --> 31:34.272
Two hours
and no call about my gator.

31:34.398 --> 31:37.024
They must have sent someone else.

31:37.150 --> 31:39.986
God almighty.
That stink gets in your soul.

31:40.112 --> 31:42.446
Which means this kill is dead.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.949
Man, you got a nose of steel.

31:45.075 --> 31:47.034
You're made for this job.

31:48.328 --> 31:50.121
Now I'm stuck with Boyd.

31:54.167 --> 31:55.960
So much for getting my life back.

32:04.011 --> 32:06.304
It's almost lunch time.

32:06.430 --> 32:08.222
I usually eat at home by myself,

32:08.348 --> 32:11.142
but there's a Chinese place
not too far.

32:11.268 --> 32:13.227
Hang on.

32:16.481 --> 32:17.648
Boyd.

32:17.774 --> 32:20.026
Maybe the universe
is showing mercy on me.

32:20.152 --> 32:21.902
What's the location?

32:23.697 --> 32:25.948
- I'm on it.
- What's up?

32:26.074 --> 32:28.367
Dead gator out on County five.

32:28.493 --> 32:30.411
First promising thing all day.

32:30.537 --> 32:32.788
But if you're starving,
we can push it till after lunch.

32:32.914 --> 32:34.915
- I'm good.
- Then let's rumble.

32:39.296 --> 32:42.798
Gator runs can be hairy.
You got to be on your toes.

32:42.924 --> 32:47.678
- Hairy how?
- Can't always tell if they're really dead.

32:48.555 --> 32:51.098
- Yikes.
- Don't worry. Like I said...

32:51.224 --> 32:53.392
I'm a safety guy.

32:56.104 --> 32:57.938
Must be at lunch.

33:15.791 --> 33:20.628
Hello?

33:27.886 --> 33:29.261
Shit.

33:30.889 --> 33:32.431
Detective.

33:35.394 --> 33:36.435
Call it in.

33:38.146 --> 33:39.188
Do it.

33:40.148 --> 33:41.357
This is Officer Manzon.

34:04.506 --> 34:06.841
Mile marker should be
right around here.

34:08.468 --> 34:10.553
Be careful.
Sucker could be anywhere.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.680
You really don't want to step on it.

34:13.724 --> 34:14.724
Finally...

34:17.728 --> 34:18.894
it's right.

34:28.405 --> 34:29.780
Shit.

34:50.761 --> 34:51.802
Where am I?

34:51.928 --> 34:54.430
On your way to County Medical.

34:54.556 --> 34:57.725
- You know what city you're in?
- Miami.

34:57.851 --> 34:59.852
What day is it?

35:00.771 --> 35:02.480
Wednesday.
What happened to me?

35:02.606 --> 35:06.567
A motorist spotted you
lying on the side of the road, called 911.

35:06.693 --> 35:10.488
Seems this guy
shot you with a tranq dart.

35:10.614 --> 35:12.656
Boys have an argument
or something?

35:14.284 --> 35:16.243
No. No.

35:16.369 --> 35:18.829
Went off by accident.

35:18.955 --> 35:21.957
Crazy asshole, you were
supposed to shoot the gator.

35:22.667 --> 35:26.504
You got in my way,
you fucking numbskull.

35:27.422 --> 35:30.257
So what's your excuse?
Why were you unconscious?

35:30.383 --> 35:32.384
They must not have found
my needle.

35:34.679 --> 35:37.807
I guess I was just so upset
that I passed out.

35:37.933 --> 35:39.725
There's one piece of good luck.

35:39.851 --> 35:41.685
I really need to get back to my truck.

35:41.812 --> 35:44.396
Yeah, sorry. I can't let you jump
out of a moving ambulance.

35:44.523 --> 35:47.399
We'll be there soon.
Need to get you both checked over.

35:56.284 --> 35:57.743
Got him.

35:59.538 --> 36:01.622
Dropping it.

36:02.374 --> 36:04.250
Let's go.

36:04.376 --> 36:06.168
Let's go on three.

36:10.423 --> 36:11.799
Trauma two.

36:33.238 --> 36:34.446
Chart.

36:35.407 --> 36:36.532
I'm Dr Lorre.

36:36.658 --> 36:39.702
I understand you suffered
a loss of consciousness.

36:39.828 --> 36:42.872
- That's what I'm told.
- That ever happen before?

36:42.998 --> 36:44.957
Um... First time.

36:45.083 --> 36:47.293
You have any history
of headaches, dizziness,

36:47.419 --> 36:48.919
- blurred vision?
- Uh-uh.

36:49.045 --> 36:51.589
- Hypoglycaemia?
- Not that I know of.

36:51.715 --> 36:54.717
OK. We're gonna run a chem profile

36:54.843 --> 36:57.803
and check your glucose levels
for possible dehydration.

36:57.929 --> 37:01.557
We'll follow up with a tox screen.
See if anything's in your system.

37:02.767 --> 37:05.686
I'll be right back to draw your blood.
Just lie still.

37:59.032 --> 38:00.157
He's in there, OK.

38:00.283 --> 38:02.660
Just give him aspirin.
No painkillers.

38:02.786 --> 38:04.578
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I didn't know about his addiction.

38:04.704 --> 38:07.623
Well, you got to check
the patient's records here, he's...

38:07.749 --> 38:10.584
Fifth time he's been in the ER this year.
This is his fifth accident.

38:10.710 --> 38:12.711
- It won't happen again.
- All right.

38:22.973 --> 38:25.140
Another head?

38:25.850 --> 38:28.060
And I was in such a good mood.

38:32.691 --> 38:35.442
It's my fault. I got him killed.

38:36.361 --> 38:38.153
Fuck that.
You didn't cut his head off.

38:38.947 --> 38:41.490
They did this because
he started talking to me.

38:42.659 --> 38:45.619
If I hadn't come back here,
Fauzi would still be alive.

38:45.745 --> 38:47.246
It was my call.

38:47.372 --> 38:49.039
We're in this together.

38:49.165 --> 38:51.959
And we're closer to catching him
because of you, OK?

38:52.085 --> 38:54.086
You did good.

38:54.212 --> 38:56.296
Looks like...

38:56.423 --> 38:59.967
the same treatment
as our other... head case.

39:03.638 --> 39:05.723
Eyes and tongue
have been excised.

39:05.849 --> 39:08.142
Damn, don't people just shoot
each other any more?

39:11.312 --> 39:12.855
Excuse me a sec.

39:15.150 --> 39:17.484
Hey, thanks for calling me back.

39:17.610 --> 39:20.029
No prob.
Sorry it took so long.

39:20.155 --> 39:21.905
We're up to our necks
on this Trinity thing.

39:22.032 --> 39:24.533
Yeah, that's what I want
to talk to you about.

39:24.659 --> 39:26.452
I think I may have a lead on Kyle Butler.

39:27.037 --> 39:27.953
Kyle Butler?

39:28.079 --> 39:30.581
Yeah, you know, the guy who was
hanging around with Arthur Mitchell?

39:30.707 --> 39:31.790
Yeah, I know who he is.

39:31.916 --> 39:33.959
Just didn't know you people
were working this.

39:34.085 --> 39:36.712
I'm sort of, uh...
flying off the record.

39:36.838 --> 39:38.130
Listen.

39:38.256 --> 39:40.466
Is there any chance I could talk
to the Mitchell family?

39:40.592 --> 39:43.427
The Mitchells are in a safe house.
First stop before witness protection.

39:43.553 --> 39:45.888
Just want to show them a photo.
Take five minutes.

39:47.557 --> 39:49.141
Give me the photo.
I'll show it to them.

39:49.267 --> 39:51.810
Ah, it's too sensitive.

39:51.936 --> 39:54.521
If I'm wrong,
it could mean my ass.

39:54.647 --> 39:58.901
Come on...
Ray, as a friend.

40:00.528 --> 40:03.405
- I'll see what I can do, but no promises.
- Thanks.

40:03.531 --> 40:05.157
Let me know.

41:02.006 --> 41:03.590
Take it.

41:03.716 --> 41:05.425
- Now, before you can take anything...
- What the fuck?

41:05.552 --> 41:08.053
you have to know what it is you want.

41:08.179 --> 41:11.056
May sound easy,
but you can't know what you want

41:11.182 --> 41:12.683
unless you know yourself.

41:12.809 --> 41:16.103
But if you want something,
there's only one option.

41:16.229 --> 41:17.271
Take it.

41:18.731 --> 41:22.025
You want that promotion?
Well, then, take it.

41:22.152 --> 41:24.820
You want that new car,
that house?

41:24.946 --> 41:26.613
Take it.

41:30.660 --> 41:32.703
That could have gone smoother.

41:35.248 --> 41:37.833
Could have also gone worse.

41:37.959 --> 41:40.043
Least he's down.

41:51.222 --> 41:53.056
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Dexter.

41:53.183 --> 41:55.184
Wanted to tell you that I'm gonna be

41:55.310 --> 41:56.894
- a little later than I expected.
- It's no problem.

41:57.020 --> 41:58.896
My sister should
be there any minute though.

41:59.022 --> 42:01.356
Actually, she phoned too.
She's tied up at work.

42:01.482 --> 42:02.524
Oh.

42:02.650 --> 42:04.568
It's OK. I don't mind staying late.

42:04.694 --> 42:07.112
I... I like watching him sleep.

42:07.238 --> 42:08.363
You're a lifesaver.

42:08.489 --> 42:09.990
I was gonna call you.

42:10.116 --> 42:11.325
Is everything OK?

42:11.451 --> 42:13.327
He took his first step.

42:13.453 --> 42:15.913
At least I think it was his first.

42:16.873 --> 42:18.415
- He did?
- It was only one step,

42:18.541 --> 42:21.752
but you could tell
he was really proud of himself.

42:23.796 --> 42:24.922
That's amazing.

42:25.048 --> 42:27.674
I managed to get a shot for you.
Check your email.

42:27.800 --> 42:30.928
Thanks. I'll call you
when I'm on my way home.

42:39.687 --> 42:41.688
My son is walking...

42:42.941 --> 42:45.192
like a normal little boy.

42:52.575 --> 42:56.828
I'm on my way there right now.
Just start trolling for eyewitnesses.

42:56.955 --> 42:59.957
Maybe we'll catch a break.
Maybe someone saw something, OK?

43:00.083 --> 43:01.458
- Lieutenant LaGuerta?
- Yes?

43:01.584 --> 43:03.001
Jim McCourt,
Internal Affairs.

43:03.127 --> 43:06.255
I wonder if I could have
a word with you in private.

43:06.381 --> 43:08.340
Of course.

43:12.971 --> 43:16.139
So... what's this about?

43:16.266 --> 43:18.225
Well, this is really a courtesy call.

43:18.351 --> 43:20.102
We're about to launch
a formal investigation

43:20.228 --> 43:24.273
into one of your detectives,
a... Angel Batista.

43:24.399 --> 43:26.358
I understand he's your husband.

43:26.484 --> 43:28.026
Yes. Yes, he is.

43:28.152 --> 43:30.404
Apparently, he had
a physical altercation

43:30.530 --> 43:33.573
with one of his fellow officers.
A Sergeant Lopez.

43:33.700 --> 43:36.535
I was under the impression
the matter was settled.

43:36.661 --> 43:39.288
Far from it.
Lopez collapsed while on duty today.

43:39.414 --> 43:42.541
He's been hospitalised
with internal bleeding.

43:42.667 --> 43:43.583
My God.

43:43.710 --> 43:48.005
We believe that he'll pull through,
but he's filed charges.

43:48.131 --> 43:50.007
Something else
you should be aware of -

43:50.133 --> 43:53.218
we have two eyewitnesses
who claim that they saw Batista

43:53.344 --> 43:55.387
kick Sergeant Lopez
while on the ground.

43:55.513 --> 43:59.766
Now, if that is true,
that is assault with a deadly weapon.

43:59.892 --> 44:01.893
And he could not only
lose his job...

44:03.313 --> 44:05.314
he could serve time.

44:31.632 --> 44:33.633
Had to borrow this from you.
I hope you don't mind.

44:35.636 --> 44:37.346
What the hell?

44:37.472 --> 44:40.265
Normally,
I bring my own plastic, but...

44:41.851 --> 44:43.435
I had to...

44:44.187 --> 44:45.854
improvise.

44:47.607 --> 44:48.940
Let me the fuck out of here.

44:49.067 --> 44:50.734
I bet you've heard that before,

44:50.860 --> 44:54.196
"let me out of here",
from all the women you've killed.

44:59.827 --> 45:03.288
I wish you could see
the room I set up for you.

45:04.123 --> 45:07.626
Mmm. But you fucked
everything up, Boyd.

45:13.841 --> 45:16.676
All those pictures I took
of the women you killed.

45:16.803 --> 45:20.222
It's a shame you'll never get to see them.

45:25.019 --> 45:27.979
I'll just have to paint
a word-picture for you instead.

45:30.400 --> 45:32.025
They were young.

45:32.777 --> 45:35.445
Just starting their lives.

45:35.571 --> 45:37.114
Now they're floating in formaldehyde

45:37.240 --> 45:40.909
and stuffed into barrels
strewn around a swamp.

45:41.035 --> 45:43.120
Who the hell are you?

45:43.246 --> 45:50.127
Just a fellow traveller,
who also likes to pick up dead animals.

45:50.253 --> 45:51.920
I did 'em a favour.

45:53.339 --> 45:58.051
They were all suffering
and I put 'em out of their misery.

45:58.177 --> 46:00.720
Yeah, you'll be doing
one more favour tonight.

46:02.598 --> 46:04.724
What are you talking about?

46:06.269 --> 46:08.395
I've recently suffered a loss.

46:09.313 --> 46:10.730
My wife...

46:11.357 --> 46:13.567
was murdered by someone like you.

46:15.027 --> 46:17.571
Someone like me.

46:17.697 --> 46:20.490
It turned my life upside down.

46:20.616 --> 46:22.409
Why is it my problem?

46:22.535 --> 46:25.745
Because you're the start
of my healing process.

46:27.290 --> 46:30.417
I knew you were fucked up
the minute I laid eyes on you.

46:31.794 --> 46:34.212
I was fucked up long before that.

46:34.338 --> 46:36.298
You don't know
what you're getting into.

46:37.425 --> 46:40.093
Remember in the truck
you asked me what I want?

46:41.429 --> 46:43.430
I want my wife back.

46:46.934 --> 46:49.311
But this will have to do.

47:03.576 --> 47:06.828
No church bells.
No hallelujah chorus.

47:06.954 --> 47:08.955
Nothing feels different.

47:10.249 --> 47:12.417
If anything, I'm emptier.

47:34.315 --> 47:36.316
It's OK. I'm not gonna hurt you.

47:39.612 --> 47:41.696
It's OK. Here.

47:43.991 --> 47:45.909
No, don't. Don't.

47:46.035 --> 47:47.661
Stop. No.

47:55.461 --> 47:57.254
She saw everything.

48:00.299 --> 48:03.385
She saw... me.

48:04.310 --> 48:10.271
