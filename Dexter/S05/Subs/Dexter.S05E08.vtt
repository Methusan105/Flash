00:10.140 --> 00:11.099
Oye, mami.

00:11.225 --> 00:12.392
Previously on Dexter...

00:12.518 --> 00:13.434
Ven aquÃ­.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.187
- He's calling me over.
- Officer Manzon, go to him.

00:16.313 --> 00:18.898
Lieutenant, no, this is a problem.
These guys are dangerous.

00:19.024 --> 00:20.358
Stand down, Morgan.

00:26.407 --> 00:28.408
Drop the gun now!

00:29.618 --> 00:32.412
Our informant, Yasmin Aragon,
was shot and killed.

00:32.538 --> 00:33.788
This is a fucking disaster.

00:33.914 --> 00:36.833
If mistakes were made,
they most certainly were not mine.

00:38.460 --> 00:41.379
- I just gave you 500 bucks.
- And I told you about the girl.

00:41.505 --> 00:43.381
But if you want to find out who she is,

00:43.507 --> 00:46.092
where she's from,
and what she's doing in that damn house,

00:46.218 --> 00:47.760
you're gonna have to pay.

00:47.886 --> 00:51.222
Boyd wasn't the only one who did this to me.
There were others.

00:51.348 --> 00:55.351
Besides the ones
that we've already taken care of,

00:55.477 --> 00:56.644
suit and tie.

00:56.770 --> 01:00.481
He'd take off his jacket
and fold it very carefully,

01:00.607 --> 01:02.400
like he didn't want to mess it up.

01:02.526 --> 01:04.736
Someone tried to move
the girls in the barrels.

01:07.072 --> 01:08.990
- Where's the driver?
- He took off.

01:09.116 --> 01:10.992
That means he's still mine to find.

01:11.118 --> 01:12.952
You're never gonna guess
who this truck is registered to.

01:13.078 --> 01:14.203
Jordan Chase.

01:14.955 --> 01:16.372
Nice to meet you.

01:16.498 --> 01:17.832
Do you know this man?

01:20.127 --> 01:22.086
That's the guy who folded his jacket.

01:22.212 --> 01:26.257
His name's Cole Harmon.
He's Jordan Chase's head of security.

01:26.383 --> 01:27.842
- That's Cole.
- And Boyd.

01:27.968 --> 01:31.679
- And Dan the Dentist.
- It's them from, like, 15 years ago.

01:32.723 --> 01:34.015
What does this mean?

03:30.340 --> 03:32.466
We are born primal.

03:36.930 --> 03:39.974
Conceived with the impulse to fight

03:40.100 --> 03:41.225
for what we desire.

03:46.523 --> 03:48.816
It's written in our genes.

03:50.569 --> 03:53.029
It's engraved in our souls.

03:54.823 --> 03:57.617
But we've traded
the wilderness for pavement,

03:57.743 --> 04:00.202
trees for skyscrapers.

04:00.329 --> 04:04.707
We've lost touch with our instincts,
with what we are.

04:05.792 --> 04:08.085
We have fallen from nature's grace.

04:09.588 --> 04:11.881
But we shall be delivered!

04:19.848 --> 04:22.808
It's time to tap into your primal selves

04:22.935 --> 04:26.145
and seize the power of instinct.

04:27.648 --> 04:30.149
We're gonna cast off those shackles

04:30.275 --> 04:32.526
that bind us to jobs we hate,

04:32.653 --> 04:34.445
people we don't love,

04:34.571 --> 04:36.697
lives that aren't worth living.

04:37.866 --> 04:40.409
We are going to...

04:40.535 --> 04:42.453
Take it!

04:42.579 --> 04:47.041
I've never been around so many people
that made me feel normal.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.753
Yeah! Yeah!

04:50.879 --> 04:52.380
Really normal.

04:52.506 --> 04:54.674
- The power of risk!
- Take it!

04:54.800 --> 04:56.050
The power of desire.

04:56.176 --> 04:57.218
Take it!

04:57.344 --> 04:59.303
- The power of instinct.
- Take it!

04:59.429 --> 05:02.181
Instincts are all I've ever had.

05:02.307 --> 05:04.725
Cole Harmon, Chase's chief of security -

05:04.851 --> 05:07.436
torturer, rapist, killer.

05:07.562 --> 05:09.605
It's time to tap into my primal self.

05:09.731 --> 05:11.857
- The power of life!
- Take it!

05:11.984 --> 05:13.651
- We're gonna take it!
- Take it!

05:13.777 --> 05:16.654
- Take it! Take it!
- Take it! Take it!

05:16.780 --> 05:17.905
All right.

05:20.784 --> 05:22.159
Lieutenant LaGuerta!

05:22.285 --> 05:25.454
Multiple rounds were fired
at the recent Club Mayan shootout.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.874
Was Miami Metro responsible for the deaths
of innocent bystanders?

05:29.001 --> 05:31.252
I have nothing to say at this time.
Excuse me.

05:31.378 --> 05:34.755
Do you agree with the Mayor? Did this
operation needlessly put people at risk?

05:34.881 --> 05:37.216
Every undercover operation is high-risk.

05:37.342 --> 05:38.884
Is there going to be
an independent investigation?

05:39.011 --> 05:42.013
- No comment.
- Have you personally retained counsel?

05:42.889 --> 05:43.973
Counsel?

05:44.099 --> 05:47.685
Isn't it true the victims' families
have filed a civil lawsuit?

05:49.396 --> 05:53.065
Let me through.
Excuse me, let me through.

05:53.191 --> 05:57.361
Lieutenant LaGuerta, neither confirming
nor denying Miami Metro's culpability

05:57.487 --> 05:59.071
in the recent Club Mayan shootout.

05:59.197 --> 06:02.575
As we know,
two innocent people are dead, six...

06:02.701 --> 06:04.201
Did ballistics come in?

06:04.327 --> 06:08.456
Good news. Bullets from the victims' bodies
belong to the Fuentes brothers, not us.

06:08.582 --> 06:11.000
That is good news.

06:11.126 --> 06:13.961
But this is far from over.
I'm sure you heard the Mayor's statement.

06:14.087 --> 06:16.589
A prime example
of how shit just rolls downhill.

06:16.715 --> 06:19.091
He should have kept his mouth shut
until all the facts came out.

06:19.217 --> 06:21.969
He was right.
This operation was too risky.

06:22.095 --> 06:25.264
And now because of us,
two innocent people are dead.

06:25.390 --> 06:26.307
Not by our bullets.

06:26.433 --> 06:29.727
Shots would have never been fired
if we hadn't been set up in that club.

06:29.853 --> 06:33.064
- Those are the facts.
- On the upside, Carlos Fuentes is dead.

06:35.734 --> 06:39.278
None of us should have any illusions.
There are gonna be consequences.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.619
Yeah, I've seen that look on her face before.

06:46.745 --> 06:49.038
Someone's about to get bent over
and fucked.

06:49.164 --> 06:51.999
It's gonna be me, isn't it? I screwed up.

06:52.125 --> 06:53.959
No, you didn't. You were following orders.

06:54.086 --> 06:56.003
LaGuerta's orders,
just like the rest of us.

06:56.129 --> 06:59.423
That's what you put in your report, right?
You were following her lead?

06:59.549 --> 07:01.258
I haven't written it yet.

07:01.384 --> 07:03.594
I'm still sorting through the events
in my mind.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.387
Sorting through what exactly?

07:05.514 --> 07:06.722
What I'm gonna say about them.

07:06.848 --> 07:09.725
- Here's a crazy idea. How about the truth?
- Deb, I'm on it.

07:20.570 --> 07:23.197
- Who's that?
- It's Yasmin's mother.

07:24.950 --> 07:27.451
You all right?

07:27.577 --> 07:31.163
Three people are dead,
Carlos Fuentes and two girls.

07:31.289 --> 07:34.166
- Nobody's crying about Carlos.
- Fuentes was a scumbag.

07:34.292 --> 07:37.211
Yeah, he's a scumbag
that I shot and killed.

07:37.337 --> 07:40.131
And? What's the problem?

07:40.257 --> 07:43.008
Don't tell me you feel bad
about killing him.

07:43.969 --> 07:45.594
I don't.

07:47.347 --> 07:48.931
That's the problem.

07:58.483 --> 08:00.860
Yasmin didn't feel any pain.

08:03.363 --> 08:05.114
She died instantly.

08:11.163 --> 08:13.247
- I'm ready.
- OK.

08:24.801 --> 08:26.594
I have some bad news for everyone.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.514
You're all going to die.

08:31.766 --> 08:35.477
Some of us sooner than others.

08:35.604 --> 08:39.899
And if you're not in touch with
your primal self, you're already dead.

08:40.025 --> 08:41.942
You may be breathing
and walking around,

08:42.068 --> 08:44.737
but you're an empty shell,
just one of the herd,

08:44.863 --> 08:48.199
completely unaware
of what you truly want.

08:48.325 --> 08:51.869
And when we come back,
we're gonna start using your instincts

08:51.995 --> 08:54.663
to design the life that you deserve,

08:54.789 --> 08:57.041
fuel the passion to make it real,

08:57.167 --> 08:58.792
and find the power...

08:59.711 --> 09:01.587
to take it.

09:04.674 --> 09:08.802
Jordan Chase's Take It Now
Experience will resume at 2:00pm.

09:08.929 --> 09:12.973
In the meantime,
we invite you to visit our vendors.

09:13.975 --> 09:16.060
Jordan promises change,

09:16.186 --> 09:18.354
but he also accepts credit cards.

09:23.151 --> 09:24.944
- Lumen?
- Can you talk?

09:25.070 --> 09:27.947
Or are you about to have
a major life revelation?

09:28.073 --> 09:31.617
No, that came around 9:00am,
when I realised I really wanted a doughnut.

09:31.743 --> 09:33.869
What'd you find?

09:33.995 --> 09:37.081
I haven't been able to find out
how these guys know each other.

09:37.207 --> 09:39.625
The picture was taken
when they were teenagers, but...

09:39.751 --> 09:41.001
Did you check high schools?

09:41.127 --> 09:44.046
Cole went to Westland Prep in Hialeah,

09:44.172 --> 09:47.925
and Dan the Dentist went to
St Joseph's Academy in Coral Gables.

09:48.051 --> 09:50.177
Boyd... There's nothing on Boyd.

09:50.303 --> 09:53.514
Yeah, he probably never saw
the inside of too many classrooms.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.100
I was able to find out
something else about Cole.

09:56.226 --> 09:58.143
- What?
- He was in the Marines.

09:58.270 --> 10:00.646
He got bounced
on dishonourable discharge.

10:00.772 --> 10:03.565
He beat up a superior officer
and put him in the hospital.

10:03.692 --> 10:05.234
This is a dangerous guy, Dexter.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.486
Do you remember the marks
I had on my back?

10:07.612 --> 10:10.322
That was Cole.

10:10.448 --> 10:14.326
- So be careful.
- Are you getting any rest?

10:15.370 --> 10:19.290
I fall into a deep sleep
from 1:00 to 1:15 every morning.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.502
When this is over,
I expect to sleep for a year.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.506
I'll talk to you later.

10:27.632 --> 10:29.633
Mr Morgan. Cole Harmon.

10:29.759 --> 10:32.303
I'm sure you remember me
from our visit to the station.

10:32.429 --> 10:35.597
Mr Chase spotted you from the stage.
He's very interested in speaking with you.

10:35.724 --> 10:38.183
He was wondering if you'd join him
in his suite for a few minutes.

10:38.310 --> 10:39.727
Uh...

10:39.853 --> 10:41.186
OK. When?

10:41.313 --> 10:43.314
How about right now?

10:47.986 --> 10:49.987
All the way to the end.

11:11.217 --> 11:14.887
I'm disgusted, to tell you the truth. You
haven't been listening to a word I've said.

11:15.013 --> 11:17.973
Call me back when you stop
being a piece of furniture.

11:19.351 --> 11:21.643
Sorry. New client.

11:21.770 --> 11:24.938
Good to see you again, Mr Morgan,
especially under better circumstances.

11:25.065 --> 11:26.857
- Call me Dexter.
- Jordan.

11:26.983 --> 11:29.485
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Uh...

11:29.611 --> 11:31.236
No, thanks. I'm good.

11:31.363 --> 11:33.405
- Think I know why you're here.
- You do?

11:33.531 --> 11:36.784
You're searching for a way
to cope with your loss.

11:36.910 --> 11:38.243
I know your history, Dexter.

11:38.370 --> 11:40.704
I thought I recognised you
when we met at the station,

11:40.830 --> 11:42.748
but it hit me later on.

11:42.874 --> 11:44.875
Your wife was murdered.

11:45.001 --> 11:47.169
- Yes.
- Are they any closer to catching Trinity?

11:48.880 --> 11:50.255
Not that I'm aware of.

11:50.382 --> 11:52.549
I followed that case very closely.

11:52.675 --> 11:54.635
Trinity, a religious man,

11:54.761 --> 11:56.345
a family, good life.

11:56.471 --> 11:58.597
Yet he was working through such rage,

11:58.723 --> 12:00.516
harbouring so many secrets.

12:00.642 --> 12:03.685
I have to be honest.
He fascinated me on a deep level.

12:03.812 --> 12:05.896
What else do Jordan and I
have in common?

12:06.022 --> 12:08.941
I certainly don't mean to imply
any sympathy for him.

12:09.067 --> 12:11.193
He's a monster, no question.

12:12.445 --> 12:18.158
I can't imagine your frustration,
knowing he's out there, unpunished.

12:18.284 --> 12:20.160
It hasn't been easy.

12:20.286 --> 12:22.079
No doubt.

12:22.205 --> 12:26.458
And now you're a single father,
which has its own set of challenges.

12:29.629 --> 12:30.963
Why did you want to see me?

12:31.089 --> 12:35.884
I've developed a theory
on how the primal self deals with tragedy.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.971
I have to prepare for the next session,

12:39.097 --> 12:40.931
but I am very interested
in what happened to you.

12:41.057 --> 12:45.352
I would like to discuss your situation in
depth at another time if you're open to that.

12:47.105 --> 12:48.897
- OK.
- OK.

12:49.023 --> 12:52.234
By the way, have you made
any progress on Boyd Fowler?

12:52.360 --> 12:54.361
I'm not really aware of all the details.

12:54.487 --> 12:56.447
You should probably speak
to one of the detectives.

12:56.573 --> 12:57.906
Of course.

12:58.032 --> 13:00.075
I look forward to our next talk.

13:05.999 --> 13:08.041
There's a little something in there
for Harrison.

13:13.465 --> 13:15.424
Thanks.

13:24.476 --> 13:27.227
- You wanted to see me?
- Close the door.

13:36.488 --> 13:38.864
You know there's a lot of heat
coming down on us,

13:38.990 --> 13:41.825
and the public's demanding blood,
our blood.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.828
Matthews wants someone's head.

13:44.954 --> 13:46.955
Sounds like Santa Muerte's catching on.

13:48.791 --> 13:51.376
I'm putting Cira Manzon
on disciplinary leave.

13:52.587 --> 13:54.838
- What?
- I need to put a face on it.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.465
What's wrong with your face?

13:56.591 --> 13:59.051
- Detective...
- You can't pin this on her.

14:00.220 --> 14:03.347
- Her actions precipitated the shooting.
- She wasn't even supposed to be there.

14:03.473 --> 14:06.183
- I tried to take her off, you wouldn't let me.
- That's your impression.

14:06.309 --> 14:08.143
No, that's what happened.

14:09.521 --> 14:11.438
Look, I was the detective in charge,

14:11.564 --> 14:15.234
so if you want to fuck somebody over,
here's your scapegoat.

14:15.902 --> 14:18.529
I know your instinct
is to take the fall for your team.

14:18.655 --> 14:22.783
You were on my team.
In fact, you fuckin' took over my team,

14:22.909 --> 14:26.036
and I had your back, cos your team,
my team, whatever, it's all the fuckin' same.

14:26.162 --> 14:28.038
Cira's just starting out.

14:28.164 --> 14:31.124
Her career will take the smallest hit.

14:31.251 --> 14:33.001
She'll recover quickly.

14:33.127 --> 14:35.462
If something like that
had happened to me back then,

14:35.588 --> 14:37.714
I never would have made detective.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.175
We were all there together.

14:40.301 --> 14:44.429
So why can't we just hold tight
and weather the fuckin' storm together?

14:45.807 --> 14:47.349
Fuckin' think about it.

15:03.241 --> 15:06.034
- Does your printer ever work?
- Lu?

15:08.037 --> 15:09.538
Owen.

15:11.457 --> 15:14.084
- How are you?
- Um...

15:14.627 --> 15:16.044
Um...

15:16.170 --> 15:18.422
I bet you're tan.

15:18.548 --> 15:22.217
The sun feels closer here, even though
I know it actually physically is not,

15:22.343 --> 15:24.094
it feels like it's right there.

15:24.220 --> 15:26.680
You're in Miami?

15:26.806 --> 15:29.141
I got a sunburn just renting the car.

15:30.727 --> 15:33.020
I came to see you.

15:33.146 --> 15:34.521
You did?

15:34.647 --> 15:36.607
Lu, I've respected your wishes.

15:36.733 --> 15:40.235
Since the day of the wedding, I haven't
called, emailed, I haven't even texted.

15:41.404 --> 15:47.117
It's like my life stopped that day
when you left, and I need to get unstuck.

15:47.243 --> 15:50.412
I feel the way to do that
is to see you, face to face,

15:50.538 --> 15:54.416
without 75 of our closest friends and family
staring at us.

15:55.418 --> 15:57.252
Please, will you see me?

16:01.466 --> 16:02.924
I...

16:03.051 --> 16:04.968
- I can't tonight.
- Tomorrow.

16:08.765 --> 16:10.307
Lu?

16:10.433 --> 16:12.476
I'm staying at
the Blue Pelican Motel.

16:12.602 --> 16:15.646
There's a cafÃ© across the street.
Meet me there tomorrow at noon, OK?

16:15.772 --> 16:17.606
OK, noon.

16:19.567 --> 16:20.817
Hey.

16:21.611 --> 16:23.487
- Hey.
- I got you some supper.

16:23.613 --> 16:25.656
Hot and sour soup,
fried rice with tofu.

16:25.782 --> 16:28.575
- That's what you like, right?
- Yeah, that's fine.

16:31.621 --> 16:33.580
No, I'm not staying.

16:35.124 --> 16:37.250
Oh, right. Harrison.

16:40.171 --> 16:41.672
You're tired.

16:41.798 --> 16:45.384
I spent the entire day
staring at that laptop,

16:45.510 --> 16:48.136
and I got exactly nowhere.

16:48.262 --> 16:51.848
Well, the good news is you won't be
on that computer tomorrow.

16:51.974 --> 16:54.643
- I have something I need you to do.
- What?

16:54.769 --> 16:56.186
- Shopping.
- What kind of shopping?

16:56.312 --> 17:01.274
Supplies. We have to make a room
where Cole will be dispatched.

17:01.401 --> 17:03.235
It has to be covered in plastic.

17:03.361 --> 17:05.987
So does Cole.

17:06.114 --> 17:07.614
To catch the blood.

17:09.867 --> 17:12.035
I made a list.

17:12.161 --> 17:16.748
Duct tape, 30 yards
of clear polyethylene sheeting.

17:16.874 --> 17:19.751
And garbage bags, three mil, black.

17:21.629 --> 17:24.172
- When are you gonna do it?
- Tomorrow.

17:24.298 --> 17:26.174
I booked a room right next to Cole's.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.926
You're gonna do it in the hotel?

17:28.052 --> 17:29.928
No choice.

17:30.054 --> 17:31.805
Jordan's next gig is in Sarasota.

17:31.931 --> 17:34.808
He and Cole will be hitting the road
right after the seminar ends.

17:36.769 --> 17:38.186
So...

17:39.188 --> 17:41.898
tomorrow night's the night.

17:42.024 --> 17:45.068
There's a parking lot right on the corner
of Fourth and Bay.

17:45.194 --> 17:47.988
Meet me there tomorrow at noon
and I'll pick up the supplies.

17:48.823 --> 17:50.907
One o'clock would be better,

17:51.033 --> 17:53.285
just so I have enough time to shop.

17:53.411 --> 17:55.620
Sure.

17:55.747 --> 17:57.581
What?

17:58.583 --> 18:01.418
A few months ago,
I was shopping for a wedding dress,

18:01.544 --> 18:03.670
and now I'm shopping for...

18:03.796 --> 18:06.631
30 yards of polyethylene sheeting.

18:07.967 --> 18:13.221
It's crazy, isn't it, how... quickly
you can get used to the supremely weird?

18:13.347 --> 18:15.182
Tell me about it.

18:26.277 --> 18:29.613
- Thanks for covering.
- No problem. Sonya just left.

18:32.450 --> 18:34.659
Urgh. Jordan Chase.

18:34.786 --> 18:37.496
I know you're hurting,
so I'll reserve judgment,

18:38.623 --> 18:40.248
but I gotta draw the line somewhere.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.501
It was free.

18:45.171 --> 18:47.547
It can't hurt, can it?
Maybe I'll come away with something.

18:47.673 --> 18:50.467
Yeah, a really ugly onesie.

18:50.593 --> 18:54.262
I don't know. If it's working,
who am I to poop on your parade?

18:54.388 --> 18:56.264
And your day?

18:57.266 --> 19:00.769
I've got six mandatory sessions
with a shrink

19:00.895 --> 19:03.647
coming at me because of Carlos Fuentes.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.651
Feels like a big, fat
fucking waste of time too.

19:07.777 --> 19:11.947
I mean, I'd kill that fucktard all over again.
I'd empty a fucking magazine in him.

19:15.409 --> 19:19.162
OK. Maybe that's something
worth talking about.

19:22.375 --> 19:26.294
I always thought if I landed a bullet
that it would bother me...

19:28.589 --> 19:30.590
that it would...

19:31.592 --> 19:34.845
it would be a burden
to take another life.

19:38.057 --> 19:41.184
They don't issue guns to lab geeks,
so you have no idea what I'm talking about.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.311
I can imagine.

19:45.356 --> 19:48.358
I don't feel bad. Me, of all people.

19:49.652 --> 19:50.944
I don't feel anything.

19:56.617 --> 19:58.201
Maybe I've just run out.

20:00.037 --> 20:02.038
Dad once told me that...

20:03.040 --> 20:05.500
some people deserve to die.

20:09.380 --> 20:11.339
You believe that?

20:12.466 --> 20:14.509
You believe some people
deserve to die?

20:15.386 --> 20:17.345
Some people don't deserve to live.

20:18.973 --> 20:22.517
Trinity should be dead.
Not Rita, not Lundy.

20:26.772 --> 20:30.108
Maybe the world is better off
without Carlos Fuentes.

20:35.740 --> 20:37.908
I'd pretty much given up hope.

20:38.034 --> 20:40.952
I figured I was destined
to go through life alone,

20:41.078 --> 20:43.163
and then I started listening
to one of your CDs.

20:43.289 --> 20:44.748
The Primal Self?

20:44.874 --> 20:47.292
I started listening
in the car on the way to work.

20:47.418 --> 20:51.379
Three weeks later I met my soul mate,
and now we have a baby on the way!

20:53.549 --> 20:56.092
- Come on up here.
- Come on, honey!

21:04.393 --> 21:07.145
Cole will be at his post
for the rest of the session.

21:07.271 --> 21:08.688
That gives me an hour.

21:42.014 --> 21:43.807
I'll have to do this in the dark.

21:44.850 --> 21:46.726
Fourteen steps to the pillow.

21:46.852 --> 21:49.562
Give him the needle,
and drag him to my room.

21:49.689 --> 21:51.231
Sixty seconds tops.

21:56.362 --> 21:59.364
Jordan's about to lose
his number-one fan.

22:13.212 --> 22:16.423
- Sorry.
- Oh. No, no, it's me. Really.

22:18.592 --> 22:21.553
- You look beautiful.
- I don't, really.

22:21.679 --> 22:25.098
You do. You always do.

22:29.395 --> 22:31.104
- Miami suits you.
- Huh.

22:31.230 --> 22:33.356
You must love
all these Art Deco buildings.

22:34.358 --> 22:35.817
Can't get enough of 'em.

22:39.321 --> 22:40.488
Steph had her baby.

22:40.614 --> 22:43.575
Oh, that's right.
She was due last month.

22:43.701 --> 22:45.744
Yes. Meet Mavis.

22:47.955 --> 22:49.581
Look at her.

22:49.707 --> 22:51.249
Mavis?

22:51.375 --> 22:54.377
Mark's grandmother. The name
came down to Mavis or Madison.

22:54.503 --> 22:57.756
Madison? Your niece
could have been named after the city

22:57.882 --> 23:00.300
where you and I did our Sunday beer runs.

23:00.426 --> 23:02.427
Cooler heads prevailed. Mine.

23:02.553 --> 23:05.263
How is Steph doing?

23:05.389 --> 23:10.685
She's tired, glad to not be pregnant
any more, cries at commercials

23:10.811 --> 23:13.438
and is transcendently happy.

23:14.982 --> 23:19.152
Your parents miss you.
They'd like to know that you're safe.

23:19.278 --> 23:22.405
You... can tell them.

23:22.531 --> 23:25.950
Well, I'm thinking of not going back too.

23:26.077 --> 23:28.161
- What?
- You were right.

23:28.287 --> 23:30.997
We were trapped in our jobs,
trapped in that city.

23:31.123 --> 23:34.209
We'd have been trapped in a life
we didn't want. It's time for that to change.

23:37.505 --> 23:39.923
- Owen?
- Lu...

23:40.049 --> 23:42.884
I bought these round-the-world tickets.
Broke the bank.

23:43.010 --> 23:45.929
We can literally hop on
and hop off in any city.

23:46.055 --> 23:47.597
I love you.

23:48.933 --> 23:52.102
No matter what you do,
whoever you are,

23:52.228 --> 23:54.145
I want to take this journey with you.

23:59.693 --> 24:01.361
Have you met someone?

24:01.487 --> 24:05.115
I've met a lot of people here,
but not like you're thinking.

24:05.866 --> 24:08.243
I can't just leave.

24:08.369 --> 24:11.246
Me showing up like this is sudden, I know.

24:12.414 --> 24:14.541
We had five years.

24:14.667 --> 24:16.668
Take a night to think it over.

24:18.045 --> 24:21.548
I'm going either way,
but I'd rather go with you.

24:21.674 --> 24:25.760
Meet me here tomorrow night
and tell me your decision.

24:29.807 --> 24:31.599
God fucking damn it.

24:31.725 --> 24:33.726
- What is it?
- Un-fucking-believable.

24:33.853 --> 24:35.353
Lieutenant, will there be any other...

24:35.479 --> 24:36.813
I don't know who your sources are,

24:36.939 --> 24:40.316
but I can confirm that Detective Morgan
was in charge of the operation.

24:40.442 --> 24:43.236
- Holy shit.
- She's blaming everything on me.

24:43.362 --> 24:46.406
Is it true that Detective Morgan
has been placed on disciplinary leave?

24:46.532 --> 24:50.493
As of today, she's being placed
on immediate suspension with pay,

24:50.619 --> 24:52.245
pending the results of...

24:52.371 --> 24:54.247
Whoa! Not the plasma.

24:54.373 --> 24:55.582
Excuse me.

24:55.708 --> 24:57.125
I thought we were actually friends.

24:57.251 --> 24:59.252
Deb, wait.

25:00.212 --> 25:02.046
I can't do it.

25:02.173 --> 25:05.133
I can't let her throw me under the bus
and drive over me,

25:05.259 --> 25:08.219
then back up a few fuckin' times
and drive off.

25:21.734 --> 25:24.068
Oh.

25:25.529 --> 25:27.906
Fuck! Shit! Fuck!

25:28.032 --> 25:29.532
Didn't you see me driving up?

25:29.658 --> 25:30.909
Didn't you see me backing out?

25:31.035 --> 25:35.455
You know, there's a reason
why cars have rear-view mirrors, lady!

25:35.581 --> 25:37.457
I mean, shit, look at that.

25:37.583 --> 25:41.753
This here's fibreglass. Can't pound that out.
I'm gonna have to pull that whole panel off.

25:41.879 --> 25:43.588
How do I know
it wasn't already there?

25:43.714 --> 25:45.548
You just hit my car.

25:45.674 --> 25:48.593
I was distracted.
Just let me give you some cash.

25:48.719 --> 25:51.221
No cash! I don't want cash!

25:51.347 --> 25:54.098
We'll do this on the up-and-up,
cos that's the kind of guy I am.

25:54.225 --> 25:56.809
We just let the insurance dudes
hash this out.

25:56.936 --> 25:58.519
You do have insurance, don't you?

25:58.646 --> 26:02.148
- Yeah.
- Well, halle-fuckin'-lujah.

26:02.274 --> 26:06.110
Now, let's just trade some info here
and get this sorted out.

26:08.405 --> 26:11.324
Look, now, we can either
do this the right way,

26:11.450 --> 26:14.077
or I can call up the police,
let Miami's finest handle it.

26:14.203 --> 26:16.871
- It's your call.
- No. No, no, no. I...

26:26.632 --> 26:28.466
The Jordan Chase
Experience seminar

26:28.592 --> 26:30.843
will resume tomorrow
at 8:00am sharp.

26:30.970 --> 26:32.428
Vendors are open tonight till 7:00pm.

26:32.554 --> 26:34.639
How was your day?

26:34.765 --> 26:36.808
I guess working for Jordan has its benefits.

26:39.436 --> 26:41.646
- Hello?
- I'm here.

26:41.772 --> 26:42.981
I'm on my way.

26:43.107 --> 26:45.108
No, I mean, I'm here in the lobby.

26:52.408 --> 26:55.618
- What are you doing here?
- I got into a car accident.

26:56.287 --> 26:58.705
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

26:58.831 --> 27:02.125
It was my fault.
Actually, no, it was Owen's fault.

27:03.794 --> 27:05.712
Owen who?

27:05.838 --> 27:08.506
My ex-fiancÃ©.

27:08.632 --> 27:10.675
He's in Miami.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.177
Why?

27:14.221 --> 27:15.763
He came to see me.

27:15.889 --> 27:19.892
Don't worry, I didn't tell him
anything about anything.

27:20.019 --> 27:22.729
He asked me to go away with him.

27:22.855 --> 27:27.859
Just up and leave all this behind.

27:30.988 --> 27:32.697
As if I could.

27:33.699 --> 27:35.783
You could, you know.

27:38.871 --> 27:40.663
Do you want me to go?

27:40.789 --> 27:43.791
If you want to, go.

27:48.630 --> 27:51.966
This is the only part of my life
that makes sense any more.

27:53.844 --> 27:55.762
- What about Owen?
- He's leaving.

27:55.888 --> 27:57.513
- When?
- Tomorrow.

28:01.435 --> 28:03.478
Stay the night.

28:03.604 --> 28:06.689
The seminar's out for the day, and Cole
could be anywhere. He could see you.

28:06.815 --> 28:09.067
It's too risky to have you
walk through the lobby again.

28:10.861 --> 28:15.239
If I stay... does that mean
you're not gonna kill Cole tonight?

28:16.158 --> 28:18.368
No, it's still happening.

28:23.248 --> 28:25.541
We're gonna prepare the room together.

28:49.858 --> 28:52.026
This is all much easier with a partner.

29:01.370 --> 29:03.037
But a partner in what?

29:06.708 --> 29:09.460
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I was planning to.

29:09.586 --> 29:11.838
I have no idea
how the press got hold of it.

29:11.964 --> 29:13.881
Maybe it was because
you fucking leaked it.

29:14.007 --> 29:15.675
You'll be a desk jockey for a few weeks,

29:15.801 --> 29:17.885
then your union rep
will have you reinstated.

29:18.011 --> 29:20.430
This time next year,
all will have blown over.

29:20.556 --> 29:23.683
It's just your word against mine
and everybody else that was there.

29:23.809 --> 29:26.644
Some people don't agree with
your version of the events.

29:27.563 --> 29:29.772
Who'd you get to lie for you?

29:29.898 --> 29:31.524
Batista?

29:31.650 --> 29:33.693
Batista's gonna back your fuckin' story?

29:33.819 --> 29:37.196
- Do I have to go to Matthews with this?
- You watch yourself, Detective.

29:38.198 --> 29:40.908
We wouldn't want your
reinstatement to be delayed.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.035
God.

29:45.581 --> 29:48.458
I was fucking happy for you
when you got married.

29:48.584 --> 29:51.794
I thought that you being with Batista
might make you a nicer person.

29:54.173 --> 29:56.466
I never expected you
to fuckin' eat him alive.

30:20.115 --> 30:21.699
Cole's other victims.

30:21.825 --> 30:24.035
Why did you put their pictures up?

30:24.161 --> 30:27.497
Cole needs to see what he's done.

30:27.623 --> 30:29.248
What do you get out of all this?

30:30.584 --> 30:32.793
I like knowing that the men
who did this to you

30:32.920 --> 30:34.754
won't do it to anyone else.

30:37.216 --> 30:39.383
This isn't about me.

30:41.970 --> 30:45.556
- You're standing here.
- Look at all this.

30:45.682 --> 30:48.809
If you didn't know me,
you'd still be in this room.

30:51.730 --> 30:53.147
Boyd wasn't your first.

30:56.151 --> 30:57.985
You've been doing this a long time.

31:03.534 --> 31:04.951
It's Cole.

31:06.954 --> 31:08.746
We'll wait for him to go to sleep,

31:08.872 --> 31:11.123
then you take off and I grab him.

31:11.250 --> 31:12.625
What's that?

31:12.751 --> 31:15.962
M-99. Animal tranquilliser.

31:16.088 --> 31:20.841
Gives me a few hours to wrap his body
in plastic and secure him to this desk.

31:21.635 --> 31:23.469
You're gonna kill him
while he's still out?

31:23.595 --> 31:25.096
No, I'm gonna wake him up,

31:25.222 --> 31:28.432
see if he'll give up the other two names
of the men in the pictures.

31:28.559 --> 31:30.685
My knife can be very persuasive.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.772
Stay here.

31:44.825 --> 31:46.701
Tie my other arm!

31:46.827 --> 31:49.287
Do it now!

31:49.997 --> 31:51.038
Yes!

31:51.164 --> 31:53.082
Oh. Oh.

31:55.377 --> 31:56.711
Yes!

31:56.837 --> 31:58.337
Oh, God!

32:10.183 --> 32:12.226
No.

32:12.352 --> 32:14.103
No!

32:22.237 --> 32:23.821
No more! Please!

32:23.947 --> 32:25.281
No!

32:30.662 --> 32:34.123
Let me go! Let me out of here!

32:58.106 --> 32:59.899
- What happened?
- You fell asleep.

33:00.025 --> 33:01.651
What about Cole?

33:01.777 --> 33:05.071
He's back at the seminar by now.

33:06.490 --> 33:10.743
- The screamer spent the night.
- So you're not gonna kill him?

33:10.869 --> 33:12.620
No, I am.

33:12.746 --> 33:14.997
I've been thinking about it all night.

33:15.123 --> 33:17.291
Cole makes his security rounds
at every session.

33:17.417 --> 33:19.001
So...

33:19.127 --> 33:23.631
I'll wait for him by the service elevator
and M-99 him there.

33:23.757 --> 33:26.300
I would have rather grabbed him at night,
but I can make this work.

33:26.426 --> 33:28.928
- And what about me?
- You'll wait until the session starts.

33:30.305 --> 33:33.391
Everyone will be in the seminar.
You won't be spotted when you leave.

33:33.517 --> 33:36.018
Just steer clear of the service elevator.

33:36.144 --> 33:38.145
OK.

33:40.148 --> 33:41.899
- I can't believe it.
- What?

33:43.235 --> 33:45.152
I actually slept.

33:57.749 --> 34:00.042
- Hey. Do you want to get up?
- No.

34:00.168 --> 34:01.419
Do you want to go back to sleep?

34:01.545 --> 34:03.587
- No.
- Do you want to just...

34:03.714 --> 34:06.048
No, I don't want to do anything.
I just want to lie here.

34:06.174 --> 34:08.551
It's Sunday. I'm allowed.

34:11.471 --> 34:13.514
LaGuerta's an evil bitch.

34:14.182 --> 34:16.058
No, she's not.

34:19.688 --> 34:21.981
Maybe she is.

34:23.275 --> 34:26.986
The best way to get back at her
is to do exactly what she says.

34:27.112 --> 34:30.406
Go on leave, talk to your union rep,
get reinstated,

34:30.532 --> 34:34.368
then come back
and kick as much ass as you possibly can.

34:37.205 --> 34:40.416
No one, not even LaGuerta,

34:40.542 --> 34:42.168
can deny that you're a great detective.

34:42.294 --> 34:44.962
At the end of the day,
you'll be the one left standing.

34:45.088 --> 34:48.466
- At the end of the day?
- Yeah, you know, when all is said and done.

34:59.227 --> 35:01.228
Sounds like one very long day.

35:06.651 --> 35:07.818
Hey.

35:07.944 --> 35:09.820
- I smell coffee.
- Now's not a good time.

35:09.946 --> 35:11.363
Well, it is for me.

35:13.450 --> 35:16.160
- Hey, Debra Morgan.
- Liddy, right?

35:16.286 --> 35:19.330
- Good memory. I like this one.
- This one?

35:19.456 --> 35:23.417
You and I got something in common.
We've both been fucked over by LaGuerta.

35:23.543 --> 35:26.629
Well, maybe we should make
matching T-shirts or something.

35:26.755 --> 35:30.132
OK. Well, this one's going
for a fuckin' breakfast burrito.

35:30.258 --> 35:32.259
I'll see you two later.

35:35.639 --> 35:38.474
Call before you come over.
It's a common courtesy.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.185
Don't you want to know about this girl
shacked up with Dexter Morgan?

35:41.311 --> 35:45.523
I just staged a little meet and greet with her.
Old PI move.

35:45.649 --> 35:48.692
- So you met her.
- Name, Lumen Pierce.

35:48.819 --> 35:51.237
Lumen. Stupid fuckin' name.

35:51.363 --> 35:52.947
From Minneapolis, Minnesota.

35:53.073 --> 35:55.991
Supposed to be married three months ago,
picture in the paper and everything.

35:56.117 --> 35:57.243
Just takes off.

35:57.369 --> 36:03.165
Shows up here in Miami one week before
your boy's wife, Rita Morgan, is murdered.

36:03.291 --> 36:06.627
- Now, what do you think of that?
- I don't know. Is that all you got?

36:06.753 --> 36:10.172
- It's a hell of lot more than I had yesterday.
- Well, stay on it.

36:10.298 --> 36:13.467
- I'd love to, but I am running out of loot.
- I just paid you last week.

36:13.593 --> 36:16.679
And I just fucked up my car
getting this info for you, Quinn.

36:16.805 --> 36:19.431
Now, this boy is dirty.
What you gonna do about it?

36:19.558 --> 36:20.558
I'm not giving you any more.

36:20.684 --> 36:23.227
You know, I thought you and me
had an understanding.

36:23.353 --> 36:27.731
I mean, it'd be a shame if the skirt
you're boning finds out about all this.

36:29.442 --> 36:32.903
- And how would that happen?
- I don't know.

36:33.029 --> 36:34.738
Things go wrong every day.

36:34.865 --> 36:36.699
Fuckin' motherfucker!

36:38.326 --> 36:41.370
You two are starting
to sound more alike every day.

36:41.496 --> 36:43.205
Must be love.

36:45.166 --> 36:46.959
Tragedy.

36:48.086 --> 36:51.046
Many of us here have experienced it
in one form or another.

36:51.172 --> 36:53.924
The kind that leaves you wondering
if there's a reason to go on living.

36:54.050 --> 36:58.429
For two days, you've heard me talking about
getting in touch with your primal self.

36:58.555 --> 37:02.683
But how does the primal self
deal with loss?

37:02.809 --> 37:06.270
Cole's starting his rounds. He'll reach
the service eleÎ½ator in five minutes.

37:06.396 --> 37:07.897
In three minutes, so will I.

37:08.023 --> 37:11.275
There's someone in this room
who is dealing with that very question.

37:11.401 --> 37:13.485
Dexter Morgan.

37:15.488 --> 37:17.448
Come and join me onstage, Dexter.

37:17.574 --> 37:21.243
I know you weren't expecting this,
but it's important.

37:21.369 --> 37:22.703
Please.

37:22.829 --> 37:24.955
So much for slipping out quietly.

37:25.081 --> 37:27.875
- Dexter! They want you, Dexter.
- Dexter, Dexter.

37:28.001 --> 37:29.627
Dexter.

37:29.753 --> 37:33.213
Dexter, Dexter.

37:33.798 --> 37:36.425
Dexter, Dexter.

37:57.113 --> 37:59.323
Dexter works with Miami Metro Homicide.

37:59.449 --> 38:02.201
Recently, he lost his wife.

38:02.327 --> 38:04.078
She was murdered...

38:05.413 --> 38:06.914
by the Trinity Killer.

38:09.084 --> 38:12.503
The very person
that Dexter's department was hunting.

38:12.629 --> 38:15.339
You were the one to find her,
your wife? Rita?

38:17.425 --> 38:18.342
Yeah.

38:18.468 --> 38:19.510
Yes.

38:19.636 --> 38:22.721
I'm gonna ask you to do something,
and it's gonna be very difficult.

38:22.847 --> 38:24.974
I want you to relive that moment.

38:27.018 --> 38:31.313
According to the newspapers, you were
supposed to be going away on honeymoon?

38:34.693 --> 38:36.443
Dexter.

38:36.569 --> 38:38.153
Y-Yes.

38:38.279 --> 38:40.280
Tell us about it.

38:42.784 --> 38:47.037
Well, we postponed the honeymoon
because we had a new baby, a boy.

38:47.872 --> 38:50.916
Keep going. Tell me how you found her.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.961
Please.

38:57.465 --> 39:00.175
I'd come home after work.

39:00.301 --> 39:02.302
I remember
walking through the house.

39:04.973 --> 39:07.641
I turned the corner and...

39:10.186 --> 39:13.063
it's like time actually slowed down...

39:14.482 --> 39:16.483
and then stopped.

39:18.445 --> 39:21.071
It's just a series of pictures.

39:22.407 --> 39:23.782
What'd you see?

39:24.993 --> 39:27.494
I saw my son sitting in blood.

39:29.956 --> 39:31.957
He was crying.

39:35.253 --> 39:36.879
So much blood.

39:40.467 --> 39:45.262
And she was there in the tub.
She'd bled out. Her eyes were still open.

39:45.388 --> 39:48.640
I want you to tell me something, Dexter.
I want you to be very honest.

39:48.767 --> 39:52.394
What did you feel in that moment?

39:52.520 --> 39:54.396
We want to know.

39:59.027 --> 40:01.320
It's difficult to put into words.

40:01.446 --> 40:02.654
Everything...

40:03.740 --> 40:06.033
fell apart. I felt...

40:06.159 --> 40:08.535
Shattered?

40:10.705 --> 40:11.789
Yes.

40:11.915 --> 40:13.457
When the primal self is shattered,

40:13.583 --> 40:17.544
it reaches out in search of
what will make it whole again.

40:17.670 --> 40:19.296
Do you feel that, Dexter?

40:19.422 --> 40:21.757
That hunger inside you
to be whole again?

40:21.883 --> 40:25.344
- I do.
- That hunger is your primal self.

40:25.470 --> 40:28.055
You must open your heart
and listen to what it's saying.

40:28.181 --> 40:31.141
- Many people after suffering a tragedy...
- Mr Harmon?

40:31.267 --> 40:33.644
spend the rest of their lives
as broken beings...

40:33.770 --> 40:36.772
- Can you sign this, please?
- ... living in the past.

40:36.898 --> 40:40.651
Your primal self is crying out to be whole.

40:40.777 --> 40:43.445
What is it that will make you whole?

40:43.571 --> 40:47.533
For some, it's a new job.
For others, the love of another person.

40:47.659 --> 40:49.743
Your primal self will tell you,

40:49.869 --> 40:52.746
but you have to be open
to hearing the message. Are you?

40:52.872 --> 40:54.039
Yes.

40:54.165 --> 40:58.377
Then you've just taken your first step
toward happiness.

41:09.597 --> 41:11.682
Dexter.

42:13.703 --> 42:15.662
You fuckin' bitch!

42:24.672 --> 42:26.089
Not this time.

42:42.565 --> 42:44.483
I'm gonna take this gag out of your mouth,

42:44.609 --> 42:47.819
but if you make one sound I don't like,
I'm gonna cut your eyes out.

42:50.240 --> 42:52.199
Blink, so I know you understand.

42:57.205 --> 42:59.456
We know about Boyd

42:59.582 --> 43:01.458
and Dan the Dentist.

43:01.584 --> 43:03.210
And now you.

43:04.379 --> 43:05.504
Who are the others?

43:05.630 --> 43:08.298
The guy who held a watch up to my ear.

43:09.884 --> 43:14.054
"Tick tick tick.
That's the sound of your life running out."

43:15.265 --> 43:17.182
What are their names?

43:20.728 --> 43:22.187
What did he say?

43:26.317 --> 43:29.987
Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

43:32.031 --> 43:34.783
Look at the women
whose lives you destroyed.

43:34.909 --> 43:36.451
Look. Look.

43:44.168 --> 43:47.087
Death was the only kindness
you showed them.

44:08.359 --> 44:10.777
It's a shame you can only die once.

44:41.351 --> 44:44.061
You said I'd done this before. That's true.

44:46.147 --> 44:48.231
This is who I am.

44:55.365 --> 44:58.867
When I was a child, my mother
was murdered in front of me, and it...

45:01.954 --> 45:03.830
shattered me.

45:07.668 --> 45:09.669
I've done this ever since.

45:11.964 --> 45:15.967
Because for the longest time,
it was the only way I could feel...

45:19.639 --> 45:21.640
unbroken.

45:23.434 --> 45:29.564
And then Rita was killed
and none of this made sense any more.

45:37.782 --> 45:39.616
Until now.

45:50.378 --> 45:53.130
Miguel couldn't. My father couldn't.

45:53.256 --> 45:56.591
Can anyone live with the truth
of what I am?

46:14.819 --> 46:17.404
Is Lumen what will make me whole?

46:30.918 --> 46:32.002
Moving in?

46:33.421 --> 46:36.756
The Lieutenant said I should bring
some of my stuff into this department.

46:38.050 --> 46:40.135
It was you.

46:40.261 --> 46:43.638
LaGuerta asked you to back her story,
and of course you did.

46:46.642 --> 46:48.977
Deb.

46:49.103 --> 46:51.646
- Deb?
- Detective Morgan...

46:53.941 --> 46:57.110
you're the youngest woman in Miami Metro
to ever make detective,

46:57.236 --> 47:00.322
and I really admire you, like, a lot.

47:00.448 --> 47:03.450
And I came here
hoping to learn from you.

47:06.704 --> 47:08.788
What you did...

47:08.915 --> 47:10.999
you would never learn from me.

47:13.419 --> 47:16.296
Good luck. You're gonna need it.

47:33.898 --> 47:35.273
Deb.

47:36.150 --> 47:39.236
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to set the record straight.

47:41.364 --> 47:43.114
I thought you were backing LaGuerta's story.

47:43.241 --> 47:46.159
No, I didn't know what I was gonna do.

47:46.285 --> 47:49.412
I was stuck between a rock and my wife,

47:49.539 --> 47:52.707
but I decided I'm backing you.

47:52.833 --> 47:54.876
Might not go over too well at home.

47:56.045 --> 47:59.881
You're flesh and blood to me,
like my kid sister,

48:00.007 --> 48:03.134
but better,
because I actually like you.

48:05.638 --> 48:07.264
Damn.

48:07.390 --> 48:09.391
It's OK.

48:11.018 --> 48:12.811
Yeah.

48:12.937 --> 48:14.271
It's OK.

48:31.163 --> 48:34.499
Most people wait until the seminar is over
before checking out.

48:34.625 --> 48:37.836
Uh... I lose my nanny in an hour.
I gotta get back to my son.

48:39.171 --> 48:41.673
- Is everything OK?
- It's nothing important.

48:41.799 --> 48:44.175
Just a little security glitch.

48:45.761 --> 48:48.471
Like your chief of security's head
is in my luggage?

48:48.598 --> 48:50.432
I want to thank you
for coming onstage.

48:50.558 --> 48:52.684
It didn't seem like I had any choice.

48:52.810 --> 48:55.270
I know it was sudden,
and you probably didn't appreciate it.

48:55.396 --> 48:57.856
But you'll look back on it,
you'll realise it was worth it.

48:58.858 --> 49:02.402
Don't forget what happened
here this weekend, Dexter.

49:02.528 --> 49:04.863
- I won't.
- Act on what you've learned.

49:04.989 --> 49:06.489
Don't let it slip away.

49:06.616 --> 49:08.241
It's what I tell my clients.

49:08.367 --> 49:09.534
Tick tick tick?

49:09.660 --> 49:12.037
That's the sound of your life running out.

49:12.872 --> 49:15.999
My primal instincts were right.
Jordan's one of them.

49:19.503 --> 49:22.213
- Take it, Dexter.
- Oh, I will.

49:36.062 --> 49:39.272
It's a law of physics
that elements want to unify.

49:54.246 --> 49:58.541
Single cells in a Petri dish
thrash around until they coalesce.

50:08.678 --> 50:11.221
And events in the universe
that once seemed random

50:11.347 --> 50:14.683
are eventually revealed to have
an underlying connectedness.

50:15.393 --> 50:17.769
Jordan Chase is one of them.
I'm sure of it.

50:17.895 --> 50:19.938
"Tick tick tick."

50:20.064 --> 50:22.857
But he wasn't in the photo.

50:22.983 --> 50:25.318
Maybe he took the photo, I don't know.

50:27.363 --> 50:29.531
We're gonna take down Jordan Chase?

50:35.663 --> 50:38.039
First things first.

50:43.838 --> 50:46.464
Just... let go?

51:05.401 --> 51:06.735
Just let go.

51:07.310 --> 51:13.414
