00:11.517 --> 00:12.934
Previously on Dexter...

00:13.060 --> 00:15.103
You were face to face
with Carlos Fuentes, right?

00:16.647 --> 00:18.481
So that means he knows
that we're onto him.

00:18.607 --> 00:20.441
Tell me why they would ever
return to this club.

00:20.567 --> 00:24.028
You have one more night at Club Mayan.
Make something happen.

00:25.698 --> 00:27.699
This is Yasmin Aragon.

00:27.825 --> 00:29.784
If we agree to drop
her drug charges,

00:29.910 --> 00:32.829
she thinks she can get
the Fuentes brothers in the club.

00:34.248 --> 00:36.332
- Hey.
- I thought you might want a debriefing

00:36.458 --> 00:38.543
before we hit Club Mayan.

00:38.669 --> 00:41.379
Um... It's sort of... not a good time.

00:41.505 --> 00:42.839
This is Stan Liddy.

00:42.965 --> 00:45.591
You are boning
our target's sister?

00:45.718 --> 00:48.177
Just tell me what you found out
on Dexter Morgan.

00:48.595 --> 00:50.430
You fucked everything up, Boyd.

00:50.556 --> 00:52.640
Boyd Fowler. Hobbies -

00:52.766 --> 00:54.934
- self-improvement...
- Take it!

00:55.060 --> 00:57.437
and storing women
in formaldehyde.

00:57.563 --> 00:59.772
Every one of these barrels
has a body in it.

00:59.898 --> 01:03.359
Boyd wasn't the only one
who did this to me. There were others.

01:03.485 --> 01:06.070
I shot one of them.
Dexter, what do I do?

01:06.196 --> 01:10.074
That last fucking bitch is alive.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.326
They're gonna find you.

01:13.495 --> 01:16.080
Some experiences are so big,
they change your DNA.

01:16.206 --> 01:17.832
I'm gonna have to find
the rest of them,

01:17.958 --> 01:20.334
because that's the only way
that I can feel this peace again.

01:21.003 --> 01:23.880
I can't get revenge
for Rita's death,

01:24.006 --> 01:27.300
but I can help Lumen avenge
what was done to her.

01:27.426 --> 01:29.093
How many more were there?

01:31.005 --> 01:37.079
FaceTime with British Models 24/7
www. saucytime. com

03:26.795 --> 03:30.006
It's been over a month
since I freed Lumen from Boyd's,

03:30.132 --> 03:32.425
but she's still
reliving it every day.

03:32.551 --> 03:34.969
Hey. I brought food.

03:36.138 --> 03:37.847
Oh.

03:41.268 --> 03:44.228
- Have you eaten?
- I ate this morning.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.397
Well, now it's night.

03:47.399 --> 03:49.400
Eat some more.

03:50.736 --> 03:52.945
You're very... controlling.

03:53.071 --> 03:54.488
I need to be.

03:59.244 --> 04:01.370
So, what else?

04:02.456 --> 04:04.749
Details would help.

04:07.127 --> 04:09.503
Besides the ones
that we've already...

04:10.631 --> 04:12.465
taken care of...

04:12.591 --> 04:15.885
- there was Watch Guy.
- "Watch Guy"?

04:16.970 --> 04:19.096
I would be tied to a chair...

04:20.223 --> 04:21.182
blindfolded.

04:21.308 --> 04:23.225
Sometimes I didn't even know
if he was there,

04:23.352 --> 04:26.270
until I'd hear this watch by my ear.

04:28.649 --> 04:30.775
And then he'd lean in
and whisper...

04:31.777 --> 04:33.361
"Tick tick tick.

04:34.529 --> 04:37.031
"That's the sound of your life
running out."

04:39.076 --> 04:41.327
OK. Anyone else?

04:43.372 --> 04:45.247
Suit and tie.

04:46.625 --> 04:49.961
He'd take off his jacket
and fold it...

04:50.087 --> 04:53.005
very carefully,
and then lay it on a chair,

04:53.131 --> 04:55.466
like he didn't want to mess it up.

04:58.011 --> 05:01.806
The Suit Guy, I'd know.
He always took the blindfold off.

05:03.850 --> 05:05.810
I guess he thought
I'd be dead soon.

05:06.979 --> 05:08.813
He was wrong.

05:44.558 --> 05:46.058
Los barriles.

05:46.184 --> 05:47.393
SÃ­?

06:07.330 --> 06:10.374
So, what do we do now?
How do we find them?

06:10.500 --> 06:12.376
I'm not sure "we"
is the operating word here.

06:12.502 --> 06:15.921
What are you talking about?
We're doing this together.

06:16.923 --> 06:19.967
Lumen, what I do, I do alone.
I don't need a partner.

06:21.011 --> 06:23.888
- I said I'd help you, but...
- Fine. Forget it.

06:24.806 --> 06:27.308
- "Forget it"?
- There's no point to it, then.

06:27.434 --> 06:29.143
You want these men
brought to justice?

06:29.269 --> 06:32.438
Yeah, and I can't go
to the cops because of you.

06:34.816 --> 06:37.193
So you're gonna have to be
a little flexible here.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.488
I want to be a part of this.

06:44.159 --> 06:45.785
We'll see.

07:03.345 --> 07:04.428
Gracias.

07:20.904 --> 07:23.197
I need to get home to Harrison.

07:24.783 --> 07:26.367
Right.

07:26.493 --> 07:28.244
The other part of your life.

07:28.370 --> 07:33.040
There is no other part to Lumen's life.
This is all she has.

07:34.459 --> 07:36.961
Even so, I can't bring her
into my world.

07:37.087 --> 07:39.547
There's no place for her.

07:40.757 --> 07:42.424
Dexter?

07:47.305 --> 07:48.514
Thank you.

07:50.517 --> 07:53.018
I feel like I'm dropping off
my prom date...

07:54.020 --> 07:56.856
except this is my house,
and my wife is dead,

07:56.982 --> 07:59.233
and I have no idea
where Lumen fits into my world,

07:59.359 --> 08:00.985
and this is all so weird...

08:04.197 --> 08:06.240
exactly like my prom.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.879
Our level of national debt
is unsustainable.

08:20.005 --> 08:23.465
I want you to fight against
a dystopian society

08:23.592 --> 08:25.384
where independent producers

08:25.510 --> 08:28.554
are weighed down
by parasitic non-producers,

08:28.680 --> 08:32.308
a Democratic President
and a Democratic Congress.

08:38.857 --> 08:40.566
You're just in time.

08:49.242 --> 08:51.493
Hey, good night, buddy.

08:52.621 --> 08:54.413
Saint Brigid,
circle us with your light,

08:54.539 --> 08:57.458
so that no darkness
shall overcome our world.

08:58.293 --> 09:00.252
Sleep well, little one.

09:01.838 --> 09:05.424
That's either a saint, or the most
boring action figure I've ever seen.

09:05.550 --> 09:07.176
Is that yours?

09:08.094 --> 09:09.929
It's Saint Brigid.

09:12.891 --> 09:15.601
To watch over you
while you sleep.

09:22.651 --> 09:24.443
- Good night.
- Good night.

09:36.081 --> 09:37.998
He doesn't need Saint Brigid.

09:39.334 --> 09:41.210
He has Father Dexter.

09:47.425 --> 09:49.760
Why are you up so early?

09:49.886 --> 09:51.679
Gym.

09:54.641 --> 09:56.517
But how about it, you know?

09:56.643 --> 09:58.894
I mean, we don't have
to live here.

09:59.020 --> 10:01.563
We could get a new place, together.

10:07.070 --> 10:08.320
Morgan.

10:10.115 --> 10:12.324
I'm Homicide.
I don't do traffic accidents.

10:14.786 --> 10:17.913
Whoa, uh... Text me the address.

10:18.039 --> 10:20.624
- What's up?
- Dead people.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.960
You're gonna get the same call.
We're all getting called in.

10:23.086 --> 10:24.878
Why didn't you tell them I'm here?

10:25.922 --> 10:27.006
Because I'm not here.

10:28.466 --> 10:30.467
Basically, nobody knows
we're seeing each other.

10:30.593 --> 10:32.469
I just want to keep it that way.

10:33.430 --> 10:35.472
Wow, baby.
You say the sweetest things.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.809
Can we at least drive in together?

10:38.935 --> 10:42.271
Yeah, and then we'll go to Disney World,
and we'll ride all the roller coasters,

10:42.397 --> 10:44.481
and we'll hold hands!

10:47.152 --> 10:49.069
I don't even know
what that means.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.959
Whatever it is... it's big.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.762
- Dexter.
- Hey, Sergeant. What have we got?

11:15.805 --> 11:18.223
- You haven't been listening to the news?
- Uh...

11:18.350 --> 11:20.809
Weather channel.
High-pressure system coming in.

11:23.772 --> 11:24.980
What have we got?

11:30.528 --> 11:32.613
We got her,

11:32.739 --> 11:34.073
and her...

11:34.199 --> 11:37.368
and her, and her...

11:37.494 --> 11:38.410
and her.

11:38.536 --> 11:41.163
The girls in the barrels -
how could this be?

11:42.332 --> 11:44.083
Someone tried to move them.

11:45.627 --> 11:46.835
Where's the driver?

11:46.961 --> 11:49.213
That's what we're trying to figure out.
He took off.

11:51.549 --> 11:53.175
Go do your thing.

11:54.677 --> 11:56.720
It's the blood guy,
but we got no blood.

11:56.846 --> 12:00.265
- We don't know what we've got.
- Yeah, what is this gunk?

12:00.392 --> 12:02.976
It's formalin -
liquid formaldehyde.

12:03.103 --> 12:06.105
- Why?
- An embalming agent.

12:06.231 --> 12:09.108
Because it was only applied topically,
the internal organs of the cadavers

12:09.234 --> 12:12.736
continued to putrefy and leak
out of the various bodily orifices,

12:12.862 --> 12:15.364
becoming congealed once they
came in contact with the formalin.

12:15.490 --> 12:18.826
That's what's on your shoe -
congealed organ.

12:20.954 --> 12:23.288
What kind of sick fuck
are we dealing with?

12:23.415 --> 12:25.040
I'm just the blood guy.

12:25.166 --> 12:28.419
We've got five victims,
all female, all blonde,

12:28.545 --> 12:31.171
all between the ages
of 20 and 35, I'm guessing.

12:31.297 --> 12:34.133
They're covered in bruises,
contusions, whip marks.

12:34.259 --> 12:37.052
Looks like they went through
some special kind of hell.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.848
We'll get fingerprints off them
once we get 'em to the ME's office.

12:40.974 --> 12:42.266
I heard the driver took off.

12:42.392 --> 12:45.394
Yeah, we've got the guy that hit him.
He was drunk off his freaking ass.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.729
He said he saw some guy
jump out and start running,

12:47.856 --> 12:49.857
but that's as detailed
as his description gets -

12:49.983 --> 12:51.150
"Some guy."

12:51.276 --> 12:53.610
That means he's still mine to find.

12:59.284 --> 13:01.034
Or Vince Masuka's.

13:01.995 --> 13:03.495
Hey.

13:03.621 --> 13:05.038
Hey, Dex.

13:06.249 --> 13:08.167
That's some pretty crazy shit, huh?

13:08.293 --> 13:10.085
Yeah, crazy shit.
What do you got?

13:10.211 --> 13:11.795
Uh...

13:13.715 --> 13:16.425
One men's suit jacket, size 40.

13:17.427 --> 13:19.928
Did you fold it,
or was it already like that?

13:20.054 --> 13:21.722
I bagged it as I found it.

13:23.391 --> 13:26.143
- I also got fingerprints galore...
- Excellent.

13:26.269 --> 13:29.313
Except for the steering wheel.
Somebody gave it a quick wipe.

13:29.856 --> 13:33.400
I'll get the vehicle back to the lab,
and we'll give it a more thorough going-over.

13:33.526 --> 13:34.902
Right.

13:40.325 --> 13:42.784
So much for keeping
my lives separate.

13:50.335 --> 13:51.376
Yeah, what's up?

13:51.503 --> 13:53.170
What you doing, boy?
Sleeping late?

13:53.296 --> 13:55.964
Your buddy, Dexter Morgan -
you asked me to keep an eye on him.

13:56.090 --> 13:57.674
Yeah? And?

13:57.800 --> 13:59.593
Well, he's got some cutie
up at his house.

13:59.719 --> 14:01.345
He even took down
the "for sale" sign.

14:02.180 --> 14:05.766
- What's this girl look like?
- Blonde, average height, late 20s.

14:05.892 --> 14:07.226
Slim, pretty?

14:07.352 --> 14:08.769
That'd be her.

14:08.895 --> 14:11.230
- Find out who she is.
- You betcha.

14:13.024 --> 14:15.943
- What are you doing here?
- I saw the news.

14:16.069 --> 14:18.695
- I knew what it was. I had to come.
- No, you didn't have to come.

14:18.821 --> 14:20.781
Dexter, I was supposed
to be one of those girls.

14:22.158 --> 14:24.743
Look, it's not safe for you here.
They could be watching.

14:24.869 --> 14:26.745
What is this?

14:27.539 --> 14:30.207
- What does it mean?
- It means they're on the run.

14:30.667 --> 14:31.667
You need to go.

14:43.221 --> 14:45.138
Will you give me...
Thank you.

14:53.898 --> 14:55.524
Shit a brick
and fuck me with it -

14:55.650 --> 14:58.902
you're never gonna guess
who this truck is registered to.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.404
Jordan Chase.

15:02.073 --> 15:05.409
Jordan Chase
is a very smart guy.

15:06.744 --> 15:09.204
His first book made me realise

15:09.330 --> 15:11.915
how I'd been putting all these
limitations on myself.

15:12.041 --> 15:15.377
I mean, I've listened to all his CDs.

15:15.503 --> 15:17.129
So did Boyd Fowler.

15:17.255 --> 15:19.798
You think Jordan could have been
driving that truck?

15:19.924 --> 15:22.551
What? No way.

15:22.677 --> 15:24.970
First off, that jacket is nice,

15:25.096 --> 15:26.847
but not that nice.

15:26.973 --> 15:29.141
Jordan wears nothing but the best.

15:29.267 --> 15:31.143
That's part of his thing.

15:31.269 --> 15:34.771
"If you think you deserve something,
then take it."

15:39.360 --> 15:44.156
I've lifted two dozen fingerprints, and they all
seem to belong to the same person.

15:44.282 --> 15:47.117
And whoever they belong to,

15:47.243 --> 15:49.411
he's not in the AFIS database.

15:49.537 --> 15:50.746
Dead end.

15:52.707 --> 15:55.125
Ooh... a hair.

16:01.716 --> 16:03.592
And another one.

16:06.137 --> 16:09.181
It's not often I'm in competition
with my own people,

16:09.307 --> 16:11.558
but getting the identity
of the driver of the truck,

16:11.684 --> 16:13.352
and getting to him before they do

16:13.478 --> 16:15.729
is the only way I can give Lumen
what I promised.

16:21.069 --> 16:22.944
All I get is a fucking computer.

16:23.071 --> 16:26.323
I can order Jordan Chase books,
I can order Jordan Chase CDs,

16:26.449 --> 16:28.617
but I can't talk to an actual person.

16:29.410 --> 16:31.703
Jordan Chase is a really
popular man, you know?

16:31.829 --> 16:34.831
He travels the world giving his
little touchy-feely seminars.

16:34.957 --> 16:38.210
- He's probably not even in Miami right now.
- I've left messages all over.

16:38.336 --> 16:40.504
If I don't hear back soon,
I'm gonna kick their door in.

16:41.506 --> 16:43.340
What about you? Anything?

16:43.466 --> 16:46.718
Yeah, we've ID'd two of the girls
off their fingerprints.

16:46.844 --> 16:48.845
One was a schoolteacher
from Wisconsin.

16:48.971 --> 16:51.223
She came out here on vacation
two years ago -

16:51.349 --> 16:52.391
never heard from again.

16:52.517 --> 16:55.560
The other one worked on
a cruise ship that was docked here.

16:55.687 --> 16:57.437
She disappeared
just over a year ago.

16:57.563 --> 16:59.106
Wow.

16:59.232 --> 17:01.274
Yeah, these were good girls,
you know?

17:01.401 --> 17:03.652
One was 26, one was 29.

17:03.778 --> 17:05.195
Nothing on the other three?

17:05.321 --> 17:08.156
No, I'm going through
the missing-person databases,

17:08.282 --> 17:09.574
put their photographs out there.

17:09.701 --> 17:11.618
- DNA?
- It's being run now.

17:11.744 --> 17:14.705
Looking for direct hits
and familial hits.

17:14.831 --> 17:18.542
Listen, I heard about
this two-bedroom place on Brickell -

17:18.668 --> 17:20.210
upper unit, right on the water.

17:20.336 --> 17:23.088
- Thought we could take a look.
- This is not a workplace conversation,

17:23.214 --> 17:24.589
so please just shut up.

17:24.716 --> 17:26.717
All I'm saying is,
is this place is going fast.

17:26.843 --> 17:28.719
Listen, please - just not here.

17:28.845 --> 17:29.970
You two.

17:31.264 --> 17:32.597
Now.

17:36.060 --> 17:37.644
Shit.

17:39.063 --> 17:41.064
Think she knows about us?

17:49.073 --> 17:50.866
- Is this about...
- The Santa Muerte case.

17:50.992 --> 17:52.576
Oh.

17:53.244 --> 17:56.538
- I thought that was dead.
- Well, now it's alive, barely.

17:57.665 --> 18:00.876
Yasmin Aragon, the associate
of the Fuentes brothers

18:01.002 --> 18:02.919
that Sergeant Batista identified,

18:03.045 --> 18:07.507
has assured us that she will bring Carlos
and Marco into Club Mayan tomorrow night.

18:07.633 --> 18:09.426
- So we're on?
- We are on.

18:09.552 --> 18:11.845
I am personally overseeing
this operation.

18:11.971 --> 18:14.389
We can't risk word leaking out
to the Fuentes,

18:14.515 --> 18:16.141
so it's strictly on a need-to-know basis.

18:16.267 --> 18:19.269
Rather than flooding
the club with police personnel,

18:19.395 --> 18:22.272
we will be performing
a small surgical operation.

18:22.398 --> 18:25.233
We will take the brothers into custody
before they get into the club.

18:25.359 --> 18:28.403
Detective Morgan,
you'll be with me in the surveillance van.

18:28.529 --> 18:29.446
Detective Quinn,

18:29.572 --> 18:32.365
we're gonna post you inside the door
of the club with Officer Manzon.

18:32.492 --> 18:35.911
I will be roving, placing myself
wherever I believe most effective.

18:36.037 --> 18:39.331
If we're gonna take them outside,
shouldn't we be outside?

18:40.625 --> 18:42.501
In order not to stand out
like sore thumbs,

18:42.627 --> 18:45.337
we will continue with the posts
we've already established.

18:45.463 --> 18:48.465
Thank you, Detectives Morgan and Quinn.
That'll be all.

18:51.511 --> 18:54.763
Maria, let me make myself very clear.

18:56.724 --> 19:01.144
You've wasted more than enough
time and money on this case already.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.605
You're supposed to be
a master manipulator of the press,

19:03.731 --> 19:06.525
but you haven't even been able to do that.
Every day I pick up the paper,

19:06.651 --> 19:09.319
read another story
about how we're not doing our job.

19:09.445 --> 19:11.822
Get it right this time,

19:11.948 --> 19:15.283
or we're gonna have an interesting
conversation about your future.

19:22.124 --> 19:23.542
Where are we with Jordan Chase?

19:27.088 --> 19:28.421
I've got Quinn on it.

19:29.674 --> 19:31.716
We've made numerous calls
to his organisation,

19:31.843 --> 19:35.136
but we haven't been able
to reach him personally just yet.

19:35.263 --> 19:36.972
He could be playing hard to get.

19:37.098 --> 19:39.766
In that case, we'll pay
his office a visit to see if...

19:39.892 --> 19:41.893
Probably won't be necessary.

19:47.108 --> 19:48.692
Jordan Chase.

19:49.402 --> 19:50.402
Hi.

19:54.532 --> 19:55.657
Holy shit, that's him.

19:55.783 --> 19:57.075
Nice to meet you.

19:57.702 --> 19:59.077
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

20:01.706 --> 20:04.291
Mr Chase? Oh, Mr Chase...

20:04.417 --> 20:05.458
- Stand back.
- I, um...

20:05.585 --> 20:08.378
I took one of your seminars
at the Beach Club a while back.

20:08.504 --> 20:10.797
Sure. In Palmetto Bay.

20:10.923 --> 20:13.300
- You remember?
- Of course I do.

20:13.426 --> 20:16.678
You have to excuse Cole here.
He, uh, keeps the crazies away.

20:16.804 --> 20:18.847
Why don't you let me
get a picture of you two?

20:18.973 --> 20:21.683
Oh, yeah.
Excellent. OK.

20:23.102 --> 20:24.561
All right, smile.

20:26.606 --> 20:29.399
Oh. One more.

20:29.525 --> 20:30.734
Got it.

20:31.569 --> 20:32.652
Jordan Chase.

20:33.863 --> 20:36.031
- Dexter Morgan.
- Nice to meet you.

20:36.157 --> 20:37.616
Nice watch.

20:37.742 --> 20:40.744
Oh, uh, my dad gave it to me
when I was a teenager.

20:40.870 --> 20:43.997
It's water-resistant to 100 metres.

20:44.123 --> 20:46.750
I have no idea why I would ever need that,
but it sure looks nice.

20:46.876 --> 20:48.376
If that's the watch that Lumen heard,

20:48.502 --> 20:51.963
I'll make sure it accompanies you
to the bottom of the Atlantic.

20:53.966 --> 20:55.258
Mr Chase.

20:55.384 --> 20:57.761
You must be the person
in charge around here.

20:57.887 --> 20:59.346
I was in Jacksonville,

20:59.472 --> 21:02.349
got an early call from Cole here,
my head of security,

21:02.475 --> 21:04.601
saying one of our trucks
had been stolen out of our lot,

21:04.727 --> 21:08.563
and that it just might be the one
we'd all been watching on the news.

21:08.689 --> 21:11.524
- I flew back as soon as I could.
- I see.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.778
We found an article
of clothing in the vehicle.

21:14.904 --> 21:17.447
My jacket.
It's my personal vehicle.

21:17.573 --> 21:19.824
I always leave my things inside.

21:19.951 --> 21:21.660
- And the keys?
- The keys?

21:21.786 --> 21:23.912
Yeah, we found the keys
in the ignition.

21:24.038 --> 21:27.082
There are a lot of ways
to steal a car.

21:27.208 --> 21:29.334
Most thieves don't have
the actual key.

21:31.087 --> 21:33.463
I leave a spare set of keys
on a hook inside our office.

21:34.840 --> 21:37.842
All my guys know where to find them,
in case they need the truck.

21:38.344 --> 21:41.680
Honestly, they're just sitting there.
Anyone could have grabbed them.

21:41.806 --> 21:44.683
And you're Head of Security?

21:44.809 --> 21:47.686
Yeah, Cole. I might have to
tighten things up a bit.

21:47.812 --> 21:48.687
Mm?

21:50.940 --> 21:54.985
I want to make it very clear that the Miami
Police Department has my full cooperation.

21:55.111 --> 21:58.196
My organisation
is completely open to you.

21:58.322 --> 22:00.699
This is a horrible, horrible tragedy.

22:00.825 --> 22:04.119
Please, anything I can do
to help facilitate its resolution...

22:04.245 --> 22:05.704
Well, thank you, Mr Chase.

22:05.830 --> 22:10.417
First, we're gonna need fingerprints
and hair samples from all your employees,

22:10.543 --> 22:11.876
starting with Cole.

22:12.003 --> 22:15.088
Absolutely. And if I could ask one favour?

22:15.214 --> 22:20.135
I'd appreciate it if my name and organisation
wasn't released to the press.

22:20.261 --> 22:23.722
Being connected to this in any way
would be a PR nightmare.

22:23.848 --> 22:25.682
I'm sure you understand.

22:25.808 --> 22:29.102
As long as we have your continued
cooperation, that shouldn't be a problem.

22:30.438 --> 22:34.774
Sociopaths can't feel psychic pain,
but they can feel physical pain.

22:34.900 --> 22:35.817
Ow.

22:35.943 --> 22:37.402
Sorry.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.492
What do you think about Cole?

22:45.828 --> 22:46.911
"It wasn't me,

22:48.289 --> 22:50.915
"someone stole my vehicle."

22:51.042 --> 22:53.877
The oldest excuse in the book.

22:54.003 --> 22:58.465
Still, it does happen.
And Mr Chase is very high-profile,

22:58.591 --> 23:00.258
well respected.

23:01.177 --> 23:03.511
It's hard to imagine
someone like him, or his people,

23:03.637 --> 23:06.264
would be involved in something like this.

23:12.897 --> 23:15.982
I took a few hairs
from the headrest of the truck as well.

23:16.108 --> 23:20.361
If someone else was driving,
he'd have left some evidence behind.

23:20.488 --> 23:21.863
And?

23:21.989 --> 23:24.616
Cole's hair matches the hair
on the jacket and the headrest.

23:24.742 --> 23:27.660
- Fingerprints?
- They're all Cole's, even on the ignition key.

23:27.787 --> 23:30.830
I think he's just become
the focus of our investigation.

23:30.956 --> 23:33.083
- And Jordan?
- His alibi holds up.

23:33.209 --> 23:34.876
He was in Jacksonville.

23:35.002 --> 23:37.420
So for now,
we got our eyes on Cole.

23:57.942 --> 24:00.151
- Lumen?
- Dexter...

24:00.277 --> 24:03.321
you need to announce yourself.
I don't know who's coming in.

24:04.323 --> 24:06.574
But it's OK to have packages
delivered here?

24:10.412 --> 24:11.704
I need things.

24:11.831 --> 24:15.208
You said not to leave the house.

24:19.839 --> 24:22.048
And what are you gonna
do with that?

24:24.927 --> 24:26.594
It's just a flashlight.

24:28.514 --> 24:31.015
You have a way
of bending the rules.

24:34.770 --> 24:37.147
What's going on with the case?

24:39.984 --> 24:41.359
Do you know this man?

24:45.656 --> 24:47.073
Oh, my God.

24:47.199 --> 24:48.992
That's him.

24:49.869 --> 24:52.412
That's the guy
who folded his jacket.

24:52.538 --> 24:54.914
- How did you find him?
- He found us.

24:55.040 --> 24:58.918
His name's Cole Harmon.
He's Jordan Chase's head of security.

25:03.507 --> 25:05.884
What about him?

25:06.010 --> 25:07.886
No, I...

25:08.012 --> 25:11.598
I mean, that guy's clearly a freak,
but I don't know him.

25:11.724 --> 25:13.933
No, not the bald guy.
The guy beside him.

25:14.059 --> 25:15.894
- Jordan Chase.
- Oh.

25:18.898 --> 25:21.191
- No, I don't know him either.
- You sure?

25:21.317 --> 25:23.693
I told you, I didn't see
most of their faces.

25:25.946 --> 25:29.282
- Who is he?
- He's some sort of motivational speaker.

25:31.452 --> 25:34.287
This guy...
I definitely know.

25:35.915 --> 25:36.998
What next?

25:37.124 --> 25:39.417
Well, there's a problem -
the homicide team is on this.

25:39.543 --> 25:41.878
They'll probably arrest him
within the next few days,

25:42.004 --> 25:46.132
and once that happens, Cole will never see
the outside of a prison cell again.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.009
What about the other guys?

25:48.135 --> 25:51.137
In order to save his own skin,
he'll probably turn them in.

25:53.307 --> 25:56.809
It's only a matter of time before they're all
in the hands of the police.

26:02.691 --> 26:07.195
But this is Florida. We execute here.
These men will be brought to justice.

26:08.614 --> 26:11.950
You can walk away from all of this now,
put it behind you.

26:13.369 --> 26:15.161
You can go on with your life.

26:15.287 --> 26:17.121
No.

26:17.248 --> 26:18.665
That's not what I want.

26:18.791 --> 26:21.918
I promise you,
the police will take care of it.

26:22.044 --> 26:25.213
No, I don't want the police
to take care of it. I...

26:25.339 --> 26:26.965
I want to take care of it.

26:27.091 --> 26:30.301
I know how she feels.
It's not so different from me.

26:33.889 --> 26:37.183
- How much coffee are you drinking?
- A lot.

26:37.309 --> 26:39.727
I have to stay awake.
What if they come for me at night?

26:40.521 --> 26:42.480
She's stressed, on edge -

26:42.606 --> 26:46.317
the way I feel when I've gone too long
without putting someone on my table.

26:46.443 --> 26:49.612
- You said you'd help me.
- I did.

26:49.738 --> 26:53.283
I just don't know that helping you
kill someone is actually helping you.

26:54.994 --> 26:57.412
This is all I think about.

26:59.415 --> 27:01.207
Don't back out now.

27:03.669 --> 27:05.128
This is important to me.

27:07.423 --> 27:10.383
Truth is, I actually want to help her...

27:13.804 --> 27:16.139
for some very complicated reasons.

27:18.809 --> 27:23.479
If we want Cole for ourselves,
I have to derail the police investigation,

27:23.605 --> 27:26.024
which means giving them
another suspect.

27:26.150 --> 27:27.483
Who?

27:27.609 --> 27:30.486
The man who actually killed
all those girls.

27:31.697 --> 27:33.865
Boyd Fowler.

27:55.846 --> 27:57.722
Here, put these on.

28:00.017 --> 28:01.851
First thing we have to do
is remove any evidence

28:01.977 --> 28:03.353
that you were ever here
at Boyd's house.

28:03.479 --> 28:06.439
If the police find
your fingerprints or...

28:08.275 --> 28:10.485
anything that ties you
to this place,

28:10.611 --> 28:13.988
they're gonna want to know
what your relationship to Boyd Fowler is.

28:14.114 --> 28:15.907
How you got here.

28:18.243 --> 28:19.369
How you got out.

28:21.997 --> 28:23.873
That's where you first found me.

28:25.667 --> 28:27.752
We need to go up.

28:31.006 --> 28:32.965
You OK?

28:34.676 --> 28:36.260
I'll be with you.

28:52.986 --> 28:54.779
Oh, God.

28:57.157 --> 28:59.367
You OK? We can leave.

29:00.911 --> 29:02.161
No.

29:04.790 --> 29:08.084
He kept me tied up...
over there.

29:11.839 --> 29:14.465
I don't know
how long I was here.

29:17.136 --> 29:18.845
Maybe a couple days.

29:18.971 --> 29:21.639
All I know is that he brought me
here to kill me.

29:22.975 --> 29:24.559
I'm guessing that was his job.

29:27.771 --> 29:30.022
He was the finisher.

29:33.402 --> 29:36.863
The last day,
I chewed on that rope for hours.

29:37.948 --> 29:39.615
I was finally able to slip it off.

29:40.451 --> 29:42.785
That's when I went downstairs,
and I saw you...

29:45.831 --> 29:46.998
Do what I did.

30:06.643 --> 30:08.394
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

30:08.520 --> 30:12.398
I just need something of Boyd's
to plant in the truck from the accident.

30:16.570 --> 30:17.904
His wallet.

30:18.030 --> 30:19.989
How did you know
that was there?

30:20.115 --> 30:21.491
I put it there.

30:22.701 --> 30:24.535
Hold the fucking phone,
everyone!

30:25.829 --> 30:28.039
I was giving Cole's truck
another quick once-over,

30:28.165 --> 30:31.626
and I found something that our
blind-as-fucking-bats lab geeks missed.

30:31.752 --> 30:33.544
What have you got?

30:33.670 --> 30:35.046
A wallet.

30:35.172 --> 30:38.591
He probably had it sitting on the console,
and then it went flying when he got hit.

30:38.717 --> 30:40.801
- I found it under the seat.
- Cole's wallet?

30:40.928 --> 30:42.762
No, that's just it.
It's not Cole's.

30:42.888 --> 30:44.722
Whose is it?

30:46.141 --> 30:48.100
Boyd Fowler's.

30:48.227 --> 30:49.977
Who the fuck is Boyd Fowler?

30:54.149 --> 30:55.775
I'm going upstairs.

30:59.029 --> 31:01.072
Check it out.

31:01.740 --> 31:05.076
There are locks of hair in here,
numbered one through twelve.

31:05.202 --> 31:07.912
Twelve? Jesus.

31:09.122 --> 31:13.334
Well, I'll run DNA on all the hair samples,
and match it to the victims.

31:13.460 --> 31:14.585
The guy that did this...

31:14.711 --> 31:16.504
Died exactly
where you're standing.

31:17.256 --> 31:18.631
Hey.

31:19.633 --> 31:21.050
In here.

31:27.391 --> 31:30.101
The same exact barrel
the girls were in.

31:30.227 --> 31:31.978
Jesus. What'd he do with these?

31:32.104 --> 31:35.898
The preliminary medical examiner's report
said all the girls were electrocuted.

31:36.650 --> 31:40.486
We're gonna need Forensics in the attic.
I think he kept the girls up there.

31:40.612 --> 31:43.489
It looks like Boyd Fowler
has become our primary focus.

31:48.829 --> 31:50.580
Do you know this man?

31:53.500 --> 31:56.544
- No.
- Well, he knows you.

31:56.670 --> 31:58.629
He has all your books
and CDs in his house.

32:00.424 --> 32:04.343
Uh... I've sold over
a million copies of my book,

32:04.469 --> 32:06.304
almost as many CDs.

32:06.430 --> 32:09.265
I'm just trying to figure out
how he came to be driving your truck.

32:11.435 --> 32:14.395
- Well, I'm sorry, but...
- I know him.

32:15.022 --> 32:18.190
Boyd Fowler.
He was one of your stalkers.

32:20.027 --> 32:22.737
And how come
I'm just now hearing this?

32:22.863 --> 32:25.239
No reason to tell you about
every nut that passes through.

32:25.365 --> 32:28.284
He never seemed
like a serious threat.

32:28.410 --> 32:31.329
He took a few seminars a while back,
and then started showing up at our office

32:31.455 --> 32:33.331
asking for Mr Chase.

32:33.457 --> 32:35.458
I had to escort him off the premises
a few times.

32:35.584 --> 32:39.629
He was clearly a bit off, but, uh...
he never struck me as dangerous.

32:39.755 --> 32:40.796
He's dangerous.

32:43.967 --> 32:47.470
He'd been in and out
of our offices enough times.

32:47.596 --> 32:49.263
Probably saw
where I put the keys.

32:49.389 --> 32:51.599
When's the last time
you had contact with him?

32:53.226 --> 32:56.187
Haven't seen him for a while.
Couple of months, maybe.

32:56.313 --> 32:58.439
Any idea where he might be?

32:58.565 --> 32:59.982
No.

33:02.319 --> 33:04.654
We have a warrant for his arrest.

33:05.656 --> 33:09.116
I suggest that you be
especially cautious, Mr Chase,

33:09.242 --> 33:12.244
because if he has a thing for you,
you could be in danger.

33:12.371 --> 33:13.746
Noted.

33:13.872 --> 33:15.831
Now, if you have
any contact with him,

33:15.957 --> 33:18.209
please get in touch
with us immediately.

33:18.335 --> 33:20.836
This guy... is very bad news.

33:21.630 --> 33:23.089
I will.

33:23.215 --> 33:26.509
Thank you for coming in.
I appreciate it.

33:50.242 --> 33:52.410
You finally did something right.

33:52.536 --> 33:55.246
Steering the cops toward Boyd -
very smart.

33:57.290 --> 33:59.083
It wasn't me.

34:05.590 --> 34:08.134
Daddy's going
to Boca Raton tonight.

34:10.887 --> 34:13.806
Cos that's where Cole Harmon lives.

34:13.932 --> 34:16.183
He's a bad man.

34:17.769 --> 34:19.937
I'm gonna try to find out

34:20.063 --> 34:22.732
who the rest
of his bad-man friends are.

34:22.858 --> 34:24.942
You want that?

34:26.778 --> 34:27.903
Hi.

34:29.030 --> 34:30.740
There's my angel.

34:31.450 --> 34:33.117
Let me just set my things down.

34:35.704 --> 34:38.289
Wonder how much longer
I'm gonna be able to talk to you like this.

34:38.415 --> 34:40.666
Soon you're gonna start
to understand me.

34:43.086 --> 34:45.463
Harrison clearly loves
his Saint Brigid.

34:45.589 --> 34:47.590
He put it with his favourite toys.

34:47.716 --> 34:50.342
- I put that in the toy box.
- Sorry?

34:50.469 --> 34:52.511
It's just a statue of a lady
who died a long time ago.

34:52.637 --> 34:55.431
She doesn't protect anybody,
or anything.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.435
I should get to work.
Here. Go to Sonya.

35:04.024 --> 35:06.692
It's just this can be
a very dark world at times,

35:06.818 --> 35:09.111
and since dear Brigid
has always been a comfort to me,

35:09.237 --> 35:11.071
I thought Harrison
might feel the same.

35:11.198 --> 35:13.908
I hope for his sake,
you'd reconsider.

35:15.160 --> 35:17.495
Sure.

35:17.621 --> 35:19.205
Bye, buddy.

35:21.458 --> 35:25.127
So, uh... What are you
wearing tonight?

35:25.253 --> 35:27.379
To the big stakeout? Um...

35:28.215 --> 35:29.632
A diaper, probably.

35:31.051 --> 35:33.886
I'll have to sit in that van
with Batista for hours.

35:34.805 --> 35:37.306
Will you please not wear
that awful shirt

35:37.432 --> 35:40.559
with the patterns all over it?
It really makes me dizzy.

35:40.685 --> 35:43.729
No, I, uh... only wore that as a joke.

35:43.855 --> 35:44.980
Oh.

35:45.106 --> 35:47.107
Hey, uh, I got to go.
I'll see you later tonight.

35:47.234 --> 35:48.275
OK.

35:57.494 --> 35:59.245
Hey.

35:59.371 --> 36:01.080
Well, look at you,
pretty as a picture.

36:02.332 --> 36:04.542
I only got a few minutes,
so what do you got for me?

36:04.668 --> 36:07.211
I don't work for free, Quinn.

36:07.337 --> 36:11.173
- Well, I just gave you 500 bucks.
- And I told you about the girl.

36:11.299 --> 36:12.925
But if you want to find out who she is,

36:13.051 --> 36:16.220
where she's from, and what she's doing
in that damn house,

36:16.346 --> 36:19.640
I might have to employ
some methods just a little bit...

36:19.766 --> 36:21.600
unorthodox.

36:21.726 --> 36:23.894
And for that,
you're gonna have to pay.

36:24.855 --> 36:27.731
- I don't know.
- I know you got the cash.

36:28.316 --> 36:30.025
Yeah, it's not that.

36:32.404 --> 36:33.821
It's the pussy.

36:35.115 --> 36:37.366
Now, looky here, stud,
if you're backing off this thing

36:37.492 --> 36:39.201
cos you're porking
that guy's sister,

36:39.327 --> 36:43.289
I'd say you've got
your priorities as a cop all wrong.

36:45.709 --> 36:47.793
I'm a little embarrassed for you.

36:47.919 --> 36:49.920
I'll give you another five.

36:53.258 --> 36:54.717
That'll work.

37:03.435 --> 37:07.187
You don't have to do anything with this, OK?
You can just talk normally.

37:07.314 --> 37:08.647
What do I have to do?

37:08.773 --> 37:11.567
We're gonna walk you through the club,
so that our team can get a visual on you,

37:11.693 --> 37:14.361
and then you're just gonna wait
by the door.

37:14.487 --> 37:17.489
The second you see the Fuentes brothers,
you walk up to them,

37:17.616 --> 37:19.992
and you engage in conversation
outside of the club,

37:20.118 --> 37:21.577
until we move in and take 'em.

37:21.703 --> 37:24.371
- What am I supposed to say?
- Tell 'em how hot they look.

37:25.832 --> 37:28.584
You really don't have to worry
about anything. We're gonna be right there.

37:28.710 --> 37:30.878
I'm gonna make sure
we're all in contact.

37:31.004 --> 37:33.339
This is Sergeant Batista.
Is everybody getting this?

37:33.965 --> 37:35.674
- Loud and clear.
- I can hear you.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.134
Looks like we're all in place.

37:48.271 --> 37:49.313
OK.

37:53.318 --> 37:55.069
You'll do great.

38:17.092 --> 38:18.676
They're already here.

38:20.011 --> 38:21.011
Say again?

38:21.137 --> 38:24.223
I said, they're already here,
sitting at the VIP table.

38:25.475 --> 38:27.893
OK, how'd that happen?
I thought we had all the doors covered.

38:28.019 --> 38:29.687
I don't know.

38:29.813 --> 38:31.981
I heard there's a secret door
from the club next door,

38:32.107 --> 38:33.357
but I've never seen it.

38:37.278 --> 38:39.405
OK, this is a change of plans.

38:39.531 --> 38:41.699
Yasmin, go sit with them.

38:41.825 --> 38:43.909
We're gonna sit tight
until they leave.

38:44.035 --> 38:46.578
Once they step outside the club,
we take them.

38:46.705 --> 38:48.414
Let's make sure we find
that secret door,

38:48.540 --> 38:50.332
and deploy a team there as well.
Everyone got that?

38:50.458 --> 38:51.667
- Got it.
- Got it.

38:59.968 --> 39:02.094
We've been here for over an hour.

39:03.054 --> 39:04.138
I know.

39:05.473 --> 39:09.268
Well, you said there's a seminar in Naples.
Don't you think he's there?

39:10.103 --> 39:11.729
Probably.

39:11.855 --> 39:13.605
So, what are you waiting for?

39:18.737 --> 39:20.487
That.

39:20.613 --> 39:22.698
The neighbour to go to bed.

39:22.824 --> 39:24.491
I'm going in.

39:24.617 --> 39:26.744
No, you're staying here.

39:26.870 --> 39:28.412
What? No.

39:28.538 --> 39:30.247
Yes. It's too dangerous.

39:30.373 --> 39:32.291
I have no idea
what's inside there.

39:32.417 --> 39:35.669
I'm gonna have my hands full
without watching over you.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.756
Fine.

39:38.882 --> 39:41.884
Well, you can...
be the lookout.

39:44.512 --> 39:46.180
It's so great working with you.

39:47.766 --> 39:49.558
If you see anything, call me.

40:02.280 --> 40:05.657
We are starting to look a little obvious.
I am gonna go get us a club soda.

40:05.784 --> 40:06.909
All right, yeah.

40:25.470 --> 40:26.804
Oye, mami.

40:29.432 --> 40:30.933
Ven aquÃ­.

40:32.143 --> 40:34.895
- He's calling me over.
- No, keep moving. Ignore him.

40:35.021 --> 40:38.816
This is Lieutenant LaGuerta.
Officer Manzon, go to him, make nice,

40:38.942 --> 40:40.734
and try to get him
to step outside the club.

40:40.860 --> 40:43.445
Lieutenant, no. This is a problem.
These guys are dangerous.

40:43.571 --> 40:44.947
Stand down, Morgan.

40:45.865 --> 40:48.492
She's in charge.
Nothing we can do.

41:12.142 --> 41:14.393
Police! Drop that fucking gun!

41:15.562 --> 41:16.812
Holy fucking shit!

41:19.149 --> 41:20.858
Move, move, move!

41:24.821 --> 41:27.739
Stop right there. Down on the ground.
Police! Drop the gun!

41:27.866 --> 41:30.033
- Back away!
- Drop the gun now!

41:30.160 --> 41:31.368
Oh, you again.

41:32.453 --> 41:35.247
You should walk away before this one
gets more than just a little cut.

41:35.373 --> 41:36.707
Drop the gun right now.

41:36.833 --> 41:38.167
Please!

41:51.764 --> 41:53.140
You OK?

41:54.017 --> 41:55.309
Yeah.

41:55.435 --> 41:57.978
It's OK. Come here.

42:32.263 --> 42:34.264
Cole as a teenager.

42:40.730 --> 42:42.147
Who the fuck are you?

42:43.441 --> 42:45.692
No fucking way!

42:45.818 --> 42:47.486
Who are you, motherfucker?

42:56.329 --> 42:59.039
We have to go
before he sees our faces.

42:59.165 --> 43:02.918
Holy shit!
I can't believe that just happened!

43:03.044 --> 43:06.380
- What made you come inside?
- I thought I saw a shadow.

43:06.506 --> 43:08.298
And that made you come
crashing through a window?

43:08.424 --> 43:10.133
I know. I know. I just had a feeling.

43:10.260 --> 43:12.094
It was some sort
of lizard-brain thing.

43:12.220 --> 43:13.929
She's starting to sound like me.

43:16.307 --> 43:18.767
- That's Cole.
- And Boyd.

43:18.893 --> 43:22.479
- And Dan the Dentist.
- It's them from, like, 15 years ago.

43:22.605 --> 43:24.189
Do you recognise any of the others?

43:24.315 --> 43:26.525
No, just those three.

43:29.112 --> 43:32.239
- What does this mean?
- I don't know.

43:32.365 --> 43:35.033
They've known each other
since they were kids.

43:35.159 --> 43:38.787
Oh, my God, Dexter. This is huge.
We just have to figure out who they are.

43:49.007 --> 43:51.800
So, what do we do next?

43:54.804 --> 43:56.138
What?

43:57.432 --> 43:58.724
You said "we".

44:04.564 --> 44:06.148
Put on your seat belt.

44:18.369 --> 44:19.953
This is a fucking disaster.

44:20.079 --> 44:21.747
Carlos Fuentes
was shot and killed.

44:21.873 --> 44:24.708
Our informant, Yasmin Aragon,
was shot and killed,

44:24.834 --> 44:27.544
- as well as another innocent bystander.
- Son of a bitch...

44:27.670 --> 44:31.089
At this point, we don't know if it's by
our gunfire, or that of the two brothers.

44:31.215 --> 44:34.509
Additionally, three other
bystanders were wounded.

44:34.635 --> 44:36.887
I want a full report by 8:00am.

44:43.061 --> 44:46.271
I know it looks bad - and it is bad.

44:46.397 --> 44:48.940
But we are going to get through this,
I promise you.

44:51.444 --> 44:53.236
In the heat of battle...

44:54.113 --> 44:56.031
all cops make occasional
mistakes in judgment.

44:56.157 --> 44:57.199
Excuse me?

44:58.826 --> 45:01.578
If mistakes were made,
they most certainly were not mine.

45:28.940 --> 45:31.608
He was so relaxed and happy,
I couldn't bear to move.

45:33.361 --> 45:35.821
And I have to admit,
he feels quite good.

45:36.656 --> 45:39.366
He's always so happy
in her arms.

45:50.002 --> 45:52.838
Partners come to us
in various ways,

45:52.964 --> 45:55.507
bound together
for many different reasons.

45:55.633 --> 45:57.300
But for any partnership to work,

45:57.427 --> 46:00.220
you must not only accept
this person into your life,

46:00.346 --> 46:02.681
but accept her for who she is.

46:25.079 --> 46:26.538
Saint Brigid...

46:28.166 --> 46:30.292
circle us with your light,

46:31.294 --> 46:34.671
so that no darkness
shall overcome our world.

46:40.678 --> 46:42.387
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:44.265 --> 46:46.892
- Hi.
- Hi!

46:47.977 --> 46:50.729
- Harrison, this is Lumen.
- Hi.

46:50.855 --> 46:53.815
Oh, my goodness. Hello.

47:02.450 --> 47:04.326
Sometimes partners find us,

47:04.452 --> 47:06.203
and as much as we try
to push them away,

47:06.329 --> 47:09.289
they work their way
into our lives regardless,

47:09.415 --> 47:12.417
until we finally realise
how much we need them.
