WEBVTT

00:10.265 --> 00:11.808
Previously on Dexter...

00:11.934 --> 00:15.478
Cut him, and I'll blow your fucking head off.

00:15.979 --> 00:17.522
Medic! I need a fucking medic!

00:18.107 --> 00:19.982
We were wondering
if there's anything you can tell us

00:20.109 --> 00:22.443
about the man who injured you.

00:22.569 --> 00:24.696
I know where Carlos and his
brother have been hanging out -

00:24.822 --> 00:26.531
at a local club
called The Mayan.

00:26.657 --> 00:29.450
- You got your lead. Congrats.
- Yeah, we stake this place out,

00:29.576 --> 00:32.787
they show up, and then we take
these Santa Muerta no-dicks down for good.

00:32.913 --> 00:34.831
- Are you and Quinn...
- We're fuck buddies.

00:34.957 --> 00:36.624
Don't bring him around
when Harrison's here.

00:38.001 --> 00:41.879
- Would you like some coffee?
- That would be wonderful.

00:42.631 --> 00:44.006
Son of a bitch.

00:44.133 --> 00:48.261
- Hey, hey, hey! Sergeant!
- Angel, let him go. This is a sting!

00:48.387 --> 00:51.931
IA needed my help
to bust a narcotics cop on the take,

00:52.057 --> 00:55.226
and I said yes,
to close the books on your bar fight!

00:55.811 --> 00:59.355
- Fuck those IA rats.
- And your boss.

00:59.481 --> 01:01.816
That bitch put handcuffs on me.

01:01.942 --> 01:03.568
I might have a job for you.

01:03.694 --> 01:06.529
- You got a name?
- Dexter Morgan.

01:07.156 --> 01:09.073
Boyd wasn't the only one
who did this to me.

01:11.410 --> 01:13.035
There were others.

01:13.162 --> 01:15.580
What are you gonna do if you
actually find one of these guys?

01:15.706 --> 01:17.790
- What you won't.
- You going to kill them?

01:17.916 --> 01:20.334
You don't get to tell me
what to do.

01:21.837 --> 01:23.004
What are you doing?

01:23.130 --> 01:25.715
You were about to murder
the wrong man.

01:25.841 --> 01:27.800
Go home.

01:28.802 --> 01:30.845
OK. OK, OK, I'll go.

01:30.971 --> 01:34.182
You're doing the right thing.
Your parents will be happy to see you.

01:34.308 --> 01:35.308
Thank you.

01:36.435 --> 01:38.686
Maybe this is one problem
I can check off the list.

01:43.650 --> 01:44.942
Welcome to Miami.

01:46.005 --> 01:52.079
FaceTime with British Models 24/7
www. saucytime. com

03:49.192 --> 03:52.862
I've always tried to keep
the different parts of my life separate.

03:57.284 --> 03:59.827
Becoming a father
made that much more difficult.

04:01.079 --> 04:03.873
And as a husband, I failed.

04:03.999 --> 04:06.292
But I'm a very neat monster...

04:07.628 --> 04:10.296
who won't make
the same mistake again.

04:15.427 --> 04:19.513
I packed up Rita's wedding dress.
I thought Astor might want it someday.

04:25.020 --> 04:27.980
Feels like it took you guys
months to move in...

04:29.274 --> 04:30.608
Only a day to pack up.

04:30.734 --> 04:33.235
The realtor suggested
we paint the walls white.

04:33.362 --> 04:36.072
She wants to stage the house
Miami Chic.

04:36.198 --> 04:38.574
No evidence that a family
ever lived here.

04:38.700 --> 04:39.867
Or died here.

04:40.535 --> 04:42.453
You have to disclose that,
don't you?

04:42.579 --> 04:44.622
The hope is that a ridiculously low
listing price

04:44.748 --> 04:47.208
will help a buyer see past that.

04:47.334 --> 04:49.669
Any idea where you want to live?

04:51.338 --> 04:55.257
I'm sorry. That was a stupid question.
You should take the apartment.

04:55.759 --> 04:57.259
No. No, that's yours.

04:57.386 --> 05:00.346
No, I insist. It's really always been yours.

05:00.472 --> 05:04.100
- I'll move out.
- I thought you already did.

05:04.768 --> 05:07.144
I didn't move in with Quinn.

05:08.271 --> 05:09.605
Well, you're never around.

05:09.731 --> 05:12.608
I'm at Quinn's, but I don't live there.

05:13.652 --> 05:15.444
No clothes in any drawers.

05:15.570 --> 05:18.698
There's no his-and-hers toothbrush action.

05:20.409 --> 05:21.951
Quinn's place is all Quinn.

05:22.786 --> 05:24.328
A vast, empty space?

05:31.545 --> 05:33.087
I don't remember Rita in these.

05:34.006 --> 05:35.548
Because they belong to Lumen.

05:35.674 --> 05:37.299
Me either.

05:39.845 --> 05:41.846
Lumen is home in Minneapolis,

05:41.972 --> 05:44.515
another part of my life
packed away.

05:48.228 --> 05:50.229
Life seems different now.

05:51.982 --> 05:53.315
Manageable.

05:57.571 --> 05:59.989
Everything in its right place.

06:37.903 --> 06:40.654
Soon, Lance Robinson
will be on my table.

06:42.866 --> 06:44.075
Lance trawls the internet,

06:44.201 --> 06:47.870
engaging in casual encounters
with innocent men...

06:49.498 --> 06:52.875
who never suspect those encounters
could turn deadly.

06:57.339 --> 07:01.175
Four times Lance deliberately pushed
someone's fantasies too far.

07:03.553 --> 07:06.722
He will be an easy kill,
just like old times.

07:08.683 --> 07:10.768
Tonight's the night.

07:36.336 --> 07:39.296
OK, people.
Let's go over our positions at Club Mayan.

07:39.422 --> 07:43.175
Everybody be in place by 10.
Batista and I'll be in the van, as usual.

07:43.301 --> 07:45.928
Quinn, you'll watch the door.
Cira...

07:47.347 --> 07:50.057
- Yes, Chief?
- Don't let me stop you.

07:51.268 --> 07:54.979
Officer Manzon, you'll be on the floor
watching foot traffic at the VIP room,

07:55.105 --> 07:58.899
- in case the Fuentes brothers roll through.
- And what if they don't?

07:59.526 --> 08:02.194
Then we'll work
the operation until they do.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.697
You were face to face
with Carlos Fuentes, right?

08:04.823 --> 08:05.739
Yes, sir.

08:05.866 --> 08:07.575
Then that means
he knows that we're onto him.

08:07.701 --> 08:10.119
Tell me why they would ever
return to this club.

08:10.245 --> 08:12.371
The only reason the Fuentes brothers
are forcing people

08:12.497 --> 08:16.625
to withdraw cash from the ATM,
is to pay for table service at this club.

08:16.751 --> 08:20.796
We ran the dates of the ATM hold-ups
past the club managers.

08:20.922 --> 08:23.257
And they confirmed
that on each of those nights,

08:23.383 --> 08:25.467
the Fuentes brothers
showed up at Club Mayan,

08:25.594 --> 08:27.303
and took over the VIP lounge.

08:27.429 --> 08:30.890
So if the Fuentes brothers do show up
at this club, which is highly unlikely,

08:31.016 --> 08:34.059
it means that someone is possibly
lying on the floor of their living room

08:34.186 --> 08:36.145
without their head.

08:37.397 --> 08:38.772
We're working
the only lead we have.

08:38.899 --> 08:42.151
All you're doing is drinking and dancing
on the taxpayer's dime.

08:44.487 --> 08:46.363
I would have expected
more from you, Morgan.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.168
Chief.

09:00.170 --> 09:01.670
We don't have
a lot of options here.

09:01.796 --> 09:05.507
Without this operation, we're effectively stopping work on
this
case,

09:05.634 --> 09:07.134
which we cannot do to this community.

09:07.260 --> 09:09.428
Did you even know
this operation was happening?

09:09.554 --> 09:11.347
Of course I knew. Why wouldn't I?

09:11.473 --> 09:15.059
Well, it seems you've been spending
a lot of time lately with Internal Affairs

09:15.185 --> 09:17.519
bailing your new husband
out of hot water.

09:17.646 --> 09:19.438
Bravo, Mrs Batista.

09:20.565 --> 09:22.107
I'm keeping my name.

09:22.234 --> 09:26.111
And I think working Club Mayan is
a valid allocation of my squad's resources.

09:26.238 --> 09:28.155
It is your squad, Lieutenant.

09:28.281 --> 09:30.199
- How you manage it is up to you.
- Thank you.

09:30.325 --> 09:32.243
But if another murder goes up on the board,

09:32.369 --> 09:34.662
it's your ass on the line, not mine.

09:41.169 --> 09:44.088
You have one more night at Club Mayan.
Make something happen.

09:44.965 --> 09:47.049
Matthews doesn't have
much faith in us, does he?

09:47.717 --> 09:49.677
Well, that fight you had at the bar
didn't help anything.

09:49.803 --> 09:52.388
- He knows about the bar fight?
- Of course he knows.

09:52.514 --> 09:55.474
A narcotics officer got suspended
because of that bar fight.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.978
No. A narcotics officer got suspended
because of you.

09:59.771 --> 10:01.563
- Me?
- You ran to IAD.

10:01.690 --> 10:03.315
You cooked up the sting.

10:03.441 --> 10:05.484
You basically got Stan Liddy fired.

10:05.610 --> 10:08.070
And got all the charges
against you dropped.

10:08.196 --> 10:09.363
I didn't ask for any of that.

10:09.489 --> 10:11.865
I could have handled whatever
IAD had coming my way.

10:11.992 --> 10:14.702
- Oh, so anything that happens is fine?
- When it happens to me, yes.

10:14.828 --> 10:16.287
I can take care of myself.

10:16.413 --> 10:18.539
But now we're married,
whatever happens to me, happens to you.

10:18.665 --> 10:20.624
That's right. That's exactly right.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.751
- We're married.
- Well, here's what's bothering me.

10:22.877 --> 10:25.754
You weren't looking out for me
out of some sense of compassion.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.798
You were taking care of yourself.

10:27.924 --> 10:30.718
God forbid your name
should lose some of its shine.

10:34.097 --> 10:36.015
- Get out of my office.
- Mm-hm.

11:01.916 --> 11:04.209
- Hey.
- I thought you might want a debriefing

11:04.336 --> 11:06.128
before we hit Club Mayan.

11:06.254 --> 11:08.922
Um, sort of... not a good time.

11:11.134 --> 11:13.135
Where's Quinn,
and what have you done with him?

11:13.261 --> 11:15.554
I know, I know. Uh...

11:15.680 --> 11:16.847
Just give me an hour.

11:18.767 --> 11:20.601
- An hour.
- Yeah.

11:21.686 --> 11:23.812
Who's naked
in your apartment?

11:23.938 --> 11:25.481
No one is naked.

11:25.607 --> 11:27.232
Then what?

11:27.984 --> 11:30.361
- I'm such a fucking idiot.
- Debra, wait.

11:30.487 --> 11:33.072
Come here.
Debra, come here.

11:35.950 --> 11:38.577
Debra Morgan,
this is Stan Liddy.

11:38.703 --> 11:43.332
Liddy had a run-in with IAD
and, uh, got suspended.

11:43.958 --> 11:47.544
We're prepping him
for his union-rep meeting tomorrow.

11:47.670 --> 11:48.796
Sorry.

11:48.922 --> 11:51.715
All clothes are staying on.

11:52.592 --> 11:54.301
- I'll just...
- Meet me there?

11:54.427 --> 11:55.969
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

12:00.558 --> 12:03.310
You are boning
our target's sister?

12:04.604 --> 12:06.980
Just tell me what you found out
on Dexter Morgan.

12:08.108 --> 12:09.149
Well...

12:10.068 --> 12:12.152
your boy's squeaky clean on paper.

12:12.278 --> 12:14.446
He's only been out
of the country once, to Paris.

12:14.572 --> 12:18.617
Pays his bills on time,
keeps to himself.

12:18.743 --> 12:21.870
I'll tell you, it's all too neat
and a little too phoney.

12:22.455 --> 12:25.457
You see drug dealers
with the very same profiles all the time.

12:25.583 --> 12:28.043
Ah. That's exactly
what I'm thinking.

12:28.169 --> 12:29.670
I mean, what's he hiding?

12:31.423 --> 12:32.339
Peekaboo.

12:37.554 --> 12:39.805
"Bye-bye, Daddy."
Peekaboo!

12:42.016 --> 12:43.809
Oh, thank you.

12:44.561 --> 12:46.478
You're really very good with him.

12:46.604 --> 12:48.522
I wish I didn't have
to work tonight.

12:48.648 --> 12:50.899
The lab fell so far behind
while I was out.

12:51.025 --> 12:53.527
Night's the only time I can ever
get anything done.

12:53.653 --> 12:56.905
Well, I hope the lieutenant
appreciates your dedication.

12:57.574 --> 12:59.324
I'm pretty sure she does.

12:59.451 --> 13:02.327
Although tonight
will be dedicated to Lance.

13:04.998 --> 13:07.416
So, you think about midnight, then?

13:07.542 --> 13:09.126
I'll try to make it sooner.

13:09.252 --> 13:11.128
Can you say,
"Bye-bye, Daddy"?

13:12.338 --> 13:14.256
Die-die.

13:14.382 --> 13:15.466
Did you hear that?

13:16.634 --> 13:20.220
- He said, "Die-die."
- Don't be silly. He said, "Bye-bye."

13:20.346 --> 13:22.097
Harrison's first word.

13:22.223 --> 13:23.849
There's a good boy.

13:23.975 --> 13:25.809
I hope so.

13:27.312 --> 13:29.229
Die-die.

13:29.355 --> 13:31.648
From the mouth of babes.

13:37.697 --> 13:42.284
I rented an RV, placed an ad online
saying I was cruising down to The Keys,

13:42.410 --> 13:44.077
and just like that...

13:45.330 --> 13:47.581
my victim came to me.

13:49.501 --> 13:52.503
You must be
ten inches of pure steel.

13:53.379 --> 13:54.379
You betcha.

14:02.347 --> 14:06.016
Compartmentalisation began
as an architectural theory -

14:06.142 --> 14:09.144
divide buildings into sections
which can be closed off

14:09.270 --> 14:11.813
to prevent a fire
from spreading.

14:11.940 --> 14:15.692
Life can also be divided
into closed-off sections.

14:15.818 --> 14:18.445
Makes everything much simpler.

14:25.662 --> 14:27.246
Lumen Pierce.

14:35.171 --> 14:36.338
Again?

14:42.095 --> 14:44.596
This is the life
Harry wanted for me...

14:45.848 --> 14:47.724
carefully divided.

14:48.142 --> 14:50.102
Shh!

14:59.696 --> 15:01.280
What the hell?

15:05.159 --> 15:06.702
Dexter!

15:06.828 --> 15:07.995
I...

15:08.121 --> 15:09.705
I shot one of them.

15:11.332 --> 15:12.541
I killed him.

15:12.667 --> 15:16.420
I'm at the marina...
Bayshore, Biscayne or something?

15:17.505 --> 15:20.090
- You're in Miami?
- I never left.

15:22.510 --> 15:24.803
Oh, there's so much blood.

15:24.929 --> 15:26.388
What do I do?

15:28.349 --> 15:30.517
Hello? Hello?

15:30.643 --> 15:32.477
Dexter, don't hang up on me!

15:33.146 --> 15:34.771
Please, help me.

15:37.442 --> 15:39.443
Don't move.
Don't do anything.

15:56.294 --> 16:01.715
The M-99 will wear off in a few short hours.
Not much time to contain the situation...

16:02.925 --> 16:04.760
Not much time...

16:04.886 --> 16:06.928
to protect my simple life.

16:19.233 --> 16:22.110
First, for good luck...
let me see your neck.

16:36.626 --> 16:38.043
I fucking love my job.

16:38.169 --> 16:40.962
Look, I'm gonna go take a lap
through the VIP.

16:44.258 --> 16:46.635
- She's cute.
- Yeah, she's all right.

16:46.761 --> 16:48.220
I could do you both.

16:53.226 --> 16:55.143
That's the sixth girl
that's hit on him.

16:57.188 --> 16:58.897
Let's focus on camera three.

16:59.023 --> 17:01.942
That guy, is he hooked up
with the Fuentes brothers?

17:02.068 --> 17:05.195
Hey, I'm gonna stay on Quinn.
He may need some backup.

17:05.321 --> 17:07.656
He is supposed to be focusing
on the Fuentes brothers.

17:07.782 --> 17:09.866
He's not supposed to be playing
with her fun bags.

17:11.577 --> 17:13.078
Sounds like someone's jealous.

17:13.204 --> 17:15.497
Why on God's green earth
would I be jealous?

17:18.876 --> 17:20.502
Quinn's a good guy.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.212
I'm not interested.

17:22.338 --> 17:27.175
Out there on the dance floor,
shaking his tail feathers.

17:27.301 --> 17:28.218
Really not interested.

17:28.344 --> 17:31.513
Stay single as long as you can.

17:31.639 --> 17:33.515
- Says the newlywed.
- Don't remind me.

17:33.641 --> 17:37.310
You've been married for five minutes.
What happened to the honeymoon phase?

17:37.437 --> 17:39.312
I blinked.

18:02.044 --> 18:04.379
Show me where he is.

18:07.133 --> 18:10.343
There was so much blood,
I had... I had to walk away.

18:13.097 --> 18:15.140
The body's in here.

18:16.726 --> 18:18.894
- Anybody see you?
- I don't think so.

18:19.020 --> 18:21.021
- Oh, God, I hope not.
- You killed somebody.

18:21.147 --> 18:23.774
- Because you wouldn't do it for me!
- But you call me to clean up after you.

18:23.900 --> 18:26.818
- I didn't know what to do with the body!
- I don't believe this.

18:26.944 --> 18:29.738
- Just go if you want to go.
- Go? I'm responsible for you.

18:29.864 --> 18:31.490
Everything you do
leads right back to me.

18:31.616 --> 18:34.117
I didn't think it would be
so hard to kill someone.

18:38.998 --> 18:40.540
- Where is he?
- Here.

18:44.295 --> 18:45.504
Oh, shit!

18:45.630 --> 18:48.507
- He was right here.
- Are you sure?

18:49.383 --> 18:51.343
- He was dead.
- Apparently not.

18:51.469 --> 18:52.719
Don't get mad at me.

18:52.845 --> 18:54.888
This isn't how I was planning
to spend my evening.

18:55.014 --> 18:56.765
- Me neither.
- Would you do me a favour?

18:56.891 --> 18:58.433
- What?
- Stop talking.

18:59.644 --> 19:02.562
He's lost a lot of blood,
at least a pint.

19:05.483 --> 19:07.234
One...

19:07.360 --> 19:08.401
two.

19:11.697 --> 19:12.697
Three...

19:12.824 --> 19:13.907
four.

19:14.867 --> 19:16.785
You're a terrible shot,
but you never shot a gun before.

19:16.911 --> 19:18.787
You didn't anticipate
the kickback...

19:18.913 --> 19:22.165
One of the many things you didn't anticipate.
Give me the gun.

19:26.212 --> 19:28.463
You must have hit him once.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.633
Where was the point of impact?

19:31.759 --> 19:34.386
Where were you standing?

19:37.348 --> 19:38.890
He was standing here.

19:39.016 --> 19:42.143
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
I go down, you run away.

19:42.270 --> 19:44.354
I get back up, and where do I go?

19:48.025 --> 19:49.317
Here.

19:53.322 --> 19:54.447
Come on!

20:01.497 --> 20:02.873
How'd you even find this guy?

20:06.294 --> 20:08.044
You can talk now.

20:08.170 --> 20:11.006
The night that I was taken,
I had gone to a bar.

20:11.132 --> 20:12.757
I thought that
they spotted me there,

20:12.884 --> 20:14.801
so I went back to that same bar
night after night,

20:14.927 --> 20:17.220
hoping that one of them
would walk through the door.

20:17.346 --> 20:19.973
- I wore a disguise.
- Disguise?

20:20.099 --> 20:21.808
A wig, so they wouldn't recognise me.

20:21.934 --> 20:23.518
I know what a disguise is for.

20:23.644 --> 20:27.230
So, you went to the bar,
you waited for one of them to show up.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.857
Where? What bar?

20:28.983 --> 20:31.067
Hurricane 26.

20:32.403 --> 20:34.446
Hurricane 26 is all the way over
on Ocean Avenue.

20:34.572 --> 20:36.823
How'd you get all the way out here?

20:36.949 --> 20:38.575
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

20:38.701 --> 20:40.285
So, go on.

20:40.411 --> 20:42.037
Tonight one of them showed up.

20:42.163 --> 20:44.456
He didn't know it was me,
so I... I flirted with him.

20:44.582 --> 20:46.750
I asked him if he wanted
to go someplace else.

20:46.876 --> 20:50.462
We got in the car, I pulled out my gun,
and I forced him to drive.

20:50.588 --> 20:52.797
This place seemed deserted,
so we stopped,

20:52.924 --> 20:54.883
- and I marched him inside.
- And you shot him.

20:55.009 --> 20:57.719
No. I asked him for the names
of the other men.

20:57.845 --> 21:00.513
He called me a cunt.
Then I shot him.

21:01.474 --> 21:03.475
How'd you know
he was one of them?

21:03.601 --> 21:06.144
I just... I just knew.

21:06.270 --> 21:08.271
You recognise his face?

21:08.397 --> 21:10.690
No. They kept me blindfolded
most of the time.

21:13.152 --> 21:14.069
So how?

21:14.195 --> 21:16.446
I felt it the minute
he walked in the door.

21:16.572 --> 21:18.782
One of the guys
had this smell like...

21:19.617 --> 21:22.160
old sweat or,
I don't know, chlorine.

21:22.870 --> 21:26.456
When I got in the car with this guy,
there it was, the exact same stench.

21:26.582 --> 21:29.000
You shot someone
based on a feeling and an odour.

21:29.585 --> 21:30.919
I shot the right guy.

21:31.045 --> 21:33.880
You were willing to shoot the wrong guy
under Tuttle Bridge.

21:34.006 --> 21:35.757
This guy was one of them.

21:36.550 --> 21:39.719
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

21:39.845 --> 21:41.972
Did you check his wallet?

21:42.098 --> 21:44.891
- No.
- Did you take his cell phone?

21:45.017 --> 21:46.977
He could have already called
the police, you know.

21:47.103 --> 21:49.187
- I'm new to this!
- You don't even know who you shot!

21:49.313 --> 21:50.772
I shot one of the creeps
who raped me.

21:50.898 --> 21:52.899
- You don't have any proof.
- I'm the proof!

21:53.025 --> 21:55.318
My memory! My experience!

21:55.945 --> 21:58.655
- Hardly the most reliable tools.
- Fuck you!

21:59.699 --> 22:01.908
Fuck me?

22:03.285 --> 22:05.245
Wow.

22:05.371 --> 22:06.496
Just go.

22:07.581 --> 22:09.874
I can find him on my own
and kill him.

22:10.001 --> 22:11.668
Like you killed him
the first time?

22:13.671 --> 22:17.632
I have no idea which direction he went,
if he turned right or...

22:23.305 --> 22:25.015
Blood swipe.

22:25.141 --> 22:27.434
He stopped here to catch his breath,

22:27.560 --> 22:29.978
leaned against the post,
put his hand here.

22:30.104 --> 22:33.857
The directionality of the blood
leads which way?

22:35.943 --> 22:37.318
This way.

22:38.571 --> 22:40.447
You sure know a lot about blood.

22:43.659 --> 22:45.118
So, hypothetically,

22:45.244 --> 22:47.871
an office romance is just
the worst idea ever.

22:47.997 --> 22:49.956
Yeah, I would advise against it.

22:50.082 --> 22:52.042
But, hypothetically...

22:53.502 --> 22:55.545
I can see how you and Quinn
make a lot of sense.

22:56.839 --> 22:59.507
So you would advise against it,
but it would make a lot of sense?

22:59.633 --> 23:02.093
What can I say?
I'm a romantic at heart.

23:02.219 --> 23:04.512
Then why don't you patch stuff up
with your wife?

23:04.638 --> 23:06.514
- It's not that simple.
- It is that simple.

23:06.640 --> 23:10.852
Get your head out of your ass,
and do something nice for her.

23:10.978 --> 23:13.396
Buy her a card, some flowers.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.982
- Get her a puppy.
- A puppy?

23:20.404 --> 23:22.155
Batista.

23:22.281 --> 23:23.490
Where?

23:25.659 --> 23:27.368
Baywater Marina,

23:27.495 --> 23:30.163
Warehouse 12.
I'll be right there.

23:30.289 --> 23:32.499
- Possible homicide.
- I'll get it.

23:32.625 --> 23:34.125
No, I'll go.
This is your baby.

23:34.251 --> 23:35.794
We've been on this for weeks,

23:35.920 --> 23:37.670
and had nothing but our asses
handed to us,

23:37.797 --> 23:40.215
and if for some reason
the Fuentes brothers show up tonight,

23:40.341 --> 23:42.926
then they've already seen my face,
so I'm useless.

23:43.052 --> 23:45.887
And you won't have to see
Quinn hitting on other women.

23:46.847 --> 23:49.349
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah. Good luck.

23:49.475 --> 23:50.725
Yeah, you too.

24:00.319 --> 24:03.113
Mmm. Who are you?

24:07.034 --> 24:09.869
No dial tone.
He didn't call anybody.

24:09.995 --> 24:12.747
Who even uses
a pay phone any more?

24:12.873 --> 24:15.875
People who don't have cell phones.
We caught a break.

24:16.001 --> 24:17.710
But he could have gone anywhere.

24:26.554 --> 24:28.221
What are you doing?

24:28.347 --> 24:31.141
- It's luminol.
- Luminol?

24:31.267 --> 24:33.226
No relation.

24:34.145 --> 24:36.980
The hydrogen peroxide
and sodium hydroxide

24:37.106 --> 24:39.023
react with the iron
present in haemoglobin,

24:39.150 --> 24:40.608
and exhibit a...

24:41.902 --> 24:43.736
blue glow. See?

24:43.863 --> 24:45.947
Why do you have that
in your purse?

24:46.073 --> 24:47.323
It's not a purse.

24:47.449 --> 24:49.242
And I use this almost every day.

24:54.707 --> 24:56.499
- What is it?
- Crime Scene.

24:58.210 --> 24:59.502
"Crime Scene"?

25:01.046 --> 25:02.589
Are you...

25:02.715 --> 25:04.340
a police officer?

25:04.466 --> 25:07.719
"Baywater Marina, Warehouse 12."
Isn't that...

25:12.725 --> 25:14.017
here?

25:18.272 --> 25:20.064
Shit. Somebody did see you.

25:20.191 --> 25:22.692
- Oh, fuck!
- No, we still have time.

25:22.818 --> 25:25.195
Patrol can't move until Homicide
arrives on the scene.

25:25.321 --> 25:27.572
That's at least 15 minutes from now.

25:27.698 --> 25:29.282
How long have you been a cop?

25:29.408 --> 25:31.743
- I'm not a cop.
- Well, what are you?

25:32.870 --> 25:34.078
Complicated.

25:40.169 --> 25:42.503
This way. Hurry up.

25:50.471 --> 25:54.224
Running pumps the heart faster,
and more blood is spilled.

26:01.815 --> 26:04.651
Look here, how the drops are pooling,

26:04.777 --> 26:07.070
getting closer together.

26:07.196 --> 26:09.113
- He's slowing down?
- Yeah.

26:10.532 --> 26:11.824
This way.

26:24.088 --> 26:26.381
This started out
as an ordinary day.

26:26.507 --> 26:28.675
In one second, everything changed.

26:30.261 --> 26:31.719
Lumen happened.

26:32.471 --> 26:35.556
Why are you here in Miami?
You were getting on a plane to Minneapolis.

26:35.683 --> 26:38.685
I tried to get on that plane.
I couldn't.

26:38.811 --> 26:40.270
I had to stay.

26:41.146 --> 26:44.649
The guy I shot tonight,
he would take these three fingers...

26:44.775 --> 26:47.277
- You don't have to tell...
and shove them in my mouth!

26:48.070 --> 26:50.113
It tasted like metal.

26:51.073 --> 26:53.700
He would keep them there
so I couldn't scream.

26:55.703 --> 26:58.079
The other guys would just stuff
a dirty rag in my mouth,

26:58.205 --> 26:59.664
but not this guy.

26:59.790 --> 27:01.958
He liked to hold me down himself.

27:05.129 --> 27:06.713
I saw everything.

27:10.926 --> 27:12.885
How? You were blindfolded.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.103
Is this your monster?

27:42.833 --> 27:45.126
Pardon me,
but I couldn't help noticing

27:45.252 --> 27:47.503
that you've been hanging out
with a fool.

27:47.629 --> 27:48.755
Hmm.

27:48.881 --> 27:53.634
- How do you know?
- Cos whoever stood you up... es un idiota.

27:54.678 --> 27:55.720
I'm Angel.

27:57.598 --> 27:59.807
- Yasmin.
- My favourite flower.

27:59.933 --> 28:01.100
Ooh.

28:01.226 --> 28:03.102
- No? OK.
- Mm-mm.

28:07.733 --> 28:10.234
Do you want to get
out of here, Yasminita?

28:18.077 --> 28:19.702
Yeah.

28:25.250 --> 28:27.960
It hurts! Oh, my God!

28:28.087 --> 28:29.962
Calm down.

28:30.089 --> 28:31.714
God... OK.

28:33.550 --> 28:36.177
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna inspect your wounds.

28:40.057 --> 28:43.351
Yeah, one gunshot wound
penetrated the abdominal cavity.

28:45.145 --> 28:46.813
Oh, God.

28:46.939 --> 28:49.107
- You can't let me die.
- Come over here and hold this.

28:49.233 --> 28:50.525
You're gonna save him?

28:50.651 --> 28:52.360
I don't know who this man is.

28:52.486 --> 28:54.821
My name's Dan. Dan Mendell.

28:55.823 --> 28:57.782
This woman right here, she shot me.

28:57.908 --> 29:00.868
- I have no idea why.
- You know exactly what you did to me!

29:00.994 --> 29:02.912
I've never seen this woman
before in my life.

29:03.038 --> 29:05.206
- You're a fucking liar!
- You're fucking crazy!

29:06.792 --> 29:09.752
Look, you can't let me die.
I got a wife.

29:10.379 --> 29:13.798
I got a daughter.
Please. Just look.

29:13.924 --> 29:16.634
"Dan Mendell, DDS."
Kids' dentist.

29:16.760 --> 29:19.345
- He's a rapist.
- I never did anything to you.

29:19.471 --> 29:21.806
We met in a bar,
but she came on to me.

29:21.932 --> 29:24.267
And then we get in the car,
she pulls a gun on me.

29:24.393 --> 29:26.727
- You panicked.
- Because you were gonna shoot me.

29:26.854 --> 29:30.064
- No, because you recognised me.
- I've never seen you before in my life.

29:30.190 --> 29:33.443
- You know exactly who I am!
- She's crazy.

29:33.569 --> 29:36.028
We got a mental situation
going on here.

29:36.613 --> 29:38.406
- You, in the corner.
- You believe him?

29:38.532 --> 29:40.783
She needs help. This woman needs help.

29:40.909 --> 29:42.368
You're a piece of shit.
Full of shit!

29:42.494 --> 29:43.828
Over there.

29:45.706 --> 29:48.166
I have to take this call.
Stay there till I get back.

29:48.292 --> 29:49.834
Don't leave me alone with her!

29:49.960 --> 29:51.961
Do not move from this spot.

29:54.047 --> 29:55.339
Help!

29:58.051 --> 29:59.886
Everything OK?

30:00.012 --> 30:01.804
Die-die.

30:01.930 --> 30:03.681
Hi-hi, Harrison.

30:03.807 --> 30:06.517
I know you're working, but I thought
you might want to take a break.

30:06.643 --> 30:09.312
- It's wild hearing him talk.
- Isn't it?

30:09.438 --> 30:11.355
I put him down,
and he was up two hours later

30:11.482 --> 30:13.983
talking up a storm, weren't you?

30:14.902 --> 30:17.737
♪ Flies in the buttermilk,
shoo, fly, shoo... ♪

30:17.863 --> 30:19.447
Here, let me get you
on the speaker,

30:19.573 --> 30:21.532
and you can sing to him too.

30:21.658 --> 30:25.203
♪ Lost my partner, what'll I do? ♪

30:25.329 --> 30:26.871
Dexter.

30:26.997 --> 30:33.461
♪ Lost my partner, what'll I do?

30:33.587 --> 30:37.131
♪ Skip to the lou, my darling ♪

30:37.591 --> 30:38.883
Well, I don't want to keep you.

30:39.009 --> 30:40.760
I'm afraid to ask, but...

30:40.886 --> 30:42.887
You want me to stay
a few more hours?

30:43.013 --> 30:46.307
I'll be home as soon as I can.
There's no place I'd rather be right now.

30:47.392 --> 30:48.434
Die-die.

30:49.645 --> 30:51.854
Die-die. I love you.

30:57.319 --> 30:59.111
- Who are they?
- Get off of me!

30:59.238 --> 31:01.656
- What are their names?
- I don't know what you're talking...

31:03.033 --> 31:05.076
Huh?

31:06.119 --> 31:09.163
He's a fucking liar!
He knows who they are!

31:10.040 --> 31:12.124
Who are they?

31:12.251 --> 31:15.836
- What are their names?
- You are ruining my life!

31:17.381 --> 31:19.131
They ruined mine.

31:24.221 --> 31:26.973
If we don't get help,
Dan the Dentist is going to expire.

31:27.099 --> 31:30.393
I don't care.
It's what he deserves.

31:30.519 --> 31:34.605
It's what they all deserve.

31:34.731 --> 31:36.607
They should all get...

31:36.733 --> 31:38.276
He's saying something.
He's talking to someone.

31:38.402 --> 31:40.486
She fucking shot me.

31:40.612 --> 31:41.946
My phone.

31:42.072 --> 31:43.906
Can you hear me?

31:44.032 --> 31:45.700
She shot me.

31:47.911 --> 31:50.830
She's alive. You hear me?

31:53.000 --> 31:56.586
That last fucking bitch is alive.

32:15.397 --> 32:16.939
They're gonna find you...

32:18.650 --> 32:19.775
you...

32:20.360 --> 32:22.236
cunt.

32:23.989 --> 32:26.157
Die-die.

32:35.626 --> 32:39.629
Lumen didn't witness her mother's murder,
but she was born in blood.

32:41.173 --> 32:42.673
Like me.

32:43.717 --> 32:47.595
Some experiences are so big
they change your DNA.

32:47.721 --> 32:49.138
What now?

32:51.433 --> 32:54.602
We clean up.
Homicide will be on us soon.

32:57.230 --> 33:00.191
Hose this area down. Make sure everything
flows through the grate.

33:03.403 --> 33:05.696
Where are you going?

33:05.822 --> 33:08.908
To get my car.
We have to move this body.

33:15.916 --> 33:17.333
About time.

33:19.169 --> 33:20.503
Come on.

33:23.799 --> 33:26.759
A hooker called in some gunshots,
but didn't actually see the shooter.

33:26.885 --> 33:29.970
- Where's the body?
- Well, haven't found it yet.

33:30.097 --> 33:31.889
Then what are we doing here?

33:32.974 --> 33:33.974
Hey.

33:37.062 --> 33:38.479
Blood.

33:42.317 --> 33:43.818
Bullet holes.

33:43.944 --> 33:46.153
Lots of blood.
A significant amount of blood.

33:46.279 --> 33:49.532
Definitely some sort
of homicidal situation here.

33:49.658 --> 33:53.452
A homicidal situation requires a body.
Why don't we let the EMTs handle it?

33:53.578 --> 33:56.372
Your average person won't survive
this amount of blood loss.

34:01.503 --> 34:03.087
There.

34:03.213 --> 34:04.672
That blood trail there. See it?

34:04.798 --> 34:06.882
Good chance that trail
ends at a dead body.

34:07.008 --> 34:09.260
- Dexter's en route, but...
- I get it. We can't wait.

34:09.386 --> 34:12.805
Will you two guys follow us in,
in case this bleeder's alive?

34:45.505 --> 34:47.381
Whoa.

34:50.135 --> 34:51.927
This dude is a half-litre from dead.

34:54.389 --> 34:56.766
- Yeah?
- Hey, fuckwad, taking the scenic route?

34:56.892 --> 34:59.685
Sorry. I was with Harrison.

34:59.811 --> 35:03.230
He said his first words...
"Bye-bye."

35:03.356 --> 35:05.941
- Yeah? That's sweet.
- Yeah, it was.

35:06.067 --> 35:07.943
I remember your first words...

35:08.069 --> 35:09.195
"Shoes."

35:09.321 --> 35:11.572
You were very girly,
once upon a time.

35:12.532 --> 35:14.784
That's funny, cos I always
remember my first words as being

35:14.910 --> 35:17.244
- "Hurry the fuck up."
- Almost there.

35:17.370 --> 35:21.415
Masuka and I tracked this dude's blood
to a pay phone inside a warehouse.

35:21.541 --> 35:23.292
- You did?
- I think this way.

35:23.418 --> 35:24.752
Yeah. We're gonna keep going.

35:24.878 --> 35:26.962
- So find us.
- Will do.

35:38.850 --> 35:40.392
You changed your clothes.

35:41.186 --> 35:43.771
- Here. This is all I have.
- Thanks.

35:43.897 --> 35:45.815
The police are close.
You have to get out of here.

35:45.941 --> 35:49.693
Go to this address.
3319, Meadow Lane.

35:49.820 --> 35:51.737
It's near Kendall.
Say it back to me.

35:51.863 --> 35:54.281
3319, Meadow Lane,
near Kendall.

35:54.407 --> 35:58.661
This'll get you in the front door.
Run six, seven blocks. Catch a cab.

35:58.787 --> 36:01.497
Get cleaned up and wait for me.
I have it from here.

36:01.623 --> 36:03.916
- You want me to go now?
- Yes.

36:04.626 --> 36:06.418
No, I'm not leaving you.

36:06.545 --> 36:08.754
Yes, you are.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.715
I can help you move the body.

36:18.306 --> 36:19.640
Who the hell is that?

36:19.766 --> 36:22.560
Go, now. Go!

36:25.480 --> 36:27.940
Compartmentalisation is a joke.

36:28.567 --> 36:30.568
Fires rip through buildings
all the time

36:30.694 --> 36:33.237
no matter how closed off
parts of them are.

36:34.155 --> 36:35.656
Life is the same way.

36:37.492 --> 36:39.118
It cannot be contained.

37:19.576 --> 37:22.786
Fuck. Maybe we should
double back the way we came.

37:31.296 --> 37:32.463
Is that?

37:34.174 --> 37:36.008
Dexter's car.

37:42.265 --> 37:43.515
Dexter.

37:44.392 --> 37:46.727
You will not believe what I found.

37:55.612 --> 37:58.614
What in the mother of fuck
went on in here?

37:59.199 --> 38:01.158
I know exactly what happened.

38:01.284 --> 38:05.287
Two words...
autoerotic mummification.

38:06.957 --> 38:09.500
See, Mr Plastic Man...

38:09.626 --> 38:12.419
shot Captain Bloody Underpants,

38:12.545 --> 38:14.505
while Underpants
was in the choke.

38:15.256 --> 38:18.509
Mr Plastic Man has hammocks
between Underpants' man chop...

38:18.635 --> 38:20.928
Thanks to Masuka's keen expertise,

38:21.054 --> 38:23.305
Debra will be able
to close this case.

38:23.431 --> 38:26.517
Evidence will go into
a banker's box and be filed away,

38:26.643 --> 38:30.562
eventually transferred
to a storage facility in Bradenton,

38:30.689 --> 38:32.231
and that is where it will stay,

38:32.357 --> 38:34.400
locked away forever in the dark.

38:39.447 --> 38:41.573
If only everything
were that simple.

38:43.159 --> 38:44.660
Thank you for the visual.

38:45.662 --> 38:49.415
Asphyxiation heightens the high,
but it's not without its risks.

38:51.251 --> 38:54.253
By the way, I wouldn't touch
the nozzle of that hose.

38:58.091 --> 39:00.092
Anything to add?

39:00.218 --> 39:02.803
The blood is consistent
with Masuka's theory.

39:03.888 --> 39:06.432
If there's any follow-up,
I'd be happy to do it.

39:07.183 --> 39:08.600
We're good here?

39:08.727 --> 39:12.146
- You just landed.
- I have to relieve Sonya.

39:12.272 --> 39:13.939
Yeah, we're good. Drive safe.

39:18.486 --> 39:20.696
What a night.

39:23.992 --> 39:25.617
You sure you want to do this?

39:26.703 --> 39:28.120
I'm here, aren't I?

39:32.167 --> 39:33.500
Angel?

39:35.795 --> 39:38.589
This is Yasmin Aragon.

39:39.758 --> 39:41.133
What is she doing on my couch?

39:41.259 --> 39:44.636
Miss Aragon is friends
with Los Hermanos Fuentes.

39:47.265 --> 39:51.143
She also has a boatload
of drug charges against her.

39:52.270 --> 39:53.937
Seems like a trade is in order.

39:56.232 --> 39:58.901
So are we gonna do this or not?

40:02.197 --> 40:03.572
Give us a minute.

40:06.659 --> 40:08.077
Excuse me.

40:18.379 --> 40:22.216
I saw that she was wearing
a Santa Muerte necklace,

40:22.342 --> 40:24.051
so I introduced myself.

40:25.470 --> 40:27.471
If we agree to drop
her drug charges,

40:27.597 --> 40:30.265
she thinks she can get
the Fuentes brothers in the club.

40:30.391 --> 40:31.975
That is...

40:33.103 --> 40:35.687
if you're willing to give us
another chance.

40:37.398 --> 40:41.443
I'm... sorry about everything.

40:41.569 --> 40:44.154
About losing my temper,
about what I said earlier.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.531
You were right.

40:46.491 --> 40:48.492
Say that again?

40:49.702 --> 40:52.204
- You were right.
- I like the sound of that.

40:52.330 --> 40:55.707
I did go to IAD because I didn't want
my husband disciplined.

40:56.584 --> 40:58.710
I really like being married to you, Angel.

40:58.837 --> 41:00.045
And I you.

41:00.171 --> 41:01.839
It's something I never thought
would happen to me

41:01.965 --> 41:04.591
because I've been so busy
making a name for myself,

41:04.717 --> 41:06.718
and now I'm this close
to making captain.

41:06.845 --> 41:08.804
And I would never
do anything to stop you.

41:08.930 --> 41:10.931
Not on purpose, I know.

41:11.641 --> 41:13.433
But get a stink on you...

41:14.644 --> 41:17.354
- and I start to stink too.
- We'll stock up on deodorant.

41:21.484 --> 41:23.443
Nice job bringing in the girl.

41:23.570 --> 41:24.778
Yeah.

41:27.323 --> 41:28.740
Better than a puppy?

41:30.577 --> 41:32.286
I'll see you back at home.

41:46.134 --> 41:47.426
Hello?

42:02.275 --> 42:04.484
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:04.611 --> 42:06.195
Last one.

42:06.321 --> 42:07.654
Sorry.

42:08.990 --> 42:10.449
You got glitter on your face.

42:10.992 --> 42:11.909
Yeah...

42:12.035 --> 42:13.577
hazard of the job.

42:14.871 --> 42:16.580
I'm not sure it's in the job description

42:16.706 --> 42:18.957
that you have to put your face
in Boobie McGee's tits.

42:19.083 --> 42:22.294
Well, you know, the first rule
of working undercover is to blend in.

42:22.879 --> 42:24.421
You disappeared.

42:25.173 --> 42:27.799
- I did, didn't I?
- It's not funny.

42:29.969 --> 42:32.804
Fuck. I...

42:35.808 --> 42:37.559
I have feelings for you.

42:39.395 --> 42:41.313
- You do?
- I tried not to.

42:44.609 --> 42:46.860
I like you too.

42:46.986 --> 42:48.028
Uh...

42:48.154 --> 42:51.240
More than "like".

42:51.366 --> 42:53.575
- You do?
- Yeah.

42:54.577 --> 42:57.246
I mean, you're the one
who keeps putting the brakes on.

42:58.039 --> 42:59.915
Well, what if I don't want
to do that any more?

43:00.041 --> 43:01.750
That'd make me very happy.

43:06.256 --> 43:07.965
If this is gonna end badly...

43:10.218 --> 43:12.469
will you please just tell me now?

43:14.722 --> 43:18.267
Morgan, I just said I want to be with you.

43:18.393 --> 43:20.394
I mean, what more do you want?

43:22.480 --> 43:25.148
Well, I mean,
sometimes you mumble,

43:25.275 --> 43:27.651
and it's kind of hard
to understand you.

43:27.777 --> 43:29.319
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:29.862 --> 43:31.363
How's this?

43:44.961 --> 43:48.046
I tried to send this woman
1,500 miles away,

43:48.172 --> 43:52.050
and she boomeranged
back into the house I shared with Rita.

43:52.176 --> 43:53.719
Lumen?

43:53.845 --> 43:56.888
So much for keeping
the different parts of my life separate.

44:18.286 --> 44:20.162
Sorry, I'll just be in here.

44:29.589 --> 44:31.965
There are towels...
somewhere.

44:32.884 --> 44:34.426
I found some in a box.

44:37.472 --> 44:41.933
I also found this robe.
Is it OK if I borrow it?

44:42.060 --> 44:43.393
Sure.

44:47.273 --> 44:50.150
The tub's not draining.

44:51.944 --> 44:53.945
Sometimes the thingy gets stuck.

45:04.290 --> 45:07.084
Are you OK?
Do you need to sit down?

45:11.631 --> 45:13.131
Yeah, for a minute.

45:19.639 --> 45:21.306
I know you.

45:21.432 --> 45:23.100
What you are...

45:23.226 --> 45:24.976
deep down.

45:25.103 --> 45:30.065
Aside from your police job,
and your... extracurricular activities.

45:32.235 --> 45:33.735
You're a father.

45:35.530 --> 45:37.823
I saw the pictures out there.

45:37.949 --> 45:39.950
Three children?

45:42.995 --> 45:46.164
The two oldest
are with their grandparents -

45:46.290 --> 45:48.041
their dad's mom and dad.

45:50.711 --> 45:52.129
You have a son?

45:53.131 --> 45:54.381
Harrison.

45:57.301 --> 45:59.344
He just started talking.

45:59.470 --> 46:00.720
Today.

46:05.226 --> 46:06.685
He's tremendous.

46:10.857 --> 46:11.857
It's...

46:13.609 --> 46:15.360
just the two of you?

46:17.155 --> 46:20.449
And an Irish superhero nanny.

46:27.290 --> 46:29.541
Never thought my life
would turn out like this.

46:35.882 --> 46:37.674
I had imagined...

46:37.800 --> 46:40.093
a totally different life
for myself too.

46:41.429 --> 46:43.638
I always did everything
by the book, you know?

46:43.764 --> 46:45.557
Go, go, go.

46:45.683 --> 46:47.684
Never stopped to think.

46:48.853 --> 46:52.522
There was high school,
and college, and graduate school...

46:53.441 --> 46:54.733
Owen.

46:58.112 --> 46:59.863
We were gonna get married at...

46:59.989 --> 47:02.199
the house that I grew up in.

47:03.284 --> 47:07.078
On my wedding day,
I... I tried on the dress,

47:07.205 --> 47:11.249
and I looked out the window
at the backyard where the aisle was, and...

47:12.084 --> 47:14.544
I saw everything
that that aisle was leading to.

47:16.797 --> 47:18.048
Babies and...

47:19.050 --> 47:20.550
matching dinnerware...

47:22.094 --> 47:23.845
Sunday barbecues.

47:26.265 --> 47:28.433
And I couldn't breathe.

47:29.644 --> 47:31.436
I had to get out of there and...

47:32.230 --> 47:33.855
find something...

47:36.651 --> 47:37.859
more.

47:46.494 --> 47:49.037
Then everything happened, and...

47:51.332 --> 47:53.375
I actually thought,

47:53.501 --> 47:55.752
"This is what I get...

47:55.878 --> 47:57.754
"for trying to...

47:59.507 --> 48:01.091
"live my own life."

48:03.719 --> 48:06.304
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

48:08.849 --> 48:10.308
A little.

48:14.605 --> 48:17.607
But tonight I felt this, like...

48:18.776 --> 48:19.818
this...

48:21.279 --> 48:22.737
peace.

48:25.157 --> 48:27.200
And it's because he's dead.

48:34.625 --> 48:37.043
And I know that it's not gonna last.

48:38.921 --> 48:42.632
And when it wears off,
I'm gonna have to find the rest of them.

48:44.302 --> 48:47.387
Because that's the only way
that I'll find that peace again.

48:53.060 --> 48:56.021
I don't even have a name
for what I'm feeling.

48:57.064 --> 48:58.565
I do.

48:58.691 --> 49:00.400
The Dark Passenger.

49:01.652 --> 49:03.903
I can't get revenge
for Rita's death,

49:04.030 --> 49:07.449
but I can help Lumen
avenge what was done to her.

49:13.998 --> 49:15.999
How many more were there?

49:16.310 --> 49:22.305
