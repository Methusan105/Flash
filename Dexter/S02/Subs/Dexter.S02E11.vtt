WEBVTT

00:02.298 --> 00:04.216
Previously on Dexter...

00:04.342 --> 00:06.719
Jesus fucking Christ.
You're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

00:06.845 --> 00:08.345
l really hate that name.

00:12.225 --> 00:13.934
What's it gonna be, Morgan?

00:14.060 --> 00:15.853
Kill me now or set me free!

00:15.979 --> 00:18.981
James knows that l believe in him,
so it was worth the risk.

00:19.107 --> 00:21.025
To your job? To your career?

00:21.151 --> 00:23.902
When you care about someone,
you do what you have to do.

00:24.029 --> 00:27.281
And your credibility was compromised
the second you failed to report a phone call

00:27.407 --> 00:29.533
from the subject
of a goddamn FBl manhunt.

00:29.659 --> 00:33.078
What really pisses me off
is you might be right.

00:33.204 --> 00:35.581
The kids have been through
so much lately.

00:35.707 --> 00:39.668
l don't want them to feel like they've been
abandoned by everyone they love.

00:39.794 --> 00:41.837
Does this mean we're dating again?

00:43.256 --> 00:46.050
l track killers. That's what l do.
They tend to move around.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.551
l know that.

00:47.677 --> 00:51.680
Then l'm not sure what you thought
would happen when the case ended.

00:52.390 --> 00:54.516
- l like it rough.
- Yeah?

01:00.732 --> 01:02.232
Jesus.

01:02.358 --> 01:03.609
I don't need Doakes dead.

01:03.735 --> 01:07.071
l just need his fingerprints
to complete my frame job.

01:07.197 --> 01:09.239
Every Saturday, beginning dive classes

01:09.365 --> 01:12.159
practice underwater skills beside this dock.

01:12.285 --> 01:15.704
Tomorrow they"ll find
a morbid little surprise.

01:16.664 --> 01:20.167
l want to know if there was
anything unusual about my father's death.

01:20.293 --> 01:22.252
He killed himself, Dexter.

01:22.378 --> 01:27.132
The idea of a code was one thing,
but the reality of it?

01:27.258 --> 01:28.258
Hey, Dad.

01:28.384 --> 01:30.928
Harry walked in on what he created...

01:31.054 --> 01:33.430
and he couIdn't Iive with himseIf.

03:38.890 --> 03:42.768
l always thought hardening arteries
squeezed the life out of my father,

03:42.894 --> 03:45.020
but it was me.

03:48.983 --> 03:52.236
Harry gazed into the eyes
of his creation and saw evil,

03:52.362 --> 03:54.154
pure and simple.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.865
My evil. lt killed him.

03:56.991 --> 04:00.744
That shit about your father,

04:00.870 --> 04:03.956
if you want to talk about it. . .

04:04.082 --> 04:05.540
About what?

04:06.709 --> 04:09.670
That my life is one tragic mistake?

04:09.796 --> 04:12.506
We've all felt that at one time
or another. l know l have.

04:12.632 --> 04:16.343
Did you happen to be stuffing a human leg into
a garbage bag at that point?

04:16.469 --> 04:18.804
lf you want to make a change, Morgan,
now's the time.

04:18.930 --> 04:21.515
All you got to do is let me out of here.

04:21.641 --> 04:23.558
lt's over, man.

04:23.685 --> 04:26.311
lt is over when l say it is!

04:26.437 --> 04:30.399
There's that anger again.
You got to let that out, man.

04:30.525 --> 04:33.068
Careful, Sergeant,
you might get your wish.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.948
l'm flying without a code here.

04:38.074 --> 04:40.492
l can unleash the beast any time l want.

04:40.618 --> 04:42.577
Morgan, you know that's not the answer.

04:42.704 --> 04:44.162
But it would feel fucking great.

04:44.289 --> 04:47.499
Yeah, but you would hate yourself
for the rest of your life.

04:58.177 --> 05:00.262
All the things Harry taught me,

05:01.431 --> 05:03.640
everything,

05:03.766 --> 05:05.851
it's bullshit.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.150
lt's the only way l know how to live.

05:14.819 --> 05:16.778
Turn yourself in.

05:19.032 --> 05:21.783
Rule number one,

05:23.286 --> 05:24.828
don't get caught.

05:24.954 --> 05:26.997
No, no, Morgan, you're spinning.

05:27.123 --> 05:30.751
Let me help you. lt's only a matter of time
before you hurt someone else.

05:30.877 --> 05:33.962
and l'm not talking about me.
l'm talking about your sister or your girlfriend

05:34.088 --> 05:36.965
or even those kids.

05:37.091 --> 05:38.091
l would never. . .

05:38.217 --> 05:40.844
No, not on purpose,
but you can't control that shit

05:40.970 --> 05:43.472
that's growing inside of you, Morgan,
it's like cancer.

05:43.598 --> 05:46.725
And in case you haven't noticed,
it's spreading.

05:47.810 --> 05:49.519
End it now.

05:51.064 --> 05:53.982
Take responsibility
for who you are, man.

05:55.651 --> 05:58.236
We'll go to the station together.
l'll help you.

06:07.997 --> 06:10.540
Morgan. Morgan, don't answer that.

06:10.666 --> 06:13.877
Stay with me, man.

06:14.003 --> 06:17.047
Morgan! Morgan!

06:17.173 --> 06:18.632
Fuck!

06:19.717 --> 06:21.385
Yes, this is Dexter Morgan.

06:21.511 --> 06:25.055
Mr. Morgan, my name is Dr. Hill.
I work at Good Samaritan HospitaI.

06:25.181 --> 06:27.891
l'm calling on behalf of Lila Tournay.

06:28.017 --> 06:31.895
- How did you get this number?
- You're listed as her emergency contact.

06:32.021 --> 06:35.524
Ms Tournay was rushed into our ER
in respiratory arrest.

06:35.650 --> 06:37.192
Could you come to the hospital?

06:37.318 --> 06:39.319
l'm two hours away. Call somebody else.

06:39.445 --> 06:42.697
Mr. Morgan, there's a legal complication.

06:43.825 --> 06:45.909
What kind of complication?

06:46.035 --> 06:50.580
l can't discuss it over the phone.
You really need to be here.

06:54.877 --> 06:56.503
Where are you going, Morgan?

06:56.629 --> 06:58.755
Don't worry, l'll send
the FBl your way soon enough.

06:58.881 --> 07:03.510
- You're still gonna try to frame me?
- l'm kind of down a path here.

07:03.636 --> 07:05.887
You'll get your chance
to tell them l'm the killer,

07:06.013 --> 07:08.557
and they'll ignore you
like before, and l'll. . .

07:08.683 --> 07:12.018
- And you'll burn in hell is what you'll do.
- Yeah, something like that.

07:13.229 --> 07:14.896
Morgan!

08:01.319 --> 08:03.320
He's gone, Dex.

08:03.446 --> 08:05.614
Dad's heart finally gave out.

08:10.620 --> 08:13.580
Harry"s heart gave out
when he saw what's inside me.

08:13.706 --> 08:16.166
He thought he could tame it,
give it a purpose,

08:16.292 --> 08:18.418
heIp it find a pIace in the naturaI order.

08:19.545 --> 08:21.630
Guess he was wrong.

08:24.926 --> 08:26.051
Dexter?

08:26.177 --> 08:27.677
- Mr. Morgan?
- Yeah.

08:27.803 --> 08:30.889
l need a second alone
with him, OK? Thanks.

08:31.015 --> 08:34.643
Dr. Hill. We spoke on the phone
regarding your girlfriend, Ms Tournay.

08:34.769 --> 08:36.394
She's not my girlfriend.

08:36.521 --> 08:38.772
Oh, l thought she said she was.

08:38.898 --> 08:40.899
Yeah, she probably did.

08:41.025 --> 08:43.360
- So, you're. . .
- lt's complicated.

08:43.486 --> 08:45.028
Look, why is Angel here?

08:45.154 --> 08:49.533
We found Rohypnol,
the date-rape drug, in Lila's system.

08:49.659 --> 08:52.577
With her bruising, the wound
to the back of her head -

08:52.703 --> 08:55.288
we may be looking at a case
of sexual assault.

08:55.414 --> 08:57.249
No, no, that didn't happen.

08:57.375 --> 09:00.627
Ms Tournay has no recollection
of what did happen.

09:00.753 --> 09:02.879
She's requested we perform a rape kit.

09:03.005 --> 09:06.383
l need to talk to her.

09:21.482 --> 09:25.902
Dexter, you came to see me.
You're so sweet.

09:26.028 --> 09:29.030
The doctors think Angel raped you.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.704
Did he? Everything's a bit fuzzy.

09:35.830 --> 09:38.832
This is desperate. lt won't work.

09:38.958 --> 09:41.918
What are you talking about?

09:42.044 --> 09:44.879
l'm just glad you're here.

09:45.006 --> 09:47.507
l missed you so much.

09:47.633 --> 09:49.968
This is how you win me back?

09:50.094 --> 09:52.929
Framing a good man to get what you want?

09:53.055 --> 09:56.516
Which is precisely
what l'm doing to Doakes.

09:58.603 --> 10:01.605
What's the matter, Dexter?

10:01.731 --> 10:04.232
You look so sad. . .lost.

10:07.236 --> 10:09.863
Don't do this.

10:09.989 --> 10:12.490
l won't press charges against Angel.

10:12.617 --> 10:16.244
l'll do whatever you want.

10:19.081 --> 10:22.167
lf you promise to take me back.

10:22.293 --> 10:24.294
Why can't you just let me go?

10:24.420 --> 10:28.173
Because l'm your real soul mate.

10:28.299 --> 10:31.635
Not Rita. Me.

10:32.345 --> 10:35.972
l see you. lnside.

10:37.266 --> 10:39.643
And l'm the only one.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.811
Look where it's gotten you.

10:47.109 --> 10:49.819
You know that l could never
do anything like that, right?

10:49.945 --> 10:52.322
You don't even have
to say anything, Angel.

10:52.448 --> 10:56.409
You warned me about her,
but my dick wouldn't listen.

10:56.535 --> 10:59.454
l could lose everything over this.

11:00.998 --> 11:02.832
What would l say to my little girl?

11:02.958 --> 11:05.502
The doctor said Lila
has 72 hours to press charges.

11:05.628 --> 11:07.212
Maybe she'll come to her senses.

11:11.133 --> 11:14.803
l should get home and grab
a few hours of sleep. Let me get this.

11:14.929 --> 11:17.180
No, back off. l got it.

11:22.228 --> 11:23.895
Oh, Angel.

11:26.315 --> 11:28.358
lf l got to choose a person -

11:28.484 --> 11:31.903
a real person - to be like. . .

11:33.781 --> 11:35.865
out of anyone, it'd be you.

11:38.035 --> 11:42.580
l'm not really sure what that means,
but. thanks. Dex.

11:47.670 --> 11:49.796
See you in the morning.

11:51.340 --> 11:54.759
Oh, and l'd appreciate it

11:54.885 --> 11:58.471
if you didn't mention this
to anyone at the station.

11:58.597 --> 12:00.306
Of course not.

12:00.433 --> 12:02.350
Thanks.

12:05.354 --> 12:07.897
How did it come to this?
l've always gone after criminals.

12:08.023 --> 12:10.984
Now l have the fate
of two cops in my hands.

12:11.861 --> 12:15.029
Doakes was right. The cancer is spreading.

12:20.953 --> 12:23.747
- We're out of yoghurt.
- Add it to the list.

12:23.873 --> 12:27.167
- We'll stop by the store tonight.
- The store's on the way to work.

12:27.293 --> 12:30.086
lt's also on the way home.
We're gonna be late.

12:30.212 --> 12:32.589
Hey, who joined who
in the shower this morning?

12:32.715 --> 12:35.884
How about. in the future.
l set the alarm ten minutes earlier?

12:36.010 --> 12:38.303
Make it 20.

12:38.429 --> 12:40.722
"The future", l'm liking the sound of that.

12:47.897 --> 12:49.439
We're being ordered to work.

12:49.565 --> 12:52.066
Fuck that. You're the head of the task force.
You do the ordering.

12:56.113 --> 12:57.947
Who's DD Adams?

12:58.073 --> 13:00.158
My boss.

13:02.995 --> 13:04.621
Mission accomplished.

13:04.747 --> 13:07.707
The weapons l tossed into the ocean
were found as planned.

13:07.833 --> 13:10.043
One more naiI in Doakes's coffin.

13:10.169 --> 13:11.878
All right, people. Listen up.

13:12.004 --> 13:14.047
This is FBl deputy director Max Adams.

13:14.173 --> 13:15.757
He just got in from Washington.

13:15.883 --> 13:18.343
He's going to be helping us out for a while.

13:18.469 --> 13:19.844
Max.

13:19.970 --> 13:21.471
Frank.

13:21.597 --> 13:24.641
Once again. l have pledged
our full cooperation and resources,

13:24.767 --> 13:27.435
so let's make him feel at home.

13:27.561 --> 13:28.812
Max.

13:28.938 --> 13:31.898
The murder weapons before you
were recovered yesterday

13:32.024 --> 13:34.484
by a beginning scuba-diving class.

13:34.610 --> 13:36.820
The instructor contacted the FBl directly,

13:36.946 --> 13:38.488
which brought them to my attention.

13:38.614 --> 13:41.491
Fingerprint analysis ties them
to one James Doakes.

13:41.617 --> 13:44.035
- This doesn't prove a goddamn thing.
- Not now, Maria.

13:44.161 --> 13:47.747
- Why l wasn't l brought in on this?
- You just were, Frank.

13:47.873 --> 13:49.874
Now, we know Sergeant Doakes
has been...

13:50.000 --> 13:52.001
Lundy better watch his back.

13:52.127 --> 13:54.879
He's abandoned the tools of the trade,
that means he's probably on the run.

13:55.005 --> 13:57.674
This footage was taken
four days ago at a Mobil station

13:57.800 --> 14:01.261
just off highway 41 . southeast of Naples.

14:01.387 --> 14:05.515
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sergeant James Doakes.

14:05.641 --> 14:07.976
l can't believe it.

14:08.936 --> 14:11.312
3.49 for regular?

14:11.438 --> 14:17.360
So, we have let our target
get away once.

14:17.486 --> 14:19.904
Let's not drop the ball again.

14:20.030 --> 14:21.447
Asshole.

14:21.574 --> 14:24.576
Highway 41 runs through
the Everglades National Park.

14:24.702 --> 14:28.037
lt won"t be long now.
l can hang this on Doakes and then...

14:30.958 --> 14:32.292
Then what?

14:32.418 --> 14:35.128
Years of triaIs and appeaIs
with him pointing his finger

14:35.254 --> 14:37.380
and calling me killer?

14:38.757 --> 14:42.969
For such a neat monster,
l'm making an awfully big mess.

15:26.430 --> 15:30.224
Where does this prick Adams get off
taking such cheap shots at Lundy?

15:30.351 --> 15:33.770
l heard that Doakes walked off
in the middle of Lundy's questioning

15:33.896 --> 15:35.939
and that Lundy didn't stop him.

15:37.566 --> 15:39.776
l might have heard that wrong.

15:39.902 --> 15:40.944
Morgan.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.820
Oh, Peters.

15:42.947 --> 15:45.365
Nice hair. Borelli.
l'm sure the Johns up in Boys Town

15:45.491 --> 15:47.784
are loving that Duran Duran look.

15:47.910 --> 15:51.162
What's the matter?
You meatheads lose your sense of humor?

15:51.288 --> 15:53.039
Joke wasn't funny.

15:53.165 --> 15:55.959
We have a warrant
for Detective Batista's arrest.

16:00.381 --> 16:02.799
Bullshit. For what?

16:02.925 --> 16:04.926
A woman named Lila Tournay

16:05.052 --> 16:07.136
has filed sexual assault
charges against him.

16:07.262 --> 16:08.638
That fucking bitch.

16:08.764 --> 16:10.807
Debra, it's OK. l knew this was coming.

16:10.933 --> 16:12.934
lt's not OK. Captain, Lieutenant!

16:13.060 --> 16:15.520
Put those away
or l will shove them up your ass!

16:15.646 --> 16:17.063
What's going on here?

16:17.189 --> 16:20.316
We've been asked to bring
Detective Batista upstairs for processing.

16:20.442 --> 16:23.987
l am sure that Detective Batista
will go along with you peacefully.

16:27.282 --> 16:29.742
lt's not your fault.

16:29.868 --> 16:31.953
l'll be OK.

16:32.997 --> 16:36.290
lt isn't my fault. l warned Angel.

16:36.417 --> 16:39.877
Still, l hate to see him
disgraced in front of everyone.

16:41.797 --> 16:45.925
And LaGuerta about to Iose her
former partner, her friend.

16:48.429 --> 16:52.306
Even Lundy is caught in Hurricane Dexter's
path of destruction.

16:54.643 --> 16:56.853
Maybe this is how evil works.

16:56.979 --> 17:02.734
Destroying everything it touches...
including my father.

17:06.321 --> 17:07.613
Hey.

17:07.740 --> 17:10.783
You're not gonna believe
the morning l'm having.

17:10.909 --> 17:12.285
l know the feeling.

17:12.411 --> 17:14.704
My car is stalled on Harper and 3rd.

17:14.830 --> 17:17.081
Think you can come get me?

17:17.207 --> 17:20.626
- Yeah, hang tight. l'll be right there.
- Thanks. Dex.

17:22.379 --> 17:25.465
l'm the helpful handyman.
How evil can l possibly be?

17:25.591 --> 17:29.052
l'm sparing Rita and Deb
by framing Doakes.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.595
Right?

18:27.236 --> 18:29.779
Hey! Hey! Over here!

18:36.829 --> 18:38.371
Thank God.

18:39.915 --> 18:43.417
l've been held prisoner in
a cabin for two fucking days.

18:45.671 --> 18:47.004
Fucking hellhole.

18:49.133 --> 18:51.259
No, no! No, no. l don't want
to go to the cabin.

18:54.096 --> 18:57.640
l need you to get my ass out of here. l'm
a police sergeant. Miami Metro Homicide.

19:11.113 --> 19:13.990
l've got to run upstairs.
There's a whole Batista thing going on.

19:14.116 --> 19:15.992
- Lunch today?
- Doubtful.

19:16.118 --> 19:19.954
l've got to write up a status report
for Deputy Director Adams.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.664
Why'd they send that dipshit?

19:21.790 --> 19:24.375
Washington gets nervous when
there's no movement on a case,

19:24.501 --> 19:27.044
- especially one as big as this.
- No movement?

19:27.171 --> 19:30.089
You're the reason they found
the blood slides in Doakes's car.

19:30.215 --> 19:32.884
l'm also the one who let him get away.

19:33.010 --> 19:36.179
- We all let him get away.
- l was in charge.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.764
The evidence was there,

19:38.891 --> 19:41.017
but something inside me
wasn't convinced he was our guy,

19:41.143 --> 19:43.311
so l let him walk.

19:43.437 --> 19:45.563
lt was a bad call.

19:45.689 --> 19:48.316
- Now we might never. . .
- Stop it.

19:48.442 --> 19:51.861
- stop what?
- Acting like me.

19:52.988 --> 19:57.074
You're a god. Don't you forget it.

19:59.161 --> 20:02.038
So, what do you think it is?

20:02.164 --> 20:03.539
Carburetor.

20:03.665 --> 20:07.460
Transmission.
That round, black hose thing.

20:07.586 --> 20:09.545
l'm more a boat guy.

20:09.671 --> 20:12.632
The last thing l need right now
is a major repair bill.

20:12.758 --> 20:14.884
Throw in a tow and a rental car,

20:15.010 --> 20:19.138
- there goes Astor's piano lessons.
- Here. take the minivan.

20:19.264 --> 20:21.390
No, l can't. lt's too big of an inconvenience.

20:21.516 --> 20:23.142
You can drop me off back at work.

20:23.268 --> 20:26.187
l'll borrow something from the motor pool.

20:29.691 --> 20:31.400
l'll make it up to you.

20:31.526 --> 20:33.527
Dinner?

20:34.529 --> 20:36.030
l have a better idea.

20:36.156 --> 20:37.740
Pack a lunch, bring the kids,

20:37.866 --> 20:39.992
let me take you
out on the ocean tomorrow.

20:40.118 --> 20:42.078
The kids have school tomorrow.

20:42.204 --> 20:43.621
Think of it as a field trip.

20:43.747 --> 20:45.539
You don't know Cody's teacher.

20:45.666 --> 20:49.001
lt's just one day. Just one more day.

20:50.295 --> 20:52.421
ls everything OK, Dexter?

20:52.547 --> 20:54.674
Look, after everything
we've been through lately,

20:54.800 --> 20:58.010
l just want to be together with you guys.

20:58.136 --> 20:59.804
ls that selfish?

20:59.930 --> 21:02.306
No.

21:02.432 --> 21:04.809
No, it's lovely.

21:14.027 --> 21:15.987
Sergeant Doakes can rejoice.

21:16.113 --> 21:18.572
l come bearing real food.

21:33.046 --> 21:34.463
Shit.

21:36.758 --> 21:38.426
All right.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.893
No, no, no.

22:29.019 --> 22:31.354
Right, right.

22:32.189 --> 22:34.857
Suck my dick, motherfucker.
You understand that shit? Huh?

23:06.515 --> 23:08.015
Friends of yours?

23:09.017 --> 23:12.144
From what l can tell.
they're friends of that drug dealer.

23:12.270 --> 23:16.148
They would've killed me
once l had all that coke on the boat.

23:17.692 --> 23:19.443
Thanks, Morgan.

23:24.533 --> 23:27.785
Well, this is awkward.

23:31.915 --> 23:34.542
l think we made
some alligators very happy.

23:38.046 --> 23:40.089
So, here we are.

23:40.215 --> 23:43.008
Back to fucking square one.

23:43.135 --> 23:44.802
Not exactly.

23:51.643 --> 23:53.227
Tell you what, James.

23:53.353 --> 23:54.979
Can l call you James?

23:55.105 --> 23:57.022
Knock yourself out.

24:01.069 --> 24:02.987
l'm toying with an idea.

24:05.699 --> 24:09.368
l've been under federal investigation
for two months.

24:11.163 --> 24:12.913
My trophies were stolen.

24:14.749 --> 24:16.333
Sorry.

24:16.460 --> 24:19.462
The code l live by has been shattered.

24:21.882 --> 24:25.885
And l have a co-worker in a cage.
Things aren't going so well.

24:27.429 --> 24:29.472
No shit. l can see that.

24:29.598 --> 24:35.060
You told me,
"Take responsibility for what l am."

24:35.187 --> 24:37.146
You were right.

24:40.066 --> 24:43.777
- Harry killed the wrong person.
- Morgan, you're not thinking about. . .

24:43.904 --> 24:47.072
Kill myself? No, that's pathetic.

24:50.744 --> 24:53.996
But l can't live in this
house of cards any more,

24:54.122 --> 24:56.248
waiting for it all to fall down.

24:56.374 --> 24:59.168
l need to do something, you know?

25:07.010 --> 25:09.887
l'm thinking about turning myself in.

25:14.935 --> 25:18.562
That's a. . . That's a good call, Morgan.

25:18.688 --> 25:22.691
That's a tough call.
but. . .that's a good call, man.

25:27.656 --> 25:30.241
- l need some fucking relief.
- Yeah.

25:30.367 --> 25:34.119
Yeah, you can't keep running, man.
That's for pussies.

25:34.246 --> 25:38.415
You're just gonna end up
in exactly the same situation sooner or later.

25:38.542 --> 25:40.000
Prison.

25:43.129 --> 25:45.673
l could finally get some sleep.

25:46.925 --> 25:48.342
Yeah.

25:50.720 --> 25:55.015
ln the long run
it would be easier on Deb. . .

25:55.141 --> 25:57.142
Rita.

26:00.272 --> 26:05.025
Better than watching me
dragged in like an animal. . .

26:05.151 --> 26:08.904
which. let's face it.
will happen, someday.

26:09.030 --> 26:12.992
Yeah. Morgan, we'll do it together.

26:13.118 --> 26:16.745
l'll go with you. Come on, let's go.

26:18.665 --> 26:21.625
lf l do this, l need a day
to get my affairs in order.

26:21.751 --> 26:24.169
That's fine. Tie me up, throw me
in the trunk. Come on, let's go.

26:24.296 --> 26:26.797
l brought supplies. Fresh fruit.

26:27.549 --> 26:30.634
Make sure you mention that when
they interview you for the story of my life.

26:30.760 --> 26:33.596
God damn it, you're not gonna leave me
in this cage. Anything could happen.

26:33.722 --> 26:37.016
- What are you doing?
- l think we've seen the worst of that.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.268
Morgan!

26:39.811 --> 26:41.478
Dexter.

26:45.859 --> 26:48.694
l've really enjoyed
our conversations, James.

26:51.489 --> 26:53.907
l lie to everyone l know. . .

26:55.910 --> 26:59.038
except my victims right before l kill them.

27:00.582 --> 27:03.751
lt's hard to establish
much of a rapport there.

27:10.925 --> 27:13.010
Sorry about the cage.

27:14.846 --> 27:16.096
Morgan!

27:18.391 --> 27:19.600
Fuck.

27:56.137 --> 27:58.472
- What?
- Hey, Deb. lt's me.

27:58.598 --> 28:02.351
- What are you doing tonight?
- l'm about to get off of work. Why?

28:02.477 --> 28:06.146
l've got some papers l need you to sign.

28:06.272 --> 28:08.107
Papers? What kind of papers?

28:10.151 --> 28:12.152
l'll explain when l see you.

28:12.278 --> 28:14.321
l'm meeting Masuka
and Batista for drinks.

28:14.447 --> 28:16.949
Why don't you bring the papers and join us?

28:18.660 --> 28:21.286
- How's Angel doing?
- How do you think he's doing?

28:21.413 --> 28:24.498
You know, it's your fault he's in this mess.
lf you hadn't fucked Elvira.

28:24.624 --> 28:28.127
l'm not the best brother, am l?

28:28.253 --> 28:30.713
Dexter, are you smoking something?

28:30.839 --> 28:33.006
No.

28:33.133 --> 28:36.385
l've always been curious to try.
Do you have any weed?

28:36.511 --> 28:38.595
OK, now l'm really worried.

28:38.722 --> 28:41.098
There's no need to worry.

28:42.726 --> 28:45.978
l'll bring by the papers tomorrow.
Bye. Deb.

28:47.939 --> 28:50.399
lt's strange. This should be difficult,

28:50.525 --> 28:53.402
But a sense of peace is settling over me.

28:53.528 --> 28:55.654
CaIm.

28:57.824 --> 28:59.491
Maybe it's the moonlight.

29:06.541 --> 29:08.333
Tom?

29:09.502 --> 29:12.963
- Can l meet you outside?
- Oh, sure.

29:13.965 --> 29:16.049
l'll check in back home.

29:17.677 --> 29:20.763
- l need a personal day.
- l hope this is a joke.

29:20.889 --> 29:24.183
Just one day. l think l can prove
that James is innocent.

29:24.309 --> 29:27.394
l was talking to a couple of the FBl agents who
were down in Haiti. . .

29:27.520 --> 29:30.022
Jesus Christ. Maria.
We are in the middle of a manhunt.

29:30.148 --> 29:32.524
You're down two detectives,
and now you want time off?

29:32.650 --> 29:35.527
The answer is no.
This department can't spare you right now.

29:35.653 --> 29:37.946
This wasn't a request, Tom.

29:38.072 --> 29:41.909
l won't be here tomorrow.
l just wanted you to know that.

29:46.873 --> 29:48.874
What is this shit, Masuka?

29:49.000 --> 29:52.669
- Hey. tequila's all the same.
- Not when it's made from pumpkins.

29:52.796 --> 29:54.922
Hey. we're not all
in the same pay grade.

29:55.048 --> 29:58.884
lf l lose my job over this, bro,
l won't have a pay grade.

29:59.010 --> 30:01.637
That is not gonna happen. Everyone
at the station knows you're innocent.

30:01.763 --> 30:03.889
How am l gonna prove it? Hmm?

30:04.015 --> 30:06.892
l can't explain the roofies,
the rough sex.

30:07.018 --> 30:09.186
- There was rough sex?
- lt was her idea.

30:09.312 --> 30:11.647
Now it's my word against hers.
l'm screwed.

30:11.773 --> 30:15.776
- Angel, you have got to fight back.
- Dude. Morgan's right.

30:15.902 --> 30:18.862
You got to man up, get tough.
Love's a battlefield.

30:18.988 --> 30:21.156
Or, in your case, a restraining order.

30:22.742 --> 30:26.662
Look, l appreciate you guys doing this,
but you don't have to stay.

30:26.788 --> 30:29.122
Hey, does it ever floor you guys

30:29.249 --> 30:32.334
that we had a killer
right under our noses this whole time?

30:32.460 --> 30:35.087
l mean, who doesn't see that shit?

30:37.340 --> 30:40.551
- That didn't come out right.
- lt's all right.

30:40.677 --> 30:43.512
That stuff doesn't bother me any more.

30:43.638 --> 30:45.722
Next round's on me.

31:07.662 --> 31:10.664
Dexter. l was wondering
when you'd show up.

31:11.791 --> 31:14.918
- We need to talk.
- Sounds good to me.

31:16.504 --> 31:19.381
l'm making coffee. Do you want one?

31:19.507 --> 31:21.550
l'm here to ask you respectfully

31:21.676 --> 31:23.844
to drop the charges against Angel.

31:26.055 --> 31:29.057
Dexter, if Angel molested me,

31:29.183 --> 31:31.518
as the evidence seems to indicate,

31:31.644 --> 31:36.732
then he should
face the consequences, don't you think?

31:36.858 --> 31:39.026
lt doesn't matter what l think.

31:40.153 --> 31:42.654
But here's what l know.

31:42.780 --> 31:44.740
After tomorrow,
l won't be around any more,

31:44.866 --> 31:46.992
so there's no end game in this for you.

31:48.453 --> 31:50.787
You're going somewhere?

31:50.914 --> 31:53.206
lt's looking more and more likely.

31:53.333 --> 31:54.750
Where?

31:54.876 --> 31:57.628
All that matters is that
l'll be out of reach permanently.

31:57.754 --> 32:01.089
Oh. come on. Dexter!
Tell me. l have a right to know.

32:01.215 --> 32:04.092
You're the one who taught me about accepting
the things you can't change.

32:04.218 --> 32:06.511
This is one of those things.

32:09.390 --> 32:11.183
Goodbye, Lila.

32:12.435 --> 32:15.979
l don't understand
how men can be so stupid.

32:16.105 --> 32:18.899
Well, not all men.

32:19.025 --> 32:21.652
Yes, every single one of you.

32:21.778 --> 32:25.322
l mean, how could Dexter and Batista
be so easily duped by Lila?

32:25.448 --> 32:29.242
l took one look at her,
l knew she was a walking nightmare.

32:30.119 --> 32:33.246
That's not stupidity.
lt's simply in our DNA.

32:33.373 --> 32:37.376
When a pretty girl smiles and bats
her eyelashes, we're powerless to resist.

32:40.254 --> 32:43.590
l'm worried about Batista.
This is so fucked.

32:43.716 --> 32:46.093
There's no way l'm gonna let him
take the fall for this.

32:46.219 --> 32:47.636
What can you do?

32:49.681 --> 32:51.890
Well. . .

32:52.016 --> 32:54.726
Special Agent Lundy,

32:54.852 --> 32:56.979
l was wondering if you might access

32:57.105 --> 33:00.023
those great, big FBl files of yours

33:00.149 --> 33:03.318
and do a search on Miss Lila Tournay.

33:05.196 --> 33:07.447
You see? Powerless to resist.

33:07.573 --> 33:11.660
ls Adams gonna be pissed off
when he sees you used FBl files for this?

33:11.786 --> 33:13.954
l certainly hope so.

33:20.086 --> 33:23.005
She has no warrants.

33:23.131 --> 33:25.298
No criminal record.

33:26.342 --> 33:29.011
Nothing with the DMV.

33:31.514 --> 33:34.349
And no social security number.

33:34.475 --> 33:37.894
What about visas
or green cards or whatever?

33:38.021 --> 33:40.772
Nothing. No records.

33:40.898 --> 33:44.735
That's impossible.
Everyone has a paper trail.

33:44.861 --> 33:46.945
Everyone real.

33:48.239 --> 33:51.241
That sneaky bitch. She's using an alias.

33:51.367 --> 33:52.743
That would be my guess.

33:52.869 --> 33:55.704
Well, how do l find out Lila's real name?

33:55.830 --> 33:57.956
l think you know the answer to that.

33:59.042 --> 34:00.876
Cut off her head, look for a label.

34:03.129 --> 34:05.547
There's probably an easier way.

34:14.348 --> 34:16.475
You got something smaller?

34:16.601 --> 34:19.686
The last time Lila was in my apartment,
she microwaved some popcorn.

34:19.812 --> 34:22.064
There's definitely gonna be prints on this.

34:24.108 --> 34:25.692
All right, got it.

34:25.818 --> 34:28.070
Next time, make her a cup of tea.

34:36.162 --> 34:38.246
This is Marlene from accounting.

34:38.372 --> 34:39.915
Hi, Marlene from accounting.

34:40.041 --> 34:42.167
She's also a notary public.

34:42.293 --> 34:43.877
Good for you.

34:44.003 --> 34:47.172
l met with a lawyer yesterday,
and he helped me prepare a living trust

34:47.298 --> 34:51.593
that gives you control
off all my assets in the event of my death

34:51.719 --> 34:54.429
or certain other situations.

34:54.555 --> 34:56.932
Oh, God. Go away. This is creepy.

34:57.058 --> 35:00.602
My financial planner said a guy my age should
have a will. lt's just a precaution.

35:00.728 --> 35:02.729
We're all going to die eventually.

35:06.234 --> 35:07.567
OK. Yeah.

35:08.778 --> 35:12.030
ls this why you were
acting so weird last night?

35:12.156 --> 35:14.157
- Yeah. probably.
- Sign here and here,

35:14.283 --> 35:17.577
- and l'll need to see an lD.
- Fine.

35:19.372 --> 35:21.540
Thanks for showing up last night
to support Batista.

35:21.666 --> 35:24.960
l am supporting Batista.
l stopped by Lila's this morning.

35:25.086 --> 35:27.462
- And?
- And l talked to her.

35:27.588 --> 35:29.464
l don't think she's gonna be a problem.

35:29.590 --> 35:33.343
Yeah, 'cause she certainly
hasn't been one so far.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.222
Hey, l'm free tonight. You want to stop by?

35:37.348 --> 35:39.057
l'll pick up some beers,
throw on a couple of steaks.

35:39.183 --> 35:40.976
There's something
l want to talk to you about.

35:41.102 --> 35:43.311
Sure. Sounds good.

35:44.480 --> 35:48.024
So, what am l getting?
l could use a new TV.

35:52.572 --> 35:55.907
Oh, then left. OK. But that's the one?

35:56.033 --> 35:58.785
- Lundy here.
- Oh, Special Agent Lundy.

35:58.911 --> 36:01.663
lt's Lieutenant LaGuerta.
l'm calling you from Haiti.

36:01.789 --> 36:03.748
Lovely this time of year.

36:03.875 --> 36:06.668
l understand that l'm not your favorite person in
the station right now.

36:06.794 --> 36:10.297
- but l really need your help.
- How so?

36:11.424 --> 36:14.426
l just met with Leones.
the travel agent that Doakes saw.

36:14.552 --> 36:18.138
There's nothing new there.
l had two agents question him for hours.

36:18.264 --> 36:21.016
Yet he never told them
about the blood slides.

36:21.142 --> 36:23.351
What does he know
about the blood slides?

36:23.477 --> 36:26.479
Doakes was looking for a lab
to have them analyzed.

36:26.606 --> 36:28.773
- Why?
- l don't know why.

36:28.900 --> 36:30.901
lf he's our killer. he'd be
keeping them for trophies.

36:31.027 --> 36:32.694
He'd have no reason
to have them analyzed.

36:32.820 --> 36:35.238
And l also have a list
of special ops missions

36:35.364 --> 36:38.241
that Leones personally knows
Doakes took part in.

36:38.367 --> 36:40.869
Now, two of them directly
conflict with murders

36:40.995 --> 36:44.080
we know to have been committed
by the Bay Harbor Butcher.

36:44.207 --> 36:46.666
l'm not sure Leones
is our most reliable witness.

36:46.792 --> 36:50.670
No, but it's worth looking into, isn't it?

36:52.590 --> 36:54.799
Yes. Yes, it is.

36:54.926 --> 36:56.635
Yes! OK.

36:56.761 --> 37:03.141
For starters, why don't you brief me
on both those missions?

37:03.267 --> 37:05.518
Give me all the details.

37:07.521 --> 37:09.564
Come on, Cody. Up and over.

37:09.690 --> 37:11.316
OK. Great.

37:11.442 --> 37:14.527
OK, Astor. Up and over. There we go.

37:16.239 --> 37:19.491
Come on, sweetie, your turn.
Watch your step.

37:34.966 --> 37:37.425
- Look. there's a pelican.
- There's a bunch of them.

37:37.551 --> 37:39.427
What's that?

38:17.758 --> 38:21.219
WeIcome to the GPS 3000 teIetracker.

38:22.763 --> 38:25.265
Previous destinations.

38:34.775 --> 38:38.153
For so long my boat has been
a tool of my dark trade -

38:38.279 --> 38:39.988
a graveyard transport.

38:40.114 --> 38:42.991
l"d almost forgotten
it couId doubIe as a pIeasure craft.

38:43.117 --> 38:45.327
Now, the thing is, if you catch a whale,

38:45.453 --> 38:47.704
we're probably gonna
have to put it back.

38:47.830 --> 38:50.165
lf it's a baby, we could put it in the bathtub.

38:50.291 --> 38:52.459
l'm not gonna take a bath with a whale.

38:52.585 --> 38:54.961
l know, they always use up all the soap.

39:03.387 --> 39:05.221
lt's peaceful out here.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.231
Rita, l've never been a very good boyfriend.

39:16.150 --> 39:18.651
l wouldn't say that.

39:20.529 --> 39:23.865
l just need you to know
that you and the kids

39:23.991 --> 39:26.076
are very important to me.

39:27.912 --> 39:31.122
No matter what happens,
l want you to always know that.

39:33.167 --> 39:35.251
OK, Dexter.

39:38.589 --> 39:41.299
Hey, everything's all right.

39:41.425 --> 39:42.592
OK?

39:42.718 --> 39:46.012
Just. . . l just need to take things slow.

39:48.557 --> 39:50.683
Oh, l have a gift for you.

39:50.810 --> 39:54.270
- Dexter, you don't need to bring me gifts.
- l want you to have this.

39:54.397 --> 39:56.398
lt's the pink slip to the minivan.

39:56.524 --> 39:59.067
Dexter, l told you everything's OK.
You don't...

39:59.193 --> 40:01.152
Please, l want you to have it for the kids.

40:01.278 --> 40:04.823
lt'll keep them safer
than a broken-down convertible.

40:07.076 --> 40:08.910
Thank you.

40:09.036 --> 40:10.745
Very generous.

40:10.871 --> 40:12.997
You're welcome.

40:14.959 --> 40:18.461
l know l've been
taking things slow with us,

40:18.587 --> 40:21.881
but it's not because
l don't have feelings for you.

40:22.007 --> 40:24.843
lt's more like l have too many feelings,

40:24.969 --> 40:27.887
and l just want to make sure
to get it right.

40:30.015 --> 40:31.933
Me too.

40:42.445 --> 40:46.281
That's not exactly taking it slow.

40:46.407 --> 40:49.117
Sorry. l'll never do that again.

40:49.243 --> 40:51.828
Well, don't say never.

41:01.922 --> 41:04.632
l was just looking for you.
The boys looked at Lila's prints.

41:04.758 --> 41:06.759
- We hit the jackpot.
- Oh?

41:06.886 --> 41:08.636
Turns out her real name is Lila West.

41:08.762 --> 41:11.306
l ran her prints through the AFlS,
which is tied to lCE.

41:11.432 --> 41:15.018
Get this. Her visa expired two years ago.

41:15.144 --> 41:17.937
- Bad girl.
- l can have her deported.

41:18.063 --> 41:20.023
Not as easy as it sounds.

41:20.149 --> 41:22.609
Miami is swamped
with criminal immigrants,

41:22.735 --> 41:25.320
refugees from Third World countries.

41:25.446 --> 41:29.073
- They'll take priority over some British girl.
- Then l'll deport her myself.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.784
- We got him.
- Doakes?

41:31.911 --> 41:34.370
Talked to a park-service manager
in the Everglades

41:34.497 --> 41:37.624
who remembers giving Sergeant Doakes
directions five days ago.

41:37.750 --> 41:39.751
So you have a tip, not Doakes.

41:39.877 --> 41:42.670
The park manager said our target
was headed into the Everglades

41:42.796 --> 41:44.380
1 5 miles north of Sunday Bay.

41:44.507 --> 41:47.884
We will have the son of a bitch
in handcuffs in 24 hours.

41:48.010 --> 41:51.095
l'd like to urge strong caution
in apprehending the suspect.

41:51.222 --> 41:53.431
l'm looking into new information
that might come into play. . .

41:53.557 --> 41:55.683
Yeah, l got your email about Leones.

41:55.809 --> 41:57.810
The man will say anything for a dollar.

41:57.937 --> 42:01.523
l agree we have to be circumspect.
which is exactly why l'd like some time.

42:01.649 --> 42:03.733
Show a little guts, for Christ's sakes.

42:03.859 --> 42:05.902
Why don't you show a little respect?

42:06.028 --> 42:10.532
You wouldn't be closing in on a suspect right
now if it wasn't for the work of this man.

42:10.658 --> 42:14.452
You know, as much as l enjoy
hearing from the local talent,

42:14.578 --> 42:17.080
l'm really rather busy right now.

42:20.334 --> 42:23.378
Well, l'm guessing you don't need me
to fight your battles any more.

42:23.504 --> 42:27.465
- Maybe you need me to fight yours.
- Ooh. Aren't you a tough one?

42:27.591 --> 42:29.342
l'm just warming up.

42:41.438 --> 42:44.566
Wow. l thought l lived in a shitcan.

42:45.693 --> 42:49.195
Officer Morgan, have you come
to inquire about my welfare?

42:49.321 --> 42:51.573
l want you to leave Miami tonight.

42:51.699 --> 42:53.366
Don't ever come back.

42:53.492 --> 42:56.119
Don't ever contact Angel
or Dexter again.

42:57.788 --> 43:01.457
And why would l listen to you?

43:01.584 --> 43:02.542
'Cause l'm a cop.

43:02.668 --> 43:05.044
And you're here on an expired visa.

43:07.548 --> 43:10.425
l know your real name
and l've contacted immigration.

43:10.551 --> 43:12.510
Officers will be here any day now.

43:12.636 --> 43:15.430
They'll arrest you and deport you,

43:15.556 --> 43:17.557
and it will not be pretty.

43:17.683 --> 43:20.268
lf this is true, why are you telling me this?

43:20.394 --> 43:24.439
Because l want you
the fuck out of here now.

43:24.565 --> 43:27.650
Whether you leave on your own
or lmmigration hauls your sorry ass away,

43:27.776 --> 43:29.152
l don't give a shit.

43:29.278 --> 43:33.448
But l don't want to give you one more day
to fuck with the people l care about.

43:33.574 --> 43:36.075
l want you gone. Tonight.

43:36.201 --> 43:38.453
You don't want to do this.

43:39.121 --> 43:40.997
lt's done.

43:42.333 --> 43:43.791
Tonight.

44:11.111 --> 44:13.655
WeIcome. Previous destination.

44:13.781 --> 44:17.700
Starting route guidance. Left turn ahead.

44:27.002 --> 44:29.128
l keep expecting to come to my senses,

44:29.254 --> 44:32.256
but the pressure is lifting
with each step l take.

44:33.801 --> 44:36.552
l've spent a lifetime keeping up my guard,

44:36.679 --> 44:39.514
watching my back, wearing my mask.

44:39.640 --> 44:43.601
Relief was never in sight until now.

44:46.146 --> 44:50.024
lf anyone deserves to take me
into custody, it's Deb.

44:50.150 --> 44:52.735
But how do I teII her what I am?

45:07.251 --> 45:19.011
Deb, l'm the Bay Harbor Butcher.

45:19.138 --> 45:21.180
On the ground.
Down on the ground, motherfucker.

45:21.306 --> 45:24.308
lt's me. l'm the Bay Harbor Butcher.

45:24.435 --> 45:27.395
No, no, no, no, no.

45:27.521 --> 45:30.022
l'm him - the Butcher.

45:34.737 --> 45:38.072
This isn't going to be easy.

45:39.908 --> 45:42.910
l brought extra beer. We're getting drunk.

45:44.121 --> 45:45.788
Fine with me.

45:50.919 --> 45:52.962
What's the occasion?

45:53.630 --> 45:56.257
l ran Lila out of town today.

45:58.135 --> 46:00.136
- Really?
- Yeah.

46:00.262 --> 46:03.556
Turns out she's here illegally.
You should have seen me, Dex.

46:03.682 --> 46:05.767
l was like an Old West sheriff.

46:11.356 --> 46:13.941
You're really feeling good.

46:15.277 --> 46:17.028
Fuck, yeah.

46:17.905 --> 46:20.740
l got to say, great timing, Dex,
getting together tonight.

46:20.866 --> 46:24.786
The last few months, l was starting to feel like l
had my head pretty far up my ass.

46:25.954 --> 46:27.747
No one blames you.

46:27.873 --> 46:30.708
Your world was turned upside down.

46:30.834 --> 46:32.835
Like mine is now.

46:32.961 --> 46:37.590
For the first time since all that
lce-Truck Killer shit, l feel like l'm back.

46:37.716 --> 46:39.801
New and improved, even.

46:51.355 --> 46:55.274
When all that stuff was happening,

46:55.400 --> 46:57.568
with Rudy, l mean,

47:02.616 --> 47:05.827
did you ever consider
doing something drastic?

47:09.164 --> 47:10.706
Are you kidding?

47:13.544 --> 47:17.046
All kinds of fucked-up shit
went through my head.

47:17.172 --> 47:19.173
Thank God l had you.

47:20.676 --> 47:22.218
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:22.344 --> 47:26.097
Every time l started to spin
out of control, l had you to grab on to.

47:26.223 --> 47:30.268
Hell, you let me live here
practically forever.

47:30.394 --> 47:32.520
lt was tough, though.

47:33.105 --> 47:36.691
l'd have done almost anything
to get out from under the weight of it all.

47:40.404 --> 47:42.530
How'd you finally do it?

47:46.076 --> 47:49.704
l just. . .just saw through it.

47:50.539 --> 47:52.540
You know?

47:52.666 --> 47:56.502
You decide who you are,
who you want to be. . .

48:00.007 --> 48:04.802
and you hold on to that and ride it out.

48:11.935 --> 48:14.520
Like an Old West sheriff.

48:21.069 --> 48:25.573
Brother, this is worth living for.

48:28.577 --> 48:30.578
Right?

48:37.920 --> 48:40.087
You are absolutely right.

48:40.213 --> 48:43.341
Hey, what did you want
to talk to me about, anyway?

48:47.346 --> 48:48.846
Nothing.

48:51.058 --> 48:53.142
Nothing at all.

48:58.440 --> 49:01.484
So, this is me, riding it out.

49:01.610 --> 49:04.445
Harry may have rejected me,
but Deb clearly believes in me.

49:04.571 --> 49:06.364
So why shouldn't l?

49:06.490 --> 49:10.076
l'm not turning myself in.
This isn't Harry's life.

49:10.202 --> 49:11.661
It's mine.

49:11.787 --> 49:15.122
I made a pIan to frame Doakes
and l'm going to stick with it.

49:20.045 --> 49:22.254
Morgan.

49:22.381 --> 49:24.465
No shit?

49:25.801 --> 49:28.427
OK. OK, l'm on my way.

49:28.553 --> 49:31.472
They found Doakes's fucking rental car.

49:31.598 --> 49:33.808
They found. . . Really?

49:33.934 --> 49:36.644
His car? Did they find Doakes?

49:36.770 --> 49:38.729
No, not yet.
But the search grid's closing in.

49:38.855 --> 49:40.856
Come on, we got to get to the station.

49:40.983 --> 49:44.443
Actually l got to make sure
they don't find Doakes in a cage.

49:54.246 --> 49:55.705
Hallelujah.

49:58.041 --> 49:59.667
Hey!

49:59.793 --> 50:01.585
Hey, l'm in here!

50:03.964 --> 50:08.175
Who's out there? Anybody out there?

50:08.301 --> 50:10.928
Ending route guidance.

50:14.975 --> 50:16.392
Hello?

50:19.521 --> 50:21.647
Somebody in there?

50:24.359 --> 50:27.111
You have arrived at your destination.
