00:02.007 --> 00:03.007
Previously on Dexter...

00:03.133 --> 00:06.427
lf you were the Bay Harbor Butcher,
would you use a place like this?

00:06.553 --> 00:09.138
The conditions in this space
don't support his MO.

00:09.264 --> 00:11.306
Maybe the Butcher's
having an identity crisis.

00:11.433 --> 00:12.516
Your brother's a junkie.

00:12.642 --> 00:15.019
Are you high? He's never even
smoked a cigarette.

00:15.145 --> 00:16.895
Looks like Cody's enjoying himself.

00:17.022 --> 00:19.648
- Dexter's very patient with him.
- Dexter's a saint.

00:19.774 --> 00:21.942
l was hoping you could dig up
an old case file for me.

00:22.068 --> 00:25.279
- Got a date?
- lt's the crime scene where Harry found me.

00:25.405 --> 00:28.157
- How much?
- 300 bricks, give or take.

00:28.283 --> 00:30.617
l've been waiting for a chance
to take your ass out.

00:30.744 --> 00:32.161
l know how you feel, Sergeant.

00:32.287 --> 00:34.830
He crossed the line, Lieutenant.
He broke into my lab.

00:34.956 --> 00:38.167
- He's probably gonna start tailing me again.
- Sergeant Doakes tailed you?

00:38.293 --> 00:40.919
l followed him to an NA meeting.
That asshole lied about that, too.

00:41.046 --> 00:42.504
- You're obsessed.
- l'm not.

00:42.630 --> 00:43.922
And l need you to see it!

00:44.049 --> 00:46.425
Dinner was fantastic, Rita. Wow.

00:46.551 --> 00:47.801
l kind of like her.

00:49.137 --> 00:52.306
Dex, just calling to check in.
lmagine Rita's face if l told her

00:52.432 --> 00:54.725
that you and l had spent
the night together in a hotel.

00:54.851 --> 00:56.185
lt's over, Dexter.

00:57.228 --> 00:58.937
l guess l just hope with Lundy
it will be different.

00:59.064 --> 01:00.606
- Why?
- l respect him.

01:00.732 --> 01:01.940
You love him.

01:02.067 --> 01:04.193
No. He's like my dad.

01:04.319 --> 01:06.111
You want to tell me what's going on?

01:06.237 --> 01:08.614
You're the one who said
l'm supposed to feel my feelings!

01:08.740 --> 01:11.408
Well, now l'm telling you
to get them under control!

01:20.960 --> 01:22.753
Which step was that?

03:22.707 --> 03:25.125
Use the entire canvas.

03:26.211 --> 03:29.588
Start from the top.
Work your way down.

03:30.798 --> 03:34.218
Light, feathery strokes.

03:35.011 --> 03:36.762
Perfect!

03:36.888 --> 03:38.472
Stunning.

03:38.598 --> 03:41.975
Try longer strokes now.

03:42.101 --> 03:44.102
Perfect.

04:02.830 --> 04:04.915
You really know what you want, don't you?

04:09.921 --> 04:12.798
l hope you don't mind.

04:12.924 --> 04:14.841
Some men do.

04:14.968 --> 04:16.927
No.

04:17.053 --> 04:21.682
l've always found
instruction manuals. . .quite useful.

04:27.689 --> 04:31.108
OK, your turn.

04:32.568 --> 04:34.903
What do you want?

04:38.741 --> 04:40.909
l think that was it.

04:41.035 --> 04:44.288
Come on.

04:45.456 --> 04:48.625
You must have
some dark fantasies. . .

04:50.670 --> 04:53.255
unfulfilled urges.

04:54.799 --> 04:57.968
l'm pretty good at acting on those.

04:59.387 --> 05:01.013
Really?

05:01.139 --> 05:03.223
Then fuck me like that.

05:17.989 --> 05:20.407
Your light's burned out.

05:20.533 --> 05:22.159
lt's the wiring.

05:22.285 --> 05:26.913
l've been asking my landlord
to fix it for weeks.

05:29.792 --> 05:31.293
Well, now l can see better.

05:31.419 --> 05:33.879
That's where my landlord lives.

05:34.005 --> 05:35.964
Now he'll have to fix it.

05:38.176 --> 05:40.218
See you later.

05:44.807 --> 05:48.977
Got to admire Lila for taking things
into her own hands.

05:50.188 --> 05:52.189
That incIudes me.

05:57.570 --> 05:58.945
Mom.

05:59.072 --> 06:01.573
Come on, let's go! No more moping.

06:01.699 --> 06:03.784
l'm not moping. l'm sleeping.

06:03.910 --> 06:05.911
Oversleeping. Third time this week.

06:06.037 --> 06:10.707
The only way you're gonna get over Dexter is if
you take charge of your day.

06:11.876 --> 06:13.960
Come on. You're not
in high school any more.

06:14.087 --> 06:19.091
Go scrub your face.
and l'll heat up some oatmeal.

06:26.599 --> 06:29.017
Didn't hear you come in last night.

06:29.143 --> 06:32.771
Well, it was late. l was quiet.

06:32.897 --> 06:34.940
Yeah, you're good at quiet.

06:35.066 --> 06:37.567
Guess you kind of have to be
with me crashing here

06:37.693 --> 06:40.320
and Rita's mom over there.

06:40.446 --> 06:42.781
You and Rita fuck quiet too?

06:42.907 --> 06:45.075
And she's off, right out of the gate.

06:45.201 --> 06:48.954
Because me.
l wake the goddamn dead. lt's a problem.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.873
- Oh, l know, only too well.
- Scary, right?

06:51.999 --> 06:54.084
Sometimes l disturb myself.

06:54.210 --> 06:57.170
so. what kind
of noises does Rita make?

06:57.296 --> 07:02.008
Can we not talk about sex. . .or Rita?

07:02.927 --> 07:04.678
Why?

07:06.472 --> 07:08.473
'Cause we broke up. . .

07:08.599 --> 07:10.934
for real.

07:12.770 --> 07:14.604
lt's over.

07:16.607 --> 07:19.151
You break up, you get back together,
that's just what goes on.

07:19.277 --> 07:21.153
You and Rita are forever.

07:21.279 --> 07:23.822
Just say you're sorry
and send some fucking flowers.

07:23.948 --> 07:25.949
You're not hearing me.

07:27.702 --> 07:29.995
Look, when all this blows over,

07:30.121 --> 07:33.665
l'll spend a few days
at Gabriel's, and. . .

07:33.791 --> 07:36.793
you can screw Rita
as loud as you want.

07:48.973 --> 07:50.765
- Big news, Dex.
- Whoa!

07:50.892 --> 07:53.602
- Feel like l got caught in a wave.
- The Miami Tribune received

07:53.728 --> 07:56.062
a 32-page manifesto in the mail.

07:56.189 --> 07:58.356
lt's looking good
for the Bay Harbor Butcher.

07:58.483 --> 08:00.525
Well, l've heard that one before.

08:00.651 --> 08:02.152
Look, this may be legit.

08:02.278 --> 08:05.155
The manifesto includes the names
of three victims

08:05.281 --> 08:09.159
- we never released to the press.
- Oh. that is big news.

08:09.285 --> 08:12.370
l'm heading over to the Tribune now
for Special Agent Lundy.

08:12.497 --> 08:15.165
- He put me in charge of the team.
- Go. Angel.

08:15.291 --> 08:17.167
Yeah, l'm psyched.

08:18.753 --> 08:22.714
Yeah, me too. l'm about to be published.

08:22.840 --> 08:25.592
I sent that manifesto to the Tribune.

08:25.718 --> 08:29.221
Guess l've been taking
some cues from Lila lately,

08:29.347 --> 08:31.056
and not just in bed.

08:31.182 --> 08:34.100
I'm tired of reacting
to the moves of Agent Lundy

08:34.227 --> 08:35.894
and his super-posse.

08:36.020 --> 08:39.356
Time to control their actions for a change.

09:02.046 --> 09:05.465
Betsy Court, 1 6. Blunt-force beating.

09:05.591 --> 09:08.552
lt looks like she was sunning herself
and never saw it coming.

09:08.678 --> 09:10.095
Who called in the body?

09:10.221 --> 09:14.015
Craig Wilson, the stepfather.
He's right over there.

09:18.354 --> 09:20.230
Wilson told the reporting officer

09:20.356 --> 09:23.900
that he came home for lunch
and found her that way.

09:24.026 --> 09:26.278
You and Dexter resolve your issues?

09:26.404 --> 09:29.698
As far as l'm concerned. Why?
The bitch come crying to you again?

09:29.824 --> 09:33.785
No. There's blood work to be done here, and if
you can't control yourself,

09:33.911 --> 09:35.453
l need to call in another detective.

09:35.580 --> 09:37.789
l won't say anything to hurt
the little girl's feelings.

09:37.915 --> 09:40.458
- God damn it, James, l'm not joking.
- Do l look like l'm laughing?

09:40.585 --> 09:43.461
No. You don't. l wish you would.
You used to.

09:43.588 --> 09:45.088
Bullshit. l never laughed.

09:45.214 --> 09:48.008
Yeah, you know what?
You're probably right.

09:48.134 --> 09:50.969
Right, look, l'm not gonna try
to scare you any more.

09:51.095 --> 09:53.138
The reality is.
you're out of free passes.

09:53.264 --> 09:56.558
Now, l already stopped Dexter
from filing a complaint against you once.

09:56.684 --> 09:59.144
- l never asked you to do that, Maria.
- Well. l did it.

09:59.270 --> 10:02.230
out of my own concern
over your obsessive behavior.

10:02.356 --> 10:05.108
Now l'm on the line.
so if you bully Dexter in any way,

10:05.234 --> 10:08.069
if you even look at him wrong.
l will not be responsible for the fallout.

10:08.195 --> 10:10.697
- You got it?
- l got it.

10:12.116 --> 10:15.035
- You're backing the fucking freaktard.
- James.

10:26.464 --> 10:28.632
Where you been, Dexter?

10:28.758 --> 10:30.842
You don't bring me doughnuts.

10:30.968 --> 10:34.012
You don't sing me love songs.
How are you. Camilla?

10:35.514 --> 10:38.058
l've been better.

10:38.184 --> 10:40.310
Well, that doesn't sound good.

10:45.524 --> 10:48.610
Sergeant Doakes dropped by
my file room yesterday.

10:48.736 --> 10:52.947
He requested the case files
for the 1 973 shipping yard murders.

10:53.074 --> 10:56.910
l gave him the same line l gave you
when you came sniffing around.

10:57.036 --> 11:00.789
said all that old stuff was boxed up
in the basement of City Hall.

11:00.915 --> 11:03.291
That made him real angry.

11:04.502 --> 11:06.461
He scared me, Dexter.

11:07.588 --> 11:10.507
That's not right. He shouldn't do that.

11:10.633 --> 11:14.594
Look, Dex, l always assumed
that your father asked me

11:14.720 --> 11:17.722
to destroy those files to protect you.

11:17.848 --> 11:21.184
Now l'm not sure what's going on.

11:21.310 --> 11:24.229
- Camilla...
- Now, l don't want to know.

11:24.355 --> 11:27.023
l just don't want to get fired.

11:27.149 --> 11:29.192
l'm retiring next year. Did l tell you?

11:29.318 --> 11:32.696
l've been looking forward
to staying home with Gene.

11:32.822 --> 11:36.074
You won't lose your retirement.
l won't let that happen.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.411
l can stall Sergeant Doakes
for a few days,

11:39.537 --> 11:41.746
but eventually he'll figure out

11:41.872 --> 11:44.207
that that case file's missing,
just like you did.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.960
And he'll track it back to me,
you know, just like you did.

11:47.086 --> 11:50.714
l'll take care of this.
You have my word.

11:57.513 --> 11:59.347
So much for threatening Doakes.

11:59.473 --> 12:03.852
He won't back off tiII he exposes
the twisted branches of my family tree,

12:03.978 --> 12:07.147
from my father's indiscretions
to my murderous brother

12:07.273 --> 12:10.817
to the root of aII eviI - me.

12:25.374 --> 12:26.374
Hey.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.626
Why aren't you at the Tribune?

12:28.753 --> 12:30.420
What for?

12:30.546 --> 12:33.506
Our guy's not gonna leave
DNA evidence on a document.

12:33.632 --> 12:36.509
- Ah, but the thrill of the hunt.
- l've had that particular thrill.

12:36.635 --> 12:38.470
l'll leave it to younger men.

12:38.596 --> 12:41.306
Besides, it's easier for me
to do my part from here.

12:41.432 --> 12:43.016
Yeah? What part is that?

12:43.142 --> 12:48.438
Operating on favors.
political leanings, posturing.

12:50.107 --> 12:52.942
l've been trying to find the right music.

12:54.528 --> 12:56.529
Right.

12:56.655 --> 12:59.866
so. l'm off duty today.
but here are those marina reports.

12:59.992 --> 13:01.701
And after my workout,

13:01.827 --> 13:04.954
l'll swing by and pick up a copy
of the manifesto.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.290
Look at that board.

13:07.416 --> 13:11.836
These kills are precise.
but there's also a fluidity,

13:11.962 --> 13:14.130
even some improvisation.

13:15.299 --> 13:18.134
lf l could just find the music. . .

13:18.260 --> 13:21.137
Want to borrow my iPod?

13:22.765 --> 13:24.307
Got any Chopin?

13:25.351 --> 13:27.811
No. Fresh out of Chopin.

13:27.937 --> 13:31.689
Shit. Chopin's perfect.

13:31.816 --> 13:33.441
Did you just swear?

13:34.652 --> 13:38.112
What can l say?
You're rubbing off on me, Morgan.

13:38.239 --> 13:39.906
But Chopin is perfect.

13:41.992 --> 13:44.452
So this is how you do what you do.

13:47.498 --> 13:51.459
The truth speaks to me
from a peaceful place.

13:51.585 --> 13:55.505
l got to set the stage to hear it.
You know what l mean?

13:55.631 --> 13:57.340
No.

13:58.676 --> 14:01.344
l thrive on chaos.

14:08.519 --> 14:10.687
But this is good too.

14:25.286 --> 14:28.079
l didn't kill her.

14:28.205 --> 14:31.374
l was just trying
to stop the blood. Just the. . .

14:33.419 --> 14:35.420
No forcefuI impact spatter -

14:35.546 --> 14:37.922
he's telling the truth. l can tell.

14:38.048 --> 14:39.632
Palms up, please.

14:44.471 --> 14:47.432
When l found Betsy.
she was still breathing.

14:47.558 --> 14:49.100
l wanted to help her.

14:51.979 --> 14:53.646
You believe me, right?

14:53.772 --> 14:56.566
l'm just the lab guy, Mr. Wilson. Sorry.

14:58.235 --> 15:00.278
Arms down at your sides, please.

15:04.575 --> 15:06.451
Blood misting. Huh.

15:09.914 --> 15:13.958
l need to collect his shirt
for evidence.

15:19.298 --> 15:21.049
Morgan!

15:24.511 --> 15:28.222
The girl's mother was at work,
but she isn't really defending her husband.

15:28.349 --> 15:30.475
Wilson and his stepdaughter
fought all the time.

15:30.601 --> 15:32.810
The neighbors heard him
yelling at her this morning.

15:32.937 --> 15:35.480
Then he comes home for lunch -
motive and opportunity.

15:35.606 --> 15:36.856
What'd the blood say?

15:36.982 --> 15:38.983
Well, the blood on his hands
could have come

15:39.109 --> 15:41.444
from trying to help her,
like he claims.

15:43.822 --> 15:47.450
But l did detect
a blood mist on his shirt.

15:47.576 --> 15:51.788
A blood mist - the kind that comes from beating
on a teenage girl?

15:51.914 --> 15:53.122
No.

15:53.248 --> 15:55.959
- Yes.
- You're absolutely sure?

15:56.085 --> 15:58.002
lt's too fine for a bludgeoning.

15:58.128 --> 16:00.171
The mist is from a bludgeoning.

16:00.297 --> 16:03.883
Medium-velocity impact spatters,
no doubt about it.

16:04.009 --> 16:05.218
OK, Morgan.

16:05.344 --> 16:09.138
Just make sure you get me
your blood report as soon as possible.

16:15.646 --> 16:17.730
This is my chance
to make Doakes go away

16:17.856 --> 16:20.692
without spilling a single drop
of his bIood.

16:20.818 --> 16:24.946
Of course, l have to sell
an innocent man down the river.

16:25.823 --> 16:29.951
Sorry, Mr. Wilson,
but l won't let you float too far.

16:39.044 --> 16:40.712
l was just thinking about you.

16:40.838 --> 16:42.964
l like the sound of that.

16:43.090 --> 16:46.175
Yeah, l had to do a little
creative problem-solving

16:46.301 --> 16:48.177
at someone else's expense.

16:48.303 --> 16:49.679
Bravo.

16:49.805 --> 16:52.849
Yeah, l figured you'd like that.
What's up?

16:52.975 --> 16:57.020
Well, you know that art installation
that l've been working on?

16:57.146 --> 16:58.813
The cannibals.

16:58.939 --> 17:02.984
They're not cannibals.
How barbaric!

17:03.110 --> 17:07.488
Their eating is symbolic of the way
we consume others to feed our needs.

17:07.614 --> 17:09.240
That's what l meant.

17:09.366 --> 17:11.868
Well, it sold.

17:11.994 --> 17:14.037
l didn't even create it to sell,

17:14.163 --> 17:17.623
but one of my buyers fell in love with it,
and l named an outrageous price,

17:17.750 --> 17:20.293
and she paid me a deposit on the spot.

17:20.419 --> 17:22.420
So. . .

17:23.464 --> 17:25.673
you in the mood to celebrate?

17:34.058 --> 17:35.767
Definitely.

17:50.032 --> 17:53.326
l'm afraid we just can't
seat you tonight without a reservation.

17:53.452 --> 17:55.787
As you can see.
we are completely at capacity.

17:55.913 --> 17:58.623
- Oh, well. . .
- No, l'm sorry. You have to help us.

17:58.749 --> 18:00.792
l made this reservation
two months ago.

18:00.918 --> 18:03.336
This is our ten-year anniversary.

18:03.462 --> 18:06.464
This is the place where
Dexter proposed to me.

18:06.590 --> 18:10.218
On the patio, in front of the fountain.

18:11.678 --> 18:14.555
He told me to make a wish,
and when l looked down,

18:14.681 --> 18:19.185
there was my diamond ring,
sparkling under the water.

18:20.270 --> 18:22.605
That is so romantic.

18:24.274 --> 18:25.983
ln case you're wondering,

18:26.110 --> 18:28.319
there's nothing sparkling
under that water tonight.

18:28.445 --> 18:31.906
Oh, l'm sure you'll dazzle me somehow.

18:32.032 --> 18:35.076
You're a creative
problem-solver now, right?

18:35.202 --> 18:38.830
A changed man, or at least changing.

18:38.956 --> 18:40.623
l suppose.

18:40.749 --> 18:43.501
There's no supposing
about it, Dexter.

18:43.627 --> 18:47.630
You've taken control of your addiction
in a way that few people do.

18:49.258 --> 18:52.760
lt's been about a week since we've even
discussed your recovery.

18:53.387 --> 18:55.304
l think you're right.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.683
And you haven't felt the need to use?

18:58.809 --> 19:01.185
lncredibly, no. l feel. . .

19:02.771 --> 19:06.983
you know, like l'm finally
in control of things again.

19:08.318 --> 19:12.905
We call that warm fuzzy feeling
the pink cloud.

19:13.031 --> 19:16.200
lt's when an addict experiences
acceptance for the first time.

19:17.828 --> 19:19.787
You're saying it won't last?

19:21.123 --> 19:24.000
l'm saying that you have
to work it. that's all.

19:24.126 --> 19:27.086
But l know that you will,

19:27.212 --> 19:32.008
because l believe that we've found
a true substitute for your addiction.

19:33.343 --> 19:35.469
What's that?

19:36.346 --> 19:37.847
Life.

19:46.523 --> 19:49.108
You're making us all look bad.

19:49.234 --> 19:50.902
l'm the manager of ll Bistro Vino.

19:51.028 --> 19:52.904
Happy anniversary - on the house.

19:53.030 --> 19:54.864
Thank you.

19:54.990 --> 19:56.908
Oh, did you hear that, darling?

19:57.034 --> 19:59.202
Oh, l heard it. . .darling.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.120
Enjoy your evening.

20:01.246 --> 20:02.914
Thank you.

20:04.499 --> 20:06.083
Happy anniversary, my love.

20:06.210 --> 20:09.420
- Aren't we in recovery?
- Oh, this? lt's just bubbles.

20:09.546 --> 20:13.007
We're not gonna shoot it up, are we?

20:13.133 --> 20:15.134
You really have a way. You know that?

20:15.260 --> 20:18.179
- A way of what?
- Of whatever the hell you want.

20:18.305 --> 20:22.516
Well, here's to ten more glorious years

20:22.643 --> 20:24.852
of whatever the hell l want.

20:31.735 --> 20:36.781
Hi, l'm Cody, and l researched Saudi Arabia
for my cultural report.

20:36.907 --> 20:40.326
That's good. sweetie.
Now, look at me when you talk, OK?

20:40.452 --> 20:42.787
And try and stand up straight.

20:42.913 --> 20:44.956
My board is covered in sand

20:45.082 --> 20:48.542
because Saudi Arabia
is one big desert.

20:48.669 --> 20:52.129
- One great big desert.
- One great big desert.

20:52.256 --> 20:55.800
lt only rains in a tiny corner
of the country.

20:55.926 --> 20:57.843
so they save rainwater. . .

20:57.970 --> 21:00.179
OK. now. try and keep
your fingers off your face.

21:00.305 --> 21:02.640
You don't want people to think
you're picking your nose.

21:02.766 --> 21:05.226
You mean like this?

21:06.311 --> 21:09.438
Cody, you need to take this seriously.

21:10.357 --> 21:12.566
Dexter said it should be fun.

21:13.443 --> 21:15.778
Dexter does drugs. He's wrong.

21:15.904 --> 21:18.322
l finished my homework.

21:18.448 --> 21:20.533
For the week?

21:22.452 --> 21:23.911
Hey, guys. l'm home.

21:24.037 --> 21:25.079
- Mom!
- Sorry l'm so late.

21:25.205 --> 21:26.872
l'm so happy to see you!

21:26.999 --> 21:28.624
Mom!

21:28.750 --> 21:30.918
Oh, wow! What a greeting.

21:31.044 --> 21:33.546
OK, why don't you guys
go get ready for bed?

21:33.672 --> 21:36.757
- Really, Mom? l just got home.
- They need their rest.

21:36.883 --> 21:40.136
l will be in in just a minute
to check on you.

21:42.973 --> 21:45.808
Those two are making
great progress.

21:45.934 --> 21:49.145
- Progress? Towards what?
- Their full potential!

21:53.984 --> 21:56.444
Mom, l know you're really good
at these things,

21:56.570 --> 22:00.197
but now that you're here, have you thought
about applying for a teaching job?

22:00.324 --> 22:02.742
No, l'm through with the schools.

22:02.868 --> 22:05.244
Well, l thought teaching was your life.

22:05.370 --> 22:08.748
And your children are going
to be the beneficiaries

22:08.874 --> 22:11.125
of all that l have to offer.

22:14.087 --> 22:18.007
Our injunction stopped the Tribune
from publishing the manifesto -

22:18.133 --> 22:19.467
for now.

22:19.593 --> 22:22.136
At the very least, we'll have time
to get a jump on things

22:22.262 --> 22:24.221
before the news frenzy hits.

22:24.348 --> 22:27.308
So, let's take advantage
of this window.

22:27.434 --> 22:30.728
Our goal for the next 48 hours
is to wade through

22:30.854 --> 22:32.938
this shining piece
of social commentary.

22:33.065 --> 22:36.442
l've never seen so many dense
and convoluted ideas in my life,

22:36.568 --> 22:40.071
but we need to search them all
for clues to his identity.

22:40.197 --> 22:43.032
- So, first impressions?
- l got something.

22:43.158 --> 22:46.118
There are a lot of literary references
in this document.

22:46.244 --> 22:47.912
- How do you know?
- l like to read books.

22:48.038 --> 22:51.123
- What kind of books?
- All kinds. Who cares?

22:52.167 --> 22:56.379
Anyway. . . l see lots of references,
like this one.

22:56.505 --> 22:59.423
"You can't depend on your eyes

22:59.549 --> 23:02.134
"when your imagination
is out of focus."

23:02.928 --> 23:04.595
He's a Trekker!

23:04.721 --> 23:07.098
That shit's straight from Deep Space Nine.

23:07.224 --> 23:09.517
What? Mark Twain said that.

23:09.643 --> 23:11.644
lt's one of his most famous quotes.

23:11.770 --> 23:15.523
Twain was never on Deep Space Nine.
He was on Next Generation.

23:15.649 --> 23:18.275
- He didn't say it on Star Trek.
- OK. so what's it from?

23:18.402 --> 23:20.694
A Connecticut Yankee
ln King Arthur's Court.

23:22.406 --> 23:28.077
Angel, what other literary quotes
are in that manifesto?

23:33.708 --> 23:37.628
This guy, he's the best boxing student
l have ever had.

23:37.754 --> 23:40.631
After four weeks,
he's getting in shots to my head.

23:40.757 --> 23:43.008
Then finally he says,
"l think l'm ready."

23:43.135 --> 23:45.511
l'm like, "You're ready for what?"

23:45.637 --> 23:49.723
And he says, "To kick my mom's ass."

23:49.850 --> 23:51.851
l'm like, "You're learning how to box

23:51.977 --> 23:54.061
"because you want to beat up
your mom?"

24:21.548 --> 24:23.215
What the fuck?

24:23.341 --> 24:26.177
Did you hear what l said?
l was gonna hit the showers.

24:26.303 --> 24:29.930
- l'll meet you back here in ten minutes.
- OK, yeah, ten minutes.

24:52.579 --> 24:55.372
Who the fuck are you?

24:56.833 --> 25:00.169
Oh, hi! l'm Lila.

25:00.295 --> 25:02.254
Oh, pardon my tits.

25:02.380 --> 25:05.716
We thought you were crashing
at your boyfriend's tonight.

25:05.842 --> 25:07.510
We? We who?

25:08.845 --> 25:10.012
Dexter and l.

25:11.806 --> 25:14.475
Could you just. . .wait here a minute?

25:19.272 --> 25:21.440
Who's the skank?

25:21.566 --> 25:23.651
Deb, did knocking occur to you?

25:23.777 --> 25:27.613
Who is she? And are you trying to fuck her
or set her on fire?

25:28.949 --> 25:31.617
l didn't do this to you when you
were riding square-jaw guy

25:31.743 --> 25:33.744
- with the handcuffs.
- That's different.

25:33.870 --> 25:36.413
l wasn't cheating on anyone with Gabriel.

25:36.540 --> 25:38.916
How could you do this to Rita,
not to mention her kids?

25:39.042 --> 25:42.711
- You're like their father.
- Hey, Rita broke up with me, OK?

25:44.381 --> 25:45.923
You fucked up, Dex. . .

25:47.717 --> 25:49.510
big time.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.804
Excuse me.

26:06.570 --> 26:08.529
Don't worry.

26:08.655 --> 26:11.323
She just needs some time
to adjust, that's all.

26:16.997 --> 26:19.331
l had officers tear apart
the stepfather's house.

26:19.457 --> 26:21.458
No murder weapon,
but he had to hide it somewhere.

26:21.585 --> 26:23.335
- Where is Wilson now?
- lnterview room two.

26:23.461 --> 26:27.381
We still have him?
Why didn't his lawyer post bond?

26:27.507 --> 26:31.135
Well. he tried. but l pulled in a favor at
the courthouse and got a bail enhancement,

26:31.261 --> 26:33.804
so they had to start
the paperwork all over again.

26:33.930 --> 26:36.098
l'm gonna break that cocksucker today.

26:36.224 --> 26:38.767
What evidence you say
we got on this guy?

26:39.603 --> 26:42.146
He was dripping in the victim's blood.
He was home alone with her.

26:42.272 --> 26:44.607
- They fought the morning of the murder.
- All circumstantial.

26:44.733 --> 26:46.817
Yeah, but the blood spatter
on his shirt was a direct result

26:46.943 --> 26:49.486
of a blunt-force beating, Maria.

26:49.613 --> 26:51.322
l'd like to see the blood report.

26:51.448 --> 26:53.449
You'll get it as soon as l do.

26:53.575 --> 26:56.535
lf you're looking for me,
l'll be questioning the suspect.

27:13.970 --> 27:16.639
They're still playing my tune.

27:19.017 --> 27:21.852
lt's like l'm conducting
a final symphony,

27:21.978 --> 27:24.647
Requiem For Demonic Dexter.

27:31.321 --> 27:35.991
And forming the entire brass section,
Sergeant James Doakes.

27:36.117 --> 27:39.036
When I reach the end,
maybe l can lay to rest the monster

27:39.162 --> 27:41.163
formerly known as Dexter.

27:43.500 --> 27:46.335
Just hang in there, Mr. Wilson.

27:59.933 --> 28:04.395
l've asked a psycholinguist at MlT
to analyze our manifesto.

28:04.521 --> 28:07.898
His computer tabulates
punctuation, misspellings,

28:08.024 --> 28:10.567
and sentence structure
to identify a set of key words,

28:10.694 --> 28:13.737
which he'll use to create
a profile of our killer.

28:13.863 --> 28:17.908
Sounds. . .complicated. Stay on it.

28:19.035 --> 28:21.120
OK, we've been at this too long.

28:21.246 --> 28:23.330
lt's one o'clock.

28:23.456 --> 28:25.541
Let's break for lunch.

28:35.301 --> 28:36.885
Are you all right?

28:37.011 --> 28:39.054
Huh? Yeah, l'm fine.

28:40.473 --> 28:42.933
Anything you want to talk about?

28:43.059 --> 28:45.310
No, not really.

28:45.437 --> 28:47.563
- Well, if you change your mind. . .
- lt's my brother.

28:47.689 --> 28:49.732
He was dating this chick.

28:49.858 --> 28:52.276
Super-sweet, a little doe-eyed.

28:52.402 --> 28:55.904
But, God, for him, fucking perfect,
and he just threw her away.

28:56.030 --> 28:58.574
l'm just pissed at Dexter,
not to mention my boyfriend,

28:58.700 --> 29:00.409
who did absolutely nothing wrong,

29:00.535 --> 29:02.911
but every time he opened
his mouth last night.

29:03.037 --> 29:06.165
- l wanted to fucking slap him.
- You've been listening to Chopin.

29:06.291 --> 29:08.625
Yeah, l downloaded a Chopin.

29:08.752 --> 29:12.296
Nocturne number 2 in E flat major.

29:12.422 --> 29:13.964
One of my favorites.

29:14.090 --> 29:17.426
lt can have this effect on people.

29:17.552 --> 29:19.553
lt can stir up some dust.

29:19.679 --> 29:21.930
No shit.

29:28.938 --> 29:32.274
Listen. You...you can heal yourself, sir.

29:33.443 --> 29:36.111
Just... You just need to talk to me

29:36.237 --> 29:39.156
Get it off you, otherwise it's gonna
haunt you for the rest of your life.

29:39.282 --> 29:42.659
Why don"t you just
Iisten to me? I didn't do this.

29:42.786 --> 29:46.330
You...you can't say it
and make it true.

29:46.456 --> 29:48.499
You have a conscience,

29:48.625 --> 29:51.168
and it's really fucking with you right now.

29:51.294 --> 29:53.295
I wish it were me. I wish I were dead.

29:53.421 --> 29:54.755
Yeah.

29:54.881 --> 29:58.300
- Why are we questioning that guy?
- He's a murder suspect.

29:58.426 --> 30:00.511
No, he's not. He's innocent.

30:01.471 --> 30:04.473
- What did you say?
- My blood report backed his story.

30:04.599 --> 30:06.183
Mr. Wilson found his stepdaughter dead,

30:06.309 --> 30:08.393
just like l told sergeant Doakes
at the crime scene.

30:08.520 --> 30:11.146
You turned in the blood report? When?

30:11.272 --> 30:14.358
l don't know. at some point
before l went home last night.

30:14.484 --> 30:17.903
l put it right on the sergeant's desk,
just like he asked.

30:18.029 --> 30:19.738
lt's the green folder.

30:23.243 --> 30:25.035
Yeah, according to my findings,

30:25.161 --> 30:27.329
the mist on the stepfather's shirt
was exhaled

30:27.455 --> 30:29.456
from the victim
when he tried to revive her.

30:29.582 --> 30:33.752
The autopsy confirmed she had severe internal
bleeding due to the bludgeoning.

30:33.878 --> 30:35.921
Yeah, but he could have beaten her first.

30:36.047 --> 30:37.589
That's impossible.

30:37.715 --> 30:43.220
The crime-scene photos show blood radiating
outward around the victim's body.

30:43.346 --> 30:45.556
That kind of bludgeoning would have
covered the real killer

30:45.682 --> 30:47.933
in blood from head to toe.

30:49.352 --> 30:51.186
Thanks.

30:55.358 --> 30:57.568
- Mr. Wilson, you're free to go.
- What the hell?

30:57.694 --> 31:00.362
- This man is a killer.
- This man has been through enough

31:00.488 --> 31:02.573
for one day.

31:02.699 --> 31:04.741
There's an officer in the hallway.

31:04.868 --> 31:07.744
He'll see that you get your personal belongings
back and take you home.

31:07.871 --> 31:10.831
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you so much.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.424
What the hell are you doing?

31:20.550 --> 31:22.593
Trying to save your career, James,
if it isn't too late.

31:22.719 --> 31:25.929
- Did you even check the blood report?
- l didn't get the blood report.

31:26.055 --> 31:29.266
lt's on your desk,
and it exonerates your suspect.

31:29.392 --> 31:31.476
We should be out there
looking for the real killer.

31:31.603 --> 31:33.687
Maria, that is not what he told me at. . .

31:35.565 --> 31:37.399
That motherfucker.

31:37.525 --> 31:39.568
He's good.

31:39.694 --> 31:41.069
Who?

31:41.195 --> 31:44.948
Morgan. He planned this whole thing.

31:45.074 --> 31:46.950
Maria, that psychopath set me up.

31:47.076 --> 31:49.536
Dexter again?
You're blaming Dexter for this?

31:49.662 --> 31:52.414
Do you have any idea
how pathetic that sounds?

31:52.540 --> 31:54.291
This is not about Dexter!

31:54.417 --> 31:56.960
This is about the poorjudgment
you have been displaying

31:57.086 --> 31:59.254
in this department for months now!

32:02.508 --> 32:05.218
- You want to work out?
- No.

32:08.806 --> 32:10.933
l wasn't talking about the gym.

32:13.519 --> 32:16.897
You're sweet.
but l'm really not in the mood.

32:19.108 --> 32:21.193
So, what do you want to do?

32:29.285 --> 32:31.411
l think l want to break up.

32:35.458 --> 32:37.501
For real?

32:37.627 --> 32:38.961
Yeah.

32:39.837 --> 32:41.296
ls that OK?

32:45.510 --> 32:48.762
No. No, it's not OK.

32:48.888 --> 32:52.516
- Fuck, what did l do, Deb?
- Nothing. l swear to God.

32:52.642 --> 32:57.688
You're. . .smoking hot and. . .fun. . .

32:57.814 --> 33:00.983
and. . .soulful and. . .

33:01.109 --> 33:02.901
age-appropriate.

33:03.027 --> 33:05.904
- And but what?
- But. . .

33:06.030 --> 33:10.200
sometimes the truth speaks
from a peaceful place.

33:11.995 --> 33:15.789
lt's taken me a long time to find that place, but
l think l have,

33:15.915 --> 33:19.167
and it's telling me
you're not the right one for me.

33:26.801 --> 33:28.260
l'm so sorry.

33:35.351 --> 33:37.310
You live in a nice neighborhood.

33:37.437 --> 33:39.229
Yeah, l had no idea.

33:39.355 --> 33:41.940
l'm usually passing
by at 35 miles per hour.

33:42.066 --> 33:43.900
l'm not a real big walker.

33:44.027 --> 33:47.904
Everybody walks in London.

33:48.031 --> 33:51.575
Of course, they're usually
walking to the pub.

33:51.701 --> 33:53.618
How far are we going?

33:56.289 --> 33:58.915
You're a bit grumpy tonight.

33:59.042 --> 34:00.876
What's wrong?

34:05.715 --> 34:09.009
Come on. Don't close up on me now.

34:09.135 --> 34:13.096
No. l honestly don't know.
l mean, thanks to you, things are. . .

34:13.222 --> 34:14.765
actually looking up.

34:14.891 --> 34:17.934
Some people at work
have been. . .after me.

34:18.061 --> 34:20.729
l think l have 'em under control.

34:22.190 --> 34:25.901
So, why the grouchiness?

34:27.570 --> 34:30.489
ls it because your sister thinks
l'm a trollop?

34:30.615 --> 34:34.618
lt's not just. . . Deb.

34:34.744 --> 34:38.497
lt's the suddenness of all of this -

34:39.665 --> 34:41.792
losing Rita, the kids.

34:41.918 --> 34:46.421
They've been the only thing
keeping me human

34:46.547 --> 34:49.216
for a long time.

34:53.596 --> 34:55.722
Were they keeping you human, though,

34:55.848 --> 34:58.892
or were they the ones
making you feel like the monster

34:59.018 --> 35:00.936
that you were talking about?

35:06.067 --> 35:07.901
Keep going.

35:08.027 --> 35:10.153
Your friends and family
have to accept you

35:10.279 --> 35:13.949
for who you're evolving into
now that you're clean.

35:16.494 --> 35:19.788
ls that what l am? Clean?

35:22.333 --> 35:25.293
'Cause l don't feel that way at all.

35:27.547 --> 35:30.507
No, you certainly don't.

35:35.221 --> 35:36.972
God.

35:37.849 --> 35:40.475
l wish l could fuck you right now.

35:49.986 --> 35:52.445
- Whose house is this?
- Couldn't tell you.

35:52.572 --> 35:54.823
God.

35:54.949 --> 35:56.992
A man of many talents.

36:26.022 --> 36:29.232
Look. l'm some old bitch.

36:29.358 --> 36:32.360
Better not press our luck. We should go.

36:36.699 --> 36:38.575
Hello?

36:38.701 --> 36:40.827
Hi, Dexter.

36:40.953 --> 36:42.495
Cody?

36:43.664 --> 36:46.124
Can you come
to my school tomorrow?

36:46.250 --> 36:48.627
What's at your school, buddy?

36:48.753 --> 36:51.213
l'm doing my cultural report.

36:52.798 --> 36:55.258
Saudi Arabia.

36:55.384 --> 36:58.178
Can you watch me?
l'm kind of scared.

36:58.304 --> 37:00.388
Cody, what are you doing?

37:03.476 --> 37:04.976
Who is this?

37:05.770 --> 37:07.229
Dexter.

37:11.567 --> 37:13.777
Hello?

37:16.656 --> 37:18.531
Who was that?

37:20.785 --> 37:25.038
Rita's son. He wants me to come see him
at school tomorrow.

37:26.123 --> 37:28.208
Oh, poor kid.

37:28.334 --> 37:31.419
He doesn't understand
that you've gone.

37:34.173 --> 37:35.757
l think l'll go.

37:41.889 --> 37:44.015
Whatever you think's best.

37:53.401 --> 37:55.110
Hey, guys!

37:55.236 --> 37:57.320
l'm home!

38:00.199 --> 38:01.491
Hello?

38:01.617 --> 38:04.661
- They're in bed.
- Why so early?

38:04.787 --> 38:07.163
Cody is being punished
for sneaking away

38:07.290 --> 38:09.541
to make a phone call
without permission.

38:09.667 --> 38:12.502
Astor joined him in a misguided
show of support.

38:12.628 --> 38:15.005
Well, who was Cody calling?

38:15.131 --> 38:16.172
Dexter.

38:16.299 --> 38:19.134
The boy was trying
to invite him to his school.

38:19.260 --> 38:21.303
- Can you imagine?
- Oh.

38:22.596 --> 38:27.892
Mom, we need to have a talk.
l made a phone call of my own today.

38:28.019 --> 38:29.811
l spoke with Aunt Cecilia.

38:29.937 --> 38:33.773
She told me the school district
fired you almost a year ago.

38:36.861 --> 38:39.696
We had philosophical differences.

38:39.822 --> 38:42.532
The educational system is falling apart.

38:42.658 --> 38:46.202
School should be life itself,
not a preparation for living.

38:46.329 --> 38:49.539
Do you know that they give
trophies to every child now

38:49.665 --> 38:52.417
- whether they win or lose?
- Yeah, l finally get it.

38:52.543 --> 38:56.129
lt took me a few decades,
but it's not just me.

38:56.255 --> 38:58.089
nobody can deal with you.

38:58.215 --> 39:01.384
You don't leave room
for anybody else to exist.

39:01.510 --> 39:04.346
lt's not my fault that
so many people are willing

39:04.472 --> 39:05.847
to settle for mediocrity.

39:05.973 --> 39:09.142
Just look at you.
First Paul, then Dexter.

39:09.268 --> 39:11.770
Rita, you lack even common sense,

39:11.896 --> 39:15.523
and now you're passing
that torch of ordinary character

39:15.649 --> 39:17.650
on to your children.

39:17.777 --> 39:19.277
Shut the fuck up.

39:21.364 --> 39:23.406
Nobody talks about my kids that way.

39:24.700 --> 39:26.701
Thatagirl.

39:26.827 --> 39:28.703
That's what l've been waiting to see.

39:28.829 --> 39:32.040
- Yeah! l'm done with you.
- No, you're not.

39:32.166 --> 39:34.876
But you go. You give me hell.

39:35.002 --> 39:38.004
No. No, l won't do that.

39:38.130 --> 39:40.840
l won't let you turn me into. . .you.

39:40.966 --> 39:43.259
- Rita...
- Here's what's gonna happen.

39:43.386 --> 39:46.596
First thing in the morning,
you're gonna pack up and go home.

39:46.722 --> 39:49.599
You'll come and visit us
for birthdays and holidays,

39:49.725 --> 39:52.435
but you're not gonna live
with us any more.

39:54.647 --> 39:56.189
Well. . .

39:58.818 --> 40:03.488
if that's what l have to sacrifice
to get you on your feet...

40:16.085 --> 40:18.294
"Kill one man.
and you're a murderer.

40:18.421 --> 40:20.004
"Kill thousands, a conqueror.

40:20.131 --> 40:21.881
"Kill them all, and you're a god."

40:22.007 --> 40:23.633
Does it sound to you like our guy

40:23.759 --> 40:27.303
has a narcissistic personality disorder,
a classic God complex?

40:27.430 --> 40:29.472
l think you're onto something, Angel.

40:30.391 --> 40:32.976
To tell you the truth, l don't know
what my alter ego had in mind

40:33.102 --> 40:34.477
when he wrote that crap.

40:34.603 --> 40:36.896
l just pulled from various
blogs on the internet,

40:37.022 --> 40:40.024
mixed and matched...
presto manifesto.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.950
You finally decided to fight back.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.079
l been waiting.

40:54.707 --> 40:56.666
Hope you don't expect me
to comment on that

40:56.792 --> 40:58.751
so you can record it on your hidden
tape recorder.

40:58.878 --> 41:00.003
l wasn't born yesterday.

41:00.129 --> 41:02.255
You might have been, for all l know.

41:02.381 --> 41:05.467
Your past is a bigger mystery
than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.

41:06.385 --> 41:09.429
l tried every avenue,
legal and otherwise.

41:09.555 --> 41:14.392
but there ain't no paper trail
on the early years of Dexter Morgan.

41:16.020 --> 41:18.021
l guess there's no recorder
running. after all.

41:18.147 --> 41:21.065
No, man.

41:21.192 --> 41:23.526
Unlike you, l do everything
out in the open.

41:26.405 --> 41:30.492
Well, in that case, Sergeant,
let me put this in the open for you.

41:33.120 --> 41:36.998
No matter what you try, no matter when,
no matter how hard you work,

41:37.124 --> 41:40.710
l'll always be a step ahead of you
for one simple reason.

41:42.046 --> 41:43.630
And what's that?

41:43.756 --> 41:45.507
l own you.

41:49.261 --> 41:50.386
Fuck!

42:03.651 --> 42:07.946
Get him off of me! Get off me!

42:08.072 --> 42:10.573
Why are you doing this?

42:10.699 --> 42:12.158
Stop!

42:19.708 --> 42:21.751
l want your gun,

42:21.877 --> 42:23.711
your badge, and your police lD.

42:23.837 --> 42:25.964
l want your access card too.

42:26.090 --> 42:27.298
Now!

42:27.424 --> 42:31.553
Type a statement that Sergeant Doakes
is on administrative leave.

42:31.679 --> 42:35.139
pending an internal affairs investigation.

42:38.060 --> 42:40.144
You two, get him out of here.

42:41.188 --> 42:42.647
Thanks.

42:51.824 --> 42:53.616
What the hell happened?

42:53.742 --> 42:57.245
l don't know. He just. . .jumped me.

43:00.874 --> 43:03.751
That guy's always had it out for me.

43:13.929 --> 43:17.640
- Thanks for meeting with me, Don.
- Well, l don't know what the point is.

43:17.766 --> 43:20.476
The district court injunction hearing
starts in three hours.

43:20.603 --> 43:23.354
Which everyone here knows
we're going to lose.

43:24.273 --> 43:26.566
Don't look so shocked.
We always lose these things.

43:26.692 --> 43:28.651
You bastards and your free speech.

43:28.777 --> 43:32.488
My boss never lets me say anything.

43:32.615 --> 43:34.198
l'll tell you what -

43:34.325 --> 43:36.868
l will agree to dropping the injunction,

43:36.994 --> 43:39.829
which will save us days
of courtroom arguments

43:39.955 --> 43:41.706
and a boatload of legal fees,

43:41.832 --> 43:45.501
if we can agree
on some simple ground rules

43:45.628 --> 43:47.462
on how you publish that document.

43:47.588 --> 43:50.214
Ground rules?
We're not gonna have any ground rules.

43:50.341 --> 43:54.052
My only goal here is to avoid
compromising an investigation

43:54.178 --> 43:56.262
of a mass murderer. . .

43:56.388 --> 43:58.473
who could hurt a lot more people.

44:01.018 --> 44:03.311
Give me just a second, will you, Frank?

44:10.611 --> 44:12.612
l can't believe you got those assholes

44:12.738 --> 44:15.657
to publish the manifesto
without the victims' names

44:15.783 --> 44:19.952
- and as a page-three story.
- No sense hyping it.

44:20.079 --> 44:22.205
lt might just inspire the killer
to greater heights.

44:22.331 --> 44:25.333
Wait. lt's quiet here. . .

44:25.459 --> 44:27.669
peaceful.

44:27.795 --> 44:29.837
lt's a good spot.

44:29.963 --> 44:31.756
For what?

44:31.882 --> 44:33.758
lt's one o'clock.

44:36.512 --> 44:38.179
So it is.

44:41.975 --> 44:44.018
l brought my own sandwich.

44:47.898 --> 44:50.066
l thought you didn't like the quiet, Morgan.

44:50.192 --> 44:53.027
l didn't. l don't.

44:55.656 --> 44:58.574
When l'm alone and it's quiet,
l get scared. . .

44:58.701 --> 45:00.368
shitless,

45:00.494 --> 45:05.915
like l start hearing
what's really going on inside.

45:06.041 --> 45:07.792
l see.

45:07.918 --> 45:09.585
So if it's all the same to you,

45:09.712 --> 45:12.547
maybe l can just practice
when you're around.

45:13.590 --> 45:15.383
OK.

45:16.969 --> 45:20.638
'Cause when you're around, l kind of feel like
l can deal with anything. you know?

45:22.307 --> 45:24.392
Like what happened to me -

45:26.729 --> 45:29.272
l don't have to run from it.

45:29.398 --> 45:33.025
l don't have to jump into bed
with some guy and hide there.

45:37.406 --> 45:39.449
You give me strength.

45:46.623 --> 45:49.333
l'm kind of opening up here.

45:50.627 --> 45:53.045
What do you want me to say?

45:54.131 --> 45:55.923
l don't know.

45:56.049 --> 46:00.303
You're the fucking Zen master.
Figure it out.

46:04.224 --> 46:05.975
Morgan. . .

46:06.101 --> 46:10.188
l've got plaque in my arteries.
l know the lyrics to elevator music.

46:10.314 --> 46:11.981
My hair isn't getting any thicker.

46:50.229 --> 46:53.022
You're gonna do great up there.
You just have to remember something -

46:53.148 --> 46:55.858
- they're more frightened than you are.
- No, they're not.

46:55.984 --> 46:59.320
Are so. You're gonna be staring at them
the whole time.

46:59.446 --> 47:02.406
lf one of those moms or dads
does something embarrassing

47:02.533 --> 47:04.617
- while you're up on stage. . .
- Like pick their nose?

47:04.743 --> 47:07.954
- . . .you're gonna be the one who sees it.
- Yeah.

47:08.080 --> 47:10.039
Now that's power.

47:10.165 --> 47:12.083
Now go have fun.

47:13.710 --> 47:16.587
Dexter, over here. We saved you a seat.

47:16.713 --> 47:18.172
Thanks, guys.

47:24.513 --> 47:27.974
There you go. 1 8,000.

47:28.100 --> 47:31.769
l'll send a truck for the piece tomorrow.
l am telling you, Lila,

47:31.895 --> 47:35.606
this is going to create
a critical mass for you.

47:37.150 --> 47:40.903
According to the psycholinguistic
analysis of the manifesto.

47:41.029 --> 47:44.782
our killer is a white male in his 50s.

47:44.908 --> 47:46.951
What else?

47:47.077 --> 47:49.245
The killer has no girlfriends

47:49.371 --> 47:52.373
- and considers himself a good Catholic.
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

47:52.499 --> 47:55.543
How can you tell all that
by putting words in a computer?

47:55.669 --> 47:57.837
- l don't know, dude. lt's science.
- How about common sense?

47:57.963 --> 48:00.631
l think the guy that we're looking for
is pissed off at God.

48:00.757 --> 48:02.216
and that's why he kills people.

48:02.342 --> 48:05.011
Really? l actually found him
very politically motivated.

48:05.137 --> 48:06.888
Yeah, like a modern-day revolutionary.

48:07.014 --> 48:10.057
Which would suggest
that he's killing for social change.

48:17.566 --> 48:19.233
This is what he wants.

48:19.359 --> 48:23.154
- What's that?
- Confusion, chaos. . .

48:23.280 --> 48:25.907
it's what the killer wants.

48:26.033 --> 48:28.326
He's always been
an intensely private figure,

48:28.452 --> 48:30.494
dispatching victims silently.

48:30.621 --> 48:33.456
Now he's suddenly a media whore?
lt doesn't make sense.

48:33.582 --> 48:35.333
He's creating a clusterfuck.

48:35.459 --> 48:37.335
Very good, Officer Morgan.

48:37.461 --> 48:39.503
The killer's making us chase our tails.

48:39.630 --> 48:41.714
You know what that means?

48:59.858 --> 49:02.860
He knows how we work.
Look how he hits every major theme -

49:02.986 --> 49:05.196
political, environmental, religious.

49:05.322 --> 49:09.075
ln one section. he manages
to weave together Julius Caesar,

49:09.201 --> 49:11.869
Berlin, Germany, the Pittsburgh
Steelers and Gandhi.

49:11.995 --> 49:13.329
lt's scattershot.

49:13.455 --> 49:17.249
He knew that this would
send us scurrying like squirrels for nuts.

49:17.376 --> 49:20.836
Yeah, but to suggest that
he might be one of us -

49:20.963 --> 49:22.838
how can you be sure?

49:26.927 --> 49:30.221
Hi. l'm Cody.
and l researched Saudi Arabia

49:30.347 --> 49:32.223
for my cultural report.

49:32.349 --> 49:33.683
My board is covered in sand

49:33.809 --> 49:37.061
because Saudi Arabia is one big desert.

49:37.187 --> 49:39.188
As you can see. . .

49:39.314 --> 49:42.108
l used coffee beans
to write "Saudi Arabia".

49:42.234 --> 49:44.610
Arabic coffee is very famous.

49:44.736 --> 49:46.404
I'm a IittIe confused.

49:46.530 --> 49:49.573
Lila is the one showing me
how to take control,

49:49.700 --> 49:52.994
stop killing, get my life clean.

49:53.120 --> 49:55.830
But this is the first time
since l went into recovery

49:55.956 --> 49:58.749
that l actually feel clean.

49:58.875 --> 50:02.878
The children in saudi Arabia
are just like us, because they. . .

50:26.862 --> 50:29.572
This is the Saudi Arabian flag.

50:30.824 --> 50:35.578
The Arabic letters mean
"There is no god except Allah."

50:47.507 --> 50:50.718
Do you know how tough it is
for a woman in Saudi Arabia?

50:50.844 --> 50:53.512
They can't drive or have powerful jobs.

50:59.603 --> 51:03.064
Or. get this. they can't even
go to the movies without men's permission.

51:03.190 --> 51:07.151
After they turn 1 2,
they have to wear long black sleeves,

51:07.277 --> 51:11.322
and they can't hardly even talk to men
until they get married.

51:19.790 --> 51:23.209
The new king, Abdullah, is trying to change
some old bad rules,

51:23.335 --> 51:25.169
so women can do more things. . .

51:28.298 --> 51:30.257
Thank you very much for listening.

51:30.383 --> 51:33.302
Or, as they say in Arabic, "Shokran".

51:58.537 --> 52:01.163
l can't believe how calm
you were up there.

52:01.289 --> 52:03.666
Yeah, you were like
a professional talker.

52:03.792 --> 52:05.709
You were pretty good.

52:05.836 --> 52:09.547
Can Dexter come for ice cream with us?

52:09.673 --> 52:11.507
Can he, Mom, please?

52:13.677 --> 52:15.010
Sure, Dexter can join us.

52:15.137 --> 52:17.930
l wouldn't miss it. Maybe they'll have
some delicious saudi flavors.

52:18.056 --> 52:19.598
like sand or oil.

52:21.476 --> 52:23.561
Hang on a sec, guys.

52:23.687 --> 52:25.354
Hello.

52:28.441 --> 52:29.900
Are you hurt?

52:31.278 --> 52:33.445
OK, OK. l'm coming now.

52:36.074 --> 52:37.992
l know. Me too.

52:42.414 --> 52:44.999
Come on, kids.
Dexter won't be joining us.

52:45.125 --> 52:48.502
Rita. it's an emergency.
Look, l'm so sorry, you guys.

52:48.628 --> 52:51.422
l'm gonna make it up to you,
but l got to help a friend who's in trouble.

52:51.548 --> 52:54.383
There was a fire at her place.
l'm so sorry.

52:56.219 --> 52:57.887
OK, let's go.

53:20.702 --> 53:22.161
Dexter.

53:25.415 --> 53:27.082
What happened?

53:28.710 --> 53:31.462
l was working on my piece
with the blowtorch.

53:31.588 --> 53:33.631
lt just caught fire. l was so scared.

53:33.757 --> 53:35.591
Oh, l guess so.

53:41.264 --> 53:43.891
Promise me that you won't leave me,

53:44.017 --> 53:46.310
that you won't go anywhere.

53:46.436 --> 53:48.896
l'm not going anywhere.

54:00.617 --> 54:02.701
Hey, you got your light fixed.
