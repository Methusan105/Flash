WEBVTT

00:02.048 --> 00:04.008
Previously on Dexter...

00:04.134 --> 00:06.927
Two treasure hunters
made a ghastly discovery today

00:07.053 --> 00:08.679
when they stumbled
on what appears to be

00:08.805 --> 00:12.766
an underwater graveyard
in a crevice off the coast of Miami.

00:14.436 --> 00:16.979
Means there might be
a new mass murderer out there,

00:17.105 --> 00:18.814
way worse than the lce-Truck Killer.

00:18.940 --> 00:20.315
The "Bay Harbor Butcher"?

00:20.442 --> 00:22.693
That's what the press is calling him.

00:22.819 --> 00:25.571
The last thing Miami needs
is another serial killer.

00:25.697 --> 00:27.614
1 3 and counting.

00:27.741 --> 00:30.826
They're so swamped up there.
they had to bring in outside talent.

00:30.952 --> 00:32.703
Frank Lundy?

00:32.829 --> 00:35.998
The Green River Killer, the DC Sniper -
if the case was impossible. he broke it.

00:36.249 --> 00:39.209
So, this is the man who
stands between me and death row.

00:39.335 --> 00:41.628
With your help, we'll find
who did this awful thing.

00:41.755 --> 00:44.590
So, let's get a jump-start
on the Bay Harbor Butcher.

00:44.716 --> 00:45.799
With Doakes tailing me,

00:45.925 --> 00:48.093
my life's been all Jekyll and no Hyde.

00:48.219 --> 00:50.304
Paul kept insisting to me

00:50.430 --> 00:53.348
that you knocked him over the head,

00:53.475 --> 00:55.851
dragged him to his motel,
and shot him up with drugs.

00:55.977 --> 00:58.145
l hit Paul to protect you and the kids.

00:58.271 --> 01:00.314
Look, if there is anything left between us,

01:00.440 --> 01:02.149
you will answer me this one question

01:02.275 --> 01:04.943
and you will tell me the truth.

01:06.780 --> 01:09.823
Are you an addict?

01:09.949 --> 01:12.159
Yes, l have an addiction.

03:13.406 --> 03:14.865
My name is Caroline.

03:14.991 --> 03:16.200
l'm an addict.

03:16.326 --> 03:18.202
Hi, Caroline.

03:18.328 --> 03:21.788
l started taking pain pills

03:21.915 --> 03:24.875
after my back surgery.

03:25.001 --> 03:28.170
l don't need them for the pain any more.

03:28.296 --> 03:30.130
Now l. . .

03:30.256 --> 03:31.924
Now l just need them.

03:32.050 --> 03:34.259
And I need duct tape - three or four roIIs.

03:34.385 --> 03:37.346
Running low on heavy-duty trash bags.

03:37.472 --> 03:40.015
When's the Iast time
l sharpened my knives?

03:40.141 --> 03:41.975
. . .and l lost my license.

03:42.101 --> 03:45.270
Tears now?
lt's very hard to concentrate in here.

03:45.396 --> 03:47.940
How am l supposed to get any work done?

03:48.566 --> 03:53.362
My husband says he's gonna
leave me if l don't stay sober.

03:56.491 --> 03:58.325
But l have to do this for myself.

03:58.451 --> 04:01.411
"'No self-control,
lost everything, trying to stop."'

04:01.537 --> 04:03.622
Same whiny story
over and over for...

04:04.916 --> 04:07.167
ten minutes, feels like ten hours.

04:07.293 --> 04:13.006
. . .taking Lortabs and Darvocet
and Percocet

04:13.132 --> 04:15.259
and anything l could get my hands on.

04:15.385 --> 04:18.762
And even now. . .

04:18.888 --> 04:21.640
l'd kill for a Vicodin.

04:21.766 --> 04:22.724
Lightweight.

04:22.850 --> 04:26.979
First l thought, "Narcotics Anonymous,
l don't belong here."

04:27.105 --> 04:29.815
You guys are real addicts.

04:31.651 --> 04:34.111
So, how was the meeting?
Tell me everything.

04:34.237 --> 04:36.238
lt was interesting,

04:36.364 --> 04:38.824
hearing the same story
over and over again.

04:38.950 --> 04:40.867
- Knowing you're not alone.
- Exactly.

04:40.994 --> 04:42.703
Did you get fortune cookies?

04:42.829 --> 04:45.831
Only the ones with the good fortunes.

04:45.957 --> 04:47.457
So, did you share or just listen?

04:47.583 --> 04:50.210
l just wanted to take it all in
my first time out.

04:50.336 --> 04:51.795
Think they forgot. . .

04:51.921 --> 04:54.131
Ah, here they are. Spring rolls.

04:54.257 --> 04:56.717
And what about a sponsor?
Did you find one?

04:56.843 --> 04:59.052
l didn't want to rush into anything.

04:59.178 --> 05:01.054
lt's an important relationship.

05:01.180 --> 05:02.723
Absolutely.

05:03.808 --> 05:05.851
OK, so, let's see your newcomer's chip.

05:05.977 --> 05:07.561
Newcomer's chip.

05:07.687 --> 05:09.396
Yeah. . .

05:12.358 --> 05:14.234
You did stay until the end, didn't you?

05:14.360 --> 05:17.821
Of course l did. Right to the end.

05:20.241 --> 05:22.326
You're a terrible liar.

05:24.704 --> 05:27.748
l know too much about
1 2-step programs

05:27.874 --> 05:29.958
to be easily conned, Dexter.

05:31.294 --> 05:33.503
l didn't stay till the end end,
if that's what you mean.

05:33.629 --> 05:35.213
l had some important errands to run.

05:36.049 --> 05:37.549
lmportant?

05:37.675 --> 05:40.594
What? Am l important? Are the kids?

05:40.720 --> 05:42.512
Yeah.

05:42.638 --> 05:43.972
Yes, of course.

05:44.098 --> 05:46.933
Well, you're just gonna have
to figure out how important,

05:47.060 --> 05:49.936
because if you don't work the program -
and l mean really work it -

05:50.063 --> 05:51.271
l just. . .

05:51.397 --> 05:52.898
l can't go through this again.

05:55.568 --> 05:57.652
All right, kids. Dinner.

05:57.779 --> 05:59.488
How important are they?

05:59.614 --> 06:03.116
I'm sure someone with a heart
could answer that question.

06:10.917 --> 06:14.294
Tomorrow. l'll go tomorrow.

06:14.420 --> 06:16.088
l'll stay.

06:19.217 --> 06:20.467
- OK.
- OK?

06:20.593 --> 06:22.052
OK.

06:26.849 --> 06:28.141
Hold the elevator!

06:35.483 --> 06:36.900
Thanks.

06:37.902 --> 06:41.655
Nice dodge last night, flooring
it through that yellow light.

06:41.781 --> 06:43.698
Oh. . .

06:44.784 --> 06:46.201
Were you behind me?

06:48.037 --> 06:49.704
See you tonight.

06:53.793 --> 06:55.627
We will get to all of you.

06:55.753 --> 06:56.837
OK, take their names

06:56.963 --> 06:59.673
and keep them out of the bullpen
till we figure this out.

06:59.799 --> 07:01.174
Sue MacMillan,

07:01.300 --> 07:03.218
she disappeared four years ago.

07:04.303 --> 07:05.637
Who are they?

07:05.763 --> 07:09.266
Every family member of every
missing person for the last decade.

07:09.392 --> 07:11.601
lncluding some sad.
and presumably single women,

07:11.727 --> 07:13.103
courtesy of Lieutenant Pascal.

07:13.229 --> 07:15.939
lt's not her fault.
That reporter's an asshole.

07:16.065 --> 07:19.734
sergeant? Yeah.
hold the rest of them downstairs.

07:19.861 --> 07:21.611
We're out of room here.

07:21.737 --> 07:23.113
You seen Pascal?

07:23.239 --> 07:26.366
You know, Pascal is just caught
in a cycle of reaction.

07:26.492 --> 07:29.077
She's not co-creating
her own reality.

07:29.203 --> 07:31.163
You know those words
don't mean anything?

07:31.289 --> 07:33.957
Look around you, bro.
She's manifesting negativity.

07:34.083 --> 07:35.959
lt's on again.

07:36.085 --> 07:37.878
- Excuse me, Lieutenant?
- No comment.

07:38.004 --> 07:40.046
We have reports
dozens of bodies were found

07:40.173 --> 07:42.299
- in that underwater grave site.
- Not dozens.

07:42.425 --> 07:44.092
The boss' sweater melons
look bigger on TV.

07:44.218 --> 07:46.970
The operative word is "boss."
Show some respect.

07:48.014 --> 07:49.264
Thought l was.

07:49.390 --> 07:52.726
- One dozen? Two dozen?
- 1 8 or so. Excuse me.

07:52.852 --> 07:56.229
- Have the families been notified?
- We're still trying to identify them.

07:56.355 --> 07:58.899
lf viewers have information,
they should contact you?

07:59.025 --> 08:00.525
Yes. Fine.

08:02.028 --> 08:03.069
So, there you have it.

08:03.196 --> 08:05.989
Police are seeking any leads
that can help them identify

08:06.115 --> 08:09.242
the 1 8 faceless victims
of the Bay Harbor Butcher.

08:09.368 --> 08:11.077
lf you have information, contact...

08:11.204 --> 08:13.371
Pascal is definitely off her game.

08:13.498 --> 08:16.875
Word is, her fiance is catching
some strange on the sly.

08:17.001 --> 08:18.502
That'd do it.

08:18.628 --> 08:21.213
The shit stops here. Give it to me.

08:23.382 --> 08:26.301
Most of these people
won't find answers here.

08:26.427 --> 08:29.471
Chances are good their loved ones
weren"t among my chosen few.

08:31.182 --> 08:34.226
May l have
your attention, please?

08:34.352 --> 08:37.103
First l want to tell you
what a great job you've all been doing

08:37.230 --> 08:39.022
on this horrific case.

08:39.148 --> 08:41.775
And with the help of
the best manhunter in the FBl,

08:41.901 --> 08:43.401
we should have answers soon.

08:43.528 --> 08:47.155
ln the meantime, the work of this precinct
must continue to serve the public,

08:47.281 --> 08:49.908
so we'll be dividing up our resources.

08:50.034 --> 08:52.369
Agent Lundy has requested
the following officers

08:52.495 --> 08:53.870
for his joint task force.

08:53.996 --> 08:54.996
Officer Cook. . .

08:55.122 --> 08:58.583
- Lundy made me LFl.
- LFl?

08:58.709 --> 09:01.294
Lead forensics investigator.

09:01.420 --> 09:03.964
sorry you got boned.
but, hey, no blood spatter.

09:04.090 --> 09:05.507
Sucks to be me.

09:05.633 --> 09:07.801
Actually, it keeps me off Lundy's radar.

09:07.927 --> 09:09.427
Sergeant Lee.

09:10.555 --> 09:12.430
Detective Ramos. . . .

09:14.642 --> 09:17.102
Officer Panko. . .

09:17.228 --> 09:18.228
Detective Batista. . .

09:18.354 --> 09:19.312
Yes!

09:19.438 --> 09:21.064
l saw this happening.

09:21.190 --> 09:22.774
And Officer Debra Morgan.

09:25.361 --> 09:29.072
Those called will report
directly to Special Agent Lundy.

09:29.198 --> 09:31.783
And let's not forget
this is on all of us, folks.

09:31.909 --> 09:34.494
Let's keep our eyes
and our ears open.

09:34.620 --> 09:37.956
The lce-Truck Killer was an amateur
compared to this guy.

09:40.251 --> 09:43.253
l'd also appreciate it if your lieutenant
would consult with me

09:43.379 --> 09:44.838
before speaking to the press.

09:44.964 --> 09:47.299
l'll rip her a new one. . .
lf l can find her.

09:50.595 --> 09:53.513
Prints, fiber, trace evidence -

09:53.639 --> 09:55.849
no, they won't find anything.

09:55.975 --> 09:59.686
l followed all of Harry's
painstaking preventative measures.

09:59.812 --> 10:02.022
He knew that nothing
stays buried forever.

10:02.148 --> 10:04.065
His code will protect me.

10:04.191 --> 10:06.943
Still, l wish my own sister
weren't hunting me -

10:07.111 --> 10:10.405
makes for an awkward family dynamic.

10:10.531 --> 10:14.242
So, l'm a Fed. My suit proves it.

10:14.368 --> 10:16.828
The other suits here are Feds.

10:16.954 --> 10:19.080
But suit or. . .

10:19.206 --> 10:21.333
ugly Hawaiian shirt -

10:21.459 --> 10:23.668
no offence -

10:23.794 --> 10:25.378
we're a team.

10:25.504 --> 10:28.131
And our first play
is lDing those bodies.

10:28.257 --> 10:30.216
Once we know who they are,

10:30.343 --> 10:32.344
we'll fill in every detail of their lives,

10:32.470 --> 10:35.221
from their huevos rancheros
to their creme brulee.

10:35.848 --> 10:38.391
And get used to food references

10:38.517 --> 10:41.853
'cause, well, l like food.

10:42.980 --> 10:45.899
Vince Masuka and his team are gathering
DNA, prints, and dental records.

10:46.025 --> 10:49.319
The rest of us will go through cold cases
and missing-persons files.

10:49.445 --> 10:52.155
Also, l want that crowd
out there interviewed -

10:52.281 --> 10:54.616
though most of them
will be a waste of time.

10:54.742 --> 10:56.284
Negative thinking.

10:56.410 --> 10:59.412
You four, move them out
as quickly as you can,

10:59.538 --> 11:00.747
but be thorough.

11:00.873 --> 11:03.583
lf we get even one hit, it'll be worth it.

11:03.709 --> 11:06.002
Everyone else, work the files.

11:06.128 --> 11:10.090
Remember, lDs will lead to a pattern,

11:10.216 --> 11:11.966
which will lead to our man.

11:15.721 --> 11:19.474
When the manhunt is on,
the hunted go shopping.

11:20.893 --> 11:22.060
Not for a new car,

11:22.395 --> 11:24.145
for my next project.

11:24.271 --> 11:26.439
l won't act on it...yet.

11:26.565 --> 11:30.527
l'm still laying low.
Harry would insist on that.

11:30.653 --> 11:33.613
Just getting the research out of the way.

11:33.739 --> 11:36.074
Someone talked his way
into the homes of two women

11:36.200 --> 11:38.785
and didn't leave till they were dead.

11:38.911 --> 11:42.247
Ann Cohen and, a month before her,
Lynn Hall.

11:44.625 --> 11:47.794
A certain car dealership
ran credit checks on both women.

11:47.920 --> 11:51.631
Both bought cars elsewhere,
so nobody thought about it twice.

11:52.842 --> 11:55.593
But who requested those credit checks?

11:57.346 --> 11:59.180
Roger Hicks.

12:02.518 --> 12:04.686
AII I need is some DNA proof -

12:04.812 --> 12:07.105
cup of coffee shouId do the trick.

12:17.533 --> 12:19.451
How many kids you got?

12:20.453 --> 12:22.620
Enough.

12:22.747 --> 12:25.123
l hear you.

12:25.249 --> 12:28.376
When my two came along.
it was bye-bye, convertible.

12:28.502 --> 12:30.128
Of course. . .

12:30.254 --> 12:32.005
they're worth it.

12:33.257 --> 12:34.841
Must take after their mom.

12:34.967 --> 12:37.594
That they do. Thank God.

12:37.720 --> 12:42.348
l tell you, l miss my convertible,
but, truth -

12:42.475 --> 12:45.351
- my minivan's got a much nicer ride.
- So you own one.

12:45.478 --> 12:48.813
The same one you're looking at.
l mean, l know - whipped, right?

12:48.939 --> 12:51.649
But my kids love the twin DVDs.

12:51.776 --> 12:53.943
They're just crazy about Spongebob,
you know?

12:54.069 --> 12:55.320
Actually, l do.

12:55.446 --> 12:59.282
My wife loves the nav system
and all the safety features.

12:59.408 --> 13:01.534
And when they're happy. . .

13:01.660 --> 13:03.203
- You're happy.
- That's right.

13:03.329 --> 13:05.705
Except the kids don't exist,
neither does the wife.

13:05.831 --> 13:08.583
And he owns a Beamer, not a minivan.

13:08.709 --> 13:10.794
Still, he"s seamless.

13:10.920 --> 13:11.878
lmpressive.

13:12.004 --> 13:14.214
lt's not flashy, but. . .

13:14.340 --> 13:17.008
What did flash ever get me?
Pulled over, that's what.

13:17.134 --> 13:18.927
l'm definitely not into flash.

13:19.053 --> 13:22.764
You got to sit in the captain's chair.
lt's like a 747, man.

13:22.890 --> 13:24.766
Manuel, hold up.

13:26.101 --> 13:27.393
Thank you, sir.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.062
So. . .

13:29.188 --> 13:31.689
we should take it out,
check out the ride.

13:31.816 --> 13:34.901
- l'm just doing research.
- OK, you don't want a big sales pitch.

13:35.027 --> 13:36.069
l get that.

13:36.195 --> 13:38.905
Let me at least pull the specs for you.

13:39.031 --> 13:40.573
Because, truthfully,

13:40.699 --> 13:42.784
we have a hard time
keeping these on the lot.

13:42.910 --> 13:45.537
You might want to grab
the test-drive while it's here.

13:45.663 --> 13:48.873
l think l have all the information l need
to make a decision.

13:48.999 --> 13:50.917
Yeah? Well, then,
you've seen the, uh,

13:51.043 --> 13:53.920
the Stow 'n Go seating system, right?

13:54.046 --> 13:58.424
l have had everything in here. . .

13:58.551 --> 14:02.595
from a soccer team
to a freakin' deer carcass.

14:02.721 --> 14:04.764
lt was an accident, of course.

14:04.890 --> 14:08.142
But l sure was glad
for the ample cargo space,

14:08.269 --> 14:11.312
not to mention the tinted windows.

14:12.398 --> 14:14.774
l can see how that might come in handy.

14:14.900 --> 14:16.901
l'll just grab the keys.

14:32.334 --> 14:35.545
l go to stalk a killer and l end up
with a new car? How'd that happen?

14:35.671 --> 14:37.589
New car?

14:37.715 --> 14:39.799
Yeah.

14:39.925 --> 14:41.801
You gettin' married?

14:41.927 --> 14:44.095
Not that l know of.

14:46.265 --> 14:49.183
So, what's with the mommy mobile?

14:49.310 --> 14:51.477
l'm. . .

14:51.604 --> 14:53.479
not sure.

15:05.159 --> 15:06.659
Synthetic.

15:06.785 --> 15:08.494
Even Roger's hair is a lie.

15:08.621 --> 15:11.122
l could learn a thing or two from this guy.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.375
Who's your daddy?

15:15.377 --> 15:16.878
Harry Morgan.

15:17.004 --> 15:22.133
Dude, the lead forensics investigator
of the joint task force. that's who.

15:22.259 --> 15:24.761
Oh, OK.

15:24.887 --> 15:26.679
So, you want in on this bitch or not?

15:26.805 --> 15:27.805
What bitch?

15:27.932 --> 15:30.975
The only bitch in town, baby.
The Bay Harbor Butcher.

15:31.101 --> 15:34.812
- l got you temporarily assigned.
- Vince, you didn't have to do that.

15:34.939 --> 15:36.064
Nothing sexy, of course,

15:36.190 --> 15:38.358
Just some bone-marrow
collection for DNA lDs.

15:38.484 --> 15:39.859
But it'll get you in the tent.

15:39.985 --> 15:41.194
And you got to see the tent.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.987
Amazing.

15:45.741 --> 15:46.783
Say it.

15:48.285 --> 15:49.744
You're my daddy.

15:49.870 --> 15:51.913
lt sounds weird when you say it.

15:52.039 --> 15:54.958
l haven't been much use
since he disappeared.

15:55.834 --> 15:59.212
l know l'm supposed to move on. . .

15:59.338 --> 16:01.089
but. . .

16:01.215 --> 16:04.050
Here's the picture of him.

16:04.176 --> 16:05.510
He looks. . .

16:07.304 --> 16:08.680


16:09.765 --> 16:12.141
Not according to my mother. . .

16:12.267 --> 16:13.851
or the police.

16:13.978 --> 16:15.979
He was in and out of jail

16:16.105 --> 16:20.358
but...my heart raced
whenever l saw him.

16:22.361 --> 16:24.404
l brought his toothbrush.

16:24.530 --> 16:26.197
They say you can get DNA off it.

16:27.658 --> 16:30.368
You can find him with this, right?

16:40.671 --> 16:42.797
Special Agent Lundy?

16:42.923 --> 16:47.093
Look, thanks for choosing me
for the task force and all, but. . .

16:47.219 --> 16:49.303
l'd appreciate you finding someone else.

16:49.430 --> 16:50.930
You want off?

16:51.056 --> 16:53.850
Just as soon as you can replace me, sir.

16:53.976 --> 16:56.602
This is a chance to solve
a pretty important case.

16:56.729 --> 16:59.272
Most people get into this
line of work to do just that.

17:00.899 --> 17:03.651
Well, l've got cases of my own backing up,

17:03.777 --> 17:06.404
and the precinct's
short-handed with all this shit.

17:06.530 --> 17:08.865
So. . .if you don't mind. . .

17:10.325 --> 17:12.201
l'll see what l can do.

17:12.327 --> 17:15.371
ln the meantime, if you could
continue the interviews. . .

17:15.497 --> 17:17.874
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.084
Thank you.

17:26.759 --> 17:28.801
Most of 'em have been
underwater for years.

17:28.927 --> 17:31.679
But some, it's awesome,
you can't even tell.

17:31.805 --> 17:35.224
The temperature on the ocean floor
and the airtight bags kept them intact.

17:35.350 --> 17:37.727
l mean, a little gelatinous
residue, sure. But. . .

17:37.853 --> 17:40.188
l"d rather remember my
old playmates as they were -

17:40.314 --> 17:41.814
neat, clean little packages.

17:41.940 --> 17:44.108
Vince, l appreciate this favor but. . .

17:44.234 --> 17:46.027
Actually, you're doing me the favor.

17:46.153 --> 17:49.655
l need your help. buddy.
The pressure's fucking ridonkulous.

17:49.782 --> 17:51.949
Glad to be of service.

17:52.993 --> 17:57.789
Field morgue for the overflow
but it's state-of-the-art. Fucking FBl, eh?

18:05.130 --> 18:07.465
A good percentage are just bones.

18:07.591 --> 18:09.300
Must have fed the fish
when the bags tore.

18:09.426 --> 18:11.677
Humpty fucking Dumpty, right?

18:11.804 --> 18:12.887
Exactly.

18:13.013 --> 18:15.848
They weren't meant to be
put together again.

18:15.974 --> 18:18.726
They were meant to remain
in the silent shadows,

18:18.852 --> 18:21.521
keeping their secrets.

18:21.647 --> 18:23.648
Now they're exposed to the glare,

18:23.774 --> 18:27.944
reflecting my darkness like
some grotesque carnival mirror.

18:29.488 --> 18:31.072
Harry was right -

18:31.198 --> 18:33.199
nothing stays buried.

18:33.325 --> 18:35.535
Perhaps not even me.

18:42.668 --> 18:44.752
Looking for my Taurus, Sergeant?

18:45.838 --> 18:47.213
Keep looking.

18:47.339 --> 18:49.757
You don't need to know
where l'm going tonight.

18:51.135 --> 18:52.760
And genius me,

18:52.886 --> 18:55.304
not only do l leave
my works in my girlfriend's car,

18:55.430 --> 18:58.057
but also all the dead fish
from the fishing trip, right?

19:00.435 --> 19:05.231
Then l collapse in her
parents' house, scare her kids,

19:05.357 --> 19:07.692
and get myself fired, 'cause guess what -

19:07.818 --> 19:08.860
we work together.

19:10.696 --> 19:12.989
Yeah.

19:13.115 --> 19:14.782
So, now. . .

19:14.908 --> 19:16.075
well. . .

19:16.201 --> 19:18.411
l'm 20 days sober. . .

19:18.537 --> 19:20.913


19:21.039 --> 19:23.124
hoping to make it to 21 .

19:28.714 --> 19:30.047
Thanks, Gordon.

19:30.174 --> 19:35.720
This meeting recognizes
lengths of sobriety with chips.

19:35.846 --> 19:40.892
so. if there's anyone
who would like a newcomer's chip. . .

19:50.319 --> 19:52.820
You've got three minutes
to share if you want it.

19:52.946 --> 19:55.281
Oh, really?

19:55.407 --> 19:57.241
Go ahead, man. You among friends.

20:05.584 --> 20:07.710
Well, l. . .

20:11.298 --> 20:13.216
What's your name?

20:17.179 --> 20:19.263
- Bob.
- Hi, Bob.

20:19.389 --> 20:21.474
Hi.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.894
And l'm. . .

20:25.020 --> 20:26.646
an addict.

20:26.772 --> 20:30.816
l use. . .heroin. . .

20:30.943 --> 20:32.318
shoot it.

20:32.444 --> 20:34.070
lt's affecting my job.

20:34.196 --> 20:37.448
My boss found my works.
He fired my ass.

20:37.574 --> 20:40.743
But l showed him. l spent every penny
of my final paycheck on junk.

20:42.204 --> 20:44.956
Doctor said l. . .

20:54.132 --> 20:56.217
l almost died.

21:03.892 --> 21:06.310
The coffee sucks. . .

21:06.436 --> 21:07.728
as bad as the doughnuts.

21:07.854 --> 21:10.314
lt's better next door. Come on.

21:18.865 --> 21:23.369
Mmm. lt is good coffee. Thank you.

21:26.039 --> 21:27.331
So, tell me. . .

21:28.458 --> 21:31.919
Exactly how full of shit are you?

21:34.631 --> 21:36.966
l'm not full of anything.

21:38.051 --> 21:40.511
lt was a nice performance in there.

21:40.637 --> 21:43.973
Where did you download it from,
addict.com?

21:46.143 --> 21:48.602
Look, l have no reason to lie.

21:49.688 --> 21:51.105
Sure you do.

21:51.231 --> 21:53.524
We all do.

21:53.650 --> 21:54.900
You thought l was lying?

21:55.027 --> 21:57.528
l don't know. . . Bob.

21:57.654 --> 22:01.240
Well, it is anonymous.

22:01.366 --> 22:03.034
Everyone in that room

22:03.160 --> 22:07.621
has heard or lived far worse
than anything you've ever done.

22:09.541 --> 22:10.958
l doubt it.

22:11.084 --> 22:13.878
Oh, so you're Super-Junkie.

22:15.130 --> 22:18.549
l don't mean to imply that what you've
been through hasn't been difficult.

22:18.675 --> 22:20.051
But there's no way

22:20.177 --> 22:23.346
that l could know what
you've experienced, right?

22:26.725 --> 22:30.978
l couldn't possibly feel that need.

22:33.148 --> 22:38.694
Like a thousand hiding voices whispering,

22:38.820 --> 22:41.030
"This is who you are."

22:43.784 --> 22:46.786
And you fight the pressure,

22:46.912 --> 22:50.790
the growing need rising like a wave,

22:50.916 --> 22:57.421
prickling and teasing
and prodding to be fed.

22:57.547 --> 23:00.800
But the whispering gets louder

23:00.926 --> 23:03.094
until it's screaming, "Now! "

23:05.597 --> 23:08.933
And it's the only voice you hear. . .

23:11.770 --> 23:14.271
The only voice you want to hear.

23:17.275 --> 23:19.360
And you belong to it. . .

23:20.445 --> 23:22.446
to this. . .

23:22.572 --> 23:25.449
shadow self.

23:27.452 --> 23:28.452
To this. . .

23:32.165 --> 23:34.708
Dark passenger.

23:34.835 --> 23:36.502
Yes.

23:39.548 --> 23:41.590
The dark passenger.

23:47.597 --> 23:49.140
No.

23:52.352 --> 23:55.187
l'm sorry, but. . . l need to go.

23:57.023 --> 23:58.941
Thanks for the coffee.

24:04.865 --> 24:06.198
She knows.

24:09.119 --> 24:11.245
She recognizes demons...

24:11.371 --> 24:13.747
dark passengers.

24:13.874 --> 24:15.374
Maybe the others can, too.

24:15.500 --> 24:19.044
This program is too risky,
especially now.

24:19.171 --> 24:21.213
Rita wiII have to understand.

24:40.984 --> 24:44.111
Hey. You just missed story time.

24:45.572 --> 24:48.282
l was at a meeting.

24:50.035 --> 24:51.243
Thank you.

24:53.038 --> 24:55.956
lt made me realize
something important.

24:56.082 --> 24:58.209
Oh, really? What's that?

24:58.335 --> 25:01.462
Those meetings are not
a good place for me.

25:03.882 --> 25:07.343
l know how this sounds,
but l can do this on my own.

25:07.469 --> 25:09.094
Dexter, you need a program.

25:09.221 --> 25:12.723
l've read studies. people are
ten times as likely to change on their own

25:12.849 --> 25:15.434
as they are with the help
of doctors or programs.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.561
So you're quoting studies?

25:17.687 --> 25:18.938
Look, l lived this.

25:19.064 --> 25:22.107
l watched Paul try and fail
with white-knuckle sobriety.

25:22.234 --> 25:25.069
l'm not Paul.
l'm not any of those people.

25:25.195 --> 25:28.739
Going to those meetings will do
more harm than good, l swear to you.

25:28.865 --> 25:30.199
l'm better off alone.

25:38.208 --> 25:40.251
l pray you change your mind.

25:45.924 --> 25:48.300
What just happened?

25:55.100 --> 25:58.519
Deb?

26:08.613 --> 26:10.614
Thought you were staying at Rita's.

26:13.076 --> 26:15.119
Taking the night off.

26:18.582 --> 26:21.834
l thought you'd be on the treadmill.

26:21.960 --> 26:23.419
Taking the night off.

26:23.545 --> 26:26.171
With no money down, guaranteed,

26:26.298 --> 26:28.382
or we'll make your first two payments...

26:29.259 --> 26:33.012
A night off is good
to remember what's important.

26:44.608 --> 26:47.026
Two women are dead,
the killer is selling minivans,

26:47.152 --> 26:51.196
and l have an opportunity to prove it
even if l am laying low.

26:51.323 --> 26:54.700
Having a victim prepped and ready
will take the edge off the wait...

26:54.826 --> 26:55.743
l hope.

26:55.869 --> 26:57.620
Hey, hang on just a second, OK?

26:57.746 --> 26:59.705
- What's going on, Dex?
- Hey.

26:59.831 --> 27:02.458
Any problems, the service centre
can take care of you,

27:02.584 --> 27:04.543
but they're around the corner. . .

27:04.669 --> 27:06.086
Actually, the minivan's fine.

27:06.212 --> 27:07.880
l never sold a lemon in my life.

27:08.006 --> 27:09.965
l'm just rethinking
the extended warranty.

27:10.091 --> 27:11.800
l'll set you up with a warranty writer.

27:11.926 --> 27:14.345
And l'm thinking roof rack
and premium sound system.

27:14.471 --> 27:15.554
- Going all out.
- Yeah.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.806
That's great, but l'm with a customer,

27:17.932 --> 27:19.391
and so one of my associates. . .

27:19.517 --> 27:21.644
l'd rather deal with you.
l'll wait in your office.

27:21.770 --> 27:23.437
Outstanding.

27:33.907 --> 27:37.034
DNA, DNA, come out and play.

27:42.582 --> 27:44.083
Roger's got you in the box.

27:44.209 --> 27:46.794
Once you're in the box.
you don't leave without a deal.

27:48.880 --> 27:52.508
Don't worry. you're safe
with Roger, he's the best.

27:52.634 --> 27:55.386
l'm just dropping off this thank-you note.

27:55.512 --> 27:57.137
l was just leaving.

27:57.263 --> 27:59.348
He sent you across the street, didn't he?

27:59.474 --> 28:00.849
Across the street?

28:00.975 --> 28:03.143
lt's OK, he told me not to tell anyone either.

28:03.269 --> 28:07.606
l don't know how he makes a living,
sending his commissions to other dealers.

28:07.732 --> 28:09.108
Maybe he has ulterior motives.

28:09.234 --> 28:11.819
Or maybe he knows l can't afford his price.

28:11.945 --> 28:13.946
After he ran a credit check?

28:14.072 --> 28:15.948
TRW doesn't lie.

28:16.074 --> 28:17.741
So, you're single?

28:20.078 --> 28:21.036
Yeah.

28:21.162 --> 28:25.124
Makes it tougher to afford those
big-ticket items, like cars and houses.

28:25.250 --> 28:26.333
You rent an apartment?

28:26.459 --> 28:28.836
House. l hate sharing walls.
You hear everything.

28:28.962 --> 28:31.296
Tell me about it. No pets, though, right?

28:31.423 --> 28:33.340
Yeah.

28:33.466 --> 28:36.051
ls this a come-on?
'Cause it's a little weird.

28:37.679 --> 28:39.430
Must be why l'm still single.

28:39.556 --> 28:40.931
Another brunette.

28:42.434 --> 28:47.479
Single, neighbors at a distance,
no guard dog.

28:48.481 --> 28:52.443
The credit check gets Roger
all the details he needs.

28:52.569 --> 28:56.739
She"s next, and l can"t do
anything about it -

28:56.865 --> 28:59.032
not untiI this manhunt ends.

28:59.159 --> 29:01.118
Harry would insist on it.

29:08.209 --> 29:11.962
What? No, l'll take care of it.

29:12.088 --> 29:13.672
l know the card is in his name.

29:13.798 --> 29:16.884
l just want to check the charges.

29:17.010 --> 29:20.304
Well, the supervisor l spoke with
this morning allowed it.

29:20.430 --> 29:22.806
Yes. . . No. . .

29:22.932 --> 29:25.225
Yeah, l'll hold. Yes?

29:26.686 --> 29:30.647
Just a reminder that the Biscayne
drive-by warrant needs your approval.

29:30.774 --> 29:31.690
l'll look at it.

29:31.816 --> 29:34.526
And the homicide from last night
needs to be assigned.

29:34.652 --> 29:36.403
Right, thanks.

29:40.074 --> 29:42.868
Look. Esmee.
l know that things are rough

29:42.994 --> 29:45.704
with you and your fiance right now,
and l'm sorry. really.

29:45.830 --> 29:48.957
but we need to keep clearing
that board out there.

29:49.083 --> 29:50.501
Yeah, you're right. l'm sorry.

29:52.378 --> 29:54.880
l seem to have had
my head up my ass lately.

29:55.006 --> 29:56.924
lt's called being human.

29:58.843 --> 29:59.885
OK, who's up?

30:00.011 --> 30:01.386
Samuels and Kent are up.

30:01.513 --> 30:03.639
Put 'em on the liquor-store shooting.

30:04.766 --> 30:06.767
And where is the Biscayne warrant?

30:06.893 --> 30:08.936
Oh, right here.

30:09.062 --> 30:11.647
Simms and Hoagie
want SWAT for entry.

30:11.773 --> 30:13.899
lt's a good measure,
given the weapons charge.

30:14.025 --> 30:17.069
Excuse me, l'm. . .
l'm gonna need a minute.

30:17.195 --> 30:18.403
Just. . .

30:20.156 --> 30:21.573
Just gonna need a minute.

30:21.699 --> 30:24.326
Esmee?

30:24.452 --> 30:26.245
- Esmee.
- Please, Maria.

30:28.998 --> 30:30.582
l'll handle it.

30:38.550 --> 30:39.466
Not taking my calls

30:39.592 --> 30:42.553
and now you're checking
my credit card charges, Esmee?

30:45.056 --> 30:49.142
Roger's DNA matches the semen
found at both crime scenes.

30:49.269 --> 30:50.936
IrrefutabIe.

30:51.896 --> 30:54.565
lf l do nothing, another woman dies.

30:56.401 --> 31:00.112
ls that my long-dormant
conscience talking

31:00.238 --> 31:03.031
or the dark passenger whispering?

31:11.207 --> 31:13.417
Hi, it's me.

31:13.543 --> 31:15.794
Hi, Dexter.

31:15.920 --> 31:18.463
Kids home from school yet?

31:18.590 --> 31:20.465
Colleen's bringing them home now.

31:20.592 --> 31:24.970
l'm a. . .little confused.

31:25.555 --> 31:28.807
l'm sorry you're confused.

31:28.933 --> 31:32.269
l mean, it"s pizza night.
ShouId I pick up the usuaI?

31:32.395 --> 31:33.395
Did you go back?

31:33.521 --> 31:36.231
To a meeting. Thinking about it.

31:36.357 --> 31:38.650
The kids and l will order in, then.

31:39.736 --> 31:41.612
OK.

31:44.365 --> 31:46.033
So. . .

31:48.119 --> 31:49.453
is this it?

31:50.747 --> 31:52.831
That's up to you, Dexter.

31:57.211 --> 32:01.381
l want to know.
where is she, mi Teresita.

32:01.507 --> 32:04.509
She's so young - seven year old.

32:05.470 --> 32:08.263
You help me. l know you find her.

32:08.389 --> 32:09.556
We'll do what we can.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.476
Don't cry.

32:14.646 --> 32:17.439
No Spanish.

32:17.565 --> 32:19.691
Only English. Angel?

32:22.236 --> 32:23.820
Just tell her we'll call her.

32:30.411 --> 32:33.580
She thinks you can find the daughter.

32:33.706 --> 32:36.375
Th. . .There are no kids down there.

32:36.501 --> 32:38.627
Tell her l can't help her.

32:38.753 --> 32:40.796
- she...
- l. . . l can't help you.

32:44.217 --> 32:46.635
Morgan? Morgan!

32:55.895 --> 32:58.730
lt's been 24 hours
since l asked to be replaced.

32:58.856 --> 33:01.984
- Has it?
- What's taking so long?

33:02.110 --> 33:06.279
Every cop on the damn force wants in
on this case. Just take your pick.

33:07.323 --> 33:10.367
l've been wondering
about that, actually.

33:10.493 --> 33:13.704
Everyone wants on, but you want off.

33:14.747 --> 33:17.040
l told you, l have cases.

33:17.875 --> 33:20.377
l don't think so.

33:21.546 --> 33:25.090
Jesus, l just don't want to be
on your task force. all right?

33:25.216 --> 33:26.341
Why?

33:26.467 --> 33:29.469
Because l'm the last person
in the world that should be on it.

33:30.847 --> 33:35.183
You want me to find a serial killer?
l was engaged to one, for Christ's sake.

33:35.309 --> 33:37.811
What kind of cop. . . What kind of. . .

33:37.937 --> 33:39.730
That's why l chose you, you know -

33:40.857 --> 33:42.399
because of what you went through.

33:43.109 --> 33:45.402
You survived.

33:45.528 --> 33:47.154
l don't know how.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.281
l can't begin to imagine
the strength it took -

33:49.407 --> 33:52.034
continues to take.

33:52.160 --> 33:55.620
More than that,
you got a first-hand look

33:55.747 --> 33:57.956
into the mind and heart of a killer. . .

33:59.667 --> 34:01.501
and you're still here.

34:02.837 --> 34:06.173
lf you can accept that -
really accept it -

34:06.299 --> 34:08.425
you could use it.

34:09.844 --> 34:12.721
Mix that with some
of your strength, and. . .

34:12.847 --> 34:17.392
you could catch someone even worse
than the lce-Truck Killer.

34:19.937 --> 34:21.396
But you have to stop running.

34:25.777 --> 34:27.986
Finish today's interviews.

34:29.322 --> 34:32.449
Then, if you still want out, you got it.

34:39.540 --> 34:41.166
Lead fucking investigator.

34:41.292 --> 34:43.168
Translation - everyone's bitch.

34:43.294 --> 34:45.504
l do have a life, you know.

34:45.630 --> 34:47.089
You do?

34:47.215 --> 34:50.592
Just give me your
bone-marrow DNA results.

34:50.718 --> 34:51.927
No matches.

34:52.053 --> 34:53.845
Big surprise.

34:53.971 --> 34:55.680
Do me a favor
on your way out, will you?

34:55.807 --> 34:58.183
Drop these dental X-rays
at the field morgue for me?

34:58.309 --> 35:00.102
Tech should still be there.

35:00.228 --> 35:03.980
Fucking Bay Harbor Butcher
is butchering my online social life.

35:06.234 --> 35:07.484
Sorry.

35:12.698 --> 35:14.157
Next.

35:20.665 --> 35:22.874
l figured you'd still be here.

35:23.960 --> 35:27.003
You were a pain in the ass
but always a damn hard worker.

35:27.130 --> 35:29.965
And, of course, you knew
how to handle the press.

35:32.176 --> 35:33.844
Come here a minute.

35:44.981 --> 35:47.190
The public needs to believe
we can protect them,

35:47.316 --> 35:49.568
or all hell breaks loose,
so l need all my people

35:49.694 --> 35:51.570
operating at their very highest levels.

35:51.696 --> 35:53.572
l agree.

35:53.698 --> 35:55.824
Should l be worried about Pascal?

35:56.909 --> 35:58.660
Pascal?

35:58.786 --> 36:00.537
Why?

36:00.663 --> 36:02.789
You can cut the crap, Maria.

36:02.915 --> 36:05.250
l know she's been AWOL
on personal matters.

36:05.376 --> 36:07.002
The press fuck-up is huge,

36:07.128 --> 36:10.297
And now l'm beginning to hear
rumors about erratic behavior.

36:10.423 --> 36:12.591
And you're asking me because. . .

36:12.717 --> 36:14.759
Because you've done the job.

36:14.886 --> 36:17.554
So if she's out,
that means you're back in.

36:17.680 --> 36:21.391
That makes you her harshest critic,
and l want it straight.

36:21.517 --> 36:23.018
So. . .

36:23.144 --> 36:24.269
Take your shot, Maria.

36:26.439 --> 36:27.981
You know what "erratic" means?

36:29.233 --> 36:32.027
lt's code for "non-male"

36:32.153 --> 36:34.487
and it's the same bullshit
sexism l put up with

36:34.614 --> 36:37.115
when l was in charge.

36:37.241 --> 36:40.660
l won't dignify rumors, Captain.
Pascal's fine.

36:49.629 --> 36:51.922
Minivan's that way.

36:52.048 --> 36:54.966
Field morgue's this way.

36:55.092 --> 36:56.343
l'll wait.

36:56.469 --> 36:58.803
You should take the night off, Sergeant.

36:58.930 --> 37:00.430
On pizza night?

37:00.556 --> 37:02.432
No way.

37:03.768 --> 37:06.269
What does she see
in a freak show like you anyway?

37:06.395 --> 37:07.604
You have to ask her.

37:07.730 --> 37:09.147
Maybe l will.

37:15.112 --> 37:16.821
What exactly is it you think l've done?

37:16.948 --> 37:20.033
l know you're connected
to the lce-Truck Killer.

37:20.159 --> 37:21.493
Could you be more vague?

37:21.619 --> 37:24.913
l know you're too careful.
You keep your assets in cash.

37:25.039 --> 37:27.958
You don't belong to any
organizations or alumni groups.

37:28.084 --> 37:32.337
You were top of your class in med school
but you traded it for fucking blood spatter.

37:32.463 --> 37:34.506
l know you studied martial arts in college

37:34.632 --> 37:38.760
but l don't know what a lab geek
needs with advanced jujitsu.

37:38.886 --> 37:40.804
Do you know what an easy credit is?

37:41.806 --> 37:43.765
l know you're a good liar, too.

37:48.646 --> 37:50.647
Not good enough.

38:05.871 --> 38:08.707
Sergeant Doakes
thinks he knows my secrets

38:08.833 --> 38:12.585
but he only needs to look at this,
my body of work,

38:12.712 --> 38:14.379
to know the reaI me.

38:14.505 --> 38:16.840
Suit up if you're gonna touch. . .

38:20.344 --> 38:23.680
No, l'm just. . .
dropping off some X-rays.

38:24.724 --> 38:26.141
l'm Dexter Morgan.

38:27.018 --> 38:28.101
l know who you are.

38:29.353 --> 38:30.812
Right.

38:31.856 --> 38:36.026
Looks like the lab tech's
gone home for the night, so l'll just. . .

38:41.532 --> 38:43.575
You hoping they'll talk to you?

38:43.701 --> 38:45.410
The ones with heads, anyway.

38:48.205 --> 38:51.207
They always speak. . . Eventually.

38:54.587 --> 38:58.006
Just got to ask the right question.

38:59.216 --> 39:00.800
Which is?

39:02.511 --> 39:04.471
"Why were they chosen?"

39:04.597 --> 39:07.265
You looking for a pattern?

39:07.391 --> 39:08.892
One doesn't kill this many people

39:09.018 --> 39:12.729
in this careful, methodical way
without a reason. . .

39:13.814 --> 39:14.898
Some. . .

39:15.024 --> 39:16.858
twisted set of principles.

39:19.403 --> 39:21.780
Yeah. they would have
to be twisted, wouldn't they?

39:21.906 --> 39:25.658
The worst killers in history are the ones
who think the murders were somehow. . .

39:25.785 --> 39:28.286
just. even deserved.

39:29.372 --> 39:31.456
Leaders have slaughtered
whole populations

39:31.582 --> 39:33.333
for the same warped reason.

39:34.460 --> 39:37.087
But there's never
any justification for killing.

39:37.213 --> 39:38.588
No.

39:39.632 --> 39:41.841
Well, one, of course.

39:44.345 --> 39:51.476
To save an innocent life.

39:51.602 --> 39:56.106
How many more bodies would there be
had I not stopped those kiIIers?

39:57.233 --> 39:59.401
I didn't do it to save Iives...

40:00.236 --> 40:02.529
but save Iives I did.

40:04.073 --> 40:06.116
Motivation aside, l think Harry and Lundy

40:06.242 --> 40:09.619
would agree on this one.

40:18.462 --> 40:20.839
- Roger the artful dodger.
- Jesus Chr. . .

40:20.965 --> 40:22.715
You scared me, bro.

40:23.300 --> 40:24.884
We have some unfinished business.

40:25.010 --> 40:27.095
Oh, yeah, right, the warranty and stuff.

40:27.221 --> 40:30.223
l can't write you up right now.
l got the wife waiting for me.

40:30.349 --> 40:32.892
- You're not married.
- Ex-wife. l got to take the kids.

40:33.018 --> 40:35.145
- You don't have kids.
- Stepkids, they're hers.

40:35.271 --> 40:37.981
- Nope.
- OK, how about this one?

40:38.107 --> 40:40.024
l don't give a shit.

40:43.654 --> 40:45.738
Neither do l.

40:54.457 --> 40:56.958
You were right about
the ample cargo space.

41:13.684 --> 41:15.560
Where am l?

41:20.691 --> 41:22.317
Looks different under plastic,

41:22.443 --> 41:25.403
but you spent an evening here. . .

41:25.529 --> 41:27.447
with Ann Cohen.

41:28.532 --> 41:30.909
You took her last breath
from her right over there.

41:31.035 --> 41:32.243
- You remember?
- No.

41:32.369 --> 41:34.579
You're. . .you're wrong. l wouldn't.

41:34.705 --> 41:37.749
You would and you did
and you were about to do it again.

41:37.875 --> 41:39.417
That's why we're here.

41:39.543 --> 41:41.544
No, this is crazy.

41:41.670 --> 41:43.213
You got the wrong guy. l. . .

41:44.048 --> 41:45.673
l sell cars, for God's sake.

41:45.799 --> 41:48.009
l've never hurt anyone.
Definitely not a woman.

41:48.135 --> 41:49.469
Why can't l do that?

41:49.595 --> 41:50.595
Do what?

41:50.721 --> 41:52.472
Lie like that.

41:53.557 --> 41:56.809
l mean, l thought l was good,
but you, it's. . .mwah.

41:56.936 --> 41:58.311
l don't lie.

41:59.438 --> 42:00.939
OK, that one was weak.

42:01.065 --> 42:04.275
OK, look. . .any car on the lot, it's yours.

42:04.401 --> 42:07.779
T-bird, Town Car, you name it - yours free.

42:07.905 --> 42:09.864
- l'll call it in right now.
- Lot's closed.

42:09.990 --> 42:12.033
l'll have them open it up.
l'm the manager.

42:12.159 --> 42:13.785
The manager's name is Rick Buxton.

42:13.911 --> 42:15.411
Yeah, but l've been there
longer than he has.

42:15.538 --> 42:17.747
- You've been there three months.
- At the other lot.

42:21.919 --> 42:25.463
lt's like watching someone ski moguls.
You just hop from one lie to the next -

42:25.589 --> 42:27.173
No shame, no embarrassment.

42:27.299 --> 42:30.635
You just don't give a shit.

42:32.763 --> 42:33.763
That's the key, right?

42:33.889 --> 42:37.642
Not to care about anyone or. . .anything.

42:37.768 --> 42:39.435
l care.

42:40.521 --> 42:41.563
l care a lot.

42:41.689 --> 42:43.982
No, it was a compliment.

42:44.108 --> 42:46.693
- l don't care, either.
- Yes, you do.

42:46.819 --> 42:48.069
Like about your wife.

42:48.195 --> 42:49.320
Not married.

42:49.446 --> 42:51.823
Girlfriend, then.

42:51.949 --> 42:53.992
l saw it the minute
you walked on the lot.

42:58.205 --> 43:00.498
What did you see? Tell me.

43:01.500 --> 43:04.377
Look, most guys your age,
they beeline...

43:04.503 --> 43:05.670
Right for the horsepower -

43:05.796 --> 43:08.256
you know, something flashy, sexy.

43:08.382 --> 43:09.382
But you,

43:09.508 --> 43:12.927
you're there all alone.
no one there to nag you,

43:13.053 --> 43:15.680
and you don't even glance
at the coupes.

43:15.806 --> 43:18.641
The only thing you look at
is the minivan.

43:19.476 --> 43:22.604
like you can see her
in the passenger's seat

43:22.730 --> 43:23.771
and the kids in the back.

43:23.897 --> 43:25.857
- Leave the kids out.
- See?

43:25.983 --> 43:28.985
You're lying to yourself
if you think you don't care.

43:31.697 --> 43:34.449
She's just a companion, really.

43:35.784 --> 43:37.869
Started that way, anyway.

43:39.455 --> 43:41.831
Someone who. . .

43:41.957 --> 43:43.583
looked good, normal.

43:43.709 --> 43:45.376
They worm their way in.

43:45.502 --> 43:47.503
Yeah, they do.

43:47.630 --> 43:50.048
Then they shut you out.

43:55.512 --> 43:58.097
That's what this is about?
That. . .she shut you out?

43:58.223 --> 44:02.101
Oh. Man, OK, l get it. l. . .

44:02.227 --> 44:03.311
l've been there.

44:05.522 --> 44:08.107
But you can't let her get to you like this

44:08.233 --> 44:12.153
'cause they're all the same,
fucking bitches.

44:12.279 --> 44:14.822
You do everything for them,
and then they fuck you.

44:14.948 --> 44:18.201
She's not worth it, all right?
You're better off without that cunt.

44:18.327 --> 44:20.370
Don't. . .

44:21.997 --> 44:24.707
talk that way about my girlfriend.

44:29.296 --> 44:33.257
l"m Dexter,
and I'm not sure what I am.

44:34.343 --> 44:35.843
Hi, Dexter.

44:35.969 --> 44:41.849
l just know there's something dark in me. . .

44:42.726 --> 44:44.394
and l hide it.

44:46.647 --> 44:49.107
l certainly don't talk about it. . .

44:49.233 --> 44:51.943
but it's there. . .

44:52.069 --> 44:53.903
always.

44:56.031 --> 44:58.783
This dark passenger.

44:58.909 --> 45:02.453
And when he's driving, l feel. . .

45:03.080 --> 45:04.789
alive. . .

45:05.874 --> 45:09.794
half sick with the thrill.
the complete wrongness.

45:12.256 --> 45:14.132
l don't fight him.

45:14.258 --> 45:15.883
l don't want to.

45:18.429 --> 45:20.096
He's all l've got.

45:22.015 --> 45:25.810
Nothing else could love me, not even. . .

45:27.604 --> 45:29.313
especially not me.

45:33.110 --> 45:37.530
Or is that just a lie
the dark passenger tells me?

45:42.286 --> 45:46.038
Because lately there are
these moments when l feel. . .

45:50.836 --> 45:54.255
connected to something else -

45:54.381 --> 45:56.048
someone.

45:58.177 --> 46:00.219
lt's like. . .

46:01.680 --> 46:04.432
the mask is slipping. . .

46:07.728 --> 46:09.854
and things. . .

46:12.483 --> 46:14.567
people. . .

46:15.819 --> 46:20.114
who never mattered before
are suddenly starting to matter.

46:21.200 --> 46:24.118
lt scares the hell out of me.

46:51.772 --> 46:53.773
Hello. . .

46:53.899 --> 46:55.191
Dexter.

47:03.784 --> 47:06.869
That's all the time
we have for sharing.

47:06.995 --> 47:10.122
Would someone lead us
in the serenity prayer?

47:11.750 --> 47:13.459
Lila.

47:27.266 --> 47:30.434
l knew there was something wrong with you.

47:30.561 --> 47:33.938
The secrets, the sneaking around. . .

47:34.064 --> 47:35.481
now it all makes sense.

47:35.607 --> 47:38.234
God grant me
serenity to accept. . .

47:38.360 --> 47:41.654
A lot of cops
have been where you are.

47:41.780 --> 47:44.115
The booze, the drugs. . .

47:44.741 --> 47:47.451
Makes the job go down easier.

47:49.329 --> 47:51.497
Stay clean and stay out of my way,

47:51.623 --> 47:54.000
we won't have a problem.

47:54.126 --> 47:57.461
Oh, and you owe me a new Michelin,
you motherfucker.

48:07.806 --> 48:08.723
l have all your forms,

48:08.849 --> 48:11.309
so we'll do what we can
to bring your dad home.

48:11.435 --> 48:13.102
l'm sorry. You don't understand.

48:13.228 --> 48:15.396
l don't want him home.

48:15.522 --> 48:17.940
Just tell me he's dead.
We need to know he's gone.

48:18.066 --> 48:20.526
Right, you want closure.

48:20.652 --> 48:22.778
l want peace.

48:22.905 --> 48:24.280
He made our lives a living hell.

48:24.406 --> 48:26.991
When he'd go to prison,
it was a blessing. but...

48:27.117 --> 48:30.328
you kept letting him out.

48:30.454 --> 48:33.581
l need to tell my mother, my sister,
that they're safe

48:33.707 --> 48:35.166
and that he's rotting in hell.

48:35.292 --> 48:38.002
Call me when you can tell me that.

48:53.143 --> 48:55.102
Lundy, wait.

48:57.814 --> 48:59.982
l think... l mean.
it could be a coincidence -

49:00.108 --> 49:01.776
but there are two of them.

49:02.903 --> 49:05.696
- Two...
- Missing people with records. . .

49:05.822 --> 49:07.698
prison records.

49:08.909 --> 49:09.992
lnteresting.

49:12.871 --> 49:15.373
And who typically has a prison record?

49:17.459 --> 49:19.460
l don't know.

49:20.587 --> 49:22.296
Bad guys?

49:23.382 --> 49:25.508
Bad guys.

49:25.634 --> 49:28.844
- Do you think it could be a. . .
- A pattern? Maybe.

49:29.888 --> 49:32.598
We'll run all the victims' DNA
against the criminal database.

49:32.724 --> 49:34.433
DC lab is still open.

49:36.728 --> 49:38.562
Come on. Let's get to work.

49:55.080 --> 49:56.288
Dexter, what?

49:56.415 --> 49:59.000
You were right.
l'm sorry to wake you up,

49:59.126 --> 50:01.168
but l had to let you know
that you were right.

50:01.294 --> 50:02.461
About what?

50:02.587 --> 50:04.255
The program.

50:04.381 --> 50:06.632
lt's. . .

50:06.758 --> 50:08.843
lt's good. lt's really good.

50:10.470 --> 50:14.640
l. . .am always so in my head.

50:15.267 --> 50:18.144
But this, it was. . .

50:18.270 --> 50:19.520
good.

50:21.773 --> 50:24.942
ln fact, it's already helped me a lot.
Thank you.

50:38.623 --> 50:40.458
Oh, l do love this car.

50:40.584 --> 50:42.293
Yeah, l thought you might.

50:46.965 --> 50:48.758
So, l will pick you up in an hour.

50:48.884 --> 50:51.385
We'll go someplace nice for lunch.

50:52.471 --> 50:54.138
Oh, there's my sponsor.

50:54.264 --> 50:56.432
Really? Where?

50:56.558 --> 50:57.683
The guy in the blue shirt?

50:57.809 --> 50:59.643
No, next to him. Lila.

51:06.151 --> 51:08.694
- Bye.
- Bye.

51:13.825 --> 51:15.743
l'm back.
