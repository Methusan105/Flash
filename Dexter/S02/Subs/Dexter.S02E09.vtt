WEBVTT

00:02.298 --> 00:04.133
Previously on Dexter...

00:04.259 --> 00:06.010
You'll notice we have
some new faces here.

00:06.136 --> 00:07.761
Are we under investigation?

00:07.887 --> 00:09.346
Sloppy blood work.

00:09.472 --> 00:12.558
l asked myself,
"How the hell did that happen?"

00:14.811 --> 00:16.854
Bay Harbor Butcher is one of our own.

00:16.980 --> 00:19.606
Dexter and l broke up.

00:19.733 --> 00:22.276
Does that mean he doesn't like us either?

00:22.402 --> 00:24.069
Would you have dinner with me
tomorrow night?

00:24.195 --> 00:25.654
l'd love to have dinner with you.

00:28.575 --> 00:31.160
Your past was a bigger mystery
than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.

00:31.286 --> 00:34.371
lt's time to make Doakes go away.

00:41.171 --> 00:43.380
sergeant James Doakes
is on administrative leave

00:43.506 --> 00:45.549
pending an internal affairs investigation.

00:45.675 --> 00:46.842
Are we through here, sir?

00:46.968 --> 00:49.595
- No, actually. We're just getting. . .
- We're done.

00:51.347 --> 00:53.390
Oh. There's my sponsor.

00:53.516 --> 00:54.767
This woman sees me.

00:54.893 --> 00:56.393
l don't care what you did.

00:56.519 --> 00:59.063
She's looking behind the mask,
and she"s not turning away.

00:59.189 --> 01:00.773
You a friend of Dexter's?

01:00.899 --> 01:03.567
l'm his decorator. Love the hat.

01:08.031 --> 01:09.073
Dexter!

01:09.199 --> 01:11.366
Help, please!

01:11.493 --> 01:14.703
I need to embrace who I am. I need to kiII the
man who murdered my mother.

01:14.829 --> 01:17.748
A secret cabin in the middIe
of the Everglades -

01:17.874 --> 01:20.834
what more couId a rededicated
seriaI kiIIer ask for?

01:20.960 --> 01:22.753
lt's kind of fitting, don't you think?

01:34.057 --> 01:38.519
Well. it's just that the door was open
and you're the only other one with a key.

01:38.645 --> 01:40.854
Rita, get out of the house.
Call the police.

01:40.980 --> 01:43.607
l can't take you with me.

01:45.110 --> 01:46.777
Someone was in this house.

01:46.903 --> 01:48.821
- Dexter, what's going on?
- Please. just stay here.

01:48.947 --> 01:51.532
Stay away from Rita.

01:51.658 --> 01:54.076
Stay away from me.

03:50.193 --> 03:53.570
- That's what l said.
- That l'm always right?

03:53.696 --> 03:56.490
That you were right about Lila.
She was bad for me.

03:56.616 --> 04:00.035
And that l'm always right!
Hurry the fuck up!

04:00.161 --> 04:02.704
l didn't realize how bad till last night.

04:03.498 --> 04:06.208
Hey, Vince. How's it going?

04:06.334 --> 04:08.293
She had me fighting
with myself the whole time.

04:08.419 --> 04:10.671
All that self-reflection is unhealthy.

04:10.797 --> 04:12.839
Stop reflecting and move.

04:13.049 --> 04:15.550
- Whoa.
- Sorry.

04:15.677 --> 04:18.929
The fact is l already know who l am,
and l'm done fighting it.

04:19.055 --> 04:22.099
So the battle's over. Lila's over.

04:22.225 --> 04:24.601
Morgan, clean this mess up.

04:24.727 --> 04:27.396
lt's a goddamn safety hazard.

04:41.077 --> 04:44.121
Can't leave this shit lying around, bro.

04:51.087 --> 04:54.798
Nice - my subconscious isn't
even bothering with symbolism.

04:54.924 --> 04:59.094
That's what l get for leaving the remains
of Jimenez up in that cabin.

04:59.220 --> 05:01.805
Bad time to get sloppy,
with Special Agent Lundy

05:01.931 --> 05:06.143
putting everyone in law enforcement
under a microscope.

05:07.395 --> 05:11.023
Dexter? What are you doing here?

05:11.149 --> 05:14.151
l. . .

05:16.946 --> 05:19.114
just wanted to give you that.

05:21.075 --> 05:23.493
You're in the same clothes as last night.

05:23.619 --> 05:25.954
You slept here?

05:26.080 --> 05:27.622
Not intentionally.

05:27.749 --> 05:32.169
l just wanted to make sure
whoever broke in stayed away.

05:32.295 --> 05:34.921
l guess l kind of fell asleep on the job.

05:36.132 --> 05:37.132
Sorry.

05:37.884 --> 05:39.468
Don't be.

05:39.594 --> 05:42.429
- Dexter! Dexter's here!
- Hey. guys!

05:42.555 --> 05:46.558
Dexter, l made a killer robot
that eats airplanes. Want to see?

05:46.684 --> 05:49.478
Mom's making pancakes.
You want bananas in yours?

05:53.274 --> 05:56.443
Actually, guys, there's something
l got to go deal with. so...

05:56.569 --> 05:58.695
Then why'd you come?

05:58.821 --> 06:01.573
'Cause you needed one of these.

06:09.290 --> 06:10.791
All right, guys,

06:10.917 --> 06:14.544
Dexter's got work to do,
so go eat pancakes.

06:14.670 --> 06:17.089
Add extra bananas for me.

06:22.887 --> 06:25.389
l didn't mean for them to find me here.

06:25.515 --> 06:29.643
Well, it's OK. l think they needed a hug too.

06:31.229 --> 06:32.771
Take care, Dexter.

06:32.897 --> 06:35.273
Wait. l want to say something.

06:43.074 --> 06:45.158
l'm sorry.

06:46.119 --> 06:48.870
- All right.
- l feel. . .

06:51.707 --> 06:53.667
such regret,

06:53.793 --> 06:57.671
which is rare for me.

06:57.797 --> 07:02.551
But not that l don't mess up, l do,

07:03.928 --> 07:06.012
just never so stupendously.

07:07.473 --> 07:11.059
l had you and them.

07:12.437 --> 07:15.897
And l had us. So much to have.

07:18.067 --> 07:21.862
And just to demolish it,

07:21.988 --> 07:24.781
l honestly thought
that l was smarter than that.

07:24.907 --> 07:26.908
Rude awakening.

07:27.618 --> 07:30.745
Lila was one of the biggest
mistakes of my life.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.917
lt means a lot to me, Dexter.

07:37.420 --> 07:42.048
But it doesn't change the fact
that you slept with another woman.

07:42.175 --> 07:45.218
- l can't forget that.
- l don't expect you to. l just. . .

07:45.344 --> 07:47.304
wanted to say it.

07:55.605 --> 07:58.899
All l can do now is
pick up the pieces of Jimenez.

07:59.025 --> 08:01.109
He's one big pile of evidence -

08:01.235 --> 08:04.696
not that anyone will easily
break into that cabin, the thing's a bunker.

08:04.822 --> 08:06.948
Still, l can't leave a kill lying around.

08:07.074 --> 08:08.783
I'II have to caII in sick at work.

08:30.306 --> 08:33.183
It's not Doakes. FBI.

08:33.309 --> 08:34.809
My feeble interview with Lundy

08:34.936 --> 08:37.687
might have put me
on his shortIist of suspects.

08:37.813 --> 08:40.732
Left turn to the cabin...

08:40.858 --> 08:43.151
right turn to a change of clothes and work.

08:45.446 --> 08:49.699
Glad l'm at peace with Harry's code again.
It makes decisions easier -

08:49.825 --> 08:52.452
caution first, Jimenez later.

09:04.632 --> 09:06.925
Announcing arrival of flight 274

09:07.051 --> 09:10.387
from Santiago, Dominican Republic,
gate 20-B.

09:10.513 --> 09:14.015
Your caII has been forwarded to a
voice-message system.

09:14.141 --> 09:16.560
- James Doakes...
- ...is not avaiIabIe.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.771
To page this person, press five now.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.986
You know what? Fuck you, James.
Fuck you and your disappearing act.

09:26.112 --> 09:28.363
You know. you didn't
just stand me up last night.

09:28.489 --> 09:30.949
You screwed yourself
out of a six-figure security job,

09:31.075 --> 09:35.495
which means that being a cop
is one of the few options you have left.

09:35.621 --> 09:39.583
So, stop pissing off the people
that can help you.

09:39.709 --> 09:43.086
Lundy's people have been
trying to reach you.

09:43.212 --> 09:46.423
They just want a hand
with the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

09:46.549 --> 09:48.174
James, give it to them.

09:48.301 --> 09:50.969
Show Lundy that you are a team player.

09:51.095 --> 09:52.762
Fake it.

09:54.223 --> 09:57.350
And pick up when l call again.

09:57.476 --> 09:59.561
'Cause l'm gonna keep calling.

10:01.397 --> 10:04.024
l'm not giving up on you, James.

10:15.328 --> 10:18.455
Your right eye is a little darker
than your left eye.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.460
And you weigh about 50 pounds.

10:23.586 --> 10:25.545
l'm gonna have to fatten you up.

10:25.671 --> 10:28.048
Didn't seem to bother you last night. . .

10:28.174 --> 10:30.091
or this morning.

10:31.927 --> 10:35.013
So much for taking it slow, huh?

10:35.139 --> 10:38.099
The slow part was nice.

10:38.225 --> 10:41.686
l guess that's the perk
of dating a man who's experienced.

10:41.812 --> 10:43.980
Read "old guy".

10:44.106 --> 10:46.483
Read what l said.

10:46.609 --> 10:50.820
Experienced, as in technique. . .

10:50.946 --> 10:52.864
as in mad skills.

11:03.125 --> 11:06.753
Are you always gonna be this touchy
about the age thing? 'Cause that will get old.

11:06.879 --> 11:07.962
Sorry.

11:08.089 --> 11:12.175
This is new territory for me,
dating in general,

11:12.301 --> 11:15.929
dating someone so young in particular,

11:16.055 --> 11:18.014
and dating a co-worker especially.

11:18.140 --> 11:22.227
Ooh. so l'm the more
experienced one. Cool.

11:22.353 --> 11:23.770
You've dated co-workers?

11:23.896 --> 11:26.398
OK, not that experienced.

11:28.984 --> 11:32.946
Well. l've seen enough of them
to see where they go wrong, and, uh. . .

11:33.072 --> 11:34.948
experience tells me that. . .

11:35.074 --> 11:37.534
full disclosure is the best way to go.

11:38.327 --> 11:40.870
What, like. . .

11:40.996 --> 11:43.039
tell people at work?

11:44.166 --> 11:48.169
Debra, l'm an aboveboard kind of guy,

11:48.295 --> 11:50.672
and in the history of office romances,

11:50.798 --> 11:52.882
sneaking around has never worked.

11:53.008 --> 11:54.801
l don't know.

11:56.011 --> 11:58.888
Things are just so tense
around the station right now.

11:59.014 --> 12:01.391
So you're worried
about making people tense?

12:01.517 --> 12:03.560
l just think the timing is bad.

12:03.686 --> 12:06.354
Maybe we should wait until we can. . .

12:13.821 --> 12:15.572
Lundy.

12:17.366 --> 12:18.992
When?

12:20.453 --> 12:21.911
Notify DC.

12:22.037 --> 12:25.498
Then get Cal to go sit
on Mendelsohn until he signs.

12:25.624 --> 12:27.208
Yeah.

12:27.334 --> 12:31.921
And then call the field office
and get me more bodies.

12:32.047 --> 12:34.841
Well, we need to move on this now.

12:34.967 --> 12:39.220
Yes. OK.

12:39.346 --> 12:41.473
- What's up?
- Not sure.

12:41.599 --> 12:43.808
Something break on the Butcher?

12:43.934 --> 12:45.935
l got to go.

12:46.061 --> 12:48.938
There's quiche. Eat it.

12:49.064 --> 12:51.274
Wait, shouldn't we finish
talking about this whole. . .

12:53.110 --> 12:55.403
full-disclosure thing?

13:05.039 --> 13:07.624
Lundy's bees are buzzing.

13:07.750 --> 13:10.710
Something has agitated the hive.

13:12.588 --> 13:15.757
My money's on Connolly down in Property.

13:15.883 --> 13:18.259
Looks like much ado
about something in there.

13:18.385 --> 13:20.553
Lundy's got a suspect
for the Bay Harbor Butcher,

13:20.679 --> 13:23.389
and, bro, it's one of us here.

13:23.516 --> 13:27.185
That's. . .disturbing.

13:27.311 --> 13:29.521
We're not sure
that Lundy's picked someone,

13:29.647 --> 13:31.648
but if he has, it sure as hell
isn't one of my people.

13:31.774 --> 13:34.400
l'm sorry. Lieutenant.
but l confirmed it myself last night.

13:34.527 --> 13:36.236
Everything points to someone in this house.

13:36.362 --> 13:37.695
Who in this house?

13:37.822 --> 13:40.114
l don't know. but something
must have broke this morning,

13:40.241 --> 13:43.493
'cause Lundy shut us PD
out of the task force, brought more Feds in.

13:43.619 --> 13:45.954
So he definitely has someone
in his cross hairs.

13:47.623 --> 13:49.791
What about Steinbauer in lmpound?
Dude's a freak.

13:49.917 --> 13:52.085
- l bet it's Wykoff from Records.
- Chico, please.

13:52.211 --> 13:53.795
What about Loring in Narcotics?

13:53.921 --> 13:56.172
Or it could be that murderous Morgan
in Blood Spatter.

13:56.298 --> 13:58.091
Maybe l was being watched this morning.

13:58.217 --> 14:00.927
But they'd be doing
more than watching if they had proof.

14:01.053 --> 14:03.054
What's going on in there?

14:03.180 --> 14:05.056
You tell us.

14:06.141 --> 14:08.184
- Why would l know?
- Come on. You're Lundy's pet.

14:08.310 --> 14:09.936
- Fuck you.
- Seriously,

14:10.062 --> 14:11.938
what's Lundy got,
or is he just blowing smoke?

14:12.064 --> 14:15.024
seriously. l don't know.
But if he's got something, it ain't smoke.

14:15.150 --> 14:19.112
- Lundy's too good to blow smoke.
- Man. no wonder you're his pet.

14:19.238 --> 14:21.364
- Fuck you twice.
- OK, enough. Enough.

14:21.490 --> 14:24.993
lf you're not on the task force.
you're clearing cases for the day.

14:25.119 --> 14:26.870
Missed you too.

14:29.123 --> 14:30.790
Morgan.

14:40.259 --> 14:42.886
- We've got company.
- Yeah, l noticed.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.721
Not there.

14:44.847 --> 14:46.222
ln there. . .

14:46.348 --> 14:48.224
waiting for you.

14:48.350 --> 14:50.894
Lundy brought in
his own forensic techs.

14:51.854 --> 14:55.064
- What are they looking for?
- Think they'd tell me?

14:55.190 --> 14:57.233
l'm just the LFl.

14:59.153 --> 15:02.822
Lead forensics investigator -
or at least l used to be.

15:02.948 --> 15:04.449
Well, fuck 'em.

15:04.575 --> 15:08.578
They can have their fucking title
and the acronym that goes with it,

15:08.704 --> 15:10.330
fucking lndian givers.

15:19.006 --> 15:20.506
Dexter Morgan.

15:20.633 --> 15:22.008
ln the flesh.

15:22.134 --> 15:24.218
Please give me your access code
for the forensic database.

15:24.345 --> 15:26.304
l'd like you to walk me
through your filing system.

15:26.430 --> 15:28.890
l'll need a breakdown
of procedure and protocol.

15:29.016 --> 15:30.975
ls there something particular
l can help you with?

15:31.101 --> 15:33.686
We just need your help
navigating the lab.

15:33.812 --> 15:35.229
Your code, please.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.399
May l?

15:47.409 --> 15:50.787
lf they're looking for proof,
they won't find it. Not here, at least.

15:50.913 --> 15:55.333
l may have briefly rebelled against Harry,
but l learned my lessons well.

15:55.459 --> 15:57.502
Come on, Dex. Tell me.

15:57.628 --> 16:00.254
Make sure they deserve it.

16:02.424 --> 16:06.427
Dexter, this is life-or-death stuff.
lt's that important.

16:06.553 --> 16:09.973
Why do you think l pulled
all those strings to arrange this?

16:10.099 --> 16:12.558
Dexter, now, come on. Tell me.

16:12.685 --> 16:15.103
What is the number one rule?

16:15.229 --> 16:16.938
Don't get caught.

16:17.064 --> 16:19.190
And what are all the other rules for?

16:19.316 --> 16:21.401
So l don't get caught.

16:23.153 --> 16:25.655
You ready for this?

16:26.323 --> 16:28.116
l'm ready.

16:45.050 --> 16:47.135
Why are they looking at us like that?

16:48.846 --> 16:50.930
They don't know why you're here,

16:51.056 --> 16:53.141
why you need to see this.

16:54.309 --> 16:57.729
But l want this
seared into your mind, son.

17:13.537 --> 17:18.166
The chair?

17:36.101 --> 17:40.480
Cross-check our data with lnterpol.
See where it leads. Yeah.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.357
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:44.359 --> 17:46.819
So, bats out of hell move slower
than you did this morning.

17:46.945 --> 17:49.655
l know. l'm sorry.
But as you can see. . .

17:49.782 --> 17:52.575
- Something's up.
- Something's up.

17:54.286 --> 17:56.329
'Cause l wondered if maybe
you were also cheesed

17:56.455 --> 17:59.082
about my whole not-disclosing thing.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.084
l don't want you to think

18:01.210 --> 18:03.419
l'm unsure or. . .

18:05.172 --> 18:06.923
embarrassed or anything.

18:07.049 --> 18:09.133
Why would you be embarrassed? l'm hot.

18:10.594 --> 18:12.595
Yeah. You got that right.

18:12.721 --> 18:16.057
Hey, look, it had nothing to do with you,

18:16.183 --> 18:19.602
except that it made you feel bad.
which was not my intention, it's just. . .

18:19.728 --> 18:21.604
- Something's up.
- Something's up.

18:21.730 --> 18:23.648
What?

18:24.399 --> 18:27.026
- l really can't tell you.
- Why not?

18:27.152 --> 18:31.030
Honestly, you don't want to know.

19:07.985 --> 19:10.444
lt's a ghost from my past.

19:10.571 --> 19:12.947
l wasn't sure l'd be able to find you.

19:13.073 --> 19:16.742
l'm in the phone book now.
Last place you look, eh?

19:16.869 --> 19:19.579
lt's good to see you, Leones.

19:19.705 --> 19:23.833
My father-in-law will be happy we have
a customer with American dollars.

19:23.959 --> 19:27.003
Looks like you're
in the travel business now, huh?

19:27.129 --> 19:29.255
Orbitz, man, it's killing us.

19:29.381 --> 19:32.925
And people only think of Haiti
for war and poverty.

19:33.051 --> 19:35.052
But the brave ones still come.

19:35.179 --> 19:37.180
We arrange tours between the islands.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.849
No more sneaking people over the border
in the middle of the night?

19:39.975 --> 19:42.643
My wife would castrate me.

19:42.769 --> 19:44.979
l work only for her father now.

19:45.105 --> 19:47.440
The man is Satan on wheels.

19:47.566 --> 19:49.650
l hope the dog will bite him.

19:53.280 --> 19:56.741
So, what can l arrange for you?

19:56.867 --> 20:00.536
Maybe the Rosewood Resort
on Little Dix. huh?

20:00.662 --> 20:03.039
Only the best for my old friend.

20:03.165 --> 20:08.336
l was thinking more like
the hospital in Dom Rep.

20:10.005 --> 20:12.590
- You are sick?
- No.

20:12.716 --> 20:15.343
But l need a. . .a discreet lab.

20:15.469 --> 20:17.720
A relaxing cruise is better.

20:17.846 --> 20:20.890
There's a shuffleboard tournament
on the Jewel Of The Seas.

20:21.016 --> 20:22.808
Big stakes.

20:22.935 --> 20:25.728
Leones, you were always the one to see,
no questions asked.

20:25.854 --> 20:29.649
- whenever we needed shit.
- l am not a fixer any more.

20:29.775 --> 20:33.194
and you are not in black operations.

20:33.320 --> 20:36.906
l'm a travel agent, and l like it.

20:37.824 --> 20:40.618
No one tries to kill me or torture me. . .

20:41.703 --> 20:43.204
except for him,

20:43.330 --> 20:45.915
with his vicious dog and foul breath.

20:46.041 --> 20:48.918
Listen, this isn't dangerous, man.

20:49.044 --> 20:51.921
l just need some blood slides analyzed.

20:53.257 --> 20:54.799
Leones, l need your help.

20:54.925 --> 20:59.095
This is all you want?
The slides analyzed?

20:59.221 --> 21:02.640
And your most expensive
tour package of the islands.

21:04.393 --> 21:06.560
Give me the slides. l'll see what l can do.

21:06.687 --> 21:09.730
Confirm the arrangements first.
l'll bring them over by boat.

21:09.856 --> 21:11.274
Avoiding Customs.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.818
Don't want to risk it with biological materials.

21:14.903 --> 21:16.946
Just tell me, James.

21:18.073 --> 21:20.157
Are you in trouble?

21:20.284 --> 21:21.909
No.

21:22.035 --> 21:24.578
But someone else is gonna be.

21:24.705 --> 21:26.831
OK.

21:26.957 --> 21:30.710
That takes us through '95's
discoverable notes.

21:30.836 --> 21:32.128
'94.

21:32.254 --> 21:34.380
How far back are you looking?

21:34.506 --> 21:37.133
Let's start with knife wounds.

21:37.259 --> 21:39.969
To search by cause of death,
go to the upper right-hand. . .

21:40.095 --> 21:42.179
lt's OK. l'm good.

21:44.599 --> 21:46.225
They're wasting their time here.

21:46.351 --> 21:50.104
lf they had a warrant for my apartment,
they'd find blood slides and killing tools.

21:50.230 --> 21:51.856
Got to move those.

21:51.982 --> 21:54.108
Got to dispose of Jimenez.

21:54.234 --> 21:56.319
lnstead, l'm waiting for the fat man to sing.

21:56.445 --> 21:57.987
- Why don't l just. . .
- l've got it.

21:58.113 --> 21:59.864
- lt will be faster. . .
- l've got it!

21:59.990 --> 22:02.533
ln fact, l think we can get along
on our own from here.

22:02.659 --> 22:04.327
And he sings.

22:10.334 --> 22:12.126
l'm wearing green underpants.

22:12.252 --> 22:13.961
Are you?

22:16.298 --> 22:18.424
Yeah, but when he bought them,
they were white.

22:18.550 --> 22:20.217
Too much information!

22:29.436 --> 22:31.520
Look who's come out of his cave.

22:31.646 --> 22:34.315
Lila, what are you doing here?

22:34.441 --> 22:35.858
She came to see me, bro.

22:35.984 --> 22:38.027
Angel mentioned
that he needed a decorator,

22:38.153 --> 22:42.198
and, well, a slot just came up,
so l gave him a call.

22:42.324 --> 22:44.283
l've always wanted a decorator.

22:44.409 --> 22:46.535
Angel, come here.

22:46.661 --> 22:49.038
She's not really a decorator.

22:49.164 --> 22:52.333
lt's not really my apartment
that l want decorated.

22:52.459 --> 22:56.754
So, hey, the boys here
have persuaded me to go for a drink.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.465
- Or ten.
- Oh, God. Should l be worried?

22:59.591 --> 23:02.468
Yes. You should.

23:02.594 --> 23:05.554
Then maybe you should come with us,

23:05.680 --> 23:08.432
because who knows what secrets
will come pouring out of me

23:08.558 --> 23:10.059
once the drinks start flowing.

23:10.185 --> 23:13.354
Hey, Lila, um, l have 2,000 square feet

23:13.480 --> 23:15.106
that needs a total makeover.

23:15.232 --> 23:17.441
You got 800 if you count your parking space.

23:17.567 --> 23:19.693
She can do it twice.

23:21.113 --> 23:25.241
l have to get to Jimenez,
but a dead man teIIs no taIes.

23:25.367 --> 23:28.411
A drunk, unstable woman very well may.

23:34.251 --> 23:37.503
But do you call me
Paddy the road builder?

23:37.629 --> 23:41.257
No, and me, with my own two hands,
l built the town library.

23:41.383 --> 23:44.468
But do you call me
Paddy the library giver?

23:44.594 --> 23:46.178
No.

23:46.304 --> 23:49.682
But you fuck one little goat. . .

23:51.560 --> 23:52.935
All right. l got one.

23:53.061 --> 23:55.813
- stop. stop.
- What? lt's a good one.

23:55.939 --> 23:58.315
Knowing you, it would be inappropriate
in front of a lady.

23:58.442 --> 24:00.234
She just did a goat-fucker joke.

24:01.445 --> 24:03.863
Aw, you're such a protector, Angel.

24:03.989 --> 24:05.573
l do my best.

24:05.699 --> 24:09.577
Like that time that you came
to Dexter's rescue at the bowling alley.

24:11.163 --> 24:15.624
You just ran right towards that mugger.
no thought for your own personal safety.

24:15.750 --> 24:17.293
That's my job.

24:17.419 --> 24:19.753
- Mine too.
- lt is not.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.923
Don't do it, Lila. Don't bring Jimenez up.

24:23.049 --> 24:25.968
Did they ever catch that guy?

24:26.094 --> 24:28.095
Yeah, Dex, did you ever file a report?

24:28.221 --> 24:31.807
- l can still look into it.
- l'm sure he's long gone by now.

24:35.562 --> 24:38.606
Yeah. Anyway, l'm gonna go to the loo.

24:39.941 --> 24:41.650
The loo?

24:41.776 --> 24:43.819
How cute is that?

24:43.945 --> 24:46.572
lt's. . . Right?

24:55.081 --> 24:57.166
What the hell do you want?

24:58.460 --> 25:00.669
l'm concerned.

25:00.795 --> 25:04.131
Usually, when someone quits their sponsor,
it means they're using again.

25:04.257 --> 25:08.469
You can quit the sponsor bullshit.
l'm done with it and you.

25:08.595 --> 25:11.013
Did l not make that clear last night?

25:11.139 --> 25:13.265
lt's out of order.

25:15.477 --> 25:18.562
- There's still work we can do together.
- No, there isn't.

25:18.688 --> 25:22.650
l am who l am. and l don't want you
coming anywhere near me or my addiction.

25:22.776 --> 25:25.861
- Do you understand?
- Oh. l understand...

25:25.987 --> 25:28.572
- how lonely you are.
- stop.

25:28.698 --> 25:31.325
Those friends of yours out there,
they didn't even know you.

25:31.451 --> 25:34.870
They just see the mask, but l see it all.

25:34.996 --> 25:37.498
l can see how upset you are.

25:39.334 --> 25:41.460
No, really?

25:41.586 --> 25:42.920
No.

25:43.046 --> 25:45.506
lt's more than just me
that's eating at you.

25:45.632 --> 25:48.300
There's something else.

25:49.302 --> 25:51.887
You don't have to handle it alone.

25:52.013 --> 25:54.181
l can help.

25:54.307 --> 25:57.977
l know how heavy that mask is,

25:58.103 --> 25:59.520
how tiring.

25:59.646 --> 26:04.108
l'm the only one who can see behind it,
and it doesn't scare me.

26:04.234 --> 26:06.902
lt's like looking in the mirror.

26:07.028 --> 26:09.738
lt's why we belong together.

26:12.325 --> 26:15.369
Hey, asshole, it's ladies only.

26:16.663 --> 26:18.247
My mistake.

26:18.373 --> 26:20.874
- He giving you trouble?
- A little.

26:22.085 --> 26:24.628
But l know he'll see l'm right.

26:24.754 --> 26:26.880
l know you will.

26:29.884 --> 26:31.885
You are not driving.

26:33.221 --> 26:36.056
Fuck you. Fine.

26:39.269 --> 26:42.187
Can't Iive with her. Can't kiII her.

26:43.773 --> 26:45.941
She's not going away.

26:48.528 --> 26:50.946
Neither is that undercover car.

26:52.490 --> 26:54.575
So much for paranoia.

26:56.411 --> 26:58.078
Those Feds are reaI.

27:12.010 --> 27:14.261
Lundy found my slides.

27:16.681 --> 27:18.390
It's over.

27:24.105 --> 27:26.899
You're out of shampoo. Sorry.

27:27.025 --> 27:29.860
- Yours is better than mine.
- What are you doing here?

27:29.986 --> 27:32.488
My new place isn't set up yet.

27:32.614 --> 27:34.615
l don't want to make a habit
of staying at Lundy's.

27:34.741 --> 27:38.202
l mean, what if people find out? lt would be
a whole new reason to disrespect me.

27:38.328 --> 27:41.080
Maybe they already know.
They keep assuming l have inside intel.

27:41.206 --> 27:43.499
They're always asking me
what Lundy knows.

27:43.625 --> 27:45.125
What does he know? Tell me.

27:45.251 --> 27:47.252
Fuck, Dex, l'm talking about
my feelings here.

27:47.379 --> 27:49.588
What the fuck is your problem?

27:49.714 --> 27:53.300
Look, l know he's old,
and it's complicated and whatever,

27:53.426 --> 27:58.430
but l feel like he's someone
l can. you know. count on.

27:58.556 --> 28:01.016
That's good, Deb. You should have that,
because l won't always be. . .

28:02.769 --> 28:04.853
Who the fuck is that at this hour?

28:07.315 --> 28:09.942
- Deb, don't.
- What the fuck?

28:11.528 --> 28:13.696
Dexter Morgan.

28:13.822 --> 28:18.033
Special Agent Lundy wants to see you.
Please come with us.

28:18.159 --> 28:21.870
Wait. Lundy didn't say anything
about this to me.

28:21.996 --> 28:24.998
- l'm sorry. Deb.
- l'm on the fucking task force.

28:25.375 --> 28:28.377
l demand to know what. . .

28:28.503 --> 28:31.046
l'm right behind you.
They're calling us in.

28:31.172 --> 28:33.382
l'm right behind you, Dex.

28:35.969 --> 28:37.928
We got him.

28:38.054 --> 28:41.181
I shouId be panicked, terrified,

28:41.307 --> 28:43.058
but Lila was right.

28:43.184 --> 28:45.060
The mask has been heavy.

28:45.186 --> 28:48.772
l won't need it in surrender. l can let it go.

28:48.898 --> 28:50.691
The pain will come

28:50.817 --> 28:54.027
when Deb finally understands
who her brother really is.

28:59.033 --> 29:02.995
Rita's horror, the kids' tears.

29:37.822 --> 29:40.073
My old friends, here to betray me.

29:41.576 --> 29:43.619
Please sit down.

29:46.581 --> 29:48.582
l'm sure that you heard we have a suspect

29:48.708 --> 29:51.293
in the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

29:51.419 --> 29:52.920
Put them on.

29:55.924 --> 29:58.801
We now have the evidence to back it up.

29:58.927 --> 30:02.763
We need answers, now.

30:05.642 --> 30:07.309
Open it.

30:26.204 --> 30:27.955
Explain it to us.

30:30.041 --> 30:32.042
Trophies.

30:32.168 --> 30:34.294
That's what l thought.

30:36.881 --> 30:38.298
What happens now?

30:38.424 --> 30:40.926
l know this will come
as a shock to you, Morgan,

30:41.052 --> 30:45.430
but our primary suspect
is someone you know well.

30:48.309 --> 30:50.686
Sergeant James Doakes.

30:50.812 --> 30:52.563
Sergeant. . .

30:52.689 --> 30:54.314
Doakes?

30:56.025 --> 30:58.902
He was the lead case investigator
on four of the Butcher victims,

30:59.028 --> 31:01.113
which put him on my radar.

31:02.949 --> 31:04.533
We looked into his background.

31:04.659 --> 31:07.703
lt turns out his father
was a butcher, and abusive.

31:07.829 --> 31:10.747
Doakes was also a trained assassin
in special Forces.

31:10.874 --> 31:14.960
That, along with his on-the-job shootings and
excessive-force citations...

31:15.086 --> 31:17.671
- He fits the profile.
- Yes.

31:18.590 --> 31:21.633
He has a need to dole out
personal justice.

31:21.759 --> 31:24.678
Yesterday, Doakes walked
out of an interview and disappeared.

31:24.804 --> 31:28.056
This morning. we were alerted
that he boarded a plane out of the country.

31:28.182 --> 31:31.226
That enabled me to get warrants
on his apartment and car.

31:34.105 --> 31:35.898
He had the slides?

31:36.024 --> 31:39.359
Carefully hidden in the trunk
of his car at the airport.

31:39.485 --> 31:41.445
lt all makes so much sense.

31:41.571 --> 31:45.490
Everyone else in the precinct
was beyond shocked when l told them.

31:47.243 --> 31:50.704
What exactly is Sergeant Doakes's
problem with you, Morgan?

31:51.456 --> 31:53.081
I kiII peopIe, for one.

31:53.207 --> 31:55.959
But what was it
Sergeant Doakes said about me?

31:56.085 --> 31:59.296
l've always sensed there was something. . .

31:59.422 --> 32:02.507
off about him. . .

32:02.634 --> 32:05.719
like he's hiding in plain sight.

32:07.889 --> 32:09.556
l never concealed my doubts.

32:09.682 --> 32:11.433
So he attacked you.

32:11.559 --> 32:13.602
Well, he might try it again,

32:13.728 --> 32:16.897
particularly when he finds out
that he's our prime suspect.

32:17.941 --> 32:19.691
Yeah. That should piss him off.

32:19.817 --> 32:22.069
We've tried to keep an eye on you
from a distance.

32:22.195 --> 32:25.530
- The undercover cars.
- Not undercover enough, obviously.

32:26.991 --> 32:30.452
l'm sorry for the abrupt pickup tonight,
but from here on out.

32:30.578 --> 32:32.704
we'll want a protective detail
on you at all times.

32:32.830 --> 32:35.499
That could complicate my life.

32:35.625 --> 32:38.377
Dexter, it will keep Doakes at bay.

32:38.503 --> 32:39.628
Good point.

32:39.754 --> 32:41.421
What happens now is we need you

32:41.547 --> 32:44.341
to analyze and match
these slides immediately.

32:44.467 --> 32:45.467
Me?

32:45.593 --> 32:47.469
l'm keeping the forensics in-house.

32:47.595 --> 32:50.222
The public needs to see our strength now.

32:50.348 --> 32:53.266
Their trust in us is about to take
a major ass-fucking.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.770
Now, l'm making you first forensic tech

32:56.896 --> 32:59.189
in the chain of custody with these slides.

32:59.315 --> 33:01.817
l figure you have
more motivation than most

33:01.943 --> 33:05.320
to see Doakes brought to justice,
so l know you'll be thorough.

33:12.120 --> 33:15.622
The TSA is circulating
Doakes's photo to all major airports.

33:16.457 --> 33:19.418
Sergeant Doakes.
He peeked behind the curtain.

33:19.544 --> 33:20.919
He saw who I am.

33:21.045 --> 33:22.921
But it only put him in the line of fire.

33:23.047 --> 33:25.507
There's an APB out
on the eastern seaboard if he moves north.

33:25.633 --> 33:27.884
- l still don't believe it.
- Because it's not true.

33:28.011 --> 33:31.346
- l don't know. . .
- Don't. Vince.

33:35.852 --> 33:37.310
Just don't.

33:40.148 --> 33:42.190
l didn't know.

33:42.316 --> 33:46.361
- l swear Lundy didn't tell me.
- l believe you.

33:46.487 --> 33:49.448
Big fucking manhunt mobilizing out there.

33:49.574 --> 33:51.616
We'll get him, Dex.

33:51.743 --> 33:54.244
And when you do,
my story has to be stronger than his.

33:54.370 --> 33:58.915
Don't worry, l'm gonna be with you
every step of the way. Me and this.

33:59.042 --> 34:01.209
l have an even bigger favor.

34:01.335 --> 34:02.377
Name it.

34:02.503 --> 34:04.379
Move into that new apartment of yours.

34:04.505 --> 34:07.549
Deb, if you got in the middle of this
and you got hurt. . .

34:07.675 --> 34:10.552
Hurt? l'm a fucking cop.

34:10.678 --> 34:13.889
You're my sister first and l'm gonna worry like a
brother. not a co-worker.

34:14.015 --> 34:15.766
Don't. God damn it.
You have enough to worry about.

34:15.892 --> 34:17.392
l can't help it.

34:17.518 --> 34:20.103
Deb, the best thing you can do for me

34:20.229 --> 34:23.023
is to give me and my protective detail
a wide berth.

34:25.234 --> 34:26.526
Fucker.

34:29.363 --> 34:31.114
Fine.

34:31.240 --> 34:33.742
l fucking hate it, but l get it.

34:38.081 --> 34:40.290
One less pair of eyes to worry about.

34:46.631 --> 34:49.424
You just can't get rid of me, can you?

34:53.096 --> 34:54.930
LaGuerta.

34:55.056 --> 34:57.265
You know I didn't do this.

34:57.391 --> 34:59.559
You know me, Maria. That's not me.

35:01.104 --> 35:03.230
Yeah, but they don't.

35:03.356 --> 35:05.190
What do they have on me?

35:05.316 --> 35:07.442
They found something in your car.

35:07.568 --> 35:09.402
Oh, shit.

35:09.529 --> 35:11.947
The longer you stay out, the worse it gets.

35:12.073 --> 35:14.950
The only way l can help you
is if you turn yourself in.

35:15.076 --> 35:17.077
No one will listen without proof.

35:17.203 --> 35:20.413
- Of what?
- Look, l don't want to pull you into this.

35:22.208 --> 35:24.209
The next time you see me,
there'll be no doubt.

35:24.335 --> 35:26.378
Until then, you won't be able to contact me.

35:26.504 --> 35:30.090
- Don't you disappear on me, James.
- Maria, l have to do this.

35:30.216 --> 35:32.676
God damn!

35:32.802 --> 35:34.886
Listen to me.

35:35.012 --> 35:37.806
l just want you to know
that you meant a lot to me.

35:37.932 --> 35:40.100
More than you know, and. . .

35:40.226 --> 35:43.270
l just want to thank you for that.

35:43.396 --> 35:45.772
What does that mean?

35:49.694 --> 35:52.946
Wait. Wait.

36:17.597 --> 36:21.057
Looks Iike I won't find
any prints or DNA on this box.

36:21.184 --> 36:24.186
I can chaIk it up to how carefuI Doakes is.

36:24.312 --> 36:27.522
Harry had strict rules
about not hurting the innocent,

36:27.648 --> 36:30.317
and for all his fury...

36:30.443 --> 36:33.028
Doakes is innocent.

36:33.154 --> 36:36.156
But there's aIso the number one ruIe -
don"t get caught.

36:39.243 --> 36:42.495
Still, he'll fight this,
and l'll have to disprove him.

36:46.667 --> 36:48.793
He couId win...

36:48.920 --> 36:51.922
or he could end up paying for my crimes.

37:19.033 --> 37:20.242
Morning.

37:22.036 --> 37:23.954
Mr. Morgan,

37:24.080 --> 37:26.915
Special Agent Lundy thought
you might need our help.

37:27.041 --> 37:28.708
Please come in.

37:28.834 --> 37:31.753
sorry about
all the secrecy yesterday.

37:31.879 --> 37:33.880
We were reviewing
Sergeant Doakes's cases,

37:34.006 --> 37:36.675
and, well, you understand.

37:36.801 --> 37:39.844
l need you to do the liquid extractions

37:39.971 --> 37:42.389
and centrifuging on these samples.

37:42.515 --> 37:45.600
- The cells just started digesting.
- Then we'll come back in 1 2 hours.

37:45.726 --> 37:47.894
The samples should be watched
at all times.

37:48.020 --> 37:49.896
Don't let anyone in or out of the lab,

37:50.022 --> 37:53.191
and don't let the incubator
dip below 37 Celsius.

37:53.317 --> 37:55.944
And, please, don't touch anything.

37:56.070 --> 37:58.405
You understand.

38:01.742 --> 38:03.827
That was satisfying.

38:09.750 --> 38:11.960
Dex! Hey, bro!

38:18.092 --> 38:21.136
Are you OK. man?
This shit with Doakes is crazy. . .

38:21.262 --> 38:23.430
- Yeah. l have to go, Angel.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

38:23.556 --> 38:27.267
Are you pissed or something
about Lila and me?

38:27.393 --> 38:30.478
- Oh. yeah. That.
- Dex, l don't want it getting between us.

38:30.604 --> 38:32.480
- lf you still want her. . .
- God. no.

38:32.606 --> 38:36.484
Lila's insane, destructive,
a naturally occurring disaster.

38:36.610 --> 38:39.654
- OK, so you don't mind if l go for it, then.
- What? No.

38:39.780 --> 38:42.032
Look, Angel, here's the real truth

38:42.158 --> 38:44.993
Lila's just using you to get at me.

38:46.078 --> 38:47.746
- So what?
- So what?

38:47.872 --> 38:50.623
Look, Dex, no one's used me
for good or bad reasons

38:50.750 --> 38:52.042
since my wife divorced me.

38:52.168 --> 38:53.918
Damn sure no one as hot as Lila.

38:54.045 --> 38:56.338
- You may be missing my point.
- Look. . .

38:56.464 --> 38:59.966
first it was the divorce,
then getting stabbed was no picnic,

39:00.092 --> 39:02.010
and now this thing with Doakes.

39:02.136 --> 39:05.805
Dark days, my friend, too dark.

39:05.931 --> 39:08.099
Man, l need a light
at the end of the tunnel, man,

39:08.225 --> 39:11.936
and Lila's it, all right?

39:13.064 --> 39:14.689
All right, then.

39:14.815 --> 39:17.692
Angel just doesn't get it. Lila's no solution.

39:17.818 --> 39:19.652
She's a probIem.

39:21.364 --> 39:23.281
Shall we?

39:24.950 --> 39:27.243
Just like my little groupies.

39:35.669 --> 39:37.379
l couldn't tell you.

39:37.505 --> 39:40.924
- Even with my brother at risk?
- We had him covered.

39:41.050 --> 39:43.635
lt would have forced you
to divide your loyalties.

39:43.761 --> 39:45.929
Plus, l didn't want to appear to favor you.

39:46.055 --> 39:49.682
- They all think you favor me anyway.
- Maybe because l do.

39:49.809 --> 39:52.811
- Do you think they know?
- Not until you tell them.

39:52.937 --> 39:54.979
Special Agent Lundy.

39:55.106 --> 39:58.650
- You're giving Doakes to the press?
- Best way to bring him in.

39:58.776 --> 40:02.404
- lf you publicly accuse him. . .
- l'm not accusing anyone.

40:02.530 --> 40:05.782
Doakes is wanted for questioning,
and that's what my press release says.

40:05.908 --> 40:07.033
lt will still destroy him.

40:07.159 --> 40:09.744
He's doing a fine job of destroying himself.

40:09.870 --> 40:14.791
- He is not your man.
- He is, however, my prime suspect.

40:15.668 --> 40:17.127
Look.

40:18.254 --> 40:20.380
l'm willing to work with you on this,

40:20.506 --> 40:22.590
but only if you let me
take lead with the media.

40:22.716 --> 40:25.802
Lieutenant, l am not letting you
anywhere near the media.

40:25.928 --> 40:29.681
He may be your ex-partner.
He may be your best friend.

40:29.807 --> 40:31.975
What he is to me is a suspect.

40:32.101 --> 40:34.727
so you deal with that
however you need to.

40:34.854 --> 40:37.480
And you will give me
your complete cooperation,

40:37.606 --> 40:39.691
or you may find yourself out of a job.

40:52.204 --> 40:54.080
lt's mine.

40:57.918 --> 40:58.877
Hello?

40:59.003 --> 41:00.962
It...it's me.

41:01.088 --> 41:03.131
l wasn't sure l should call.

41:03.257 --> 41:04.674
l'm glad you did.

41:04.800 --> 41:07.760
lt's probably best l move on,

41:07.887 --> 41:10.388
but the kids were so happy
to see you yesterday,

41:10.514 --> 41:14.642
and l wasn't, you know, unhappy.

41:14.768 --> 41:17.437
Well, that's good, right?

41:17.563 --> 41:21.149
l just... l need to know one thing.

41:21.275 --> 41:24.444
ls it over with Lila?

41:24.570 --> 41:27.614
Yes. Absolutely, completely over.

41:27.740 --> 41:29.949
lf l never see her again, it'll be too soon.

41:40.169 --> 41:41.377
Hello?

41:42.671 --> 41:44.297
l have feelings for you.

41:45.257 --> 41:47.300
l have feelings for you too.

41:48.385 --> 41:50.678
l'm not gonna fight them any more.

41:50.804 --> 41:53.681
l think we should get together and talk.

41:53.807 --> 41:55.266
Tonight?

41:57.645 --> 42:01.147
That would be great, really great.
But tonight's. . .

42:01.273 --> 42:03.816
No, this. . .is a bad idea.

42:03.943 --> 42:06.361
No, Rita, it's the best idea
you"ve ever had.

42:06.487 --> 42:10.114
lt's just we've got a big break
in the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

42:10.241 --> 42:12.700
Things are kind of intense around here.

42:12.826 --> 42:14.494
Oh, wow. Did they catch him?

42:15.663 --> 42:18.540
Well, someone's gonna go down for it.

42:18.666 --> 42:21.251
But tomorrow would be really great.

42:22.086 --> 42:24.879
OK. Tomorrow.

42:25.005 --> 42:26.422
l'll look forward to it.

42:34.598 --> 42:37.350
We're getting together tomorrow.

42:38.769 --> 42:40.853
Communication's the key.

42:45.901 --> 42:48.194
The light at the end of the tunnel.

43:02.293 --> 43:04.043
All clear.

43:04.169 --> 43:06.170
We'll have a man stationed
at the front and side doors

43:06.297 --> 43:07.922
and two in the parking lot.

43:08.048 --> 43:10.717
Just give us a yell if anything arises.

43:10.843 --> 43:14.512
Nothing's gonna arise, certainly not me -
not until tomorrow morning.

43:14.638 --> 43:16.222
l'm exhausted.

43:16.348 --> 43:19.058
Don't let anyone near this door
for any reason.

43:19.184 --> 43:23.062
- Shoot them if you have to.
- No problem. sleep tight.

43:26.942 --> 43:29.068
SIeep wouId be nice,

43:29.194 --> 43:32.280
but there's too much to do.

43:32.406 --> 43:35.742
The good news is my new friends
will keep Doakes away.

43:35.868 --> 43:39.412
The bad news is they make
getting to Jimenez difficult...

43:41.123 --> 43:43.124
but not impossible.

43:43.250 --> 43:45.543
Fortunately, a car isn't the only way

43:45.669 --> 43:47.503
to reach the Everglades,

43:47.630 --> 43:50.757
and my new marina's
only a 20-minute walk.

43:57.181 --> 43:59.807
l'm on my way, Jimenez.

43:59.933 --> 44:01.976
Don't decompose just yet.

44:15.115 --> 44:17.575
l'll be against the current on the way back.

44:17.701 --> 44:21.037
With bagging, cleanup
and detour to the GuIf Stream -

44:21.163 --> 44:23.581
tight, but l should be home by daybreak.

44:28.837 --> 44:31.297
lt's time to get you
out of my life once and for all.

44:34.301 --> 44:37.428
- You got to talk to Lundy.
- About what?

44:37.554 --> 44:39.847
Get him to hold off
on putting Doakes on the news.

44:39.973 --> 44:41.516
Maybe you should talk to Lundy.

44:41.642 --> 44:45.228
Morgan, you're one of us.
Doakes is one of us.

44:45.354 --> 44:47.522
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

44:47.648 --> 44:51.651
Look, Lieutenant, l know he's your friend,

44:51.777 --> 44:55.446
and we're all pretty fucked up about this,
but it is Lundy's ballgame.

44:55.572 --> 44:58.991
But he listens to you. You're his right hand.

44:59.118 --> 45:01.327
Right hand? Just say it.

45:01.453 --> 45:04.622
Fuck the euphemisms.
And OK, l may be sleeping with him,

45:04.748 --> 45:06.541
but that doesn't mean he tells me shit

45:06.667 --> 45:08.960
or listens to me about anything,
so stop asking.

45:09.086 --> 45:11.170
You're sleeping with Lundy?

45:16.051 --> 45:18.845
l'm sleeping at your place again tonight.

45:40.367 --> 45:42.744
Just one more trip.

45:42.870 --> 45:44.912
Ahead of scheduIe.

45:48.500 --> 45:51.586
That's right, motherfucker. lt's over.

45:58.635 --> 46:00.678
How'd you find me?

46:00.804 --> 46:02.638
GPS tap on your boat.

46:02.765 --> 46:04.974
Jesus Christ, Morgan.

46:05.100 --> 46:07.643
Jesus fucking Christ.
You're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

46:07.770 --> 46:10.813
- l really hate that name.
- Jesus Christ. man.

46:10.939 --> 46:12.023
You said that.

46:12.149 --> 46:15.818
Always knew there was something with you.
But this shit?

46:15.944 --> 46:18.154
What can l say?
You were right about me.

46:19.031 --> 46:20.782
l never held it against you.

46:20.908 --> 46:22.909
l don't now.

46:23.035 --> 46:25.703
My buddies thought l was crazy
for becoming a cop.

46:25.829 --> 46:28.206
l had skills.
l could have written my own ticket.

46:28.332 --> 46:30.374
And lately, l thought
they might have been right.

46:30.501 --> 46:32.502
But this. . .

46:32.628 --> 46:34.504
This makes it all worth it.

46:35.964 --> 46:38.132
- l'm happy for you.
- Shut the fuck up.

46:38.258 --> 46:40.343
Let's get this over with.

46:42.429 --> 46:44.263
Put them on.

46:45.766 --> 46:48.601
Morgan, you're done. Give it up.

46:48.727 --> 46:50.520
Would you in my position?

46:50.646 --> 46:52.980
l wouldn't be in your position,
you sick fuck.

46:53.106 --> 46:55.274
You sure about that?
You might want to check with Lundy.

46:56.652 --> 46:59.153
You shoot me,
who will prove your innocence?

46:59.279 --> 47:00.988
Maybe l'll just kneecap you.

47:17.840 --> 47:20.591
All right. Nice and slow.

47:23.512 --> 47:27.098
- Back the fuck off, Morgan!
- l'm just following your lead.

47:28.308 --> 47:30.142
Slow down.

48:41.798 --> 48:44.467
You're gonna have to kill me, Morgan!

48:46.887 --> 48:50.139
You're gonna have
to fucking kill me, Morgan!

48:55.896 --> 48:58.064
Morgan!
