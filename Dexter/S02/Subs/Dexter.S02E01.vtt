WEBVTT

00:13.893 --> 00:17.354
Blood. Sometimes it sets my teeth on edge,

00:17.480 --> 00:19.898
other times it helps me control the chaos.

00:22.193 --> 00:23.986
Last season on Dexter...

00:24.571 --> 00:28.282
Tonight"s the night
and it's going to happen again...and again.

00:28.408 --> 00:31.243
Open your eyes
and look at what you did!

00:31.369 --> 00:33.370
Please, you have to understand.

00:33.496 --> 00:35.122
Trust me, l definitely understand.

00:35.248 --> 00:38.125
Children - l could never do that, not like you.

00:38.251 --> 00:40.502
- Why?
- l have standards.

00:43.214 --> 00:45.299
- You'd better be a cop.
- No. Forensics.

00:45.425 --> 00:47.134
- They found another hooker.
- Another?

00:47.260 --> 00:48.385
The third in five months.

00:48.511 --> 00:50.471
There's no blood near the body at all.

00:50.597 --> 00:52.181
lt's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

00:52.307 --> 00:56.310
l"ve never seen such
clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

00:56.436 --> 00:57.978
How does he get rid of the blood?

00:58.104 --> 01:00.189
l think this is a friendly message,

01:00.315 --> 01:02.107
Kind of like, "'Hey, want to play?"'

01:02.233 --> 01:04.985
And, yes, l want to play. l really, really do.

01:05.111 --> 01:07.237
What's this sick son of a bitch telling us?

01:07.363 --> 01:08.822
Not us. Me.

01:08.948 --> 01:10.157
lnteresting hand job.

01:10.283 --> 01:13.077
- Think this is our guy's work?
- The lce-Truck Killer?

01:13.203 --> 01:14.495
This feels familiar.

01:14.621 --> 01:16.121
When he broke into my apartment,

01:16.247 --> 01:19.541
he took some time to get to know me,
my life, my secrets.

01:19.667 --> 01:23.629
He knows. He"s not corrupting
the happy, Hallmark images of my youth.

01:23.755 --> 01:26.423
He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

01:26.549 --> 01:29.301
Son, there are people out there
who do really bad things.

01:29.427 --> 01:32.304
Of course, you have to learn to spot them.
But l can teach you.

01:32.430 --> 01:35.974
The code of Harry,
my foster father, is satisfied.

01:36.101 --> 01:38.977
- So how the hell was your date with Rita?
- Great.

01:39.104 --> 01:40.854
She's perfect because Rita is,

01:40.980 --> 01:43.148
in her own way, as damaged as me.

01:43.274 --> 01:45.943
- l want...
- A normal life.

01:46.069 --> 01:47.653
Yeah, a normal life.

01:50.365 --> 01:51.907
The killer is an artist.

01:52.033 --> 01:54.118
You give me the fucking creeps,
you know that?

01:54.244 --> 01:55.869
Yeah, l know. Sorry about that.

01:55.995 --> 01:57.996
Why, in a building full of cops,

01:58.123 --> 02:01.750
is Doakes the only one
who gets the creeps from me?

02:01.876 --> 02:03.669
l want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

02:03.795 --> 02:04.920
Dex, Rudy's different.

02:05.046 --> 02:07.548
l feel safe with him.
l think l'm falling for him.

02:08.758 --> 02:10.342
Dexter.

02:11.219 --> 02:12.845
l've waited a long time to meet you.

02:12.971 --> 02:14.888
Dad's coming home?

02:15.014 --> 02:17.349
lf their dad shows up.
we'll deal with it together.

02:17.475 --> 02:19.852
Paul Bennett, father on parole.

02:19.978 --> 02:21.353
Are you fucking my wife?

02:22.564 --> 02:24.690
My heart beats for those two kids,

02:24.816 --> 02:27.526
so if you or that skinny bitch
try to screw with what's mine,

02:27.652 --> 02:29.736
l swear to God.
l don't care who l have to hurt.

02:29.863 --> 02:32.614
Let's face it, Paul, you've been a problem.

02:32.740 --> 02:34.158
lt's time for you to go away.

02:34.284 --> 02:36.410
He smacked me over the head
and dragged me out of the house,

02:36.536 --> 02:37.995
probably through the back yard.

02:38.121 --> 02:41.582
All l want is for you to look for a shoe.
lt"s missing.

02:41.708 --> 02:44.418
l'm telling you.
Dexter is not who you think he is.

02:44.544 --> 02:46.879
Do l have the pleasure
of your company this weekend?

02:47.005 --> 02:49.381
We've had a major break
in the lce-Truck Killer case.

02:49.507 --> 02:51.133
Debra Morgan. . .

02:51.259 --> 02:53.093
will you marry me?

02:53.219 --> 02:54.386
Yes. Yes.

02:54.512 --> 02:55.512
Where's my sister?

02:55.638 --> 02:57.806
Took her code 1 2.
Left about an hour ago.

02:57.932 --> 02:59.933
How did you not know who l was?

03:00.059 --> 03:03.770
l think a real cop
would. . .at least have a sense

03:03.897 --> 03:07.858
that she was in the presence
of the person that she was hunting.

03:09.068 --> 03:11.111
Where the fuck are you?
l'm here at work.

03:11.237 --> 03:14.489
l need to talk to you.
Do not see Rudy until you find me.

03:14.616 --> 03:15.908
You're connected to this.

03:16.034 --> 03:19.286
l don't know how, but l'll find out, and some of
what l find's gonna stick to your ass.

03:19.412 --> 03:21.622
l was hoping you could dig up
an old case file for me.

03:21.748 --> 03:22.873
Sure thing.

03:22.999 --> 03:25.626
lt's the crime scene where Harry found me.

03:25.752 --> 03:28.086
This is what he wanted me to find all along.

03:28.213 --> 03:29.588
He's showing me where to go.

03:29.714 --> 03:32.382
Laura Moser and three others
found chopped up with a chainsaw.

03:33.885 --> 03:36.136
What is in that report that
Harry didn't want me to see?

03:36.262 --> 03:38.513
What he saw in that
cargo container changed him.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.808
You were left there for days, starving,

03:41.935 --> 03:43.852
ln blood two inches thick.

03:43.978 --> 03:46.104
You remember now?

03:47.440 --> 03:49.316
- l have a brother.
- A real brother.

03:49.442 --> 03:51.485
l didn't even know you existed.

03:51.611 --> 03:55.239
lmagine how l felt
when l tracked you down

03:55.365 --> 03:57.824
and found out you were exactly like me.

03:57.951 --> 04:00.244
You can't be a killer and a hero.

04:00.370 --> 04:02.913
lt doesn't work that way!

04:07.752 --> 04:10.671
Why me, Dex? Why'd he choose me?

04:10.797 --> 04:12.256
Just lucky, l guess.

04:15.093 --> 04:18.178
l was so scared. l was so scared.

04:18.304 --> 04:19.680
Am l one of your victims now?

04:19.806 --> 04:22.057
You're not a trophy.

04:22.183 --> 04:24.142
But you need to be put down.

04:25.812 --> 04:26.937
Sorry.

04:27.063 --> 04:29.439
l drove away a brother who accepts me

04:29.565 --> 04:31.858
for a foster father who betrayed me.

04:31.985 --> 04:34.194
l'm not alone, and Harry kept it from me.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.863
Doakes always sensed
l was hiding something.

04:36.990 --> 04:39.700
Now he knows.
My devil danced with his demon

04:39.826 --> 04:42.494
and the fiddIer's tune is far from over.

06:44.283 --> 06:46.785
Tonight's the night...

06:53.918 --> 06:57.462
..and it's going to happen
again and again.

06:58.464 --> 07:00.549
Has to happen.

07:04.011 --> 07:09.015
It's not what I want,
but what I want doesn't matter.

07:09.142 --> 07:13.562
This is the only way
I know how to survive.

07:18.109 --> 07:20.819
l'm coiled and ready to strike...

07:27.910 --> 07:29.578
...although a spare will do.

07:29.704 --> 07:31.955
Nice. Nice. Nice warm-up, bro.

07:32.081 --> 07:35.208
Now, you can get that.
Remember, loose-arm swing.

07:35.334 --> 07:36.543
Loose. Got it.

07:36.669 --> 07:37.961
And keep your mind limber.

07:38.087 --> 07:40.672
- l'm doing mental jumping jacks.
- Don't forget.

07:40.798 --> 07:42.841
Okey dokey.

07:42.967 --> 07:44.676
l'm on edge.

07:44.802 --> 07:48.388
38 days, 1 6 hours,
and 1 2 minutes have passed

07:48.514 --> 07:50.265
since l killed my brother.

07:50.766 --> 07:55.187
In that entire time, I haven't
had a single night to myself.

07:55.313 --> 07:58.690
Sergeant Doakes makes sure of that.
He follows me everywhere now,

07:58.816 --> 08:02.694
a human bIoodhound,
incited by the scent of darkness.

08:03.738 --> 08:08.408
My best hope of losing him
is to act relentlessly normal, dull.

08:08.534 --> 08:10.285
So I bowI.

08:15.958 --> 08:18.668
What's really disturbing
is that l"m good at it.

08:19.629 --> 08:20.587
Balls, Dex.

08:20.713 --> 08:22.756
You pictured it, didn't you?

08:26.719 --> 08:29.888
Hey. striker. we need you
to lock down tonight, huh?

08:30.014 --> 08:32.682
We're playing the Alley Cats.

08:32.808 --> 08:35.519
l'm a little tense, Angel.

08:36.562 --> 08:39.022
But l'll try my best
not to let the team down.

08:39.148 --> 08:41.316
Try? Try?

08:41.442 --> 08:43.193
You got to think positive, bro,

08:43.319 --> 08:45.403
'cause what we think
creates the world around us.

08:45.530 --> 08:48.198
lt's all about energy
and interconnectedness.

08:48.324 --> 08:49.866
l mean, we got to think positive. . .

08:49.992 --> 08:53.036
Angel lost someone, too,
when his wife Ieft him.

08:53.162 --> 08:56.456
Now he's going toward the light,
searching for answers.

08:56.582 --> 08:58.959
He found one on an Oprah rerun.

08:59.085 --> 09:01.461
l wish it were that easy for me.

09:01.587 --> 09:04.798
And we just got to direct it
to manifest what we want.

09:04.924 --> 09:06.174
OK?

09:06.300 --> 09:08.510
All right.

09:22.608 --> 09:24.359
Dude, dude, just bowl a strike

09:24.485 --> 09:26.444
so we can go have some fun
at the strip clubs.

09:26.571 --> 09:28.488
l want to see a real 7-1 0 split.

09:28.614 --> 09:30.407
I wish I couId have fun.

09:30.533 --> 09:33.785
With Doakes tailing me,
my life's been all Jekyll and no Hyde -

09:33.911 --> 09:35.161
no moonlit play dates,

09:35.288 --> 09:37.998
no late-night social calls, not one.

09:39.041 --> 09:40.709
My brother would be so disappointed.

09:40.835 --> 09:44.129
Don't forget,
tell the universe what you need.

09:44.255 --> 09:45.422
l really need

09:45.548 --> 09:47.257
to kill somebody.

10:01.439 --> 10:03.189
Did you even take my advice?

10:03.316 --> 10:05.984
l'm telling you, the universe
can be very generous.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.165
lt certainly can.

10:23.794 --> 10:28.006
For weeks I've known who was next,
who belonged to me.

10:28.132 --> 10:31.051
l just needed Doakes to take a night off.

10:43.356 --> 10:44.522
What do you need?

10:46.317 --> 10:49.736
l need to curse someone.

10:49.862 --> 10:52.238
What kind of curse?

10:55.826 --> 10:57.160
Death curse.

11:01.082 --> 11:03.041
We don't do that kind of thing here.

11:03.167 --> 11:05.126
You can go down to Little Haiti,

11:05.252 --> 11:07.712
find all the hoodoo voodoo
you need there.

11:09.382 --> 11:13.259
You are Jimmy Sensio,
high priest. right?

11:18.474 --> 11:20.684
The man with God in his mouth?

11:22.520 --> 11:24.104
l'm not a tourist.

11:24.230 --> 11:27.565
l need a Petro curse,
and l heard you were the best.

11:29.485 --> 11:32.153
Thank you for your offering.

11:32.279 --> 11:33.738
Come.

11:53.592 --> 11:56.219
A blind man -
not very sporting, l know,

11:56.345 --> 12:01.599
but I'm not one to discriminate
based on race, gender, or disability.

12:06.313 --> 12:09.733
What. . .is. . .happening?

12:10.401 --> 12:13.820
The only pertinent question is
what happened to your victims?

12:13.946 --> 12:16.823
What are you doing?
What do you want?

12:16.949 --> 12:20.869
l can see this might be confusing, Jimmy,
but my favorite part's kind of ruined here.

12:20.995 --> 12:24.873
See, this is where l'd normally show you
the innocent people you've killed.

12:24.999 --> 12:28.209
l brought them along anyway,
as part of my death ritual.

12:28.335 --> 12:31.045
Since you're blind,
l'll just remind you.

12:32.173 --> 12:33.715
Emmanuel Alzua,

12:33.841 --> 12:35.467
Jean Philippe Peguero,

12:35.593 --> 12:37.469
Nono Baptiste.

12:37.595 --> 12:39.095
l didn't kill them.

12:39.221 --> 12:41.014
l cursed them.

12:41.140 --> 12:42.724
And in a remarkable coincidence,

12:42.850 --> 12:44.684
they each died of respiratory failure

12:44.810 --> 12:46.686
with fluid in their lungs.

12:46.812 --> 12:49.314
l guess murder is one way
to make your curses come true.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.565
lt's good for business.

12:52.985 --> 12:54.652
What. . .what was that?

12:54.779 --> 12:56.988
Just the next part of the ritual.

12:59.325 --> 13:02.160
How did you administer
the ricin poison to your victims?

13:08.167 --> 13:11.169
l am the one
with the power in his hands.

13:12.963 --> 13:14.464
That's not entirely accurate.

13:14.590 --> 13:16.800
Those who believe in me shall be free.

13:17.384 --> 13:18.968
Alabanza, Alaban. . .

13:19.094 --> 13:20.178
Knock it off.

13:20.846 --> 13:23.556
How'd you poison them?

13:23.682 --> 13:25.892
Not me.

13:26.018 --> 13:29.020
Madoli, my Petro spirit,

13:29.146 --> 13:31.481
told me put the powder

13:31.607 --> 13:34.859
ln the aguardiente bottles
that they buy from me.

13:35.903 --> 13:37.779
And l did it.

13:37.905 --> 13:39.239
Thank you, Jimmy.

13:39.365 --> 13:41.407
My ritual's almost complete.

13:41.534 --> 13:43.993
Madoli curses you! You. . .

13:45.162 --> 13:48.122
l'm afraid Madoli's a little
late to the party on that one.

13:52.294 --> 13:56.506
l appreciate you helping
me out tonight, Jimmy.

13:56.632 --> 13:59.217
l've been waiting a long time for this.

13:59.343 --> 14:01.553
l really needed it.

14:20.531 --> 14:22.574
What the fuck?

14:40.759 --> 14:42.552
Let that be a lesson to you.

14:43.262 --> 14:44.929
l've always enjoyed my work.

14:45.055 --> 14:49.225
lt brings order to the chaos,
fills me with civic pride.

14:49.351 --> 14:51.227
But what was that back there?

14:51.353 --> 14:52.812
Not voodoo.

14:52.938 --> 14:56.441
When I picked up the knife,
it's Iike I didn't know who I was.

14:56.567 --> 14:58.651
l come here to dump bodies,
not beer bottles.

14:58.777 --> 15:00.820
Now l'm just a litterbug.

15:21.884 --> 15:23.551
Deb!

15:29.558 --> 15:31.017
Jesus!

15:31.143 --> 15:34.062
What are you doing working out
in the middle of the night?

15:34.188 --> 15:35.188
l couldn't sleep.

15:35.314 --> 15:37.649
Tomorrow's your big day.

15:40.319 --> 15:42.528
Where the fuck were you?
l was worried about you.

15:42.655 --> 15:43.863
Bowling.

15:43.989 --> 15:45.782
Kind of late for bowling.

15:45.908 --> 15:47.784
Kind of not looking for your opinion.

15:49.495 --> 15:51.579
You said you cleaned the place today?

15:51.705 --> 15:53.665
l did. lt got messed up again.

15:53.791 --> 15:56.876
l don't suppose you were looking at
apartment ads on the treadmill?

15:57.002 --> 15:59.337
- Look, if you want me out of here, just...
- l don't.

15:59.463 --> 16:01.589
l just had a bad. . .

16:01.715 --> 16:03.800
. . .bowling night.

16:04.843 --> 16:06.552
l meant, when you're ready
to be on your own.

16:06.679 --> 16:09.138
l'll help you with the transition, that's all.

16:10.808 --> 16:12.767
Thanks, Dex.

16:12.893 --> 16:14.894
Thanks for putting up with me.

16:16.021 --> 16:17.563
You're all l got.

16:19.358 --> 16:21.859
That's not such a great bargain
for you. huh?

16:23.654 --> 16:25.196
l'm not complaining.

16:27.658 --> 16:28.992
Night.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.660
lt's your turn on the couch.

16:30.786 --> 16:32.787
Could you at least pick up your. . .

16:33.998 --> 16:36.916
Debra can't sleep
in an empty house any more.

16:37.042 --> 16:38.918
In fact, she can't sIeep much at aII.

16:39.044 --> 16:42.088
l guess that"s what happens
when your fiance tries to slice you up

16:42.214 --> 16:44.632
into small, bloodless pieces.

16:48.012 --> 16:49.887
Pathetic.

16:59.898 --> 17:02.567
- Did you see that?
- Nice shooting, Dex. We need to talk.

17:02.693 --> 17:05.236
Those boars don't stand a chance.
Hope one charges me.

17:05.362 --> 17:07.613
- No, you don't.
- Got massive stopping power. . . .

17:07.740 --> 17:09.615
Dexter, slow down.
l got bad news.

17:09.742 --> 17:12.660
They need me to take a shift at work.

17:12.786 --> 17:14.912
Right now?
What about the boar hunt?

17:15.039 --> 17:16.289
We'll plan another trip.

17:16.415 --> 17:17.832
l waited two weeks for this trip.

17:17.958 --> 17:19.959
- You can wait another one.
- No. l can't.

17:20.085 --> 17:22.503
lf you read the books,
you'd know psychopaths like me

17:22.629 --> 17:26.674
- have a low tolerance for frustration.
- Enough with the psychopath bullshit.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.551
You're in control of your urges.

17:28.677 --> 17:31.554
You don't understand, Dad.
l need this.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.431
lt's not just a sport to me.

17:33.557 --> 17:36.476
l'm sorry. son.
l have responsibilities at work.

17:36.602 --> 17:37.894
Now, come on.

17:38.520 --> 17:41.022
- l'll drop you off at home. Give me the gun.
- No!

17:54.828 --> 17:57.121
There's cheese in that doughnut.

17:57.247 --> 17:59.373
Oh, that's a Danish.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.959
Look, they forgot the frosting on this one.

18:02.086 --> 18:06.047
Well, some people like doughnuts plain,
no frosting.

18:07.841 --> 18:11.844
l can't even get doughnuts right.
What's going on here?

18:11.970 --> 18:14.680
Sorry, guys, l was in a hurry.
l just ordered a dozen.

18:14.807 --> 18:18.184
Pastry buffs like you two
deserve better than this.

18:18.310 --> 18:19.977
Thanks, Dexter.

18:21.063 --> 18:22.980
We're gonna go visit my dad in jail today.

18:23.107 --> 18:24.899
Want to come?

18:25.025 --> 18:26.526
Afraid l got to work, buddy.

18:26.652 --> 18:28.319
OK.

18:29.488 --> 18:30.947
Thanks for getting here so fast.

18:31.073 --> 18:32.365
What's the emergency?

18:32.491 --> 18:33.825
Hip Hop Harry is on.

18:47.005 --> 18:49.882
We're good for 1 5 minutes.

18:53.762 --> 18:55.888
l know we're supposed
to have dinner tonight.

18:56.014 --> 18:58.099
but l just had this urge.

19:00.727 --> 19:03.187
l'm all for satisfying urges.

19:03.313 --> 19:06.649
l just wish l knew
why l couldn't satisfy mine last night.

19:23.584 --> 19:24.542
ls everything OK?

19:24.668 --> 19:27.879
- Yeah, it will be. Just keep going.
- OK.

19:29.256 --> 19:31.966
Any minute now...

19:41.393 --> 19:44.812
Sorry.

19:44.938 --> 19:47.106
No. No, it's my fault.

19:47.232 --> 19:49.775
l shouldn't be springing this on you.

19:49.902 --> 19:51.944
No, it's. . .not that.

19:52.070 --> 19:54.280
l'm just feeling a. . .

19:54.406 --> 19:57.116
a little pressure at work.

20:02.581 --> 20:04.290
I'II be OK.

20:04.416 --> 20:05.625
I foIIowed the code.

20:05.751 --> 20:07.501
The stalk was good.

20:07.628 --> 20:10.755
l'm just a little rusty
since killing my brother.

20:12.132 --> 20:14.759
Or maybe l took pity on my victim.

20:15.594 --> 20:18.930
I mean, sure, he's a heinous kiIIer,
but he also bumps into walls.

20:24.978 --> 20:26.938
Hey, Sergeant.

20:27.064 --> 20:28.981
Thanks for supporting
the bowling team.

20:29.107 --> 20:30.024
Fuck you.

20:30.150 --> 20:33.069
Where's my blood report
on the Maynard victim?

20:36.448 --> 20:38.532
So, what's that, a titty site?

20:39.701 --> 20:40.826
Oops, caught me.

20:40.953 --> 20:44.205
Bullshit. What the hell
were you really doing in here?

20:44.998 --> 20:46.707
The tits are right there.

20:46.833 --> 20:48.626
Yeah, but in ten years,

20:48.752 --> 20:51.420
you've never rented a single porn title.

20:53.757 --> 20:56.133
Huh. How would you know?

20:58.512 --> 20:59.512
Call me an office crazy,

20:59.638 --> 21:01.847
but your humbling interest
in my personal life

21:01.974 --> 21:04.976
could be misinterpreted
as harassment in some circles.

21:05.894 --> 21:07.561
So report me.

21:08.230 --> 21:10.189
I couId think of easier soIutions.

21:12.067 --> 21:14.151
Nice tits.

21:21.118 --> 21:22.702
James, you got any
misdemeanor A forms?

21:22.828 --> 21:24.912
Try the filing cabinet.

21:28.125 --> 21:32.169
Can anybody tell me where the goddamn
misdemeanor A forms are kept?

21:33.005 --> 21:34.839
l've got some right here, Lieutenant.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.884
OK, all right, move along.
Nothing to see here.

21:39.011 --> 21:41.137
Just another fucking day at work.

21:47.519 --> 21:49.270
Welcome back. . .Morgan.

21:50.188 --> 21:51.355
Thanks.

21:54.860 --> 21:56.444
Maria.

22:03.994 --> 22:06.412
A tour-boat guide called in
a body at the breakwater.

22:06.538 --> 22:08.748
l want you to take Doakes
and a support team

22:08.874 --> 22:10.374
and take Morgan.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.585
l want to get her back out
in the field today.

22:14.212 --> 22:16.422
she's not ready.
She shouldn't even be here.

22:16.548 --> 22:18.090
What's it been?
Five weeks, six?

22:18.216 --> 22:21.427
l appreciate your concern
but according to her psych evaluation,

22:21.553 --> 22:24.263
she's ready to get back out into the field.

22:25.182 --> 22:28.267
You just got to look her in the eyes
to know she's not right.

22:28.393 --> 22:31.395
You put her out in the field.
she could melt down, freak out.

22:33.065 --> 22:34.940
She hugged me.

22:35.609 --> 22:38.819
All right, you partner with her today
so you can keep an eye on her.

22:38.945 --> 22:40.571
- That's. . .
- Not a request.

22:40.697 --> 22:42.073
Put Doakes with Batista.

22:47.079 --> 22:48.579
Fine.

22:49.289 --> 22:51.040
Maria. . .

22:51.708 --> 22:53.751
l know it's difficult
for you to take orders

22:53.877 --> 22:55.920
when you feel that
you should be giving them,

22:56.046 --> 22:58.339
and l really appreciate
your professionalism.

22:59.508 --> 23:01.008
Thanks. Thank you.

23:04.721 --> 23:05.805
You don't like roses?

23:05.931 --> 23:08.057
Allergies.

23:08.183 --> 23:10.393
And let me know what you
find out about that body.

23:13.522 --> 23:14.897
OK, guys, listen up.

23:22.114 --> 23:24.198
Heard your sister's back
on the job already.

23:24.324 --> 23:25.950
ls she in any kind of shape?

23:26.076 --> 23:27.910
Oh. you know Deb.
Nothing gets her down.

23:28.036 --> 23:29.620
No, l mean, did she pack on any pounds?

23:29.746 --> 23:31.831
'Cause, you know,
last time l saw her, she was tight.

23:35.293 --> 23:38.796
We got multiple chop wounds,
pretty much head to toe.

23:39.714 --> 23:42.341
All right, you call it -
heads or tails.

23:42.467 --> 23:44.844
- Heads.
- Hey, l didn't flip yet.

23:44.970 --> 23:46.345
You said call it.

23:46.471 --> 23:48.639
Damn. l always get the ass end.

23:48.765 --> 23:51.100
There you go, Sergeant.

23:51.226 --> 23:52.643
Never mind.

23:55.647 --> 23:58.190
l got sharp-force trauma here,

23:58.316 --> 24:00.025
heavy-impact, parallel wounds.

24:00.485 --> 24:01.569
Maybe an axe.

24:01.695 --> 24:04.572
No, the defense wounds
on the forearms are long and linear,

24:04.698 --> 24:06.782
and l can make out beveled margins.

24:06.908 --> 24:08.576
A machete did this.

24:08.702 --> 24:11.579
The machete is the weapon
of choice of the 29th Street Kings.

24:11.705 --> 24:14.206
The victim was in the gang,
judging from that tattoo.

24:14.332 --> 24:17.501
We think the body was carried
from a nearby location.

24:17.627 --> 24:20.838
l found a real good blood trail
coming down from the road.

24:20.964 --> 24:22.173
Damn it.

24:24.426 --> 24:26.218
Lens.

24:28.513 --> 24:31.390
Let's make sure we check
the dock slips for criminal records.

24:31.516 --> 24:35.186
lt's possible this victim was killed
by one of these boat owners out here.

24:35.312 --> 24:38.189
Or maybe it was just an easy access spot
to dump a corpse at night.

24:38.315 --> 24:39.482
There are no light poles.

24:39.608 --> 24:42.276
The freeway exit ramp's just a block away.

24:42.402 --> 24:44.028
He's got a point.

24:46.364 --> 24:48.240
Yo, Dex.

24:51.453 --> 24:54.038
You're supposed to preserve
the crime scene. asshole.

24:57.375 --> 24:59.793
What's the matter with you today?

25:00.629 --> 25:03.881
l'm just a little off my game.
l'll get it back.

25:05.258 --> 25:07.301
- What time did you find the body?
- Seven o'clock.

25:07.427 --> 25:10.095
l start prepping the banana boat
every morning at seven

25:10.222 --> 25:11.931
for our Miami Banana tour.

25:12.057 --> 25:13.432
- Banana tour?
- Yeah. yeah.

25:13.558 --> 25:16.101
lt's a calypso journey
through Miami's inner harbor,

25:16.228 --> 25:18.604
- and you should try it.
- l'll think about it.

25:18.730 --> 25:21.315
Hey, isn't that
the lce-Truck Killer's babe?

25:21.441 --> 25:23.609
She was in the paper.
She's fucking hot.

25:23.735 --> 25:25.486
Did you see anyone else this morning?

25:25.612 --> 25:26.904
No, not this morning.

25:29.366 --> 25:30.324
Are you sure?

25:30.450 --> 25:32.201
Yeah. l'd have given them a brochure.

25:32.327 --> 25:33.953
Yo, Mrs. lce-Truck Killer!

25:34.663 --> 25:36.372
OK. Hang on. Hang on.

25:36.498 --> 25:38.791
Just turn around.
Look scared for the camera.

25:39.876 --> 25:42.211
lf you think of anything else,
you have our numbers.

25:42.337 --> 25:44.588
And you have mine.
Can l pass these out now?

25:44.714 --> 25:47.049
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

25:48.134 --> 25:51.178
Come on. Just look over here.

25:51.304 --> 25:53.722
Look scared for the camera.

25:55.976 --> 25:57.268
Morgan. . .

25:59.104 --> 26:00.980
Thank you.

26:02.065 --> 26:04.775
What? Do you need help with something?

26:08.029 --> 26:09.947
Rafael!

26:10.073 --> 26:12.366
- Where is Rafael?
- shit. sergeant!

26:13.326 --> 26:16.495
Don't just stand there!
Grab her! What are you doing?

26:16.621 --> 26:19.331
- Somebody stop her! Miss!
- Rafael!

26:19.457 --> 26:22.334
- Miss, you cannot go down there.
- Hey! Hey!

26:22.460 --> 26:23.586
Batista, stop her!

26:23.712 --> 26:25.963
God damn it, Morgan, grab her!

26:52.532 --> 26:55.492
Can we please secure this
motherfucking crime scene?

27:03.335 --> 27:05.002
What did she say?

27:06.171 --> 27:08.213
That's her son.

27:08.340 --> 27:10.174
She says she knows who killed him -

27:10.300 --> 27:12.593
some guy named Little Chino.

27:14.179 --> 27:17.389
- lt felt like she was asking me something.
- She was.

27:17.515 --> 27:20.351
She wants you to find Little Chino
and kill him like a dog.

27:32.822 --> 27:34.490
That Iook.

27:35.533 --> 27:36.659
I know that Iook.

27:37.952 --> 27:40.412
Like her mother, she wants
someone to do something.

27:47.921 --> 27:51.298
The next stop on Matchy
the Matchbook's magical journey

27:51.424 --> 27:54.009
down the rainbow path is. . .

27:55.428 --> 27:57.763
. . .the dreaded chocolate swamp.

27:57.889 --> 27:59.264
Why is it dreaded?

27:59.391 --> 28:01.100
l love chocolate.

28:01.226 --> 28:04.103
Because. . .the chocolate swamp

28:04.229 --> 28:08.232
is the home of a goopy, gooey
nightmare named Gloppy,

28:08.358 --> 28:11.402
who turns children into Fudgesicles
and eats them!

28:12.529 --> 28:14.154
What does Matchy do?

28:16.199 --> 28:19.702
Well, luckily, Gloppy was sleeping,

28:19.828 --> 28:22.746
so Matchy goes straight
to Candy Castle.

28:22.872 --> 28:25.332
where he becomes King Candy,

28:25.458 --> 28:27.209
who can turn everyone into sweets

28:27.335 --> 28:30.045
with a wave of his royal gumball staff.

28:30.171 --> 28:31.588
Cool story, Dad.

28:31.715 --> 28:34.341
But next time,
can we play the actual game?

28:35.427 --> 28:37.261
First chance l get, l'll talk to the warden

28:37.387 --> 28:40.723
about finding some of
those missing game pieces, OK?

28:41.766 --> 28:44.601
OK. Got to go, kids.

28:47.439 --> 28:49.481
All right, say goodbye to your father.

28:49.607 --> 28:51.942
Jump! Jump!

28:53.570 --> 28:55.696
Hugs!

28:55.822 --> 28:58.490
What's wrong with your lip?

28:58.616 --> 29:01.660
Well. l was biting it
cause l was excited to see you.

29:01.786 --> 29:05.289
So come back real soon, OK?
OK, buddy. Bye.

29:07.792 --> 29:09.626
Rita, one minute?

29:11.004 --> 29:13.630
All right. Go wait by the door.

29:14.966 --> 29:17.801
l need your help. My lawyer
is gonna file my appeal tomorrow,

29:17.927 --> 29:19.970
but l don't stand a chance
without that shoe.

29:20.096 --> 29:23.515
There's no shoe. How many times
do l have to tell you that?

29:23.641 --> 29:25.976
OK. . . Anything, any evidence

29:26.102 --> 29:27.770
to support the fact that l was set up.

29:27.896 --> 29:29.313
You mean that Dexter set you up.

29:29.439 --> 29:31.523
Somebody set me up.

29:33.234 --> 29:36.195
Rita, l'm not doing real good
in here. OK?

29:36.321 --> 29:38.781
lt's a federal prison, hardcore.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.991
l don't belong here.

29:41.117 --> 29:42.159
Will you help me?

29:44.913 --> 29:47.998
l need to go.
l'll see you in a couple of weeks.

29:57.467 --> 30:01.053
Angel, will you please
take Eva's statement

30:01.179 --> 30:03.931
and set up her daughter, Marissa,
with some crayons, OK?

30:05.350 --> 30:06.809
Sure thing.

30:19.697 --> 30:21.573
That girl's gonna need
more than crayons

30:21.699 --> 30:24.451
to make her world right.

30:25.787 --> 30:28.705
Killing Little Chino
could restore my world, too,

30:28.832 --> 30:31.542
but only if he satisfies Harry's code.

30:34.462 --> 30:36.421
l see you've been benched.

30:36.548 --> 30:39.925
LaGuerta's just jealous the lce-Truck Killer
fucked me instead of her.

30:41.219 --> 30:42.761
Wow.

30:42.887 --> 30:43.929
You're chipper.

30:44.055 --> 30:45.722
Just happy to be back on the job.

30:48.518 --> 30:49.643
What do you want?

30:49.769 --> 30:52.187
Just working up my blood report
from the crime scene,

30:52.313 --> 30:55.274
wanted to know what you found
on the suspect, Little Chino.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.359
Cocksucker's guilty as they come.

30:57.485 --> 30:59.486
He's an enforcer
for the 29th Street Kings,

30:59.612 --> 31:01.697
East Side gang, intensely violent.

31:01.823 --> 31:05.117
He's been linked to nine murders
in the last five years.

31:05.243 --> 31:06.368
So far, so good.

31:07.078 --> 31:08.620
l just hope he's not blind.

31:08.746 --> 31:09.955
Has he ever been tried?

31:10.081 --> 31:13.458
Twice. but the witnesses
in each case were murdered,

31:13.585 --> 31:14.751
We think by Chino himself.

31:14.878 --> 31:17.462
Now people are just too afraid
to come forward.

31:17.589 --> 31:19.673
Come on, Chino, right this way.

31:36.774 --> 31:40.193
Fucking beef bus.

31:47.493 --> 31:49.369
Dad!

31:50.622 --> 31:52.873
l'm OK, Dex. l've told you. . .

31:52.999 --> 31:56.251
never put your finger on the trigger
unless you're shooting.

31:56.377 --> 31:58.754
- Are you OK?
- Jesus. That was close.

31:58.880 --> 32:01.506
My heart's beating out of my chest.

32:02.759 --> 32:03.926
Let me feel.

32:04.052 --> 32:07.220
- Feel what?
- Your heart.

32:11.100 --> 32:13.393
That's amazing.

32:16.731 --> 32:20.400
A challenge, a mountain to climb.

32:20.526 --> 32:22.069
I need this one.

32:22.195 --> 32:25.822
LittIe Chino came to mi front door.

32:25.949 --> 32:28.158
He asked for mi son, Rafael.

32:28.743 --> 32:32.871
Rafael did not want to go
with Little Chino,

32:32.997 --> 32:35.207
but he was afraid not to.

32:35.750 --> 32:40.212
- What was he going to do?
- My brother has a house in Georgia.

32:40.338 --> 32:42.464
Rafael was going to live with him.

32:43.091 --> 32:45.258
That's why they kill him.

32:45.385 --> 32:46.635
I know it.

32:47.637 --> 32:49.930
Nobody ever leaves the gang.

32:50.056 --> 32:51.515
Eva. Eva.

32:52.684 --> 32:54.226
Eva.

32:54.352 --> 32:56.603
Are you willing to testify

32:56.729 --> 32:59.648
that Little Chino picked up your son
on the night of his death?

33:01.859 --> 33:04.361
Come on. Don't back down now.

33:08.700 --> 33:11.785
l want him to pay.

33:12.370 --> 33:13.412
Got him.

33:14.706 --> 33:18.375
Well, that"s discouraging.
With a grieving mother as a witness,

33:18.501 --> 33:22.045
LittIe Chino wiII never reach
my cutting courtroom.

33:27.677 --> 33:30.470
Hey, Morgan, you want to see
something swell?

33:30.596 --> 33:32.389
Come a little closer.

33:32.515 --> 33:35.767
And the token has spoken.
Good to see you, too, Vince.

33:35.893 --> 33:38.311
l heard we captured Bigfoot.

33:38.438 --> 33:42.149
Behold the eighth wonder of the world.

33:42.275 --> 33:43.942
Am l speaking clearly?

33:51.242 --> 33:54.244
- Yeah.
- Then answer my fucking question, Chino.

33:54.370 --> 33:57.831
What time did you pick up Rafael last night?

33:57.957 --> 34:01.251
Last night?
l didn't see Rafael last night.

34:02.962 --> 34:05.922
OK, so why would Rafael's mother
make up that story. Chino?

34:07.341 --> 34:11.303
That puta's into the devil's candy, man -
fucking heroin. Shit.

34:12.472 --> 34:13.555
She was probably high.

34:13.681 --> 34:16.975
You're telling me
that Eva Arenas is a junkie?

34:17.101 --> 34:20.395
Man, if that's true, Pascal and LaGuerta
are gonna have a piss party.

34:23.399 --> 34:25.942
Eva Arenas,
two pops for drug possession.

34:26.069 --> 34:27.986
No fucking way the DA
puts a drug user on the stand.

34:28.112 --> 34:30.405
That cholo's gonna walk again.

34:31.365 --> 34:32.949
But not very far.

34:38.664 --> 34:42.000
We'II both be vindicated soon.

35:13.825 --> 35:16.201
OK, boys, today's our day.

35:16.327 --> 35:19.454
Let's find that galleon
and bring back the gold.

35:22.750 --> 35:24.918
Here's that aberration
in the sea floor.

35:25.044 --> 35:27.420
The crevice is at 65 feet.

35:27.547 --> 35:30.173
lt has to be where
the Santa Rosa went down.

35:43.855 --> 35:46.815
The crevice is 30 to 40 yards
straight ahead.

36:12.800 --> 36:16.970
The crevice should be
25 yards ahead, bearing 1-4-4.

37:00.139 --> 37:01.431
l need your help.

37:01.557 --> 37:03.516
l know you were looking
forward to going out

37:03.643 --> 37:05.227
but l think Deb could use you more.

37:05.353 --> 37:08.438
Now. Dexter. this isn't
about this morning, is it?

37:09.106 --> 37:11.483
No, no, l swear. This is for Deb.

37:11.609 --> 37:15.028
She had her first day at work today
and LaGuerta was kind of rough on her.

37:15.780 --> 37:17.155
Dexter, unlock the door.

37:17.281 --> 37:19.407
Hold on. Hold on!

37:19.533 --> 37:21.993
Dexter, come on!

37:22.119 --> 37:24.246
Open the fucking door!

37:24.372 --> 37:26.289
See, she's yelling at me now.

37:26.415 --> 37:27.540
Look, l'm no expert,

37:27.667 --> 37:30.335
but l think Deb could use
some girl time tonight.

37:30.461 --> 37:32.212
Well, l won't lie.

37:32.338 --> 37:33.588
l'm a little disappointed,

37:33.714 --> 37:35.674
but l know your heart's
in the right place.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.259
Absolutely.

37:38.052 --> 37:40.053
OK. Whatever you need, Dexter.

37:40.179 --> 37:42.514
Thank you. Rita.
l will make this up to you.

37:42.640 --> 37:45.558
l'm gonna have Deb pick you up
in a half-hour. OK? Bye.

37:49.272 --> 37:50.855
Sorry.

37:50.982 --> 37:54.025
l double-booked when l made plans
to go out with Rita tonight.

37:54.151 --> 37:57.195
l forgot that l had promised
to sub for another bowling team.

37:58.281 --> 37:59.864
Why do you look so happy about it?

37:59.991 --> 38:03.034
l like bowling. What can l say?
Look, will you take Rita out for me?

38:03.160 --> 38:04.619
She hired a baby-sitter and everything.

38:04.745 --> 38:06.121
No way. l need to work out.

38:06.247 --> 38:09.207
Actually, you need to stop working out.
lt's getting unhealthy.

38:09.333 --> 38:11.334
Why not go out
for some hard liquor instead?

38:12.545 --> 38:14.504
- Sorry, bro.
- Deb, please!

38:16.757 --> 38:19.509
When do l ever ask you for anything?

38:23.347 --> 38:25.515
You bunghole.
Why'd you have to put it that way?

38:25.641 --> 38:28.977
She's expecting you in a half an hour.
You're a life saver.

38:36.319 --> 38:38.862
Tonight's the night.

38:38.988 --> 38:40.447
Really.

38:42.199 --> 38:46.828
Harry would prefer l take more time
but my life is falling apart.

38:49.040 --> 38:52.000
Whatever stopped my knife before
won"t stop it again.

38:52.126 --> 38:53.793
Hey, there!

38:55.212 --> 38:57.422
Gonna work
on my release tonight -

38:57.548 --> 38:59.883
practice, practice, practice.

39:00.885 --> 39:04.012
Lane's open till midnight.
You want to join me?

39:12.146 --> 39:14.439
Fuck it.

39:49.433 --> 39:51.768
There is nothing else to talk about.

39:51.894 --> 39:53.937
You are a liar, and you lied!

39:54.063 --> 39:55.355
Would you stop

39:55.481 --> 39:57.190
- trying to act all hard like that?
- shit.

39:57.316 --> 40:00.318
You want me to act better,
then you treat me better.

40:00.444 --> 40:03.071
You got these things
all mixed up in your head.

40:03.197 --> 40:04.823
Listen to me. l love you, Boo.

40:04.949 --> 40:07.992
lt's all about you. There is nobody else!

40:08.119 --> 40:11.329
ls that why you bought me
three dozen fucking roses?

40:11.455 --> 40:13.456
Get out of my sight.

40:13.582 --> 40:15.667
l send you flowers, babe,

40:15.793 --> 40:17.710
- because l love you.
- Get out of my sight.

40:17.837 --> 40:20.713
l got nothing else to say to you
until you decide to man up.

40:21.632 --> 40:24.467
Please, go.

40:33.644 --> 40:34.894
Maria?

40:35.020 --> 40:36.688
Fuck.

40:44.989 --> 40:47.407
l'm sorry you had to hear that.

40:47.533 --> 40:49.075
That was my fiance.

40:50.369 --> 40:52.662
We are having some problems.

40:54.498 --> 40:55.957
Well, that happens.

41:05.551 --> 41:08.094
l called his house three nights in a row
and he says he's working.

41:08.220 --> 41:10.221
He didn't return my phone calls.

41:10.347 --> 41:12.515
And then he comes home,
and he says he's tired.

41:14.059 --> 41:17.520
Well. he's tired because
he's out there fucking some bitch.

41:18.355 --> 41:20.482
l can smell it on him.

41:22.902 --> 41:24.903
Don't worry about washing their hair.

41:25.029 --> 41:28.281
- And read to them before bed.
- OK, got it.

41:29.325 --> 41:30.283
Hello?

41:30.409 --> 41:33.244
You have a coIIect caII from PauI Bennett.
Will you accept the charges?

41:33.370 --> 41:35.663
Yes, l'll accept the charges.

41:37.750 --> 41:39.626
Excuse me.

41:39.752 --> 41:42.378
Rita, do you have a second?
l need to talk to you.

41:42.505 --> 41:44.005
What do you want?

41:44.131 --> 41:45.965
l'm not gonna make it in here.

41:46.091 --> 41:48.259
l don't have time
for your bullshit right now.

41:48.385 --> 41:49.886
It's not buIIshit.

41:50.012 --> 41:52.639
l'm not like these guys.
l don't belong here, Rita.

41:52.765 --> 41:54.015
Can you help me?

41:54.141 --> 41:56.142
Help you? What?

41:56.268 --> 42:00.063
Just. can you look
for the shoe one more time?

42:00.856 --> 42:03.733
l found the fucking shoe, OK?

42:04.401 --> 42:06.402
You. . .you what?

42:06.529 --> 42:08.947
Oh. that's great!
l'll call the lawyer in the morning!

42:09.073 --> 42:11.324
Look, what does it matter?
lt's just a shoe.

42:11.450 --> 42:12.700
lt doesn't mean anything.

42:12.826 --> 42:15.537
You were probably high on smack
when you lost it at my house.

42:15.663 --> 42:18.248
Whatever.
l'll let the courts fucking decide that.

42:18.374 --> 42:20.833
- This is good news.
- No! No. Paul. no.

42:20.960 --> 42:23.545
lf you send a lawyer to my house,
the shoe won't be here.

42:23.671 --> 42:25.672
l'm not gonna let you
drag Dexter into this.

42:25.798 --> 42:28.049
l'm in a healthy relationship, finally,

42:28.175 --> 42:31.177
and l'm not gonna throw it away
to bail out my abusive ex-husband.

42:31.303 --> 42:32.554
lt doesn't work that way.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.305
l got to go.

42:34.431 --> 42:37.725
No. you don't. No. don't...
Rita, don't hang up that fucking phone.

42:37.851 --> 42:40.186
Stop blaming other people
for your problems.

42:40.312 --> 42:43.439
- You're in prison now, Paul. Deal with it.
- Rita!

42:46.110 --> 42:48.486
No! No! No! No!

42:55.703 --> 42:58.788
Some gangs earn
teardrops of blood by killing.

42:59.540 --> 43:01.499
l understand.
We all need our keepsakes.

43:01.625 --> 43:05.003
One man"s tattoos
are another man's bIood sIides.

43:05.129 --> 43:07.088
AII I had to do was caII
the gang task force,

43:07.214 --> 43:09.757
ask where the 29th Street Kings
get their tattoos,

43:09.883 --> 43:12.176
and wait for my prey to show up.

43:19.977 --> 43:21.436
What the fuck?

43:22.938 --> 43:25.440
What the fuck? Get the fuck off me!

43:25.566 --> 43:28.735
Fuck! Get the fuck off!

43:28.861 --> 43:30.987
Fuck that shit!

43:45.544 --> 43:47.545
The scene of the faiIed crime -

43:47.671 --> 43:49.505
no better place to try again.

43:49.632 --> 43:52.717
l have it on good authority
the owner fled town.

43:52.843 --> 43:56.346
Plus, it's a much quieter working
environment now without the chickens.

44:14.031 --> 44:15.573
So. . .

44:16.659 --> 44:18.951
You and Dexter come here a lot?

44:19.078 --> 44:21.371
We love the hot wings.

44:24.583 --> 44:27.794
Look. l'm sorry
if l'm such bad company tonight.

44:27.920 --> 44:30.088
Paul called right before we left.

44:30.214 --> 44:31.923
Yeah? What did he want?

44:32.049 --> 44:33.466
Well, who knows?

44:33.592 --> 44:35.927
Make me feel bad he's in prison, l suppose.

44:36.053 --> 44:37.428
Hey, l'm the one that answered

44:37.554 --> 44:40.390
that domestic-dispute call
way back when, remember?

44:40.516 --> 44:42.600
That prick deserves to be in prison.

44:42.726 --> 44:44.310
l know. l know.

44:44.436 --> 44:46.437
l know. l just. . .

44:46.563 --> 44:48.523
l can't believe l still let him get to me

44:48.649 --> 44:51.401
after everything he's put me through.

44:54.363 --> 44:57.115
Oh, God, l'm such an idiot.

44:57.241 --> 45:00.618
What you went through
is so much worse than my problems.

45:00.744 --> 45:02.412
What?

45:02.538 --> 45:04.247
My psycho killer fiance?

45:04.373 --> 45:06.541
Please. l've had worse.

45:06.667 --> 45:08.793
At least he paid for my meals.

45:10.462 --> 45:12.839
l can't believe you moved on like that.

45:12.965 --> 45:15.466
l wish l could be more like you.

45:15.592 --> 45:18.720
Paul was so horrible to me. . .

45:19.638 --> 45:21.723
Really horrible.

45:21.849 --> 45:24.809
Sometimes. . . Don't tell Dexter,

45:24.935 --> 45:28.020
but. . .sometimes. . .

45:28.147 --> 45:31.899
l find myself missing
the good parts of him.

45:33.610 --> 45:35.695
Oh, God.

45:38.282 --> 45:40.241
Not him.

45:41.285 --> 45:43.619
Not him, it's not him that you miss.

45:45.706 --> 45:48.666
'Cause what he had to offer wasn't real.

45:51.754 --> 45:54.797
But the way he made you feel
about yourself. . .

45:57.885 --> 46:00.178
that was real.

46:01.764 --> 46:03.890
Hey, are you OK?

46:04.016 --> 46:05.099
Need a refill?

46:10.773 --> 46:12.857
Can l get another draught, please?

46:13.692 --> 46:15.234
Hey, excuse me.

46:15.360 --> 46:17.361
Don't l know you from somewhere?

46:19.406 --> 46:21.908
Haven't l seen you on television?

46:23.202 --> 46:25.328
Oh. . .yeah.

46:26.497 --> 46:28.664
Hey, excuse me, are you that girl. . .

46:28.791 --> 46:30.583
What the fuck are you doing?

46:30.709 --> 46:34.545
- Debra, what happened?
- He grabbed me! You saw it, right?

46:34.671 --> 46:36.839
- He grabbed me.
- l think you broke my fucking nose.

46:36.965 --> 46:39.300
- You fucking grabbed me!
- All l did was touch you.

46:39.426 --> 46:41.844
You saw it. He grabbed me.

46:51.063 --> 46:52.355
He wasn't easy to get here,

46:52.481 --> 46:55.650
but here he is, and here I am -

46:55.776 --> 46:58.236
ready, willing...

47:00.531 --> 47:01.989
AbIe?

47:06.328 --> 47:10.248
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

47:10.374 --> 47:11.415
Shit.

47:14.795 --> 47:16.754
Not enough tape. Perfect.

47:39.570 --> 47:42.238
39 days, 22 hours, and 1 8 minutes

47:42.364 --> 47:44.824
since l killed my brother.

47:44.950 --> 47:47.034
I am cursed.

48:17.441 --> 48:20.526
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

48:20.652 --> 48:21.944
- What were you doing?
- l don't know.

48:22.070 --> 48:23.613
- What were you thinking?
- l don't know.

48:23.739 --> 48:26.532
Whatever you're going through,
killing yourself isn't the answer.

48:26.658 --> 48:28.910
You don't get points for dying.

48:29.036 --> 48:30.494
Dying?

48:30.621 --> 48:32.830
Dad, l. . . l don't want to die.

48:32.956 --> 48:36.500
l'm just trying to figure out
some way to feel alive.

48:40.672 --> 48:44.508
l don't normally seek human
contact in times of failure,

48:44.635 --> 48:47.762
but then l don't normally
experience faiIure.

48:49.890 --> 48:54.226
Right now all l can think about
is the smell of Rita's kitchen,

48:54.353 --> 48:58.356
the breathy cadence
of her sleeping children,

48:58.482 --> 49:00.566
the warmth of her flesh.

49:23.548 --> 49:25.466
Rita?

49:25.592 --> 49:27.259
What's wrong?

49:28.971 --> 49:30.930
The prison called.

49:31.056 --> 49:32.932
Paul's dead.

49:43.068 --> 49:46.570
He died in an inmate altercation.

49:47.906 --> 49:49.490
lt was a fight.

49:49.616 --> 49:52.827
He was angry, and he got into a fight.

49:54.246 --> 49:57.957
Now l have to figure out how
to tell my children their father's dead.

50:02.796 --> 50:04.922
And l could have helped him.

50:07.718 --> 50:09.176
How?

50:12.431 --> 50:15.725
Rita, how could you have helped him?
He was in prison.

50:17.728 --> 50:21.480
That's right, Dexter. lt happened in prison.

50:21.606 --> 50:23.941
Paul was in prison.

50:26.945 --> 50:28.696
That was his own fault.

50:33.618 --> 50:34.994
Was it?

51:11.323 --> 51:13.324
You all right? Rita said you got in a brawl.

51:13.450 --> 51:14.992
You've got to see this.

51:16.161 --> 51:17.870
Mount PIeasant and 81 ...

51:17.996 --> 51:21.123
They've been playing it
on the news all night.

51:24.336 --> 51:27.379
Two treasure hunters made
a ghastly discovery today

51:27.506 --> 51:30.049
when they stumbled on what appears
to be an underwater graveyard

51:30.175 --> 51:33.052
in a crevice off the coast of Miami.

51:33.178 --> 51:34.720
There's bodies in those bags.

51:34.846 --> 51:39.225
The butchered bodies were submerged
inside these heavy-duty garbage bags.

51:39.351 --> 51:42.394
Authorities have Iocated
at least 30 bags so far,

51:42.521 --> 51:45.731
but around-the-clock salvage efforts
are still under way.

51:45.857 --> 51:48.192
Did you hear that? 30 bags.

51:48.318 --> 51:50.236
Do you know what that means?

51:50.362 --> 51:52.238
There might be
a new mass murderer out there,

51:52.364 --> 51:55.032
way worse than the lce-Truck Killer.

51:55.158 --> 51:57.660
Maybe l can finally get some peace.

51:58.787 --> 52:00.454
lsn't that great?

52:06.378 --> 52:08.045
lt's amazing.
