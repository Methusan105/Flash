00:02.048 --> 00:03.382
Previously on Dexter...

00:03.508 --> 00:04.591
My mother. . .

00:04.718 --> 00:06.760
she was murdered when l was a boy.

00:06.886 --> 00:08.262
l was there. l saw it.

00:08.388 --> 00:10.389
There were three men arrested
for those murders.

00:10.515 --> 00:13.308
One's deceased.
one's doing life without possibility,

00:13.435 --> 00:16.520
that's the only one that's still
an open case - Santos Jimenez.

00:16.646 --> 00:18.480
1 972!

00:18.606 --> 00:20.899
Did you have to saw her
into little pieces?

00:21.026 --> 00:25.529
Did you have to leave two little boys
soaking in a pool of their mother's blood?

00:26.573 --> 00:32.661
l don't care what you did. lt's OK.

00:32.787 --> 00:33.829
Who the fuck are you?

00:33.955 --> 00:35.998
Oh, pardon my tits.

00:36.124 --> 00:38.584
How could you do this to Rita,
not to mention her kids?

00:38.710 --> 00:41.295
Hey, Rita broke up with me, OK?

00:41.921 --> 00:45.591
'Cause when you're around, l feel like
l can deal with anything, you know?

00:47.469 --> 00:49.428
Morgan. . .

00:58.104 --> 01:00.731
Your past is a bigger mystery
than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.

01:00.857 --> 01:03.317
lt's time to make Doakes go away.

01:04.652 --> 01:06.779
Fuck.

01:10.784 --> 01:13.660
Sergeant Doakes
is on administrative leave

01:13.787 --> 01:16.830
pending an internal affairs investigation.

01:16.956 --> 01:19.124
The killer's making us chase our tails.

01:19.250 --> 01:22.461
- You know what that means?
- That he might be one of us?

01:24.881 --> 01:28.550
l was working on my piece.
and it just caught fire. l was so scared.

01:28.676 --> 01:30.844
Promise me that you won't leave me,

01:30.970 --> 01:32.513
that you won't go anywhere.

01:32.639 --> 01:34.264
l'm not going anywhere.

03:34.052 --> 03:36.595
l can't believe he said it.
Even for Masuka. . .

03:36.721 --> 03:40.140
And Batista didn't do anything.
Talk about lame, he fucking sat there.

03:40.266 --> 03:41.642
You know how much l wanted to. . .

03:41.768 --> 03:44.269
ls that the sports section?

03:45.730 --> 03:47.940
l used to enjoy quiet mornings,

03:48.066 --> 03:49.816
but ever since the fire at Lila"s loft,

03:49.943 --> 03:52.319
she's been crashing here a bit too often.

03:52.445 --> 03:54.488
- ls that my shirt?
- l thought it was Dexter's.

03:54.614 --> 03:55.989
lt's not.

03:57.450 --> 03:59.826
No, it's OK. Just. . .keep it.

03:59.953 --> 04:02.746
And so now I share the kitchen
with a cobra and a mongoose.

04:02.872 --> 04:04.831
Did somebody drink all the coffee again?

04:04.958 --> 04:06.833
No. Somebody didn't drink all the coffee.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.627
l had a cup, and Dexter had a cup,

04:08.753 --> 04:12.172
and it just kind of went like that
until the pot was empty.

04:12.298 --> 04:13.674
- Deb, please.
- What?

04:13.800 --> 04:16.218
Someone didn't drink all the coffee.
stupid question.

04:16.344 --> 04:20.097
- Why are you sticking up for her?
- l'm just trying to keep the peace.

04:20.848 --> 04:22.849
Maybe we should stay
at your place tonight.

04:22.976 --> 04:24.643
Has the fire damage been repaired yet?

04:24.769 --> 04:27.145
The insurance company's
still dicking me around.

04:27.272 --> 04:29.940
- Won't give me a check.
- Don't worry. l'll move out soon.

04:30.066 --> 04:32.484
Stop leeching off your brother?
Whatever for?

04:32.610 --> 04:34.736
Again, Dex, thanks for sticking up for me.

04:34.862 --> 04:35.821
l am Switzerland.

04:35.947 --> 04:37.614
Yeah, and l'm out of here.

04:45.623 --> 04:47.291
What's this?

04:48.835 --> 04:51.712
lt's the dragon zombie.

04:51.838 --> 04:53.964
Cody likes to hide things in my bag.

04:54.090 --> 04:56.049
He's trying to control you.

04:56.175 --> 04:57.551
By hiding toys in your bag,

04:57.677 --> 05:01.054
you have no choice
but to return them to him.

05:01.180 --> 05:03.598
He's seven, he seldom
has thoughts more complicated

05:03.725 --> 05:06.059
than the desire for candy.

05:06.185 --> 05:08.145
l'll see you at your loft tonight.

05:13.067 --> 05:15.861
Oh, honey! Honey, no.

05:15.987 --> 05:18.488
- No.
- You said we could make breakfast.

05:19.532 --> 05:22.034
- l meant cereal. baby.
- We don't want cereal.

05:26.748 --> 05:29.249
l guess l should give Rita back her key.

05:35.715 --> 05:38.425
Cody, no. No, let Mommy get the d. . .

05:38.551 --> 05:40.802
- lt's Dexter!
- He brought doughnuts!

05:40.928 --> 05:43.055
l did. l also brought. . .

05:43.181 --> 05:44.473
a dragon zombie!

05:44.599 --> 05:46.600
l knew you'd find it!

05:47.727 --> 05:50.270
Hope it's OK l'm here.

05:50.396 --> 05:53.440
Could you watch them
while l finish getting ready?

05:53.566 --> 05:55.609
Astor still has homework.

06:03.701 --> 06:05.744
Thank you, Dexter.

06:07.455 --> 06:09.581
Meet me at the car.

06:12.043 --> 06:13.710
Good thing l dropped by.

06:14.629 --> 06:16.755
Don't ever do it again.

06:18.007 --> 06:18.965
l'm sorry?

06:19.092 --> 06:21.510
lt's too hard on the kids,
and it's too hard on me.

06:21.636 --> 06:23.720
lt's Paul all over again.

06:23.846 --> 06:26.848
Please, Dexter, just stay away.

06:36.943 --> 06:40.320
You'll notice we have some new faces here.
Please make them feel welcome.

06:40.446 --> 06:43.198
Our immediate task is to
re-examine every criminal case

06:43.324 --> 06:44.950
involving our 1 8 victims.

06:45.076 --> 06:46.493
Where would you like us to start?

06:46.619 --> 06:48.328
By answering every question

06:48.454 --> 06:50.497
as honestly and with
as much detail as you can.

06:50.623 --> 06:53.667
Excuse me, sir. Answering questions?

06:53.793 --> 06:55.043
That is correct.

06:55.169 --> 06:57.963
l can hardly expect you
to investigate your own cases.

06:58.089 --> 07:02.467
What are you saying?
Are we under investigation?

07:02.593 --> 07:06.346
We are now assuming that our killer
is connected to law enforcement.

07:06.472 --> 07:09.057
Whether he be a file clerk,
a dispatch officer,

07:09.183 --> 07:11.226
- park ranger...
- Or a police officer.

07:11.352 --> 07:13.228
Or a police officer.

07:13.354 --> 07:15.689
ls that why you brought in all these suits?

07:15.815 --> 07:17.232
Special agents.

07:17.358 --> 07:21.111
Sir, you risk alienating every cop
on the task force if you do this.

07:21.237 --> 07:23.321
We go where the chase leads us. . .

07:24.407 --> 07:26.908
even if it gets messy.

07:32.707 --> 07:34.040
lt's insulting.

07:34.167 --> 07:37.043
We're just as capable as they are
of looking into our own cases.

07:37.170 --> 07:39.754
Who wears a wool suit in
the middle of summer in Miami?

07:39.881 --> 07:42.549
Nazis. that's who.
lt's all about intimidation.

07:42.675 --> 07:46.761
And the idea that one of us could be
the killer, it's complete bullshit.

07:46.888 --> 07:48.513
What do you mean? Us who?

07:48.639 --> 07:51.391
Lundy has his Feds investigating
all of our cases

07:51.517 --> 07:53.768
that are tied to the Bay Harbor victims.

07:53.895 --> 07:55.020
That's good here.

07:57.190 --> 07:58.732
Look, we got to stand tough here.

07:58.858 --> 07:59.900
We got to make it clear

08:00.026 --> 08:03.195
that we're not gonna be their little
"Yes. sir. no. sir" lapdogs.

08:06.073 --> 08:09.618
Gentlemen. Morgan, l'd like to go over
some of your cases tomorrow.

08:09.744 --> 08:11.203
Got them all listed right there.

08:11.329 --> 08:15.790
lt would be helpful if you could gather up
any notes you may have taken.

08:15.917 --> 08:17.584
Happy to help.

08:21.339 --> 08:22.589
Way to stand tough, Dexter.

08:22.715 --> 08:23.632
Sorry.

08:23.758 --> 08:26.593
That's exactly how Hitler walked.

08:31.557 --> 08:32.807
lt seems my manifesto

08:32.934 --> 08:36.102
unintentionally helped Lundy
narrow his focus.

08:36.229 --> 08:38.104
That's what l get for trying to emulate Lila

08:38.231 --> 08:40.023
and take the offensive.

08:40.149 --> 08:42.192
l've always worked best in the shadows,

08:42.318 --> 08:44.528
and that's where l have to stay.

08:45.071 --> 08:47.906
Lundy's really pissing people off.

08:48.032 --> 08:51.034
He's got his whole crew
looking through every case

08:51.160 --> 08:52.953
involving any of the Bay Harbor victims.

08:53.079 --> 08:54.704
Hm! He sounds desperate.

08:54.830 --> 08:56.873
You know you're gonna be called in.

08:56.999 --> 08:59.709
l'll be curious to see if l show up.

08:59.835 --> 09:03.421
OK, James, you need to be
a little careful here.

09:03.548 --> 09:05.799
lf you want to keep your job,
you got to cooperate.

09:05.925 --> 09:08.802
Being on suspension
does not exclude you from this.

09:08.928 --> 09:10.637
And who was it
that suspended me again?

09:10.763 --> 09:11.972
Oh, shit. That was you.

09:12.098 --> 09:14.808
Please don't act like
you didn't deserve it.

09:16.018 --> 09:17.978
Your case is coming up
for review in a week.

09:18.104 --> 09:20.605
- lf you want to keep your job. . .
- You keep saying that.

09:20.731 --> 09:22.315
What makes you think l want to?

09:22.441 --> 09:23.984
Whoa.

09:24.110 --> 09:25.652
Are you just talking here,

09:25.778 --> 09:28.446
or is this something
that you've seriously considered?

09:29.115 --> 09:32.993
Well, you and l both know that
l've gone as high as l can over there.

09:33.119 --> 09:34.911
Maybe it's time to move on.

09:35.997 --> 09:37.664
Well, what would you do?

09:38.749 --> 09:40.208
l don't know.

09:40.334 --> 09:43.378
My father was a butcher.
maybe l'll open up my own butcher shop.

09:43.504 --> 09:47.257
Yeah, l can just see you putting
on an apron every morning.

09:49.343 --> 09:51.011
Look, l have a friend.

09:51.137 --> 09:54.222
He's the head of personnel
at Stillwater Security.

09:54.348 --> 09:55.515
Government contractors?

09:55.641 --> 09:57.726
They're always looking
for people like you.

09:57.852 --> 09:59.436
lt's a dangerous world out there.

09:59.562 --> 10:01.479
They pay a lot of money to make it safe.

10:01.606 --> 10:03.523
Yeah, you got that right.

10:03.649 --> 10:07.319
All right. Set it up. l'll meet with your guy.

10:08.487 --> 10:10.071
Officer Morgan.

10:10.197 --> 10:11.740
- Debra.
- Yes?

10:11.866 --> 10:15.327
l picked the Rodrigo case
for you to look into.

10:15.453 --> 10:16.995
Small-time dope dealer.

10:17.121 --> 10:19.956
Arrested for murder.
ended up walking free,

10:20.082 --> 10:24.669
then disappeared until his body was found
in a garbage bag in the ocean.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.882
Not exciting enough for you?

10:29.008 --> 10:31.217
Well, it's just. . . l'm Homicide.

10:31.344 --> 10:33.219
l mean, l thought you didn't want us

10:33.346 --> 10:35.096
checking into our own cases.

10:35.222 --> 10:36.348
You're new to Homicide.

10:36.474 --> 10:38.642
At the time of this case,
you were still in Vice.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.560
No conflict there.

10:40.686 --> 10:43.897
Well. l'm flattered
you want me in on this, but. . .

10:44.023 --> 10:46.566
Batista and Doakes were lead here.

10:46.692 --> 10:49.736
l feel kind of weird about
investigating my own colleagues.

10:49.862 --> 10:51.571
Weird. Gosh.

10:51.697 --> 10:53.657
l'd hate for you to feel weird.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.117
You know what l mean.

11:00.331 --> 11:03.041
Would you have dinner with me
tomorrow night?

11:04.210 --> 11:06.878
Or would that make you feel weird?

11:10.132 --> 11:12.967
l'd love to have dinner with you.

11:13.094 --> 11:14.761
Good.

11:14.887 --> 11:17.013
l'll take you to the best restaurant in Miami.

11:17.139 --> 11:19.641
Wow. Great.

11:33.864 --> 11:36.908
l like the smell. Don't you?

11:37.993 --> 11:39.994
Like something exciting
happened here.

11:40.121 --> 11:42.706
lt's like when a piece of bread
gets stuck in the toaster.

11:42.832 --> 11:46.751
You like to pretend
there's no poetry in you.

11:47.753 --> 11:49.963
What's the problem
with the insurance company?

11:50.089 --> 11:51.756
Why aren't they paying?

11:52.842 --> 11:53.800
lt's ridiculous.

11:53.926 --> 11:57.679
They...think the fire
is of suspicious origin

11:57.805 --> 12:00.807
and they need to finish
their investigation.

12:00.933 --> 12:02.475
What do they mean, suspicious?

12:02.601 --> 12:05.061
Are they saying you started
the fire on purpose?

12:05.187 --> 12:07.021
Who knows what they're saying?

12:07.148 --> 12:09.107
You know insurance companies,

12:09.233 --> 12:11.526
anything to keep from paying out.

12:17.074 --> 12:21.453
Yeah, especially when a fire
has multiple points of origin.

12:25.124 --> 12:26.958
So, you never told me.

12:28.377 --> 12:31.296
How did it go at Rita's this morning?

12:31.422 --> 12:33.798
You know,
l just returned Cody's toy,

12:33.924 --> 12:35.592
and. . .that was it.

12:35.718 --> 12:38.219
No quickie on the kitchen table?

12:38.345 --> 12:40.513
Rita doesn't have a kitchen table.

12:40.639 --> 12:43.600
Oh. clever way of
not answering the question.

12:43.726 --> 12:45.393
lt was. . .

12:46.353 --> 12:48.563
awkward, actually.

12:48.689 --> 12:50.648
Always is.

12:51.692 --> 12:54.110
You can't go back. You know that.

12:55.196 --> 12:56.613
l'm not trying to go anywhere.

12:56.739 --> 12:59.699
Well, the bed's all ready.

13:00.284 --> 13:02.535
l can't.

13:02.661 --> 13:04.704
And why would that be?

13:04.830 --> 13:06.539
l have too much work to do.

13:08.709 --> 13:11.044
l have all these case files
to go over for tomorrow.

13:11.170 --> 13:13.046
You didn't bring any work with you?

13:13.172 --> 13:17.759
Home. l need to. . .work at home.

13:19.345 --> 13:20.303
OK.

13:20.429 --> 13:22.347
Bye, then.

13:22.473 --> 13:24.265
So, l'll see you tomorrow?

13:26.477 --> 13:27.519
Whatever.

13:45.246 --> 13:48.206
ls it possible she started
that fire on purpose?

13:48.332 --> 13:50.041
l can't imagine why.

13:50.167 --> 13:53.711
What I do know is that
l can't take any risks right now.

14:08.894 --> 14:09.853
Hi, you wanted to. . .

14:09.979 --> 14:11.563
Morgan, come in.

14:12.731 --> 14:14.983
Can l offer you some tea?

14:15.109 --> 14:17.402
No, thank you. l'm. . .

14:17.528 --> 14:18.987
And he pours it anyway.

14:19.572 --> 14:21.322
He's trying to throw me off balance,

14:21.448 --> 14:24.951
show that I don't have
the power to say no to him.

14:25.077 --> 14:27.287
How about some sesame crackers
to go with that?

14:27.413 --> 14:28.872
So l'll say yes to everything.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.039
l'd love some.

14:32.167 --> 14:36.087
Oh. Sorry. Guess l ate them all.

14:36.630 --> 14:37.922
AsshoIe.

14:40.926 --> 14:44.387
So, you worked first-hand on,

14:44.513 --> 14:46.055
what, four of the cases

14:46.181 --> 14:48.516
related to the Bay Harbor investigation?

14:48.642 --> 14:50.727
l believe so.

14:50.853 --> 14:53.938
Your reports were
a real pleasure to read.

14:55.065 --> 14:56.649
Concise, meticulous.

14:56.775 --> 14:58.151
l appreciate that.

14:59.278 --> 15:00.486
Good. Thank you.

15:00.613 --> 15:02.947
Does your sister prefer meat or fish?

15:03.991 --> 15:05.491
Debra?

15:05.618 --> 15:07.118
You have more than one?

15:08.787 --> 15:11.289
Sister? No. Just Deb.

15:12.124 --> 15:14.834
Or is she more of a salad kind of person?

15:16.629 --> 15:18.129
She's definitely a carnivore.

15:18.255 --> 15:22.467
Good.

15:22.593 --> 15:24.594
So. . .

15:24.720 --> 15:26.304
the Rodrigo case.

15:26.430 --> 15:28.932
- Let's talk about that one.
- OK.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.643
Kind of blew it, didn't you?

15:33.228 --> 15:34.979
- l'm sorry?
- Anthony Rodrigo,

15:35.105 --> 15:38.775
crack dealer with an apparent habit
of killing people who got in his way.

15:38.901 --> 15:41.986
l believe this was. . . .yes. . .

15:42.112 --> 15:44.489
Doakes and Batista's case.

15:44.615 --> 15:46.824
They finally tied Rodrigo
to one of his victims,

15:46.951 --> 15:48.910
built a solid manslaughter case,

15:49.036 --> 15:51.704
would have got him off
the street for a few years.

15:51.830 --> 15:55.959
But the case largely rested
on the blood work that you did.

15:58.128 --> 16:02.674
Blood work that in the course of the trial
was proven to be, well. . .

16:02.800 --> 16:03.841
wrong.

16:05.427 --> 16:10.181
So, you, one of the most cautious and precise
forensic specialists

16:10.307 --> 16:11.724
l've had the pleasure to work with,

16:11.850 --> 16:13.518
you performed blood work

16:13.644 --> 16:16.270
that directly led to Rodrigo walking free.

16:17.356 --> 16:21.734
l asked myself,
"How the hell did that happen?"

16:21.860 --> 16:24.570
And did you answer,
"'Dexter blew the case on purpose

16:24.697 --> 16:27.073
"'so that he could get
Rodrigo off the streets for good

16:27.199 --> 16:31.244
"'with a cordless reciprocating saw"'?

16:31.370 --> 16:33.705
l'm sorry. You've caught me off-guard here.

16:34.498 --> 16:36.624
Sloppy blood work.

16:39.211 --> 16:41.713
Look, this wasn't my idea.

16:43.924 --> 16:45.800
Could have said no.

16:45.926 --> 16:48.136
Come on, Angel, we have a job to do.

16:48.262 --> 16:51.931
since when is it my job to prove to
a fellow officer that l'm not a serial killer?

16:52.057 --> 16:54.434
- That's not what this is about.
- What is this about?

16:54.560 --> 16:57.270
lt's about finding someone
who had motive and opportunity

16:57.396 --> 16:59.439
to kill all 1 8 of our victims.

16:59.565 --> 17:01.607
No way it's anybody in our department.

17:01.734 --> 17:03.943
Then help me prove it.

17:04.069 --> 17:06.237
Go through the Rodrigo case with me.

17:06.363 --> 17:07.488
Look, it is not just you.

17:07.614 --> 17:11.784
LaGuerta's cooperating on her old cases.
Even Matthews is coming in.

17:22.254 --> 17:24.130
The Rodrigo file.

17:27.593 --> 17:29.886
You just happen to have it with you.

17:31.221 --> 17:33.264
l'm a reasonable man.

17:37.061 --> 17:38.519
You know how it is.

17:38.645 --> 17:41.814
The defense attorneys bring in
their so-called blood experts

17:41.940 --> 17:43.441
to counter everything l say.

17:43.567 --> 17:45.443
l'm familiar with the process.

17:45.569 --> 17:49.572
And l understand how this may look
like sloppy blood work to the layman,

17:49.698 --> 17:52.325
that's what Rodrigo's defense
convinced the jury of.

17:52.451 --> 17:54.410
But as you can see,

17:54.536 --> 17:57.914
the low-velocity blood drops
clearly point in the direction

17:58.040 --> 18:01.042
opposite to that in which
we know Rodrigo to have fled,

18:01.168 --> 18:02.668
which makes it impossible. . .

18:02.795 --> 18:04.420
Except those low-velocity drops

18:04.546 --> 18:07.215
were revealed to actually be
90-degree passive drops

18:07.341 --> 18:10.468
that were given tails
due to the angle of the floor.

18:14.139 --> 18:17.141
Perhaps. but if you then
examine the blood trail. . .

18:17.267 --> 18:20.728
Which we know isn't a blood trail,
but projected blood.

18:20.854 --> 18:23.731
You're not winning me over here, Morgan.

18:37.162 --> 18:39.038
The truth?

18:39.164 --> 18:40.998
By all means.

18:46.505 --> 18:47.505
l was overworked.

18:47.631 --> 18:49.549
l was carrying half a dozen
cases at once.

18:49.675 --> 18:54.053
lt was a heat wave.
Means a spike in. . .homicides.

18:56.181 --> 18:57.682
This one got pushed aside.

18:57.808 --> 19:02.353
l didn't write up my summary
until an hour before the trial.

19:02.479 --> 19:05.523
l obviously overlooked a few things.

19:06.358 --> 19:08.901
A murderer walked free

19:09.027 --> 19:11.362
because you were overworked?

19:12.197 --> 19:13.865
Yes.

19:26.753 --> 19:28.796
Who's this guy? Lenny Asher.

19:28.922 --> 19:31.090
Lenny? He's a nutjob.

19:31.216 --> 19:34.093
He lived next door to Rodrigo,
filed all kinds of complaints.

19:34.219 --> 19:36.762
But he filed complaints about everybody.

19:36.889 --> 19:38.389
He'd just sit at his window all day

19:38.515 --> 19:41.267
and call us every time
he saw someone move.

19:41.393 --> 19:46.105
He called us once to say there was
something weird about the clouds.

19:46.231 --> 19:48.482
Still, no harm talking to him, right?

19:51.111 --> 19:52.653
Lenny Asher?

19:53.822 --> 19:55.114
Who the hell are you?

19:55.240 --> 19:57.783
Detective Batista. This is Officer Morgan.

19:57.910 --> 20:00.077
We're with the Miami Metro Homicide.

20:00.204 --> 20:01.954
Can we come in?

20:09.004 --> 20:10.087
Who's dead?

20:10.214 --> 20:11.505
Anthony Rodrigo.

20:11.632 --> 20:15.092
l know. They found him in the ocean.

20:15.219 --> 20:17.303
l hope a whale ate him and shat him out,

20:17.429 --> 20:19.513
and then ate him again.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.057
You weren't too close to him.

20:21.183 --> 20:23.100
He was scum!

20:24.019 --> 20:26.520
Yeah. you made
numerous calls about him

20:26.647 --> 20:27.980
when he used to live here.

20:28.106 --> 20:29.690
He was a drug dealer.

20:29.816 --> 20:32.652
He played loud music,

20:32.778 --> 20:35.154
urinated on my lilies.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.697
You actually saw that?

20:36.823 --> 20:37.990
They were dead.

20:38.116 --> 20:39.700
That's all l needed to know.

20:39.826 --> 20:41.994
Any thoughts
as to who might have killed him?

20:42.120 --> 20:44.705
How the hell should l know?

20:46.124 --> 20:49.543
Look at that joker parked
right in front of the fire hydrant.

20:49.670 --> 20:52.630
l got his licence plate, though.

20:54.383 --> 20:55.967
That would be our car.

21:00.555 --> 21:02.014
You take a lot of notes?

21:02.140 --> 21:04.183
Anything hinky happens
outside this window,

21:04.309 --> 21:06.769
- l make a note on it.
- How long you been doing that?

21:06.895 --> 21:09.355
Since someone stuck a nail in my tire -

21:09.481 --> 21:11.774
March 1 998.

21:11.900 --> 21:14.360
Rodrigo was last seen alive
the day after his trial.

21:14.486 --> 21:16.862
April 1 6, 2002.

21:16.989 --> 21:18.572
Might you have taken notes that day?

21:18.699 --> 21:20.866
lf something happened, l did.

21:20.993 --> 21:23.119
You still have those notes?

21:31.128 --> 21:33.296
Here. 2002.

21:36.341 --> 21:38.050
What kind of order did you put them in?

21:38.176 --> 21:41.053
l told you, 2002.

21:44.933 --> 21:47.685
l have no idea if Lundy bought my excuse.

21:48.729 --> 21:50.604
Either way, it makes me a little anxious

21:50.731 --> 21:54.233
to see my sister looking
through the Rodrigo files...

21:54.359 --> 21:56.068
looking for me.

21:56.194 --> 21:58.237
Hey. Dex.

21:59.323 --> 22:01.615
You're never gonna guess what l found.

22:02.617 --> 22:04.744
What did you find?

22:04.870 --> 22:06.329
An apartment.

22:07.289 --> 22:09.749
Oh. Great.

22:09.875 --> 22:12.418
One-bedroom, near 78th and Harding.

22:12.544 --> 22:13.836
Wow. Big change.

22:13.962 --> 22:17.298
Yeah, well, it's time, you know?

22:17.424 --> 22:19.091
Well. good for you.
When do you move?

22:19.217 --> 22:21.010
As soon as possible, but not tonight.

22:21.136 --> 22:22.345
l have a date.

22:22.471 --> 22:25.097
l thought you broke up with Gabriel.

22:25.223 --> 22:27.933
No, it's. . .someone new.

22:29.561 --> 22:30.561
Lundy.

22:34.232 --> 22:36.442
Lundy, Special Agent Lundy?

22:37.694 --> 22:41.238
He's at least 20 years older than me.
What do you care?

22:42.908 --> 22:44.492
l don't.

22:44.618 --> 22:46.285
l mean. . .

22:48.997 --> 22:51.040
l'm sure you wouldn't do
anything like that.

22:51.166 --> 22:53.042
Do anything like what?

22:53.168 --> 22:55.586
Like try to sleep your way to the top.

22:56.046 --> 22:58.130
You douche.

22:58.256 --> 22:59.840
That is so not true.

22:59.966 --> 23:01.300
No, of course not.

23:01.426 --> 23:04.303
l shouldn't have even said anything,
and l'm sure that thought

23:04.429 --> 23:06.138
would never even occur to anyone else.

23:06.264 --> 23:07.807
Double douche!

23:07.933 --> 23:10.226
You are not allowed to talk
about anyone l date

23:10.352 --> 23:14.146
as long you're seeing
Little Miss Pardon My Tits.

23:14.272 --> 23:17.316
l am sorry, Dex, but she is gross. . .

23:17.442 --> 23:20.194
And pale, and nobody is pale in Miami.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.947
She is obviously a vampire.

23:23.073 --> 23:27.451
A gross, English titty-vampire.

23:27.953 --> 23:31.205
You just described the perfect woman.

23:34.876 --> 23:37.169
Truth is I need to avoid LiIa for now.

23:37.295 --> 23:39.171
Harry taught me that the key to survival

23:39.297 --> 23:40.840
was staying one step ahead.

23:40.966 --> 23:43.050
But Lundy almost trapped me today.

23:43.176 --> 23:45.469
l can't be unprepared like that again.

23:46.346 --> 23:47.513
Hey, it's me.

23:48.390 --> 23:51.517
Why aren't you here? l'm starving.

23:52.978 --> 23:55.354
Oh, l thought you knew,
it's my bowling night.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.482
Bowling? Really?

23:58.608 --> 24:00.609
What, like Fred Flintstone?

24:00.735 --> 24:03.362
l'm more in the Barney Rubble category.

24:03.488 --> 24:07.533
How fun. l'd love to watch you bowl.

24:08.910 --> 24:11.537
lt's not really a spectator sport.

24:11.663 --> 24:14.832
Oh, well, l'll close my eyes.

24:14.958 --> 24:17.543
But it's sort of the guys' night out.

24:17.669 --> 24:21.130
Come on, Dexter,
l want to meet your friends.

24:21.256 --> 24:24.467
Where is it? What time is it?
Give me the address.

24:26.678 --> 24:29.555
Starlight Lanes. 1 690 Michigan Avenue.

24:29.681 --> 24:31.348
Seven o' cIock.

24:33.810 --> 24:35.895
l guess l'm going bowling.

24:41.943 --> 24:44.820
Go, Dexter!

24:47.073 --> 24:48.699
He only got three pins down.

24:48.825 --> 24:51.368
Well, l like to celebrate
the little things in life.

24:51.495 --> 24:53.329
lf you like little things, l'm your man.

24:53.455 --> 24:55.164
l mean, l'm not little everywhere.

24:55.290 --> 24:57.875
Some places l'm just perfectly average.

24:58.001 --> 25:00.544
You are perfectly adorable.

25:03.298 --> 25:05.341
How come you got a hug
and l got a pat on the nose?

25:05.467 --> 25:08.177
'Cause you're like a retarded puppy.

25:14.476 --> 25:18.145
Your arse does the cutest
little thing when you bowl.

25:18.271 --> 25:20.481
Oh, thank you.

25:20.607 --> 25:25.110
lf you guys will excuse me.
l need to use the ladies' room.

25:31.618 --> 25:33.494
She's pretty hot.

25:33.620 --> 25:35.996
Yes. She is.

25:43.713 --> 25:44.922
Wow.

25:46.049 --> 25:47.550
Nice place.

25:49.511 --> 25:50.970
Very. . .

25:52.973 --> 25:54.974
grey.

25:55.100 --> 25:58.769
Yes, the Bureau have always
been known for their fashion sense.

25:58.895 --> 26:02.022
Honestly, all l care
about is the kitchen.

26:03.733 --> 26:05.693
You cook?

26:05.819 --> 26:09.655
Like l said, best restaurant in Miami.

26:09.781 --> 26:13.367
Really? You're gonna cook for me.

26:14.452 --> 26:15.828
Well. . .

26:15.954 --> 26:18.372
don't ever expect me
to return the favor...

26:18.498 --> 26:21.208
unless you're a big fan of toast.

26:21.334 --> 26:24.211
l would love to eat your toast.

26:24.337 --> 26:26.463
Gosh, that sounded wrong.

26:27.882 --> 26:29.008
So, what's for dinner?

26:29.134 --> 26:33.304
steak Florentine
and grilled potatoes ltalian-style.

26:33.430 --> 26:34.805
Fuckin'-A.

26:34.931 --> 26:36.265
There's that mouth again.

26:36.391 --> 26:39.018
Oh. . . l'm sorry.

26:39.144 --> 26:41.854
lt's just the way l talk.

26:41.980 --> 26:44.565
And if we're gonna be together,
you better get used to it.

26:44.691 --> 26:50.613
Can't change who l am.
l'm crass and dirty, and. . .

26:50.739 --> 26:52.823
l have a very filthy mind.

26:53.950 --> 26:55.326
You're also pretty adorable.

26:55.452 --> 26:57.119
l know.

26:59.205 --> 27:00.789
Now start peeling potatoes.

27:02.626 --> 27:05.336
l like a man that takes control.

27:09.466 --> 27:11.675
Wash your hands first.

27:12.802 --> 27:15.179
You're so turning me on.

27:15.305 --> 27:17.181
You know, considering our age difference,

27:17.307 --> 27:18.766
you're not too old to spank.

27:18.892 --> 27:20.684
No, stop. Please.

27:20.810 --> 27:23.312
l can't control myself.

27:23.438 --> 27:25.731
Oh, my God!

27:39.954 --> 27:41.664
Sure you won't grab a beer with us?

27:41.790 --> 27:43.957
Nah, thanks. l'm tired.

27:50.423 --> 27:52.883
l hope you saved
enough energy for me.

27:53.968 --> 27:56.178
That doesn't exactly look like
the look of love.

27:56.304 --> 27:58.847
l'm sorry. l really am tired.
l think l'm just gonna. . .

27:58.973 --> 28:00.057
Dexter!

28:00.517 --> 28:02.726
Help! Help, please!

28:04.562 --> 28:06.772
Somebody please come!

28:12.737 --> 28:14.738
God.

28:16.408 --> 28:17.741
You OK?

28:17.867 --> 28:19.201
Yeah, yeah.

28:20.328 --> 28:22.746
- Dexter, you're bleeding.
- lt's not deep.

28:22.872 --> 28:23.914
l mean, what the hell?

28:24.040 --> 28:26.166
He tried to grab my watch. lt was stupid.

28:26.292 --> 28:29.128
l should have let him have it,
it was just...it was reflex.

28:29.254 --> 28:30.587
As long as you're OK.

28:30.714 --> 28:32.047
Yeah, yeah. l'm fine.

28:33.299 --> 28:35.926
Jesus Christ.
They sell anyone a gun in Florida.

28:36.052 --> 28:38.387
Yeah, l know. Scary, right?

28:38.513 --> 28:41.223
- Anyone get a licence plate?
- No, it was all too fast.

28:41.349 --> 28:43.475
- You want us to take you to a doctor?
- No.

28:43.601 --> 28:45.477
Really, l'm fine.

28:45.603 --> 28:47.688
l'll take care of him.

28:52.986 --> 28:56.572
So, who was it?

28:58.116 --> 29:00.075
That man, he wasn't trying to rob you,

29:00.201 --> 29:02.953
he was trying to kill you.

29:05.039 --> 29:07.291
Santos Jimenez, the man
who murdered my mother.

29:07.417 --> 29:08.500
Oh, my God, Dexter. . .

29:08.626 --> 29:12.379
He must have tracked me down
and followed me to the bowling alley.

29:12.505 --> 29:15.424
lf you hadn't have seen him in time. . .

29:16.134 --> 29:18.969
l did see him. That's all that matters.

29:23.641 --> 29:26.143
None of this scares you?

29:27.187 --> 29:30.981
Nothing you could do, Dexter,
would scare me.

29:35.236 --> 29:37.321
l believe you.

29:39.949 --> 29:41.617
Come here.

29:45.163 --> 29:47.247
Whatever comes. . .

29:48.666 --> 29:51.210
we'll get through this together.

29:51.336 --> 29:53.837
l'm not leaving your side, Dexter.

29:55.465 --> 29:57.758
l'm not leaving yours.

29:59.677 --> 30:01.345
Really?

30:06.392 --> 30:08.685
Why would you think that?

30:09.813 --> 30:12.523
You've just been a bit distant lately.

30:13.983 --> 30:16.568
l get that way when l'm stressed.

30:16.694 --> 30:18.862
What are you stressed about?

30:23.284 --> 30:25.369
Right now, nothing.

30:34.045 --> 30:37.214
Do you think Dexter
will come for breakfast tomorrow?

30:38.299 --> 30:41.927
Oh, l don't think so, honey.

30:42.053 --> 30:44.555
Well, maybe we should call him.

30:46.015 --> 30:48.100
lt's kind of late.

30:48.226 --> 30:50.602
But Dexter stays up late.

30:50.728 --> 30:52.396
She doesn't want to call him.

30:53.565 --> 30:55.148
Why not?

30:56.067 --> 30:58.443
Dexter and l broke up.

30:59.153 --> 31:00.445
Why?

31:00.572 --> 31:02.573
They don't like each other any more.

31:03.700 --> 31:06.410
Well, that's not true.

31:07.620 --> 31:10.455
Does that mean he doesn't like us, either?

31:10.582 --> 31:13.876
Oh, no. Of course he likes you.

31:15.587 --> 31:20.841
lt's just... lt's hard
when two people break up.

31:20.967 --> 31:23.468
lt makes them sad to see each other.

31:24.554 --> 31:28.307
l don't think Dexter's gonna be
coming for breakfast for a while.

31:32.478 --> 31:34.146
Sorry.

31:35.106 --> 31:36.815
Lila may be the right woman for me

31:36.941 --> 31:38.650
but she's wrong about one thing.

31:38.776 --> 31:41.320
Recovery simply isn't an option.

31:41.446 --> 31:42.487
When l let my guard down,

31:42.614 --> 31:45.866
l open myself up for attack...or capture.

31:45.992 --> 31:49.494
I need to embrace who I am,
who l've always been.

31:49.621 --> 31:52.748
l need to kill the man
who murdered my mother.

31:57.629 --> 32:00.547
l'd almost forgotten this feeling.

32:00.673 --> 32:03.258
Driving toward a kill,

32:03.384 --> 32:05.636
all my senses sharpened.

32:06.971 --> 32:12.392
lt's like l've been living underwater, holding
my breath, and now l can finally breathe.

32:13.645 --> 32:16.772
So how come it's so suffocating in here?

32:24.322 --> 32:26.114
James.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.199
Hey.

32:27.325 --> 32:29.534
Hey. lt's nice to see you.

32:29.661 --> 32:32.329
Yeah, feels all warm and comfy.

32:33.373 --> 32:35.207
l spoke to Todd about you.

32:35.333 --> 32:37.000
Yeah?

32:37.126 --> 32:39.461
He's very interested.

32:39.587 --> 32:44.549
He said someone with your background
typically starts at about 200.000.

32:44.676 --> 32:46.009
l could live with that.

32:46.135 --> 32:50.013
You can meet him tonight.
nine o'clock, bar at the Hilton.

32:50.139 --> 32:51.807
l'll be there.

32:58.523 --> 33:02.442
Sergeant Doakes. l appreciate your time.

33:02.568 --> 33:05.570
Can we get this over with, sir?

33:05.697 --> 33:07.030
OK.

33:08.116 --> 33:11.868
lt's interesting that of the 1 8 victims,
nine passed through this very station,

33:11.995 --> 33:15.872
and you worked on cases
involving four of them.

33:15.999 --> 33:18.917
And you were unable to obtain
a single conviction.

33:19.043 --> 33:22.462
The smith case thrown out
because of inadmissible evidence.

33:22.588 --> 33:25.757
Orozco skipped bail.
never to be seen again.

33:25.883 --> 33:29.136
The Rodrigo case -
lost due to bad blood work.

33:29.262 --> 33:30.721
Excuse me?

33:31.931 --> 33:34.141
Oh, you weren't aware of that?

33:35.226 --> 33:38.103
The DA didn't get a conviction,
that's all l know.

33:41.441 --> 33:45.694
- Are we through here. sir?
- No, actually, we're just getting. . .

33:45.820 --> 33:47.070
We're done.

33:56.414 --> 33:57.998
Look at this.

33:58.124 --> 34:01.334
"June 1 st. Mrs. Holcomb takes out trash,

34:01.461 --> 34:04.796
"drops soda bottle, doesn't pick it up."

34:04.922 --> 34:08.550
"March 1 7th.
Airplane flying too low."

34:08.676 --> 34:10.927
l told you, this guy's a fruit bat.

34:11.929 --> 34:15.223
"April." Hey, it's the month we want.

34:17.310 --> 34:18.977
"April 1 6th". . .

34:20.688 --> 34:22.439
Fuck me sideways, listen to this.

34:22.565 --> 34:24.816
"Rodrigo gets into car
parked in wrong space.

34:24.942 --> 34:27.152
"Must be drunk because
someone is carrying him."

34:27.278 --> 34:29.738
The licence plate's here.
The night he disappeared.

34:29.864 --> 34:32.532
The last time anyone saw him alive.
We got to run that plate.

34:32.658 --> 34:35.494
- Whoever owned this car is our killer.
- l'm gonna get Lundy.

34:35.620 --> 34:38.497
- He's out with his feds.
- Well, l'm calling him in.

34:45.213 --> 34:48.173
Lila almost had me believing
it was possible,

34:48.299 --> 34:51.426
to change, to become something else,

34:52.762 --> 34:55.555
As if that ever really happens.

34:55.681 --> 34:58.183
l've always known what l am.

34:59.602 --> 35:01.394
lf the glove fits...

36:29.066 --> 36:33.236
A secret cabin in the middIe
of the Everglades -

36:33.362 --> 36:36.907
what more couId a rededicated
seriaI kiIIer ask for?

36:51.088 --> 36:52.297
Cocaine.

36:52.423 --> 36:55.425
Apparently Mr. Jimenez
never gave up his old habits.

36:56.594 --> 36:59.095
What a bad, bad man.

37:29.335 --> 37:32.420
What, did you think it just
turned on by itself?

37:36.300 --> 37:38.760
"There is no such plate."

37:38.886 --> 37:41.179
ls that a one or an l?
Fuck you, Lenny.

37:41.305 --> 37:43.390
Fuck your handwriting.

37:48.938 --> 37:50.188
Debra.

37:50.314 --> 37:52.023
Kind of busy here.

37:52.149 --> 37:55.193
Then can you please tell me
where l can find Dexter?

37:55.319 --> 37:57.028
l've brought him some dinner.

37:57.154 --> 37:58.321
Dexter's not here.

37:58.447 --> 37:59.406
Where is he?

37:59.532 --> 38:01.116
How should l know?

38:01.242 --> 38:03.326
He said he was working late.

38:05.329 --> 38:06.955
ls that what he told you?

38:07.999 --> 38:10.208
What do you mean?

38:10.334 --> 38:11.668
He's not working late.

38:13.337 --> 38:15.714
l think he lied to you.

38:16.424 --> 38:18.758
Oh, men are such pigs.

38:28.811 --> 38:31.146
l'm so sorry. l'm sure he'll show up.

38:31.272 --> 38:33.523
He's very excited about this job.

39:06.474 --> 39:08.683
l swear, l've tried every combination.

39:08.809 --> 39:10.894
Nothing is coming up.

39:12.063 --> 39:14.606
l told you Lenny would be
a waste of time.

39:14.732 --> 39:17.067
Maybe it's not a Florida plate.

39:20.237 --> 39:22.364
Try Georgia.

39:23.574 --> 39:24.824
Holy shit, here it is.

39:26.243 --> 39:28.578
The vehicle was registered
to Charlie Lewis.

39:28.704 --> 39:30.246
l know that name.

39:31.082 --> 39:33.583
A drug dealer out of New York.

39:33.709 --> 39:35.043
A tough guy,

39:35.169 --> 39:36.711
likes to carry a big-ass knife.

39:36.837 --> 39:39.130
That's our guy.
That's the Bay Harbor Butcher.

39:39.256 --> 39:41.341
l told you he wasn't a cop.

39:43.928 --> 39:44.969
What?

39:45.096 --> 39:46.137
Shit.

39:46.263 --> 39:47.555
Where is he?

39:48.516 --> 39:51.017
According to this,
South Bay Correctional Facility.

39:51.143 --> 39:52.227
For how long?

39:52.353 --> 39:54.813
Oh, shit.

39:54.939 --> 39:57.857
Charlie Lewis was arrested April 1 2, 2002.

39:57.983 --> 40:01.486
That's four days before Rodrigo
was seen being carried into the car.

40:01.612 --> 40:03.196
Who had his car? One of his gang?

40:03.322 --> 40:06.658
This is where it gets really bad.
The vehicle was seized as evidence.

40:06.784 --> 40:08.159
By who?

40:08.285 --> 40:10.078
By our department.

40:11.414 --> 40:12.747
Where was the vehicle held?

40:13.207 --> 40:15.792
Right here in our evidence lab,
behind a secure gate.

40:15.918 --> 40:19.129
Someone signed the vehicle out,
picked Rodrigo up,

40:19.255 --> 40:21.673
killed him, and then signed
the vehicle back in.

40:21.799 --> 40:24.843
- So you have records.
- Why would we keep them?

40:24.969 --> 40:27.053
The only people with access
to those vehicles

40:27.179 --> 40:29.722
are members of the Miami Metro
Police Department.

40:29.849 --> 40:30.974
Holy shit.

40:34.854 --> 40:37.939
Bay Harbor Butcher is one of our own.

40:39.900 --> 40:42.652
We keep this to ourselves for now,

40:42.778 --> 40:43.778
just the three of us.

40:43.904 --> 40:46.781
l'm gonna go tell it to a bottle of Scotch.

41:26.572 --> 41:28.573
Here we are again.

41:29.742 --> 41:32.702
What the fuck?

41:32.828 --> 41:36.581
l know, l keep asking myself
that same question.

41:45.716 --> 41:46.799
Let me out of here!

41:46.926 --> 41:49.052
But. . .

41:50.346 --> 41:53.890
l'm finding it's best to accept
things you can't change, you know?

41:55.518 --> 41:56.935
Normally, l'd have a chat

41:57.061 --> 42:00.396
to make sure you understand
why you're here, but. . .

42:00.523 --> 42:03.233
l think you have a pretty good idea.

42:05.236 --> 42:06.486
Let me go.

42:07.530 --> 42:09.822
l got cocaine.

42:09.949 --> 42:11.741
You can have all of it.

42:11.867 --> 42:15.203
lt's funny you should say that.
l am off the wagon.

42:17.164 --> 42:19.916
But that was never my drug.

42:21.502 --> 42:24.254
l'll fucking kill you!

42:28.884 --> 42:31.511
No, Mr. Jimenez.

42:31.637 --> 42:34.597
l'm gonna kill you tonight. . .

42:34.723 --> 42:38.142
for what you did to my mother. . .

42:38.269 --> 42:41.813
and because, well,
this is what l do best.

42:50.698 --> 42:52.824
lt's kind of fitting, don't you think?

43:18.976 --> 43:21.436
Astor, Cody, come on, let's eat.

43:25.441 --> 43:27.066
How'd you get the door unlocked?

43:27.192 --> 43:29.694
lt was already open.

43:29.820 --> 43:32.614
Oh, that's odd.

44:51.652 --> 44:53.069
Lila.

45:02.413 --> 45:03.413
Hello?

45:03.539 --> 45:04.956
Dexter, hi.

45:05.082 --> 45:08.418
Look, l'm sorry to bother you,
and l'm sure this is nothing.

45:08.544 --> 45:11.462
but l was just wondering if
by chance you were at my house.

45:12.423 --> 45:13.631
Well. . . No.

45:13.757 --> 45:17.677
Well. it's just that the door was open
and you're the only other one with a key.

45:21.724 --> 45:24.016
Rita, get out of the house.
Call the police.

45:24.143 --> 45:26.102
l'll be there as soon as l can.

45:31.108 --> 45:33.526
Can't leave you here.

45:33.652 --> 45:35.737
Can't take you with me.

45:37.781 --> 45:39.323
Don't go anywhere!

45:42.995 --> 45:45.204
Oh, hey, l'm sorry to drag you into this.

45:45.330 --> 45:47.039
No, no, l'm glad you called. The kids?

45:47.166 --> 45:48.458
Next door.

45:52.129 --> 45:54.922
The place is empty.
No sign of forcible entry.

45:55.048 --> 45:58.009
l'm guessing you just forgot
to lock the door.

45:58.135 --> 45:59.343
lf you need anything else. . .

45:59.470 --> 46:01.554
- No, no. You're not leaving.
- Sir?

46:01.680 --> 46:07.059
Someone was in this house. l need you
to stay here until l tell you it's safe.

46:07.186 --> 46:09.270
Really? l need to do those things.

46:09.396 --> 46:10.897
l'm with Miami Metro Homicide.

46:11.023 --> 46:14.692
l know you don't take orders from me
but l could phone Lieutenant LaGuerta

46:14.818 --> 46:18.279
or if you prefer Captain Matthews,
l could arrange that as well.

46:19.364 --> 46:20.615
Dexter, what's going on?

46:20.741 --> 46:23.034
Please, just stay here. OK?

46:24.244 --> 46:25.995
lt's one thing to fuck with me,

46:26.121 --> 46:30.583
another to fuck with
my ex-girlfriend who hates me.

46:30.709 --> 46:33.836
The Lila experiment is officially over.

46:35.255 --> 46:36.464
Dexter!

46:36.590 --> 46:38.883
Give me Rita's key.

46:43.263 --> 46:45.848
Well, that's your fault, isn't it, Dexter?

46:45.974 --> 46:49.477
You lied to me about working late,

46:49.603 --> 46:51.979
and l thought l might find you there.

46:53.065 --> 46:55.691
Do not ever go to Rita's house again.

46:55.818 --> 47:00.947
Do you understand?

47:02.115 --> 47:06.202
Oh. ls this the monster
that you keep telling me about?

47:06.912 --> 47:09.247
Trust me, when you meet
the monster, you'll know.

47:13.210 --> 47:15.378
You called Jimenez.

47:15.504 --> 47:17.380
Yeah, l suppose l did.

47:17.923 --> 47:19.257
Why?

47:20.384 --> 47:22.218
Why would you try to have me killed?

47:22.344 --> 47:24.887
You weren't going to get killed.

47:25.013 --> 47:26.264
That's why l did it at the bowling alley,

47:26.390 --> 47:28.933
so all your police-officer
friends would be there.

47:29.059 --> 47:32.144
What were you thinking?
Are you insane?

47:32.271 --> 47:35.314
l was trying to bring us
back together again!

47:35.440 --> 47:38.192
You were pulling away, and. . .

47:40.612 --> 47:44.407
Remember at the hotel
after you faced Jimenez?

47:45.325 --> 47:47.827
That! That's what l wanted!

47:49.246 --> 47:51.205
To bring you back.

47:53.208 --> 47:56.085
So you called him?

47:56.211 --> 47:59.547
Well, it worked, didn't it?

47:59.673 --> 48:02.633
Last night. You and l.

48:02.759 --> 48:04.927
You fell asleep in my arms.

48:09.391 --> 48:10.850
What?

48:14.855 --> 48:16.147
You. . .

48:16.273 --> 48:21.777
You are more dangerous
than my addiction will ever be.

48:21.904 --> 48:24.113
That's saying a lot.

48:27.284 --> 48:30.077
Stay away from Rita.

48:30.203 --> 48:32.705
Stay away from me.

48:34.249 --> 48:36.000
Or what?

48:38.170 --> 48:40.546
Or you will see the monster.
