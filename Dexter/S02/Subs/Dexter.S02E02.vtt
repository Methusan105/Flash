WEBVTT

00:02.048 --> 00:03.882
Previously on Dexter...

00:04.009 --> 00:08.929
l'm on edge. 38 days have passed
since l killed my brother.

00:09.055 --> 00:11.515
In that entire time,
l haven't had a single night to myself.

00:11.641 --> 00:13.642
Sergeant Doakes makes sure of that.

00:13.768 --> 00:16.645
With Doakes tailing me,
my life's been all Jekyll and no Hyde.

00:16.771 --> 00:18.397
My brother would be so disappointed.

00:18.523 --> 00:21.191
Don't forget,
tell the universe what you need.

00:21.317 --> 00:23.902
l really need...to kill somebody.

00:24.029 --> 00:25.946
l've been waiting a long time for this.

00:33.204 --> 00:34.121
What the fuck?

00:34.247 --> 00:37.708
I'II be OK. I foIIowed the code.
The stalk was good.

00:37.834 --> 00:40.461
l'm just a little rusty
since killing my brother.

00:40.587 --> 00:43.630
Debra can't sleep
in an empty house any more.

00:43.757 --> 00:46.341
l guess that"s what happens
when your fiance tries to slice you up

00:46.468 --> 00:48.260
into small, bloodless pieces.

00:48.386 --> 00:49.928
Welcome back, Morgan.

00:50.722 --> 00:51.972
Thanks.

00:52.766 --> 00:55.434
You just got to look her in the eyes
to know she's not right.

00:55.560 --> 00:58.103
- Excuse me, are you. . .
- What the fuck are you doing?

00:58.229 --> 01:01.899
Rita, l'm not doing real good in here, OK?
Will you help me?

01:02.025 --> 01:03.901
l found the fucking shoe, OK?

01:04.027 --> 01:05.903
Great! l'll call the lawyer in the morning.

01:06.029 --> 01:08.906
No! l'm not gonna let you
drag Dexter into this.

01:11.242 --> 01:12.785
Paul's dead.

01:13.411 --> 01:15.204
And l could have helped him.

01:15.330 --> 01:16.997
That was his own fault.

01:17.999 --> 01:20.000
Was it?

01:20.794 --> 01:25.339
- What's the matter with you today?
- l'm just a little off my game. l'll get it back.

01:25.465 --> 01:26.715
Rafael!

01:26.841 --> 01:29.843
- lt felt like she was asking me something.
- That's her son.

01:29.969 --> 01:32.805
She says she knows who killed him,
Some guy named Little Chino.

01:32.931 --> 01:35.474
She wants you to find Little Chino
and kill him like a dog.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.017
Eva.

01:37.143 --> 01:38.811
Are you willing to testify

01:39.729 --> 01:42.648
that Little Chino picked up your son
on the night of his death?

01:42.774 --> 01:44.316
Come on. Don't back down now.

01:45.860 --> 01:48.112
l want him to pay.

01:48.238 --> 01:51.281
A challenge, a mountain to climb.

01:51.407 --> 01:53.075
I need this one.

01:53.201 --> 01:56.829
The scene of the failed crime,
no better place to try again.

02:01.167 --> 02:03.836
l don't normally experience failure.

02:03.962 --> 02:08.423
39 days, 22 hours and 1 8 minutes
since l killed my brother.

02:08.550 --> 02:10.175
I am cursed.

02:10.301 --> 02:12.678
Two treasure hunters
made a ghastly discovery today

02:12.804 --> 02:15.681
when they stumbled on what appears to be
an underwater graveyard

02:15.807 --> 02:18.767
in a crevice off the coast of Miami.

02:20.145 --> 02:23.355
That means there might be
a new mass murderer out there

02:23.481 --> 02:25.732
way worse than the lce-Truck Killer.

04:28.273 --> 04:29.648
l'm drifting.

04:31.943 --> 04:35.320
l finally get a chance to kill and l can't do it.

04:37.156 --> 04:39.950
And a second chance, and he gets away.

04:44.497 --> 04:47.958
And now all my secrets
are floating to the surface.

04:49.085 --> 04:54.006
Where is the orderly,
controlled, effective Dexter?

04:54.132 --> 04:56.216
How did I Iose him?

04:56.342 --> 04:58.427
How do l find him again?

05:01.180 --> 05:02.681
l'm drifting...

05:05.351 --> 05:07.144
...but not to sleep.

05:12.275 --> 05:15.444
...the gruesome discovery
off the coast of Florida yesterday.

05:15.570 --> 05:19.573
Police are still searching through evidence
lying at the bottom of the ocean.

05:19.699 --> 05:23.869
Sources say there could be multiple victims
in what appears to be the work...

05:44.974 --> 05:47.559
Here l am, back in the belly of the beast.

05:47.685 --> 05:51.813
But how can l solve a crime when
l can't even solve what's wrong with me?

05:53.733 --> 05:55.650
Yet duty calls.

06:01.282 --> 06:03.450
Eight confirmed.

06:03.576 --> 06:06.787
- Eight confirmed. Here?
- No. Here is just one.

06:06.913 --> 06:09.164
Eight confirmed victims
of the Bay Harbor Butcher.

06:11.084 --> 06:12.793
The "Bay Harbor Butcher"?

06:12.919 --> 06:16.505
That's what the press is calling
whoever dumped those bodies offshore.

06:16.631 --> 06:18.507
Has a nice ring to it, no?

06:18.633 --> 06:20.675
Well, it's a little. . .

06:20.802 --> 06:23.512
- lurid.
- Lurid and possibly wrong.

06:23.638 --> 06:26.973
Part of me is hoping they found
the lce-Truck Killer's dumping grounds.

06:27.100 --> 06:30.227
Tell me about it. The last thing Miami needs is
another serial killer.

06:32.939 --> 06:35.065
Eva Arenas. All she wanted was justice

06:35.191 --> 06:38.193
against the 29th Street Kings
for whacking her son.

06:38.319 --> 06:41.279
- First she's the messenger...
- Now she's a goddamn message.

06:43.783 --> 06:46.910
Death by machete. Again.

06:47.036 --> 06:51.665
We got a bolo on Little Chino. Gang crash
unit. all local patrols after that cabron.

06:51.791 --> 06:55.836
Last thing l want is for the cops
to bring Little Chino in.

06:55.962 --> 06:57.254
He's mine.

06:57.380 --> 07:00.549
Why don't you take a picture, Morgan?
lt'll last longer.

07:00.675 --> 07:03.385
What would l do
without you, Sergeant?

07:13.229 --> 07:16.314
Please, senora. Please, slower.

07:18.985 --> 07:21.027
She's saying you fuckin' cops
don't do nothin'.

07:21.154 --> 07:22.779
Grandma really talks like that?

07:22.905 --> 07:26.283
Not exactly. But you get the point.
Right. bitch?

07:31.873 --> 07:33.707
Fucking people don't want our help.

07:35.501 --> 07:38.378
Shit. She had a little girl.

07:38.504 --> 07:39.546
l know.

07:42.091 --> 07:43.717
This stuff never gets to you?

07:45.428 --> 07:47.804
l'm more of a "crying on the inside"
kind of guy.

07:47.930 --> 07:51.475
Wow. He makes the lce-Truck Killer
look like a goddamn artist.

07:56.731 --> 07:58.315
Sorry, Morgan.

07:58.441 --> 08:00.066
What?

08:00.193 --> 08:01.610
l'm so over that.

08:03.529 --> 08:05.071
You just prove it to me.

08:05.198 --> 08:06.573
You can't.

08:06.699 --> 08:09.409
You're just fucking with me!

08:11.829 --> 08:13.872
l'm gonna have to put you on hold.

08:17.335 --> 08:18.418
Fiance.

08:18.544 --> 08:21.546
lncarnate. Couldn't pick a worse time, right?

08:22.882 --> 08:23.924
Hey, Esmee.

08:24.050 --> 08:27.052
How about you take off,
let me handle this?

08:29.096 --> 08:31.848
l couldn't let you do that.

08:31.974 --> 08:35.602
l'll write up the report and email it to you
for signature.

08:35.728 --> 08:36.895
OK?

08:42.735 --> 08:47.113
l want Morgan to report to me first thing
in the morning about that bar fight of hers.

08:47.240 --> 08:48.615
Maria. . .

08:49.700 --> 08:50.867
l owe you.

08:59.835 --> 09:02.254
ln there!

09:05.424 --> 09:07.175
Somebody else get in there now!

09:21.607 --> 09:23.775
Mommy!

09:28.489 --> 09:30.532
Seeing her mother that way.

09:30.658 --> 09:33.618
Can you imagine that?

09:33.744 --> 09:36.162
l can't even go there, Angel.

09:50.803 --> 09:53.013
This one's on us, man.

09:53.139 --> 09:57.767
lf l had killed Chino last night,
that little girl's mother would still be alive.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.955
l gotta find Chino before he finds me.

10:23.085 --> 10:26.379
...bringing to an even dozen
the number of bodies found offshore.

10:26.505 --> 10:28.882
l have to focus, tune everything out.

10:29.008 --> 10:32.135
So far, the authorities
have no cIue as to the criminaI.

10:32.261 --> 10:36.890
lf l don't, being linked to my bodies of work
will be the least of my worries.

10:38.434 --> 10:40.352
Shit. LittIe Chino?

10:40.478 --> 10:43.480
He was out there.
The timing could be better.

10:46.442 --> 10:48.860
Yeah, plus l don't have my tools.

10:50.154 --> 10:53.448
lt does give me the chance
to tie up one massive loose end.

11:06.545 --> 11:10.048
- lt's you, Sergeant.
- Who else you got following you?

11:11.634 --> 11:12.842
Apparently no one.

11:16.347 --> 11:19.891
Go ahead. Try it. l've been waiting.

11:20.935 --> 11:22.894
This neighborhood. . .

11:23.020 --> 11:24.729
it's full of crazies.

11:26.315 --> 11:28.400
l'd lock my doors.

11:42.456 --> 11:45.208
Bathroom's all yours.

11:45.334 --> 11:47.377
Kind of always was.

11:52.967 --> 11:55.343
We run out of glasses?

11:55.469 --> 11:56.720
Clean ones.

11:56.846 --> 12:01.141
Come here a sec. l found a couple of places
on craigslist you should check out.

12:01.267 --> 12:04.018
Got two bedrooms, two baths,
limited water views.

12:04.145 --> 12:06.271
- has its own gym.
- Hate it.

12:06.772 --> 12:08.273
All right.

12:08.566 --> 12:11.317
One bedroom, one bath,
Art Deco building.

12:11.444 --> 12:13.153
Shitty neighborhood.

12:13.279 --> 12:16.156
lt gets morning sun.

12:16.991 --> 12:18.616
Come on, Deb, give it a chance.

12:18.743 --> 12:22.537
l appreciate the brotherly love.
but l've got the lieutenant in like an hour.

12:22.663 --> 12:25.039
See you at the job.

12:26.792 --> 12:28.168
l will not kill my sister,

12:28.294 --> 12:31.254
l will not kill my sister,
l will not kill my sister.

12:47.813 --> 12:50.023
- Hey, you.
- Dexter?

12:51.358 --> 12:53.777
Astor? Sweetie, what's the matter?

12:53.903 --> 12:55.987
Mom's acting all weird and stuff.

12:57.072 --> 13:00.533
- What kind of weird?
- She keeps talking to people on the phone

13:00.659 --> 13:03.411
about my dad.
then she starts yelling at them.

13:03.537 --> 13:06.706
- Then she yells at me and Cody.
- l'm on my way.

13:09.168 --> 13:12.253
No. no.
Calm is what l was 35 minutes ago.

13:12.379 --> 13:14.130
Pissed is what l am now.

13:15.174 --> 13:17.217
Hey, who wants Eggos?

13:17.343 --> 13:19.761
l got blueberry or chocolate. Or both.

13:19.887 --> 13:22.055
- Both.
- Don't care.

13:24.225 --> 13:27.227
Assholes. They did everything but help.

13:27.353 --> 13:29.854
Which assholes were you talking to?

13:31.482 --> 13:33.650
Funeral home assholes.

13:34.860 --> 13:36.528
You're having a funeral for Paul?

13:37.321 --> 13:40.240
For Paul, for the kids, for me.

13:40.366 --> 13:42.367
We had this old insurance policy.

13:42.493 --> 13:44.911
lt's about $5.000.
but it should cover everything.

13:45.037 --> 13:47.539
You know. the county
will bury Paul for free.

13:47.665 --> 13:50.416
l mean, he wasn't even your husband.

13:50.543 --> 13:52.043
Any more.

13:52.169 --> 13:53.878
Technically.

13:54.839 --> 13:58.925
Then you could use the insurance money
for a starter scholarship for the kids?

14:00.719 --> 14:03.555
Dexter, l didn't ask for your help
or your advice.

14:06.225 --> 14:09.644
I'II never understand
how people deal with death,

14:09.770 --> 14:13.064
why they can't just put it in its place.

14:14.900 --> 14:17.944
And now I have to find someone
who knows l'm looking for him,

14:18.070 --> 14:21.865
not exactly ideal in
the "'eIement of surprise"' department.

14:21.991 --> 14:25.660
And l have to find a new way
to dispose of Little Chino's body.

14:26.745 --> 14:28.788
If I can cIose the deaI this time.

14:35.588 --> 14:38.006
You totally douched me in there.

14:39.675 --> 14:42.427
You clocked a guy in a bar
who touched your arm.

14:42.553 --> 14:45.138
l told the lieutenant
you weren't ready for active duty.

14:45.264 --> 14:49.267
Well, thank you
for the fucking vote of confidence.

14:49.393 --> 14:51.352
Nice.

14:52.771 --> 14:54.314
1 3 confirmed.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.317
The buzz in the halls
is that the feds are coming in

14:57.443 --> 14:59.819
- on the Bay Harbor bodies.
- Well. that figures.

14:59.945 --> 15:03.364
The FBl does all the heavy lifting.
Captain Matthews takes all the credit.

15:03.490 --> 15:06.367
Nice political move
when you're bucking for Deputy Chief.

15:06.493 --> 15:09.162
- Any idea who the FBl is sending?
- some guy named Lundy.

15:09.288 --> 15:10.788
Frank Lundy?

15:10.915 --> 15:13.541
He's a rock star.
The Green River Killer, the DC Sniper.

15:13.667 --> 15:16.127
- lf the case was impossible, he broke it.
- Now. James.

15:16.253 --> 15:18.046
l'm damaged goods around here, but you,

15:18.172 --> 15:22.133
you should do whatever you can
to get on Lundy's task force.

15:22.259 --> 15:24.677
- lt's a career-maker!
- Hey.

15:26.555 --> 15:31.225
Just visualize that door of opportunity opening
up wide for you. bro.

15:31.352 --> 15:35.104
- and just walk right through it.
- Angel, you keep up with this woo-woo shit,

15:35.230 --> 15:37.607
l'm gonna walk right through you.

15:39.985 --> 15:41.235
You were right.

15:41.362 --> 15:43.488
LittIe Chino. Shit.

15:43.614 --> 15:47.033
This guy is officially the highest point
in aII of FIorida.

15:51.246 --> 15:53.206
What is he doing here?

15:53.874 --> 15:56.668
People tell me you're looking for my client.

16:02.174 --> 16:04.175
People tell you right.

16:10.724 --> 16:12.850
Fuck, he's big.

16:12.977 --> 16:15.269
The harder they fall.

16:16.939 --> 16:19.399
That come with a story?

16:19.525 --> 16:22.902
- l cut myself shaving.
- Well, you should be more careful, amigo.

16:23.028 --> 16:25.780
Lieutenant, my client has been
harassed by this department.

16:25.906 --> 16:28.199
- We're considering. . .
- Oh, cut the shit, Raul.

16:28.826 --> 16:31.786
There was another murder in East Kendall
yesterday and my client. . .

16:31.912 --> 16:35.748
Word on the pavement is
you're looking for me regarding this. . .

16:35.874 --> 16:38.835
- tragedy.
- You bet your ass we are.

16:38.961 --> 16:42.922
The victim was the mother of one of
your compadres who we know you killed.

16:43.048 --> 16:45.425
But can't prove, right, Officer?

16:45.551 --> 16:48.845
lt's Detective. And can't prove yet.

16:48.971 --> 16:51.014
Show them the disc.

17:01.692 --> 17:04.485
Time stamp is yesterday afternoon,
same time as. . .

17:04.611 --> 17:07.030
- Eva Arenas' TOD.
- That's bullshit.

17:07.156 --> 17:10.074
- Anyone could reset a time stamp.
- Check it out.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.743
Yesterday's paper.

17:13.245 --> 17:17.290
That arrogant prick. He knew
we'd peg him for Arenas' murder,

17:17.416 --> 17:19.917
so he covered his ass,
had someone else do the deed.

17:20.044 --> 17:23.087
- That makes him an accomplice, right?
- Not without evidence.

17:23.797 --> 17:26.174
Cut him loose.

17:35.225 --> 17:38.853
Red rover, red rover,
send Chino back over.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.035
Yo, Dex, check this out.

18:01.126 --> 18:03.044
1 3 and counting.

18:03.170 --> 18:07.173
They're so swamped up there
they had to bring in outside talent,

18:07.299 --> 18:09.467
which would be moi.

18:12.596 --> 18:16.265
Bet this guy never expected his work
to see the light of day.

18:16.391 --> 18:18.142
Bet you're right.

18:19.728 --> 18:21.646
lt can't be easy
to hide a body nowadays.

18:21.772 --> 18:24.107
- You shitting me?
- Hypothetical.

18:24.233 --> 18:28.194
You're the Bay Harbor Butcher. How do you
make sure a disposed body stays disposed?

18:28.320 --> 18:32.198
Tons of options. Everglades,
alligators. pig farms.

18:32.324 --> 18:34.826
sulphuric acid, wood chipper, incinerator.

18:34.952 --> 18:37.078
Hell, even meat pies.

18:37.204 --> 18:39.831
- The mind boggles.
- Don't all those run the risk of contact

18:39.957 --> 18:43.209
- with the outside world?
- You got a better idea?

18:45.629 --> 18:46.921
No.

18:47.047 --> 18:51.342
And that"s the problem. Where
do I put Chino when I'm done with him?

18:52.845 --> 18:56.514
Captain's coming up with that FBl guy.
He's got a fuckin' entourage.

19:17.202 --> 19:21.372
All right, listen up, everyone. Briefing room in
two minutes for Show and Tell.

19:24.376 --> 19:25.626
All right.

19:25.752 --> 19:31.090
The Bay Harbor Butcher case
is now a Miami Metro case.

19:31.216 --> 19:35.094
And it is shaping up to be
the biggest one in our history.

19:35.220 --> 19:37.096
We're now at 14 confirmed.

19:37.222 --> 19:39.640
The FBl has sent over their top man,

19:39.766 --> 19:42.185
Special Agent Frank Lundy,
to help solve this crime.

19:42.311 --> 19:44.061
Now. . .

19:44.188 --> 19:47.648
this will not be
a jurisdictional circle jerk.

19:47.774 --> 19:50.276
This will be a shining example

19:50.402 --> 19:54.906
of two agencies working together
for the public good.

19:55.032 --> 19:56.616
Agent Lundy.

19:58.994 --> 20:03.206
Hello, everyone. There is no such thing
as the perfect crime,

20:03.332 --> 20:06.042
not in my experience, anyway.

20:06.168 --> 20:09.670
With your help and with the mistakes
this person has made

20:09.796 --> 20:13.841
and will eventually make.
we'll find whoever did this awful thing.

20:13.967 --> 20:18.554
l need everyone in every department
up to speed on what we are doing.

20:18.680 --> 20:23.142
while l review your files
and put our task force together.

20:23.268 --> 20:26.520
So, let's get a jump-start
on the Bay Harbor Butcher,

20:26.647 --> 20:29.607
a moniker which, by the way, repulses me.

20:29.733 --> 20:31.442
Well, we have something in common.

20:31.568 --> 20:33.611
Can someone get the lights?

20:38.575 --> 20:42.495
The first report from the field
had these parts as coming from one body.

20:42.621 --> 20:45.748
Actually, it's two.

20:45.874 --> 20:48.292
There's been speculation
that this human harvest

20:48.418 --> 20:51.420
might be connected to a case
you've recently solved.

20:51.546 --> 20:55.508
But there are several inconsistencies between
the two sets of body parts,

20:55.634 --> 21:00.596
gender, exsanguination,
specific methods of dissection.

21:00.722 --> 21:03.015
Not to mention my guys deserved it.

21:03.141 --> 21:07.144
The evidence just isn't there to piggyback this
onto the lce-Truck Killer.

21:08.563 --> 21:12.608
We're looking for a different suspect.
All information is to be disseminated. . .

21:12.734 --> 21:14.527
Miss me, brother?

21:16.071 --> 21:18.281
. . .all agency protocol. . .

21:20.784 --> 21:21.784
Putting it plainly. . .

21:21.910 --> 21:27.123
l can"t afford to lose it like this, not with
Special Agent Rock Star on my case.

21:27.249 --> 21:29.208
Do not discuss this case.

21:29.334 --> 21:31.627
I need to cIear the decks.

21:31.753 --> 21:33.462
And my head.

21:41.013 --> 21:44.056
l'm coming for you tonight, Little Chino.

21:44.182 --> 21:46.267
And this time there won't be any screw-ups.

21:46.393 --> 21:51.397
Just slam in your CO2 cartridge here,
put in your tranq dart and let her rip.

21:51.523 --> 21:54.108
Wham, bam, lights fuckin' out.

21:55.610 --> 21:58.237
So, 'gators giving you trouble, Dex?

21:58.363 --> 22:00.781
They ate my puppy.

22:02.909 --> 22:07.580
This sucker, you load her up right,
she'll take down a goddamn grizzly.

22:07.706 --> 22:10.374
Now, you may have to get closer
than you'd like.

22:10.500 --> 22:13.711
but she'll do the job, l promise you that.

22:13.837 --> 22:15.880
So which will it be?

22:18.091 --> 22:19.175
Both.

22:20.093 --> 22:21.635
Excellent.

23:03.470 --> 23:04.678
Oh, fuck!

23:04.805 --> 23:06.055
Oh, fuck.

23:08.725 --> 23:10.768
First time?

23:10.894 --> 23:12.603
Sort of.

23:12.729 --> 23:14.855
Yeah, l've been boxing since l was ten.

23:16.525 --> 23:18.943
- Tough neighborhood?
- Tough family.

23:20.278 --> 23:21.946
And those are just my sisters.

23:23.532 --> 23:26.075
Want some help?

23:26.201 --> 23:29.870
- l'm doing enough damage on my own.
- ls that a yes or a no?

23:32.290 --> 23:34.458
That was a yes. lt sounded like a no,

23:34.584 --> 23:36.127
but. . .

23:36.253 --> 23:37.294
Yeah. Yeah.

23:38.630 --> 23:40.297
Good answer.

23:45.971 --> 23:47.221
First. . .

23:49.391 --> 23:53.185
you need to wrap your wrists
so you don't hurt yourself again.

24:00.944 --> 24:02.153
l'm. . .

24:04.156 --> 24:05.156
l'm sorry.

24:20.881 --> 24:22.506
Yo, Deb!

24:29.181 --> 24:31.265
You scared the shit out of me.

24:32.809 --> 24:35.227
How are you doing?

24:35.353 --> 24:37.438
How am l doing?

24:37.564 --> 24:39.690
l saw the man l thought l loved. . .

24:40.734 --> 24:42.234
No, did love,

24:42.360 --> 24:45.279
up on some goddamn screen
with a gallery full of women

24:45.405 --> 24:47.072
that he murdered and cut into pieces.

24:47.199 --> 24:49.200
- Deb, l. . .
- Don't.

24:49.326 --> 24:51.410
You fuckin' asked.

24:53.038 --> 24:54.914
So, how am l doing?

24:56.041 --> 24:57.708
l'm just fine.

25:16.394 --> 25:19.104
l might be playing fast and loose
with my father's code,

25:19.231 --> 25:21.899
but l don't think Harry would disapprove...

25:22.025 --> 25:24.443
considering.

25:25.737 --> 25:27.863
Attaboy, Chino, a little closer.

25:33.745 --> 25:38.249
Come on, don"t get the shakes now,
this is no time for performance anxiety.

25:57.435 --> 25:58.978
l've been waiting for you.

26:01.606 --> 26:03.649
Take him! Tommy!

26:03.775 --> 26:06.193
l'll get his ass!

26:15.620 --> 26:18.831
No, no, no! l don't know
where the fuck he is!

26:34.306 --> 26:38.058
We're out here all night long if we have to.
You find him. OK?

26:41.479 --> 26:44.231
What the hell is wrong with me?

26:51.072 --> 26:53.824
Dexter, someone's coming.

27:07.172 --> 27:09.715
lt's OK, l got you.

27:09.841 --> 27:11.550
Please don't hurt us!

27:11.676 --> 27:14.178
God. Oh, my God.

27:21.019 --> 27:24.855
No! Dexter, don't leave me!

27:26.858 --> 27:28.984
Biney!

27:30.612 --> 27:32.571
Don't leave me!

27:32.697 --> 27:35.324
Dexter, please don't leave me!

27:36.368 --> 27:37.743
Biney!

27:38.870 --> 27:41.372
Biney! Biney!

27:44.209 --> 27:46.585
Brian, my brother.

27:52.884 --> 27:54.760
Somebody must have seen something.

27:54.886 --> 27:57.054
Seeing and talking are two different things.

27:57.180 --> 28:00.015
- You want me to knock on some doors?
- Or maybe some heads.

28:00.141 --> 28:01.767
Sorry l'm late.

28:01.893 --> 28:04.478
What fucking asshole left this here?

28:04.604 --> 28:08.232
lt's Special Agent Fucking Asshole.

28:09.859 --> 28:12.695
- Morgan, right?
- We got witnesses to interview.

28:13.863 --> 28:15.614
You seen my brother?

28:15.740 --> 28:17.282
Oh. Excuse me.

28:32.048 --> 28:34.550
Excuse me. sir.
Do you have a minute?

28:34.676 --> 28:37.136
Or three. Good tea takes time.

28:37.971 --> 28:41.640
- What's up, Sergeant?
- lt's about your task force.

28:41.766 --> 28:43.684
l think l can bring something to it, sir.

28:44.769 --> 28:46.937
l've looked into your jacket, Sergeant.

28:47.063 --> 28:49.148
You've done some fine work
here in Homicide.

28:49.274 --> 28:51.650
- Miami Metro's lucky to have you.
- Thank you. sir.

28:51.776 --> 28:54.153
But l don't think
you'd be a good fit for my team.

28:55.280 --> 28:58.991
- l thought you just said l was qualified.
- l said you'd done fine work in Homicide.

28:59.117 --> 29:02.953
Frankly. sergeant. you're more
of a leader than a team member.

29:03.079 --> 29:06.081
l'm not convinced you play well with others.

29:08.251 --> 29:10.335
Excuse me.

29:16.593 --> 29:18.302
Can somebody clean this shit up?

29:20.972 --> 29:23.807
l feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece

29:23.933 --> 29:26.810
and l"m not even sure
what the picture should be.

29:29.355 --> 29:32.274
l've been calling you for hours.

29:34.903 --> 29:36.737
Kind of pulled an all-nighter.

29:36.863 --> 29:39.198
Dexter, l called the station.

29:39.324 --> 29:41.074
l was off the clock.

29:41.201 --> 29:42.868
lt's this huge case l'm working.

29:42.994 --> 29:44.828
lt's. . .

29:44.954 --> 29:47.873
lt's taking me to places
l never thought l'd go.

29:51.503 --> 29:52.961
What?

29:54.005 --> 29:59.468
l've been thinking a lot about Paul's death and
how l'm gonna deal with it.

30:00.845 --> 30:02.554
- And?
- First of all,

30:02.680 --> 30:04.973
l'm not gonna let the county bury him.

30:05.099 --> 30:08.602
l'm using the insurance money
to give Paul a proper funeral. lt's in an hour.

30:08.728 --> 30:10.854
Rita, Paul was such a. . .

30:11.856 --> 30:14.775
. . .destructive force,
why can't you just put him behind you?

30:14.901 --> 30:16.443
lt's about saying goodbye.

30:16.569 --> 30:20.781
Goodbye to him and the grip
he had on my life. lt's called moving on.

30:24.118 --> 30:26.578
Go clean yourself up.
The kids are expecting you.

30:26.704 --> 30:28.747
- l'm just gonna make you late.
- Damn it, Dexter!

30:28.873 --> 30:32.084
l need you there too.
You have no idea what this feels like.

30:42.345 --> 30:44.263
Just give me ten minutes.

30:48.226 --> 30:50.686
Can't wait to get another door
slammed in my face.

30:50.812 --> 30:54.481
Yeah. lf l lived in this neighborhood,
l wouldn't talk to the cops either.

30:54.607 --> 30:56.275
Brave guy like you?

30:56.401 --> 30:59.736
lt's about survival.
These people have families, kids.

30:59.863 --> 31:03.532
lt's not easy to talk when you got the 29th
Street Kings playing whack the witness.

31:03.658 --> 31:06.535
- lt just takes one, right?
- That's it.

31:06.661 --> 31:10.455
Put that out into the universe. Right?

31:13.626 --> 31:16.837
- Miami Metro. Can we talk to you?
- Go to hell!

31:17.672 --> 31:21.091
OK, but before we do that, ma'am,
can l ask you a few questions?

31:21.217 --> 31:25.512
- How many is a few?
- Three. But one's a two-parter.

31:25.638 --> 31:29.766
- Go away before l call the police!
- We are the fucking police!

31:31.895 --> 31:34.396
l ain't talking to no one!

31:34.522 --> 31:36.773
- Look at the bright side.
- What bright side?

31:36.900 --> 31:39.526
Karmically, we're batting 1 ,000.

31:39.652 --> 31:43.322
There's something balancing
about that kind of consistency.

31:45.325 --> 31:46.742
God damn it!

31:47.368 --> 31:48.452
Morgan!

31:58.004 --> 32:00.047
Aw, shit.

32:17.231 --> 32:21.276
You think you can spray-paint your gang crap
on a police car and get away with it?

32:21.402 --> 32:24.363
Get off! Unless you want to fuck me
like you fucked the lce-Truck Killer!

32:24.489 --> 32:26.490
You gangbanging-wannabe piece of shit!

32:26.616 --> 32:28.659
No, please.

32:28.785 --> 32:31.244
l'll tell you where the shit is,
the drugs and shit.

32:31.371 --> 32:33.622
- Please don't shoot me, miss.
- Morgan!

32:52.433 --> 32:54.601
lf l believed in God,

32:54.727 --> 32:56.979
if l believed in sin,

32:57.105 --> 33:00.440
this is the place where
l'd be sucked straight to hell...

33:02.193 --> 33:05.028
if I beIieved in heII.

33:11.077 --> 33:13.078
Come on, Dexter. lt's all right.

33:27.510 --> 33:30.554
But that is not the entire story
of who this man was.

33:31.681 --> 33:35.392
Born into innocence
as are all of God's children. . .

33:35.518 --> 33:39.271
. . .are truly the living personification
of God's...

33:39.397 --> 33:43.066
. . .through the magic of family,
giving love and receiving love,

33:43.192 --> 33:44.985
that he truly flourished.

33:45.111 --> 33:49.072
lt was with his children
that he, for all his blemishes,

33:49.198 --> 33:51.783
re-embraced the perfect innocence.

33:51.909 --> 33:57.456
And it was through his children that once again
God smiled on Paul Bennett.

33:58.708 --> 34:02.878
And now the family will come forward
for a few moments of silent prayer.

34:22.607 --> 34:24.691
l hope you found your peace, Paul.

34:38.289 --> 34:40.457
Bye, Dad.

35:01.646 --> 35:04.523
l'm so sorry for your loss.

35:05.316 --> 35:07.192
Thank you. . .

35:07.318 --> 35:08.485
Father.

35:11.280 --> 35:12.948
l'm not sorry.

35:14.117 --> 35:16.201
You're still here.

35:16.327 --> 35:17.702
Never left.

35:17.829 --> 35:19.996
Yeah, you did. l killed you.

35:20.123 --> 35:22.624
No. You just took my life.

35:28.005 --> 35:30.382
So how do l make you go away?

35:33.010 --> 35:36.972
Well. you could try doing
what these people are doing.

35:38.474 --> 35:40.350
l'm not like them.

35:48.442 --> 35:51.278
Well. if it helps.
l can tell you it's not your fault,

35:51.404 --> 35:53.280
what you did to me.

35:53.406 --> 35:54.948
l never said it was.

35:55.074 --> 35:56.283
But you feel it.

35:57.285 --> 35:59.953
How do you know that?

36:00.079 --> 36:01.621
lt's human nature.

36:03.416 --> 36:04.916
l'm not human.

36:05.042 --> 36:06.209
No.

36:07.545 --> 36:09.671
You're just fucked up.

36:22.101 --> 36:23.727
l need to let you go.

36:27.565 --> 36:29.399
You think it's as simple as that?

36:35.990 --> 36:37.240
Nothing's simple.

36:39.911 --> 36:42.245
Does this mean you'll be my dad now?

37:06.604 --> 37:09.105
- 29th Street Kings?
- Yeah, we got 'em.

37:09.232 --> 37:12.234
SWAT did a sweep on some auto shop those
animals were using as a front.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.110
Maybe we didn't get them on murder,

37:14.237 --> 37:17.739
but we busted their asses on drugs, weapons
and money laundering.

37:17.865 --> 37:21.201
Half of them are three-strikers.
so they're gonna go away forever.

37:21.327 --> 37:23.411
Thanks to Officer Morgan.

37:34.674 --> 37:37.175
Hey, something you should know.

37:37.301 --> 37:40.762
Deb pulled her gun on an unarmed boy
to get him to give up the gang,

37:40.888 --> 37:43.014
some kid named Joey Nunez.

37:43.140 --> 37:45.517
- Thanks, Angel, l'll talk to her.
- All right.

37:45.643 --> 37:49.229
l'll give her one thing. though.
she's in motherfucking good shape.

37:49.355 --> 37:50.814
Here comes another one.

37:52.525 --> 37:54.192
Did we get Little Chino too?

37:54.318 --> 37:56.444
That cocksucker wasn't there.

37:57.863 --> 37:59.781
That's too bad.

38:02.493 --> 38:04.786
- What you got?
- None of your business.

38:14.171 --> 38:15.088
Yeah.

38:15.214 --> 38:18.049
Excuse me, Esmee,
l opened this by mistake.

38:18.175 --> 38:19.718
lt said Lieutenant.

38:19.844 --> 38:21.386
No worries.

38:21.512 --> 38:24.097
Today, Maria, it is all about the win.

38:24.223 --> 38:26.308
l think we really should enjoy this.

38:27.435 --> 38:30.729
Stop me if you think l'm speaking out of turn or
above my station.

38:30.855 --> 38:35.608
but we really don't use department resources
around here for personal matters.

38:35.735 --> 38:38.695
- What are you talking about?
- Well, let's, for argument's sake,

38:38.821 --> 38:41.406
say those phone records
belong to your fiance.

38:42.283 --> 38:45.869
lt could open up a shit-ugly can of worms you
might not be able to close.

38:46.996 --> 38:49.039
Only if someone mentions it.

38:51.542 --> 38:53.960
This is me not mentioning it.

38:57.506 --> 38:59.841
Maria.

39:00.676 --> 39:02.719
l'm new at this,

39:02.845 --> 39:06.639
this. . .not trusting the man
that l thought that l loved. . .

39:06.766 --> 39:08.099
and. . .

39:08.225 --> 39:11.936
l really appreciate your support.

39:26.327 --> 39:28.078
Hey, Deb, it's me.

39:28.204 --> 39:29.120
Again.

39:29.246 --> 39:31.122
You're probably at the gym.

39:31.248 --> 39:32.290
Again.

39:32.416 --> 39:35.001
l got some unfinished business
outside the office.

39:35.127 --> 39:39.547
l'll probably be a little late tonight.
l'll catch up with you later.

41:46.467 --> 41:48.927
lt was simple, really.

41:49.053 --> 41:52.430
All l had to do was put myself
into the mind of a killer,

41:52.556 --> 41:54.516
hardly a stretch.

41:54.642 --> 41:58.019
lt was only a matter of time
before Little Chino went after Joey Nunez

41:58.145 --> 41:59.729
for snitching him out.

42:07.988 --> 42:10.198
Here's hoping l'm back on my game.

42:37.393 --> 42:40.520
Trust me, you're not
going anywhere this time.

42:40.646 --> 42:42.480
Who the fuck are you?

42:42.606 --> 42:43.815
Now. . .

42:43.941 --> 42:48.111
that kind of talk is just gonna bring you closer
to your victims.

42:52.616 --> 42:54.576
Are you a cop?

42:54.702 --> 42:56.786
'Cause l was cleared on that bitch.

42:58.539 --> 43:02.250
No, maybe you didn't do the deed,
but her blood is on your hands.

43:05.254 --> 43:06.921
A lot of blood is on your hands.

43:11.218 --> 43:12.969
What do you care about these people?

43:16.473 --> 43:17.515
Actually. . .

43:17.641 --> 43:19.726
Agh! Fuck. Fu. . .

43:19.977 --> 43:22.061
. . . l don't.

43:22.855 --> 43:25.481
Why are you doing this to me?

43:28.986 --> 43:32.822
l'm not so much doing this to you
as l'm doing it for me.

43:50.382 --> 43:51.883
l never killed no kid.

43:52.009 --> 43:54.510
But you killed most of her.

43:55.596 --> 43:57.013
Her mother.

43:58.349 --> 44:00.266
Her brother.

44:02.102 --> 44:04.187
Her innocence.

44:06.649 --> 44:09.359
You leave pain wherever you go.

44:14.198 --> 44:15.907
You kill me. . .

44:16.909 --> 44:19.243
what do you leave behind?

44:19.370 --> 44:20.828
A world without you.

44:21.914 --> 44:23.998
Look at that. Steady as a surgeon.

44:54.822 --> 44:58.658
This kill was just the first of the loose ends
I needed to tie off.

44:58.784 --> 45:01.994
I aIso found a newer,
safer place to dump my trash.

45:03.038 --> 45:04.872
Moving at over four miles an hour,

45:04.998 --> 45:08.626
the GuIf Stream is one of the world's
most powerful deepwater currents.

45:08.752 --> 45:11.671
This time tomorrow,
LittIe Chino wiII be north of PaIm Beach.

45:12.506 --> 45:15.299
After that, it's on to Georgia, South Carolina,

45:15.426 --> 45:17.969
North Carolina, until eventually...

45:19.179 --> 45:22.849
Well, let"s just say,
the North Atlantic's a pretty big place.

45:38.407 --> 45:39.365
Hey, you.

45:39.491 --> 45:42.535
- l need to see you.
- l was just dropping somebody off.

45:42.661 --> 45:44.871
- Can it wait?
- No, it can't.

45:45.998 --> 45:48.082
All right, then.

46:01.847 --> 46:03.890
A shoe?

46:05.934 --> 46:08.019
You wanted to see me about a shoe?

46:10.189 --> 46:12.023
lt's Paul's shoe.

46:17.905 --> 46:19.030
OK.

46:22.618 --> 46:24.076
What do we do with it?

46:27.039 --> 46:29.457
Paul kept insisting to me

46:29.583 --> 46:32.585
that you knocked him over the head,

46:32.711 --> 46:36.088
dragged him to his motel
and shot him up with drugs.

46:39.426 --> 46:42.261
Sounds like one of his stories, huh?

46:43.472 --> 46:46.724
He asked me to look in the yard
for his shoe.

46:46.850 --> 46:48.893
Finally, l did.

46:51.021 --> 46:53.064
- Maybe. . .
- No, let me finish, Dexter.

46:56.819 --> 47:01.239
l didn't have a lot to hope for until l met you.

47:03.492 --> 47:06.118
You gave me something to believe in

47:06.245 --> 47:08.871
when l didn't even believe in myself.

47:10.624 --> 47:12.291
And maybe l was. . .

47:12.417 --> 47:15.586
maybe l was so desperate
that l looked the other way.

47:17.047 --> 47:20.424
Paul begged me to help him.

47:21.552 --> 47:23.177
And what did l do?

47:23.303 --> 47:25.304
l hung up on him.

47:25.430 --> 47:28.099
And he was so upset.
he got into a prison fight,

47:28.225 --> 47:30.309
and he was beaten to death with a pipe.

47:30.435 --> 47:32.645
That's not your fault.

47:32.771 --> 47:34.438
Part of it is.

47:35.858 --> 47:39.902
Part of me believes that,
with all of Paul's flaws. . .

47:41.280 --> 47:43.197
he paid the price for my dreams.

47:54.668 --> 47:56.544
Did you attack him, Dexter?

47:59.131 --> 48:01.424
l'd understand if you did.
He attacked me.

48:11.143 --> 48:13.811
l hit Paul to protect you and the kids.

48:16.940 --> 48:18.774
lt was totally an act of impulse.

48:20.527 --> 48:25.323
OK.

48:30.787 --> 48:32.663
Where did you get the drugs?

48:37.210 --> 48:39.211
Stolen from the evidence locker.

48:45.677 --> 48:49.347
Wait.

48:49.473 --> 48:50.723
Wait, you mean. . .

48:51.767 --> 48:53.893
First you tell me that you. . .

48:54.019 --> 48:56.604
acted on impulse,

48:56.730 --> 49:00.900
and then you tell me that you stole the drugs
from your police station?

49:02.194 --> 49:06.405
l mean, what are you trying to say?
That you planned on acting on impulse?

49:06.531 --> 49:10.618
- lt's all kind of jumbled now.
- How did you know how to cook the heroin?

49:10.744 --> 49:14.413
How did you know what dose
to give a big guy like Paul?

49:23.173 --> 49:25.257
Oh, my God.

49:25.384 --> 49:27.468
Oh, my God, why didn't l see this?

49:29.513 --> 49:30.930
They were your drugs.

49:31.056 --> 49:32.974
Now it makes sense.

49:33.100 --> 49:37.687
That's where you disappear to at all hours
of the night like Clark fucking Kent.

49:40.148 --> 49:42.358
Look, if there is anything left between us,

49:42.484 --> 49:46.404
you will answer me this one question
and you will tell me the truth.

49:49.116 --> 49:51.409
Are you an addict?

50:04.423 --> 50:06.090
Yes, l have an addiction.

50:17.394 --> 50:19.103
Oh, Dexter.

50:22.649 --> 50:23.649
That's good.

50:23.775 --> 50:27.236
That's the first step,
admitting you have a problem.

50:28.030 --> 50:29.864
We'll get you into a program.

50:29.990 --> 50:32.491
We'll get you the help you need.

50:32.617 --> 50:34.577
And l will be there for you.

50:45.338 --> 50:48.591
lf the eyes are the windows to the soul,

50:48.717 --> 50:51.469
then grief is the door.

50:53.346 --> 50:58.184
As long as it's closed, it's the barrier between
knowing and not knowing.

50:59.603 --> 51:02.354
Walk away from it
and it stays closed forever.

51:03.648 --> 51:05.733
But open it and walk through it...

51:07.486 --> 51:09.779
and pain becomes truth.

51:15.368 --> 51:18.370
And now l'm faced with the struggle
for my own survival

51:18.497 --> 51:20.539
that l always knew was coming.

51:27.881 --> 51:30.800
l've been preparing for this my entire life.

51:33.845 --> 51:35.638
When all is said and done, Chino,

51:35.764 --> 51:37.890
you're the same size as everyone else.

51:43.355 --> 51:45.648
Hey, Dex, what the fuck?

51:46.733 --> 51:48.818
Hold on, l'm coming!

51:56.493 --> 51:57.993
lt's annoying, isn't it?

51:58.120 --> 52:00.287
l'm not taking the bait.

52:04.251 --> 52:06.252
- You're up late.
- Yeah, just surfing.

52:06.378 --> 52:08.129
You go to the gym?

52:09.589 --> 52:12.383
Then l was sort of driving around.

52:12.509 --> 52:14.718
Around what?

52:14.845 --> 52:16.929
Around town.

52:18.056 --> 52:20.015
- Because?
- l saw some buildings

52:20.142 --> 52:22.977
with some "For rent" signs.
l'm gonna check 'em out.

52:25.438 --> 52:28.274
Then Chez Dexter can return to its original,

52:28.400 --> 52:32.069
semi-lived-in, museum-quality state.

52:33.238 --> 52:36.031
- Deb, you don't need to do this.
- Yes, l do.

52:36.158 --> 52:37.658
You don't need to do this now.

52:37.784 --> 52:40.619
Well, what about the video tours
of eligible apartments?

52:40.745 --> 52:42.872
Temporary insanity.

52:46.168 --> 52:47.293
You sure?

52:50.297 --> 52:52.089
No. Get out.

52:53.884 --> 52:55.593
Asshole.

52:55.719 --> 52:59.430
This way l can take care of my sister
the way Harry would have wanted.

53:00.765 --> 53:02.349
You really reek.

53:05.353 --> 53:08.397
You're right. Like a fuckin' sewer.

53:14.029 --> 53:15.487
For every door that closes...

53:15.614 --> 53:16.947
Fuck.

53:18.116 --> 53:19.658
Sorry.

53:25.081 --> 53:27.166
lt was always right there.

53:29.920 --> 53:33.005
l had to say goodbye in order to reconnect

53:33.131 --> 53:35.966
with what's really important...

53:36.927 --> 53:38.719
with who I was...

53:41.473 --> 53:43.682
with who I have to be.

54:31.606 --> 54:33.190
Rest in peace.

54:43.410 --> 54:44.868
l am.
