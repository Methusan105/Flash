WEBVTT

00:02.549 --> 00:04.216
Previously on Dexter...

00:04.342 --> 00:06.552
l was working on my piece
with the blowtorch,

00:06.678 --> 00:08.721
and it just caught fire, l was so scared.

00:09.055 --> 00:13.434
We could always get in the car
and pass the time like we used to.

00:13.560 --> 00:15.144
You're giving Doakes to the press?

00:15.270 --> 00:16.770
He is not your man.

00:16.896 --> 00:19.732
Your credibility was compromised
when you failed to report a phone call

00:19.858 --> 00:22.401
from the subject
of a goddamn FBl manhunt.

00:22.527 --> 00:24.486
Who joined who
in the shower this morning?

00:24.612 --> 00:26.947
How about. in the future.
l set the alarm ten minutes earlier?

00:27.073 --> 00:29.408
The future, l'm liking the sound of that.

00:29.534 --> 00:33.579
A woman named Lila Tournay has filed
sexual-assault charges against him.

00:33.705 --> 00:34.913
That fucking bitch.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.874
l could lose everything over this.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.084
Lila, why can't you just let me go?

00:39.210 --> 00:41.170
Because l'm your real soul mate.

00:44.716 --> 00:45.883
Not Rita.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.848
Jesus fucking Christ,
you're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

00:52.974 --> 00:55.017
l really hate that name.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.146
What's it gonna be, Morgan?

00:59.272 --> 01:00.689
Kill me now or set me free!

01:00.815 --> 01:03.025
Don't worry, l'll send the FBl
your way soon enough.

01:03.151 --> 01:04.526
You're still gonna try to frame me?

01:04.652 --> 01:07.696
Mission accomplished.
One more naiI in Doakes' coffin.

01:07.822 --> 01:10.657
- We got him.
- So you have a tip, not Doakes?

01:10.784 --> 01:12.993
Our target was headed
into the Everglades.

01:13.119 --> 01:16.580
We will have the son of a bitch
in handcuffs in 24 hours.

01:17.624 --> 01:20.000
Do not ever go to Rita's house again.

01:20.126 --> 01:23.003
Stay away from Rita.

01:23.129 --> 01:24.922
Stay away from me.

01:25.048 --> 01:28.258
Whether you leave on your own
or immigration hauls your sorry ass away,

01:28.384 --> 01:29.593
l don't give a shit.

01:29.719 --> 01:34.389
But l don't want to give you one more day
to fuck with the people l care about.

01:36.768 --> 01:39.269
Previous destinations...

01:39.395 --> 01:42.314
- They found Doakes' fucking rental car.
- Did they find Doakes?

01:42.440 --> 01:44.858
No, not yet.
But the search grid's closing in.

01:44.984 --> 01:46.944
Hey!

01:47.237 --> 01:49.321
Who's out there?
Anybody out there?

01:49.948 --> 01:52.574
You have arrived at your destination.

01:52.700 --> 01:54.493
Somebody in there?

03:58.243 --> 04:00.452
Hello? Who's out there?

04:07.126 --> 04:08.835
l need some help!

04:09.754 --> 04:11.880
Get me out of here!

04:13.549 --> 04:14.925
Who are you?

04:15.051 --> 04:18.470
Just open the door!
l'm being held captive.

04:29.399 --> 04:32.359
Leave the mess for once.
Walk away from the mess.

04:32.485 --> 04:33.860
You know l can't do that.

04:33.987 --> 04:37.364
Lundy's mobilizing every agency
in five counties. We're closing in.

04:37.490 --> 04:39.408
You have a rental car.
you don't have Doakes.

04:39.534 --> 04:41.201
God, come on.

04:41.327 --> 04:43.120
l'm only helpful if there's blood.

04:43.246 --> 04:44.454
Maybe we'll shoot him.

04:44.580 --> 04:46.248
Then you'll need a paramedic, not me.

04:46.374 --> 04:48.875
Are you afraid to face Doakes?

04:49.002 --> 04:51.628
Yes, of course l'm afraid to face him.

04:51.754 --> 04:53.005
And l have dishes to do.

04:53.131 --> 04:54.965
Fine, l'll let you know when it's over.

04:57.719 --> 05:00.053
lt's Doakes. You fucking hate the guy.

05:00.179 --> 05:01.221
l used to.

05:01.347 --> 05:04.725
l can't even afford to think of him
as a person any more.

05:05.935 --> 05:07.686
Would you get going?

05:07.812 --> 05:09.271
l tried.

05:11.524 --> 05:13.233
lf they find Doakes in a cage,

05:13.359 --> 05:15.569
it will seriously undermine my frame job.

05:18.323 --> 05:20.574
I need to beat them to that cabin.

05:29.917 --> 05:33.378
Waiting out there in the Everglades
are hordes of county sheriffs,

05:33.504 --> 05:35.881
search parties, and ravenous reptiles.

05:36.966 --> 05:38.925
And in this corner, wearing dark trunks,

05:39.052 --> 05:40.719
the mighty Dexter.

05:48.186 --> 05:49.603
Drive much?

05:55.026 --> 05:56.610
I need a miracIe.

06:04.369 --> 06:08.080
There's a switch,
right behind you on the wall.

06:11.918 --> 06:14.961
God damn, it's good
to see another face.

06:15.088 --> 06:16.254
l never thought l would.

06:18.591 --> 06:22.094
l'm Sergeant James Doakes,
Miami Metro Homicide.

06:23.262 --> 06:24.304
Who put you in there?

06:24.430 --> 06:26.807
A fucking psycho.

06:26.933 --> 06:29.476
And he could be back any minute.

06:30.561 --> 06:33.146
Grab that key
right behind you on the wall.

06:33.272 --> 06:34.856
Who is he?

06:34.982 --> 06:36.274
His name is Dexter Morgan.

06:38.403 --> 06:40.195
l need you to open this gate.

06:41.447 --> 06:43.156
Why would he do that,
put you in there?

06:43.282 --> 06:45.659
Because l found out he's
the Bay Harbor Butcher.

06:45.785 --> 06:48.036
Please, just open this fucking gate!

06:48.162 --> 06:50.622
He's. . .the B. . . Butcher?

06:51.666 --> 06:54.209
That's what l've been trying to tell you.

06:54.335 --> 06:56.128
What's in there?

06:56.254 --> 06:58.880
Exactly what you think it is.

06:59.006 --> 07:02.175
lt's evidence, and l saw it happen.

07:02.301 --> 07:04.553
l really need to get out of this cage, lady.

07:06.722 --> 07:09.182
Poor thing, all alone.

07:10.309 --> 07:12.644
l'm OK. Just open the gate.

07:12.770 --> 07:15.480
Not you, Dexter.

07:17.775 --> 07:20.360
Hiding such an enormous secret.

07:20.903 --> 07:22.404
What a burden that's got to be.

07:22.530 --> 07:25.198
No wonder he is so shut down.

07:26.534 --> 07:28.743
What are you, his accomplice?

07:33.207 --> 07:35.167
l'm his soul mate.

07:51.559 --> 07:54.019
You can't leave me in here like this.

07:54.145 --> 07:55.562
You'll be an accessory.

07:55.688 --> 07:57.564
l'm not gonna leave you. . .

07:59.525 --> 08:00.775
not like that.

08:03.696 --> 08:07.032
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

08:07.158 --> 08:08.742
No! Turn that off!

08:08.868 --> 08:11.453
No! Do you understand? This is murder!

08:11.579 --> 08:13.246
Open this fucking door!

08:13.372 --> 08:16.124
This is fucking murder!

09:21.566 --> 09:24.359
Hey. Dexter Morgan.
Miami Metro PD Forensics.

09:24.485 --> 09:27.487
l'm here to join the search
for the Bay Harbor Butcher.

09:27.613 --> 09:31.157
The search is on hold right now
until they sort out the confusion.

09:31.284 --> 09:32.367
Confusion, huh?

09:32.493 --> 09:33.994
Yeah. lt's a real mess.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.495
Take a right at the fork.

09:35.621 --> 09:38.081
Park outside the line of fire trucks.

09:40.167 --> 09:42.377
Confusion requires fire trucks?

10:00.813 --> 10:02.731
When something beyond reason happens,

10:02.857 --> 10:05.817
it turns skeptics into believers -

10:06.902 --> 10:09.195
believers in a higher power.

10:11.907 --> 10:15.035
But what kind of power did this?

10:21.459 --> 10:25.045
How the hell did you get here so fast?
l just got here in a helicopter with Lundy.

10:25.171 --> 10:27.464
l broke a lot of speed limits.

10:27.590 --> 10:31.843
After you left, l realized you were right.
l didn't want to miss the action.

10:32.887 --> 10:34.304
What happened?

10:34.430 --> 10:37.140
They think a propane tank exploded.

10:38.392 --> 10:40.101
How?

10:40.227 --> 10:42.687
Do l look like a fucking fire chief?

10:45.399 --> 10:47.525
Did they find a body?

10:48.527 --> 10:50.570
Just bits and pieces so far.

10:55.868 --> 10:58.745
Was it spontaneous combustion?

10:58.871 --> 11:01.081
Divine intervention?

11:01.207 --> 11:02.999
lf you believe that God makes miracles,

11:03.125 --> 11:06.753
you have to wonder if Satan
has a few up his sleeve.

11:06.879 --> 11:11.049
But when you don't believe in anything,
who do you thank at a time like this?

11:30.778 --> 11:32.195
We got a floater!

12:08.315 --> 12:11.651
We got lift-off and separation. . .

12:13.446 --> 12:14.654
Gaping areas of. . .

12:14.780 --> 12:18.324
pulpified tissue. . .

12:18.451 --> 12:20.785
extensive fourth-degree burns.

12:22.496 --> 12:25.665
Big-ass fucking explosion.

12:25.791 --> 12:28.084
What else can you give us?

12:29.128 --> 12:32.255
These linear lines
around his eyes are unburned.

12:32.381 --> 12:36.092
He was squinting,
alive when it happened.

12:36.677 --> 12:37.761
What else?

12:40.639 --> 12:41.598
Teeth are intact.

12:41.724 --> 12:44.309
Dental records should give us a positive lD.

12:44.894 --> 12:47.353
God damn it, Masuka. ls it Doakes?

12:48.439 --> 12:51.191
Male, African-American,

12:51.317 --> 12:54.194
about the right length torso. . .

12:54.612 --> 12:56.404
heavily muscled.

12:58.324 --> 13:00.158
l think it's him.

13:05.414 --> 13:09.042
These are the same kind of tools
that scuba-dive class found.

13:09.168 --> 13:12.003
He'd need them
to make cuts that clean.

13:12.129 --> 13:13.755
Those come from the suspect?

13:13.881 --> 13:16.800
No, they belong to a second body.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.718
And whoever he was, he was. . .

13:18.844 --> 13:21.054
dead and dismembered
before the explosion.

13:21.180 --> 13:23.389
So this is where the Butcher
did his dirty work.

13:23.516 --> 13:25.975
lt's a perfect location for a kill room.

13:26.101 --> 13:28.269
lt doesn't get any more remote than this.

13:28.395 --> 13:29.479
No, it couldn't.

13:29.605 --> 13:31.064
This is good news, gentlemen.

13:31.190 --> 13:33.191
And lady.

13:33.317 --> 13:34.317
Right.

13:34.443 --> 13:35.777
All right, we keep the search on

13:35.903 --> 13:39.197
till we get a firm lD
on that body in the water.

13:41.534 --> 13:42.575
You agree with them?

13:44.370 --> 13:46.913
The evidence is compelling.

13:47.039 --> 13:49.290
Overwhelming, actually.

13:51.961 --> 13:54.170
l guess we got our man.

13:54.296 --> 13:57.048
Oh, shit. LaGuerta's here.

13:58.384 --> 14:00.552
Lieutenant. . .

14:01.637 --> 14:03.596
l wouldn't if l were you.

14:03.722 --> 14:05.807
ls it James?

14:07.977 --> 14:09.936
They don't know yet.

14:11.021 --> 14:13.690
Apparently miracles are subjective.

14:13.816 --> 14:15.650
l can't exactly feel LaGuerta's pain

14:15.776 --> 14:17.402
but l can appreciate it.

14:17.528 --> 14:19.487
Doakes wasn't so bad in the end.

14:20.072 --> 14:21.322
But the truly tragic thing

14:21.448 --> 14:23.616
would be to let his sacrifice go to waste.

14:24.493 --> 14:27.412
There's only one way
I can think of to honor him.

14:27.538 --> 14:29.998
l have to embrace my freedom.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.596
SIeep. What a concept.

14:46.348 --> 14:50.351
l can"t believe l actually
contemplated turning myself in.

14:53.856 --> 14:56.691
This is so much better than a prison cell.

15:01.906 --> 15:03.781
l can squeeze fresh orange juice...

15:04.825 --> 15:07.452
Savor a fine French roast...

15:11.498 --> 15:14.083
grab a morning workout.

15:14.835 --> 15:18.546
OK, working out l could have
done in prison, but still...

15:19.798 --> 15:21.466
I'm free.

15:36.148 --> 15:38.608
- Dexter?
- sorry.

15:38.734 --> 15:40.109
Hope l didn't scare you.

15:40.235 --> 15:41.819
What are you doing out there?

15:42.988 --> 15:46.824
Well, l figured the kids were still asleep.
l didn't want to ring the bell.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.661
Why are you here?

15:51.330 --> 15:54.666
Well, l figured the kids were still asleep.

16:21.986 --> 16:23.361
That was. . .

16:23.487 --> 16:25.154
unexpected.

16:27.157 --> 16:30.368
Yeah, l wound up with some
unexpected time on my hands.

16:30.494 --> 16:33.204
Like 20 years to life.

16:35.249 --> 16:38.001
l don't know if this is a good idea, Dexter.

16:39.169 --> 16:43.840
l was just getting used to you
from a distance.

16:43.966 --> 16:46.300
l know. You've been like a mirage.

16:48.387 --> 16:51.180
l've been right here.

16:51.306 --> 16:53.182
You're the one that went away.

16:54.226 --> 16:56.269
Yeah, l did.

16:57.730 --> 16:59.814
l kind of forgot who l was.

17:02.651 --> 17:04.902
l got it straight now.

17:06.113 --> 17:07.655
Well, keep it straight,

17:07.781 --> 17:10.241
or l won't be here next time.

17:10.367 --> 17:11.909
l know that.

17:14.663 --> 17:16.414
Mom!

17:16.957 --> 17:18.624
lt's the sex police.

17:22.296 --> 17:23.546
How come you're still in bed?

17:23.672 --> 17:24.964
l overslept.

17:25.090 --> 17:27.800
Will you make us pancakes, please?

17:29.053 --> 17:30.386
What's under there?

17:40.064 --> 17:42.440
- Hi.
- Hi, Dexter.

17:44.276 --> 17:45.693
Are you guys back together?

17:47.571 --> 17:49.781
l guess we are.

18:15.099 --> 18:19.268
Over, under, over, under.

18:20.479 --> 18:22.855
- Maybe l should do it myself.
- No. l want to do it.

18:22.981 --> 18:23.940
We're gonna be late.

18:24.066 --> 18:26.025
So what? The case is closing.

18:26.151 --> 18:29.487
l know. We still need confirmation
on Doakes' body.

18:29.613 --> 18:31.072
And if it's him?

18:31.198 --> 18:32.448
Then it's over.

18:32.574 --> 18:34.242
The case, not us, right?

18:35.285 --> 18:39.122
We still have the wrap-up to do -
cataloguing. confirming.

18:39.248 --> 18:40.832
filing, more filing.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.291
So we've got time?

18:43.335 --> 18:44.794
Plenty.

18:52.678 --> 18:54.220
Time enough for a vacation?

18:54.346 --> 18:55.388
Now you're talking.

18:55.514 --> 18:59.100
Toes in the sand, tequila. . .

18:59.226 --> 19:01.018
little, teeny bikini.

19:02.187 --> 19:03.437
How about a parka?

19:05.357 --> 19:06.482
A what?

19:06.608 --> 19:08.609
l've had my fill of heat,

19:08.735 --> 19:10.236
no more heat.

19:10.362 --> 19:12.405
You'd look great in a parka.

19:12.531 --> 19:14.323
Ever heard of Lake lpperwash?

19:16.410 --> 19:17.577
Can't say that l have.

19:17.703 --> 19:20.705
Wonderful ice fishing, very romantic.

19:21.790 --> 19:23.499
Fine, book it.

19:24.168 --> 19:26.043
Let's just go.

19:30.549 --> 19:32.216
- Morning, Dex.
- Doughnut?

19:32.342 --> 19:34.927
l'm not really feeling like doughnuts.
Know what l mean?

19:35.053 --> 19:37.096
No.

19:40.350 --> 19:44.187
Oh, right.

19:44.313 --> 19:46.105
Mmm, doughnuts.

19:47.107 --> 19:48.316
Hey, are you free?

19:48.442 --> 19:50.526
- Oh, Vince, you have no idea.
- Good.

19:50.652 --> 19:53.654
l got a dozen boxes of burnt-up shit
from the cabin need cataloguing.

19:53.780 --> 19:54.822
Come on.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.039
- Lieutenant.
- Special Agent Lundy,

20:03.165 --> 20:04.540
l was just looking more closely

20:04.666 --> 20:07.752
at the dates of James'
special forces missions, and. . .

20:07.878 --> 20:09.378
We have a positive lD on the body.

20:09.504 --> 20:13.716
And there may be an additional date,
which puts him out of the country...

20:13.842 --> 20:16.385
The burn victim is Sergeant Doakes.

20:17.554 --> 20:19.263
Dental records confirmed it.

20:25.938 --> 20:28.105
And the other body?

20:28.232 --> 20:29.982
Jose Garza, a murder fugitive,

20:30.108 --> 20:32.944
who's been living
under the alias Chris Harlow.

20:33.862 --> 20:35.488
The body was dismembered,

20:35.614 --> 20:38.282
consistent with our other victims.

20:38.408 --> 20:41.285
Deputy Director Adams is closing the case.

20:42.371 --> 20:43.412
l see.

20:43.538 --> 20:46.457
Lieutenant. . .

20:46.583 --> 20:48.668
all the evidence
points to James Doakes

20:48.794 --> 20:50.878
as the Bay Harbor Butcher. . .

20:51.463 --> 20:52.755
conclusively.

20:56.093 --> 20:57.635
l wanted you to hear it from me first.

20:57.761 --> 21:01.597
- Thank you.
- l'm truly sorry.

21:24.371 --> 21:27.957
l don't know why they keep
hauling crap from the cabin in here.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.918
We already know
what we need to know.

21:31.044 --> 21:32.878
Doakes was a suicidal maniac.

21:33.005 --> 21:35.631
l believe the term is homicidal maniac,

21:35.757 --> 21:37.049
Not that l'm judging.

21:37.175 --> 21:38.634
Yeah, whatever, Morgan.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.012
He blew himself up.
That's all l'm saying.

21:41.138 --> 21:43.889
l thought l heard somebody say
it was a propane accident.

21:44.016 --> 21:47.768
Right. Doakes accidentally
turned on the propane valve,

21:47.894 --> 21:50.062
and then he accidentally
turned the stove on.

21:50.188 --> 21:51.981
The stove was on?

21:52.107 --> 21:55.818
lt was in the official
fire investigator's report this morning.

21:56.987 --> 21:59.071
l mean, l guess it could be

21:59.197 --> 22:02.450
that Doakes didn't realize
fire and gas are a bad combo,

22:02.576 --> 22:04.618
but my money's on suicide.

22:04.745 --> 22:09.206
A badass like Doakes
would rather burn than get burned.

22:10.167 --> 22:12.043
That's a good line for my movie.

22:12.169 --> 22:13.169
l better write it down.

22:13.295 --> 22:15.254
You're writing a movie about Doakes?

22:15.380 --> 22:16.756
Like you're not.

22:16.882 --> 22:19.925
He'd rather burn than get burned.
He'd rather burn than get burned.

22:20.052 --> 22:22.553
He'd rather burn than get burned.

22:46.078 --> 22:47.411
l just checked.

22:47.537 --> 22:49.872
l didn't see any GPS device
in the minivan. Dexter.

22:49.998 --> 22:51.248
Did you check the glove box?

22:51.375 --> 22:52.833
lt's grey, rectangular.

22:52.959 --> 22:55.336
lt's about the size
of a paperback book.

22:55.462 --> 22:58.089
No. it wasn't there.
l even looked under the seats.

22:58.215 --> 22:59.548
Do you think someone stole it?

22:59.674 --> 23:00.800
Maybe.

23:00.926 --> 23:03.552
Thanks, Rita. l'll see you tonight.

23:03.678 --> 23:05.012
lf someone stole my GPS,

23:05.138 --> 23:07.723
it would have led them straight to Doakes.

23:07.849 --> 23:11.268
Who do I know with
a nasty habit of stealing?

23:11.395 --> 23:13.104
LiIa...

23:13.855 --> 23:16.357
my miracle worker.

23:22.948 --> 23:25.616
lt looks peaceful in there.

23:26.827 --> 23:28.494
Doesn't it?

23:30.831 --> 23:32.581
l'm glad you called.

23:33.625 --> 23:36.794
l was afraid maybe you'd left town.

23:37.838 --> 23:39.797
lt seems l found a good reason to stay.

23:39.923 --> 23:41.340
Like what?

23:42.717 --> 23:44.135
A new victim?

23:49.307 --> 23:50.891
You mean you?

23:57.649 --> 23:59.817
That's why you asked
to meet at the aquarium,

23:59.943 --> 24:01.152
in a public place?

24:01.278 --> 24:02.653
You thought l was gonna. . .

24:03.989 --> 24:06.031
What, slip my needle into your neck?

24:06.158 --> 24:08.075
ls that how you do it?

24:10.704 --> 24:12.288
lt's one of the ways.

24:26.511 --> 24:30.347
You're afraid of me now, aren't you?

24:30.474 --> 24:33.225
l've always been afraid of you, Dexter.

24:35.395 --> 24:37.229
Why?

24:37.355 --> 24:38.647
From the first time l saw you,

24:38.773 --> 24:42.693
l could see how hopelessly
consumed you were by your need.

24:47.449 --> 24:48.699
You lied to me.

24:51.495 --> 24:55.206
All that time as my sponsor,

24:55.332 --> 24:56.499
you said all you wanted

24:56.625 --> 24:58.918
was to help me control my addiction.

24:59.044 --> 25:00.419
We did control it.

25:00.545 --> 25:03.214
But that's not what you really wanted. . .

25:03.340 --> 25:04.673
was it?

25:07.719 --> 25:10.262
What do you think l wanted?

25:11.389 --> 25:12.806
To know what it's like

25:12.933 --> 25:17.978
to feel something. . .that deeply. . .

25:18.939 --> 25:22.942
Anything. That's why you
hang out in recovery groups.

25:23.068 --> 25:24.944
You're emotionally color-blind.

25:25.070 --> 25:26.320
You use the right words,

25:26.446 --> 25:28.948
you pantomime the right behavior,

25:29.074 --> 25:30.950
but the feelings never come to pass.

25:32.869 --> 25:33.994
That's not true.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.580
lt is, Lila.

25:36.706 --> 25:40.584
You know the dictionary
definition of emotions -

25:40.710 --> 25:43.921
longing, joy. sorrow -

25:44.047 --> 25:45.130
but you have no idea

25:45.257 --> 25:47.883
what any of those things actually feel like.

25:48.009 --> 25:50.177
You're wrong. l have feelings for you.

25:50.303 --> 25:53.639
You want to have feelings for me
but they're just impulses.

25:53.765 --> 25:55.641
- Enough.
- They're primitive responses

25:55.767 --> 25:57.142
- to immediate needs.
- stop it.

25:57.269 --> 25:59.645
You know all the words,
but you can't hear the music.

25:59.771 --> 26:01.897
- Don't do this here.
- Lila. . .

26:04.943 --> 26:07.611
l'm just like you.

26:17.122 --> 26:18.622
Hey!

26:29.134 --> 26:31.677
l was down to my last hope.

26:31.803 --> 26:33.470
So was l.

26:35.140 --> 26:38.517
When he told me who you are,

26:38.643 --> 26:41.520
l thought that was
a secret worth protecting.

26:41.646 --> 26:43.439
Most definitely.

26:43.565 --> 26:46.525
l wish you could have seen it, Dexter.

26:46.651 --> 26:49.612
The explosion was. . .

26:49.738 --> 26:50.988
brilliant.

26:51.573 --> 26:54.033
l'm more like my father
than l ever imagined.

26:54.159 --> 26:56.869
l've created a monster of my own.

26:58.038 --> 26:59.705
Told you.

27:01.499 --> 27:04.460
We were meant to be together.

27:07.297 --> 27:09.882
Lila, l'm sorry l pushed you away.

27:14.095 --> 27:17.806
l know how frightening
it must have been for you,

27:17.932 --> 27:19.850
me scratching to get in.

27:20.685 --> 27:21.769
But it's OK.

27:21.895 --> 27:26.315
l'm in now,
and l'm not going anywhere.

27:27.233 --> 27:28.359
l am.

27:29.527 --> 27:30.569
Even with Doakes gone,

27:30.695 --> 27:33.238
l'm starting to think
it's too dangerous for me here.

27:33.365 --> 27:36.992
l need to move on, disappear.
l've already said my goodbyes.

27:37.118 --> 27:39.161
Let me come with you.

27:39.996 --> 27:41.288
l was hoping you'd say that.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.919
How long would it take you to get ready?

27:48.004 --> 27:49.588
To close my accounts. . .

27:51.841 --> 27:54.718
shut up my business. . .

27:56.137 --> 27:58.555
Tomorrow afternoon.

27:59.349 --> 28:00.766
Go home and pack.

28:00.892 --> 28:02.893
l'll call you tomorrow.

28:09.859 --> 28:11.985
l can't wait to go away with you, Dexter.

28:17.242 --> 28:18.909
l can't wait.

28:24.457 --> 28:27.793
You're going away with me, all right...

28:27.919 --> 28:30.212
in a garbage bag.

28:33.216 --> 28:34.341
But it went all right?

28:34.467 --> 28:37.344
Sure, for an internal affairs investigation.

28:37.470 --> 28:41.724
l spent two hours saying,
"No, l did not rape Lila Tournay.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.977
"She's bat-shit, nuts, wacko."
l started to run out of adjectives.

28:45.103 --> 28:46.353
Well, l got a few you can use.

28:47.147 --> 28:50.149
The good news is the department
is dying to drop the charge.

28:50.275 --> 28:52.818
They're dodging enough bullets
with this Doakes thing.

28:52.944 --> 28:56.488
Good - so when they find out
your so-called victim fled Miami,

28:56.614 --> 28:58.198
you'll be reinstated.

28:58.324 --> 29:00.826
- Lila went away?
- She fucking better.

29:00.952 --> 29:03.954
l dropped by her house and told her
to haul her slag ass out of town

29:04.080 --> 29:05.831
before she's deported.

29:05.957 --> 29:07.916
- You did that for me?
- Of course.

29:08.042 --> 29:09.376
For you and for Dex.

29:10.879 --> 29:14.423
You two window-lickers needed
somebody to snap you out of it.

29:16.468 --> 29:19.970
lt's good to know somebody's
pulling for you when you're down.

29:21.014 --> 29:22.973
OK, l get the point.

29:23.975 --> 29:25.642
Are you sure Lila got the message?

29:25.769 --> 29:27.269
Yeah, totally.

29:27.395 --> 29:30.814
l mean, l made it pretty clear.

29:32.817 --> 29:33.859
Excuse me.

29:33.985 --> 29:37.404
- Donations can be made directly to me.
- Donations?

29:37.530 --> 29:40.532
For Sergeant Doakes' memorial service.

29:40.658 --> 29:42.701
You got to be kidding?

29:42.827 --> 29:45.788
lt's what we do for a fellow officer.

29:48.166 --> 29:49.124
Thanks again, Morgan.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.834
Yeah.

29:52.837 --> 29:54.588
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

29:54.714 --> 29:57.883
l. . .was wondering. . .

29:58.009 --> 30:00.177
Checks payable to cash.

30:00.303 --> 30:02.846
Actually l just wanted
to offer my support...

30:03.932 --> 30:05.891
sympathy or. . .

30:06.017 --> 30:07.935
whatever the fuck, if you want to talk. . .

30:09.187 --> 30:11.396
Thank you, Morgan. l can manage.

30:11.523 --> 30:12.898
l'm not so sure, l mean. . .

30:13.024 --> 30:16.109
you're collecting money
to honor a killer.

30:16.236 --> 30:18.403
l'm not honoring the Butcher.

30:18.530 --> 30:21.198
l'm honoring James Doakes.

30:22.325 --> 30:24.660
Respectfully, Maria, that's denial.

30:24.786 --> 30:26.078
So it is.

30:26.204 --> 30:27.621
You're choosing to be in denial?

30:27.747 --> 30:29.414
Conscious denial.

30:30.792 --> 30:33.293
But the case is closed.
l'm not gonna pursue it.

30:34.546 --> 30:36.839
But l knew James.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.841
l knew him.

30:38.967 --> 30:40.884
As a partner and as a friend.

30:41.845 --> 30:44.096
l have to keep on believing
that that is who he was.

30:44.222 --> 30:48.392
because if he could hide
all that other fucked-up shit,

30:48.518 --> 30:50.435
then l don't think l could ever. . .

30:50.562 --> 30:52.062
Trust anyone again.

30:53.523 --> 30:55.774
That's right.

30:57.318 --> 30:58.902
Or yourself?

31:03.449 --> 31:05.576
l'll leave a check in your office.

31:13.501 --> 31:15.836
lt's strange to have a creation out there.

31:15.962 --> 31:18.463
A deeply mutated version of yourself

31:18.590 --> 31:21.341
running loose and screwing everything up.

31:21.467 --> 31:23.844
I wonder if this is how parents feeI.

31:29.559 --> 32:01.173
Lila?

32:20.902 --> 32:22.694
What the fuck?

32:24.155 --> 32:25.530
Dexter?

32:25.657 --> 32:26.782
What are you doing here?

32:26.950 --> 32:29.701
l came to make sure Lila left town.

32:29.827 --> 32:31.203
Yeah, me too.

32:31.329 --> 32:34.706
And if she was still here, you were
gonna what, wrestle her out? Jesus!

32:36.000 --> 32:37.167
What have we here?

32:40.380 --> 32:42.047
The door was open.

32:43.174 --> 32:46.426
l just stepped out to buy
some snacks for the road trip.

32:50.348 --> 32:52.224
Come to say goodbye?

32:53.810 --> 32:55.978
Actually, we came to see
that you cleared out.

32:56.104 --> 32:58.814
But now that we see
you're on your way.

32:58.940 --> 33:01.358
we're good to go.

33:02.151 --> 33:04.194
Have a nice fucking life.

33:11.661 --> 33:15.747
- You're not coming with me, then?
- Oh, my God.

33:15.873 --> 33:19.167
What did you do to make her
so pathetically crazy for you?

33:19.293 --> 33:20.585
Does your dick dance?

33:22.505 --> 33:23.880
Oh, well, OK.

33:31.472 --> 33:33.765
l better be on my way, then.

33:33.891 --> 33:37.728
l think that's my bag.
l must have left it last time l was here.

33:37.854 --> 33:40.564
No, l'm pretty sure it's mine.

33:40.690 --> 33:44.276
l can open it up for you if you like,
so you can check for yourself.

33:44.402 --> 33:46.653
No, it's my mistake. . .

33:49.365 --> 33:50.615
OK.

33:51.701 --> 33:53.702
Well. . .

33:56.581 --> 33:58.123
Bye, then.

33:58.249 --> 34:01.752
Have a nice flight.
Don't forget your broom.

34:06.799 --> 34:07.924
HeIIo, this is LiIa.

34:08.051 --> 34:11.428
Please leave your name and number,
and l will ring you back as soon as l can.

34:11.554 --> 34:14.639
Lila. where are you?
l'm ready to hit the road.

34:14.766 --> 34:17.017
Hope you're not mad about Deb. l had to lie.

34:17.143 --> 34:20.270
l don't want her to know
we're running off together.

34:20.396 --> 34:21.688
Call me right away.

34:21.814 --> 34:23.440
l miss you.

35:02.438 --> 35:03.480
What?

35:14.325 --> 35:15.867
Frank!

35:16.953 --> 35:18.620
Bedroom.

35:18.746 --> 35:20.789
"What are we doing home
in the middle of the day?"

35:20.915 --> 35:23.166
She asked, hoping for sex.

35:26.879 --> 35:29.047
You're packing already.

35:31.342 --> 35:34.302
Good thing l got my tuque.

35:34.428 --> 35:35.887
Lake lpperwash or bust.

35:36.013 --> 35:38.723
- Debra, slow down.
- Oh, wait. l got a parka.

35:38.850 --> 35:42.227
Do you know how hard it is
to find a parka in Miami?

35:42.353 --> 35:43.854
When do we leave?

35:43.980 --> 35:45.897
Not we. Me.

35:47.358 --> 35:49.818
Debra, l just got a call from DC.

35:49.944 --> 35:52.320
A pattern of bodies
was identified in Oregon.

35:52.446 --> 35:55.532
My flight leaves tonight at seven.

35:55.658 --> 35:57.367
You got to be fucking kidding me.

35:57.493 --> 35:59.452
l wish l were.

36:01.914 --> 36:03.081
But it's too soon.

36:03.207 --> 36:07.419
l mean. . .if you're leaving,
we got to work out logistics.

36:07.545 --> 36:08.837
Logistics?

36:08.963 --> 36:11.673
Yeah, we got a lot of shit to figure out.

36:11.799 --> 36:13.925
Weekend visits and red-eye flights

36:14.051 --> 36:16.428
and frequent-flyer plans.

36:16.554 --> 36:18.096
Let me get my calendar.

36:18.222 --> 36:20.223
Hey.

36:21.434 --> 36:23.727
Do you honestly want
to go down this path?

36:24.604 --> 36:26.479
You're right. l don't.

36:26.606 --> 36:28.607
Long-distance relationships
never work out,

36:28.733 --> 36:31.860
not even in the movies.

36:31.986 --> 36:33.612
Fuck it.

36:36.032 --> 36:37.449
What are you doing?

36:37.575 --> 36:38.742
Logistics.

36:40.828 --> 36:43.788
l'm taking a leave of absence.

36:43.915 --> 36:45.749
You're not thinking this through.

36:45.875 --> 36:48.543
What's to think about?
l'm going with you.

36:48.669 --> 36:50.170
lt's just a job.

36:51.881 --> 36:53.215
lt's more than that to you.

36:53.925 --> 36:56.259
OK, l love my job,

36:56.385 --> 36:57.802
but not as much as l love. . .

37:00.640 --> 37:02.933
being with you.

37:03.476 --> 37:06.811
Just. . .do me a favor.

37:08.272 --> 37:11.608
Take the afternoon and think about this.

37:14.946 --> 37:16.238
Fine.

37:17.281 --> 37:20.825
You do me a favor and buy me
a goddamn ticket on your flight.

37:20.952 --> 37:23.995
l'm going home to pack.
and l'll see you at the airport.

37:38.886 --> 37:40.136
That was delicious.

37:40.263 --> 37:43.098
What did you like better.
the nature stew or the mud pudding?

37:43.474 --> 37:45.183
l want worms on toast.

37:45.309 --> 37:47.477
Can we have worms on toast
for a snack?

37:48.688 --> 37:50.355
Go wash up, both of you.

37:50.481 --> 37:53.149
Hey, no running in the house, please.

38:03.995 --> 38:05.495
Yeah, real mature.

38:11.919 --> 38:14.713
Captain, you called for me?

38:14.839 --> 38:16.131
Oh, hey, Dexter.

38:16.257 --> 38:17.799
Yeah, l received a phone call

38:17.925 --> 38:19.884
from a woman that says
she's a friend of yours.

38:20.011 --> 38:22.637
- Who?
- She wouldn't give her name

38:22.763 --> 38:25.473
but claims to have vital information
on the Bay Harbor Butcher.

38:25.599 --> 38:28.393
- Any idea who she might be?
- English accent?

38:28.519 --> 38:30.562
- That's her.
- l think...

38:30.688 --> 38:34.399
she might have
a personal issue with me.

38:35.234 --> 38:37.485
This is the same woman
who tried to railroad Batista.

38:37.611 --> 38:39.362
You might want to avoid her.

38:39.488 --> 38:40.613
Not a chance.

38:40.740 --> 38:41.823
No, this case is closing,

38:41.949 --> 38:43.408
and l can't afford to leave any loose ends.

38:43.534 --> 38:46.661
- Did she say she was coming in?
- Within the hour.

38:46.787 --> 38:48.413
And you said she mentioned my name?

38:48.539 --> 38:50.707
Specifically.

38:51.751 --> 38:55.337
Well. stick around.
We'll sort this thing out together, OK?

38:56.547 --> 38:59.591
lf Lila plans to turn me in, why would she
drop my name to the Captain

38:59.717 --> 39:01.509
and give me a chance to intercept her?

39:01.635 --> 39:03.636
It doesn't make sense...

39:04.722 --> 39:08.016
UnIess she wants me here
so she can hurt me some other way.

39:08.142 --> 39:09.601
Rita.

39:21.489 --> 39:22.739
Astor?

39:23.407 --> 39:24.949
Cody?

39:26.035 --> 39:27.535
Guys?

39:28.245 --> 39:29.913
Lexi.

39:30.956 --> 39:32.749
Lexi! Where are the kids?

39:32.875 --> 39:34.209
l can't remember.

39:35.795 --> 39:37.545
Dexter, l got your message.

39:37.671 --> 39:38.880
What is it? What's going on?

39:39.006 --> 39:40.090
The kids are missing.

39:40.216 --> 39:43.593
Miss Bennett, l am so sorry.
l didn't mean to fall asleep.

39:43.719 --> 39:45.053
We have to call the police.

39:46.097 --> 39:48.681
Call Deb. she'll have
the entire force looking for them.

39:48.808 --> 39:51.476
See if any neighbors saw anything.
l'll drive around the area.

39:51.602 --> 39:54.312
l promise we'll find them.

39:54.939 --> 39:57.774
We're going to terminal seven,
Miami lnternational.

40:01.112 --> 40:02.153
Morgan.

40:02.279 --> 40:03.363
Debra, it's Rita.

40:03.489 --> 40:05.281
Hey, l'm just. . . l'm getting in a cab.

40:05.408 --> 40:06.991
Look, Cody and Astor are missing.

40:07.118 --> 40:08.326
Did you call the police?

40:08.452 --> 40:10.120
Dexter said to call you.

40:10.246 --> 40:13.832
OK, you just sit by the phone.
l'll take it from here.

40:13.958 --> 40:15.291
All right.

40:16.293 --> 40:18.002
Hey, hold up. Could you just wait?

40:18.129 --> 40:20.380
You don't want to go to the airport?

40:20.506 --> 40:22.590
Course l want to go to the airport.

40:22.716 --> 40:24.050
Wait. l just said wait.

40:24.176 --> 40:26.970
For Christ's sake, honey,
make up your mind.

40:27.888 --> 40:29.764
Why?

40:30.808 --> 40:33.059
Why do l have to make up my mind?

40:36.439 --> 40:37.897
God damn it!

40:38.899 --> 40:40.150
Here.

40:45.823 --> 40:47.907
Hi, Dexter.

40:52.997 --> 40:54.539
- Hi, Dexter.
- Hey. Dex.

40:54.665 --> 40:55.915
Hey, guys. You having fun?

40:56.041 --> 40:59.586
- Super fun. Lila's so nice.
- Where is Lila?

40:59.712 --> 41:01.171
l'm over here.

41:04.633 --> 41:06.468
You could have had it all, Dexter.

41:19.190 --> 41:20.315
Dexter!

41:21.984 --> 41:23.568
Stay on the bed, guys! Don't move!

41:32.077 --> 41:33.661
Dexter!

41:38.751 --> 41:40.543
Look away, both of you.

41:47.343 --> 41:49.969
OK, Astor, you first.

41:50.095 --> 41:52.722
You're gonna help your brother.

42:06.403 --> 42:07.654
Go. Run. Find help.

42:07.780 --> 42:10.365
- Come on, Dexter!
- l can't fit.

42:12.326 --> 42:14.244
Shit.

42:56.287 --> 42:58.162
What do you remember from before -

42:58.289 --> 43:00.248
you know, before we took you in?

43:04.587 --> 43:06.379
Nothing.

43:06.505 --> 43:08.089
Good. . .

43:08.215 --> 43:11.342
because what happened was too strong.

43:11.468 --> 43:13.970
Son, it got into you too early. . .

43:15.014 --> 43:16.472
and it's gonna stay there.

43:16.599 --> 43:19.017
lt's gonna make you want to kill,

43:19.143 --> 43:21.144
and you won't be able to stop it.

43:24.315 --> 43:26.816
So, l'm going to be like this forever?

43:28.777 --> 43:30.236
Yes.

44:20.537 --> 44:22.872
You're gonna be OK. l got you.

44:28.879 --> 44:33.216
Number 1 265 to Paris
now boarding at gate 5A.

44:39.556 --> 44:41.265
Arriving passengers,

44:41.392 --> 44:43.726
baggage claim is at ground level.

44:55.155 --> 44:57.281
l'm so sorry about all of this.

44:57.408 --> 44:59.492
lt's over now.

44:59.618 --> 45:02.036
They're safe. You're safe.

45:02.454 --> 45:03.830
That's all that matters.

45:06.166 --> 45:07.834
Come on.

45:13.090 --> 45:14.799
You two, secure a perimeter,

45:14.925 --> 45:17.593
and have the fire chief see me
as soon as he gets here, OK?

45:18.512 --> 45:22.181
Put out an APB on Lila West,
AKA Lila Tournay.

45:22.307 --> 45:23.307
suspected arsonist -

45:23.434 --> 45:26.227
Five-seven, black hair,
pale like a fucking corpse.

45:26.353 --> 45:28.229
"Fucking corpse." Got it.

45:29.273 --> 45:32.316
You're wasting your time.
She's not coming back, not after this.

45:32.443 --> 45:35.445
- Yeah, l wouldn't bet on it.
- No, she won't.

45:35.571 --> 45:37.321
She's a survivalist.

45:38.031 --> 45:40.199
How'd you know the kids were here?

45:40.325 --> 45:42.493
A neighbor saw them
with a strange woman.

45:42.619 --> 45:44.287
lt wasn't much of a leap.

45:44.413 --> 45:46.831
Lila's gone after everyone
that's close to you.

45:49.334 --> 45:50.710
What?

45:50.836 --> 45:51.878
lt's pretty impressive.

45:52.004 --> 45:54.547
lt seems it wasn't too long ago
l was taking care of you.

45:55.716 --> 45:57.592
l like it better this way.

45:57.718 --> 45:59.302
Yeah, l can see that.

45:59.428 --> 46:02.138
Why is this man not on the way
to the hospital now?

46:02.264 --> 46:03.222
l'm fine, Deb.

46:03.348 --> 46:05.641
You're not fine.
Your eyebrows are singed.

46:07.936 --> 46:09.771
How can you be so fucking relaxed?

46:12.399 --> 46:15.026
l'm good at compartmentalization.

46:16.570 --> 46:18.196
You're a little weird, Dex.

46:19.031 --> 46:22.200
That's not gonna change.
l'm gonna be this way forever.

46:24.453 --> 46:26.078
l can live with that.

46:28.707 --> 46:30.082
Just smarten up, OK?

46:32.586 --> 46:35.880
l passed through the flames
and rose from the ashes...

46:36.006 --> 46:37.757


46:37.883 --> 46:41.052
l've never been one to put much weight
into the idea of a higher power

46:41.178 --> 46:44.138
but if I didn't know better,
I'd have to beIieve some force

46:44.264 --> 46:46.974
wants me to keep doing what l'm doing.

47:52.541 --> 47:53.457
Dexter.

47:53.584 --> 47:55.334
You wanted to be close to me, Lila?

47:55.460 --> 47:57.628
This is the most l have to offer.

47:57.754 --> 47:59.839
l can't feel my. . .

47:59.965 --> 48:01.257
my legs and my body.

48:01.383 --> 48:02.341
Good.

48:02.467 --> 48:04.844
l went with a spinal epidural
instead of the tranquillizer.

48:04.970 --> 48:06.512
l've got a plane to catch,

48:06.638 --> 48:09.307
And you don't need to feel this.

48:12.352 --> 48:14.437
You killed an innocent man.

48:15.898 --> 48:18.024
l did it for you, l did. . .

48:18.150 --> 48:20.192
Did you try to kill
the children for me, too?

48:23.447 --> 48:24.655
Don't do this.

48:25.908 --> 48:28.075
You taught me to accept what l am. . .

48:30.996 --> 48:34.206
and to trust in the one thing l know
with absolute clarity.

48:44.343 --> 48:46.177
Thank you.

49:05.155 --> 49:06.739
Not long ago l had a dream

49:06.865 --> 49:08.699
that peopIe couId see me for what I am,

49:08.825 --> 49:10.701
and for a brief instant in time,

49:10.827 --> 49:13.537
the world actually saw my bodies of work.

49:13.664 --> 49:15.498
Some even cheered.

49:15.624 --> 49:19.001
But as it turns out,
nobody mourns the wicked.

49:19.127 --> 49:20.836
Sorry, James.

49:23.715 --> 49:25.758
l think Harry knew that from the start.

49:25.884 --> 49:27.760
That's why he gave me a code.

49:27.886 --> 49:29.971
It cost him his Iife, but it kept me aIive

49:30.097 --> 49:32.056
through incredible trials.

49:32.182 --> 49:34.850
The code is mine now and mine aIone.

49:34.977 --> 49:38.229
So, too, are the reIationships I cuItivate.

49:44.486 --> 49:46.946
They're not just disguises any more.

49:47.072 --> 49:49.323
I need them...

49:49.449 --> 49:52.118
Even if they make me vulnerable.

49:52.244 --> 49:56.539
My father might not approve,
but l'm no longer his disciple.

49:56.665 --> 49:58.916
I'm a master now...

49:59.459 --> 50:03.129
an idea transcended into Iife.

50:07.092 --> 50:09.218
And so this is my new path,

50:09.344 --> 50:11.095
which is a Iot Iike the oId one...

50:11.847 --> 50:14.515
only mine.

50:14.641 --> 50:17.685
To stay on that path, l need to work harder,

50:17.811 --> 50:21.105
explore new rituals, evolve.

50:22.774 --> 50:24.608
Am I eviI?

50:24.735 --> 50:26.444
Am l good?

50:26.570 --> 50:28.696
l'm done asking those questions.

50:28.822 --> 50:31.073
I don't have the answers.

50:32.284 --> 50:33.951
Does anyone?
