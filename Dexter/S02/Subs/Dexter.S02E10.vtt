00:02.132 --> 00:03.340
Previously on Dexter...

00:03.466 --> 00:04.425
l'm sorry.

00:04.551 --> 00:07.553
lt doesn't change the fact
that you slept with another woman.

00:07.679 --> 00:08.846
What do they have on me?

00:08.972 --> 00:11.765
- They found something in your car.
- Oh, shit.

00:11.891 --> 00:15.686
Our primary suspect
is someone you know well. . .

00:15.812 --> 00:18.731
- Sergeant James Doakes.
- He had the slides.

00:18.857 --> 00:20.441
You know me, Maria. That's not me.

00:20.567 --> 00:22.234
Don't you disappear on me, James.

00:22.360 --> 00:25.779
What exactly is Sergeant Doakes's
problem with you, Morgan?

00:25.905 --> 00:30.200
l always sensed there was something. . .
off about him.

00:30.326 --> 00:33.620
From here on out. we'll want
a protective detail on you at all times.

00:33.747 --> 00:36.373
You're a good cop like your old man.

00:36.499 --> 00:39.710
- Do you think they know?
- Not until you tell them.

00:39.836 --> 00:41.378
He is not your man.

00:41.504 --> 00:43.881
He may be your ex-partner,
he may be your best friend.

00:44.007 --> 00:45.340
What he is to me is a suspect.

00:45.467 --> 00:48.218
- Lila, what are you doing here?
- she came to see me. bro.

00:48.344 --> 00:50.387
Are you pissed or something
about Lila and me?

00:50.513 --> 00:53.057
- Lila's just using you to get at me.
- So what?

00:53.183 --> 00:56.185
A secret cabin
in the middle of the Everglades...

00:56.311 --> 00:59.396
what more could
a rededicated seriaI kiIIer ask for?

01:02.150 --> 01:04.610
Jesus Christ.
You're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

01:16.414 --> 01:19.041
You're gonna have to kill me, Morgan!

01:21.544 --> 01:24.296
You're gonna have
to fucking kill me, Morgan!

03:31.758 --> 03:34.843
ls it deep? l hope it's fucking deep.

03:36.179 --> 03:38.639
lt's a graze wound. Minor tissue abrasion.

03:38.765 --> 03:41.225
No hemorrhage along the bullet track.

03:41.351 --> 03:42.976
Sorry. l think l'm gonna live.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.562
Am l?

03:45.688 --> 03:47.564
That's a good question.

03:47.690 --> 03:51.485
lf you're not gonna let me go, Morgan,
then kill me now, just get it over with.

03:51.611 --> 03:55.614
l'd advise you not to tempt me just now.

04:01.579 --> 04:04.748
Why couldn't you just leave me
to do my work in peace?

04:05.792 --> 04:07.584
Why'd you have to go
and ruin everything?

04:07.710 --> 04:09.211
You're a killer.

04:09.337 --> 04:10.379
l catch killers.

04:11.339 --> 04:12.923
So do l. l caught you.

04:13.049 --> 04:14.883
l'm not a killer.

04:16.970 --> 04:18.929
You are.

04:19.055 --> 04:21.390
That's why you've always known what l am.

04:21.516 --> 04:25.686
That's why you have more officer-related
shootings than anybody else.

04:25.812 --> 04:28.605
Only l don't fuck with you
when you shoot somebody.

04:28.731 --> 04:31.191
Why couldn't you pay me
the same professional courtesy?

04:31.317 --> 04:33.652
There's nothing professional
about what you do.

04:33.778 --> 04:35.696
l kill when l have to on the job.

04:35.822 --> 04:40.284
Oh, so it's OK to take a life
as long as you get a paycheck for it?

04:40.410 --> 04:42.577
The city pays me to keep the law.

04:42.704 --> 04:45.455
l've got news for you, Sergeant.

04:45.581 --> 04:50.419
My code requires a higher standard of proof
than your city's laws.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.547
At zero cost to the taxpayer.

04:53.673 --> 04:55.424
lf you ask me, l'm a bargain.

04:56.426 --> 04:58.385
That's enough bullshit, Morgan.

04:58.511 --> 05:00.345
Let's get this over with.

05:00.471 --> 05:03.348
Either kill me or set me free,
what's it gonna be?

05:03.474 --> 05:06.601
l actually think you'd like it if l killed you,
just to prove your point.

05:06.728 --> 05:09.313
- Morgan, you gotta choose.
- No. l need to go home.

05:09.439 --> 05:13.233
l've got FBl guards standing outside my door
right now. . .

05:15.611 --> 05:17.779
to protect me from you.

05:19.115 --> 05:21.074
What's it gonna be, Morgan?

05:22.035 --> 05:25.162
Morgan, what's it gonna be?
Kill me now or set me free!

05:25.288 --> 05:27.372
You only have two choices, Morgan!

05:27.498 --> 05:29.791
You can't fucking ignore me!

05:31.878 --> 05:34.755
What's wrong?
The place is a ghost town this early.

05:34.881 --> 05:36.840
Besides, l thought we were out as a couple.

05:36.966 --> 05:39.760
Out and flaunting it are two different things.

05:40.803 --> 05:43.513
- "Don't ask, don't tell"?
- Works for the military.

05:43.639 --> 05:45.515
Not really.

05:48.102 --> 05:49.770
Oh, excellent.

05:50.813 --> 05:54.107
My subpoena for Doakes's
phone records came through.

05:54.233 --> 05:57.652
- He isn't much of a talker.
- Not a lot of friends, l'm guessing.

05:59.155 --> 06:00.781
Except for one. Check this out.

06:01.657 --> 06:04.493
That's Lieutenant LaGuerta's number.
Look at the time and date.

06:04.619 --> 06:07.245
Doakes called her
right after we launched the manhunt.

06:07.372 --> 06:10.207
- We could have traced that call.
- Doubt it.

06:10.333 --> 06:12.959
Sergeant Doakes wouldn't have stayed on
long enough,

06:13.086 --> 06:16.213
but LaGuerta should have
given us the chance.

06:16.339 --> 06:19.299
You're gonna ream her, aren't you?
Can l be there when you do it?

06:19.425 --> 06:22.719
- lt's kind of a hobby of mine.
- You can ream her yourself.

06:23.763 --> 06:24.846
Me?

06:25.973 --> 06:28.517
- l can't dress down my own boss.
- lt's your subpoena.

06:28.643 --> 06:30.644
- Your case.
- Our case.

06:31.479 --> 06:33.939
And l need to know if your lieutenant
can be counted on.

06:34.065 --> 06:35.649
You know her better than l do.

06:35.775 --> 06:37.651
- Lox?
- Gross.

06:38.277 --> 06:42.155
Seriously, that would get me in deeper shit
with her and LaGuerta already hates me.

06:42.990 --> 06:45.909
You know, l'm not always gonna be around
to run interference.

06:46.035 --> 06:47.494
Oh, come on.

06:47.620 --> 06:50.372
You got at least five,
ten good years left in you.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.960
l mean l won't be around
once this case ends,

06:55.086 --> 06:58.630
so a reaming will be good practice for you after
l'm gone.

06:59.674 --> 07:01.550
l better refrigerate this.

07:12.270 --> 07:15.856
Taking a life is one thing,
but the care and feeding of it is another.

07:15.982 --> 07:19.192
l can"t keep my problem
locked away in a cabin forever.

07:22.572 --> 07:25.824
Harry always said there were
plenty of people who deserved to die,

07:25.950 --> 07:30.370
but no matter how hard l close my eyes
and wish, Doakes isn"t one of them.

07:33.916 --> 07:37.335
Harry, you never prepared me for this one.

07:37.462 --> 07:39.963
What do I do?

07:40.089 --> 07:42.132
What would you do?

07:43.759 --> 07:46.303
Get a description of Juan Ryness
to every patrol unit,

07:46.429 --> 07:47.971
and wake up Judge Morehouse.

07:48.097 --> 07:50.432
l need a warrant for
Ryness's apartment immediately.

07:50.558 --> 07:53.143
- Fisk, make sure you get that print. . .
- she was dumped?

07:53.269 --> 07:55.937
Debra, get back inside the car
like l told you.

07:58.232 --> 07:59.983
Blunt trauma to the head?

08:00.109 --> 08:02.444
l went over there. No one saw.

08:04.614 --> 08:08.366
The blow to the head killed her.
She took a brutal beating beforehand.

08:08.493 --> 08:10.494
The guy who did this is an evil bastard.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.746
- You know who it was?
- Oh. yeah.

08:13.414 --> 08:16.500
l've been trying to nail him for a while.
A pimp named Juan Ryness.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.168
She was one of his girls.

08:18.294 --> 08:20.128
She was dumped, right?

08:20.254 --> 08:22.088
Get back in the truck.

08:45.446 --> 08:46.738
You awake?

08:47.698 --> 08:48.865
You for real?

08:48.991 --> 08:50.784
You got a visitor.

08:53.287 --> 08:54.329
Coffee?

08:56.666 --> 08:58.166
Yeah. Why not?

09:06.092 --> 09:08.635
l heard the news. lt's everywhere.

09:08.761 --> 09:11.888
Sergeant Doakes is
the Bay Harbor Butcher?

09:12.014 --> 09:13.932
That's what they're saying.

09:15.017 --> 09:18.061
l was worried about you, Dexter.
Are you OK?

09:18.187 --> 09:20.272
Why is the FBl guarding your building?

09:20.398 --> 09:22.566
Oh, you know the federal government.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.901
Any excuse to spend money.

09:27.655 --> 09:28.947
lt's cold.

09:29.782 --> 09:30.740
Sorry.

09:30.866 --> 09:36.538
Well, there's nothing better on a muggy Miami
morning than an iced coffee. right?

09:42.795 --> 09:44.212
How are the kids?

09:45.423 --> 09:48.425
They asked about you again.

09:50.094 --> 09:52.637
And they've been pretty confused
since we split up.

09:54.890 --> 09:56.016
Yeah. Me too.

09:56.142 --> 09:58.226
Are you still confused?

09:58.352 --> 10:01.438
l'm generally confused most of the time. . .

10:04.150 --> 10:05.400
But not about us.

10:06.902 --> 10:07.986
Good.

10:11.115 --> 10:12.407
No.

10:13.659 --> 10:15.243
lt's not good?

10:15.369 --> 10:18.747
No. lt's great. . .

10:19.957 --> 10:22.542
to have this. . .clarity.

10:25.087 --> 10:27.631
l'm really glad you feel that way, Dexter.

10:27.757 --> 10:30.508
Me and the kids
have been through so much lately

10:30.635 --> 10:33.345
with Paul's death and my mom moving out. . .

10:34.347 --> 10:37.766
l don't want them to feel like they've been
abandoned by everyone they love.

10:42.855 --> 10:44.939
Does this mean we're dating again?

10:47.777 --> 10:50.987
That would be kind of fast, wouldn't it?

10:52.114 --> 10:55.867
l mean, you're so important to them
and they need you.

10:57.578 --> 10:59.829
But l don't know.

11:01.749 --> 11:04.000
l mean, maybe we could just. . .

11:04.126 --> 11:05.794
hang.

11:07.129 --> 11:09.339
Like a sloth.

11:09.465 --> 11:10.882
l can do that.

11:14.929 --> 11:18.890
Well, if you're free on Saturday,
we're gonna spend the day at the beach,

11:19.016 --> 11:22.310
and maybe we could all hang together.

11:22.436 --> 11:24.312
A family of sloths.

11:29.485 --> 11:30.985
Let me get you some ice.

11:33.781 --> 11:37.158
l've been selfish, only thinking about
what happens to me.

11:38.703 --> 11:41.579
But if I were ever reveaIed
as the true Bay Harbor Butcher,

11:41.706 --> 11:43.665
Rita and her children would be destroyed.

12:03.018 --> 12:06.229
- Lieutenant?
- Yes, Morgan?

12:14.363 --> 12:17.198
- l need you to take a look at these.
- l know what they are.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.910
You didn't report the call from Doakes.

12:21.036 --> 12:25.457
Your task force doesn't need
my help railroading a good cop.

12:28.085 --> 12:30.044
Doakes was officially a person of interest.

12:30.171 --> 12:32.922
Not reporting that call
could be aiding and abetting.

12:33.048 --> 12:36.801
None of you wanted to hear
what he had to say, so l didn't tell you.

12:38.220 --> 12:41.765
- What did he have to say?
- That he's innocent.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.349
And you believe him?

12:45.519 --> 12:47.479
What do you think?

12:49.565 --> 12:50.940
And if he calls again?

12:51.066 --> 12:52.525
He won't.

12:52.651 --> 12:55.028
- And you know this...
- Because l know him.

12:57.364 --> 13:00.450
- l thought l knew someone too.
- l know him.

13:00.576 --> 13:04.954
So if Lundy wants to flag me to
Captain Matthews, you tell him to go for it.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.248
But James knows that l believe in him,

13:07.374 --> 13:09.209
so it was worth the risk.

13:09.335 --> 13:10.752
To your job?

13:12.463 --> 13:14.964
To your career?

13:15.090 --> 13:17.592
You ever care about anyone, Morgan?

13:18.928 --> 13:20.011
Yes.

13:22.681 --> 13:24.641
Then you shouldn't have to ask.

13:24.767 --> 13:27.227
'Cause when you care about someone,

13:27.353 --> 13:28.937
you do what you have to do.

13:37.780 --> 13:43.618
Four different aliases all issued by the DOD
during Doakes's stint with Special Forces.

13:43.744 --> 13:46.329
We've attached these names
to our temporary felony want,

13:46.455 --> 13:49.499
so if he uses one, we'll be notified.

13:49.625 --> 13:51.125
l remember when life was easy,

13:51.252 --> 13:54.128
when the only question l worried about
was "'who"s next?"'

13:54.255 --> 13:56.923
Now it's "'How can l dodge
my protective detail?

13:57.049 --> 13:59.509
"'What should l do with my hostage?"'

13:59.635 --> 14:02.095
These are not easy questions.

14:02.221 --> 14:07.016
Morgan, would you bring us up to speed
on the analysis from the blood slides?

14:07.142 --> 14:09.185
Of the 46 slides,

14:09.311 --> 14:12.105
1 8 belonged to previously known
Butcher victims.

14:12.231 --> 14:16.359
We're still running the DNA.
but we've matched an additional 1 2

14:16.485 --> 14:19.320
with felons in the criminal database,
all reported missing.

14:20.573 --> 14:23.700
We'll proceed on the assumption
that these 1 2 were Bay Harbor victims.

14:23.826 --> 14:26.119
lt's a fair assumption.

14:27.246 --> 14:31.082
Officer Morgan.
do you have the new victims' jackets?

14:31.208 --> 14:34.294
Sorry, sir. Not my responsibility.

14:36.088 --> 14:37.255
That'd be me.

14:38.674 --> 14:43.011
Each of the 1 2 had at least
one homicide on their records,

14:43.137 --> 14:45.430
and we all know
how the Butcher loves a killer.

14:46.307 --> 14:48.725
We're checking into
their last known whereabouts

14:48.851 --> 14:53.062
and any connection that their criminal cases
may have had with sergeant Doakes.

14:53.188 --> 14:56.065
Forensics.
expect a steady stream of evidence

14:56.191 --> 14:59.402
seized from our suspect's apartment
over the next few hours.

14:59.528 --> 15:02.280
Look for any evidence
that could connect him to these victims.

15:02.406 --> 15:04.741
The rest of you have your assignments.

15:04.867 --> 15:06.868
Let's bring him in, folks.

15:11.415 --> 15:12.665
Special Agent Lundy?

15:12.791 --> 15:15.460
Dexter, is your sister all right?

15:15.586 --> 15:17.295
l wouldn't know.

15:17.421 --> 15:20.506
But l wanted to talk to you
about my protective detail.

15:23.761 --> 15:27.180
Angel, l hear you have
1 2 new butcher victims.

15:27.306 --> 15:28.556
Potential victims.

15:28.682 --> 15:30.558
You got names?

15:34.188 --> 15:35.855
Mind if l keep this?

15:36.857 --> 15:38.900
We're all working together now.

15:39.026 --> 15:40.693
Why? You got an angle on Doakes?

16:05.010 --> 16:08.471
Oh, yeah. That's good.

16:08.597 --> 16:10.306
That's real good.

16:11.392 --> 16:12.433
This is a waste of time.

16:12.559 --> 16:15.937
lf Doakes is the Butcher, we're not gonna find
trace evidence on his clothes.

16:16.063 --> 16:18.731
The guy we're after
is way too careful for that.

16:20.317 --> 16:22.610
l have to agree with you there.

16:24.154 --> 16:26.781
You think it could be Doakes?

16:26.907 --> 16:30.034
lt's not about what l think.
lt's all about the evidence.

16:31.495 --> 16:36.791
All those times he called me "lab geek,"
"fairy winkle," "donkey fluffer". . .

16:38.836 --> 16:41.045
l'm just glad l took it lying down, you know?

16:43.257 --> 16:44.298
What the fuck, Dex?

16:44.425 --> 16:45.842
What? Which fuck?

16:45.968 --> 16:48.219
You told Lundy to pull your protective detail?

16:48.345 --> 16:50.138
Oh, she's gonna hit you, isn't she?

16:50.264 --> 16:53.141
she's gonna hit someone
if you don't get the fuck out of here.

16:53.267 --> 16:57.687
Hair-pulling may not be manly,
but it's very effective.

17:00.816 --> 17:03.026
Doakes fucking hates you, Dex.

17:03.152 --> 17:05.445
- No doubt about that.
- And he's a trained killer.

17:05.571 --> 17:07.989
lf he wanted me dead.
it would have happened by now.

17:08.115 --> 17:09.532
ls that supposed to be reassuring?

17:09.658 --> 17:11.951
Doakes is a lot of things,
but he's not an idiot.

17:12.077 --> 17:15.163
He won't come out of the shadows
because of a grudge.

17:15.289 --> 17:16.539
Right.

17:16.665 --> 17:18.916
'Cause serial killers are so practical.

17:20.002 --> 17:21.044
Actually, they are.

17:21.920 --> 17:25.548
Deb, l'm safer with Lundy's troops
hunting Doakes than baby-sitting me.

17:25.674 --> 17:27.717
- Lundy agrees.
- Lundy doesn't give a shit!

17:27.843 --> 17:30.511
All he cares about is solving this case
and moving on!

17:31.764 --> 17:33.890
l thought he was the guy you could count on.

17:36.101 --> 17:39.604
You are the only one l can count on, jackass.

17:41.315 --> 17:43.107
Deb.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.193
Got to give Deb credit for one thing,

17:45.319 --> 17:47.361
she knows how to express her feelings.

17:50.074 --> 17:53.409
lf l was convicted as the Butcher,
she'd probably explode.

17:53.535 --> 17:55.953
lt'd be a waste of a perfectly good cop...

17:56.080 --> 17:58.039
and sister.

17:59.291 --> 18:02.210
This isn't just about me any more,
it"s about Deb,

18:02.336 --> 18:05.338
and Rita and the kids.

18:05.464 --> 18:07.715
l have only one choice for Doakes.

18:20.354 --> 18:22.188
Shit.

18:26.318 --> 18:27.443
All right.

18:39.873 --> 18:41.249
Yes.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.120
No reason for you to suffer.

19:26.670 --> 19:28.629
You come to a decision?

19:28.755 --> 19:31.424
Yes, but l don't think
you're gonna like it.

19:37.639 --> 19:39.932
So this is the way it ends.

19:41.435 --> 19:43.686
Regardless of how we got here. . .

19:44.646 --> 19:46.981
one of the two killers
in this cabin has to go away.

19:47.107 --> 19:48.357
l am not a killer.

19:48.483 --> 19:50.484
Right.

19:51.486 --> 19:55.573
ln terms of who goes,
it boiled down to a philosophical question. . .

19:56.909 --> 20:00.036
which one of us has more inherent worth?

20:00.162 --> 20:02.163
l know you're fucking kidding me.

20:03.207 --> 20:06.500
First l considered our value
to the community. That was a wash.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.213
We're both loyal civil servants.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.965
We work hard to keep the city clean.

20:13.091 --> 20:15.134
You cut people up into little pieces.

20:15.260 --> 20:18.471
Then l looked at our personal lives.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.515
And, well. . .

20:22.517 --> 20:25.394
that's where the differences
became clearer.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.605
Strange as it may seem,

20:27.731 --> 20:30.566
l have people who depend on me.

20:30.692 --> 20:35.196
They would be devastated
if they found out what l do.

20:36.531 --> 20:40.910
You, Sergeant, you're more of a lone wolf,
easier to put down,

20:41.036 --> 20:43.746
- no one in the pack to miss you.
- Fuck you.

20:44.873 --> 20:47.750
Fuck you, Morgan. l have a family.
l have my mother and my sisters.

20:47.876 --> 20:49.543
Who you never visit.

20:54.841 --> 20:56.550
lt puts a pit in my stomach. . .

20:57.719 --> 20:59.845
that l can only interpret as. . .

21:02.224 --> 21:03.557
sadness.

21:05.394 --> 21:06.978
lf you had a personal life,

21:07.104 --> 21:08.854
you might not have made me
your obsession

21:08.981 --> 21:10.481
and we wouldn't be here right now.

21:27.666 --> 21:31.752
sergeant. why would you hide
a dead drug dealer's cellphone from me?

21:31.878 --> 21:34.171
You working on an exit strategy?

21:34.298 --> 21:36.090
l'm afraid that's not gonna happen.

21:39.094 --> 21:40.636
lf you want to bring me down, Morgan,

21:40.762 --> 21:44.307
you're gonna have to open
this goddamn cage first.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.392
So come on. Bring it.

21:48.228 --> 21:51.022
l already did. You just didn't know it.

21:57.446 --> 21:59.030
Motherfucker.

21:59.156 --> 22:01.073
The sedative works fast.

22:01.199 --> 22:02.867
lt's probably best just to go with it.

22:07.456 --> 22:10.958
You think you're a fucking hero, don't you?
Cleaning up the fucking streets.

22:11.877 --> 22:13.669
Your old man would be proud.

22:16.214 --> 22:17.673
My old man was proud.

22:20.135 --> 22:21.260
He knew?

22:23.305 --> 22:25.264
He really was a fucking whack job.

22:26.308 --> 22:29.685
Name-calling at this juncture?

22:29.811 --> 22:31.937
What's the point?

22:32.064 --> 22:34.732
Besides, my father was
a legend on the force.

22:34.858 --> 22:36.650
ls that what you think?

22:38.528 --> 22:41.072
They never told you.

22:43.075 --> 22:45.201
Told me? Told me what?

22:46.495 --> 22:48.162
Hey!

22:48.288 --> 22:52.833
What about my father?

23:05.847 --> 23:07.139
A missed call.

23:07.265 --> 23:09.183
lf it's Dexter, tell him to come over.

23:15.190 --> 23:17.066
l have Auri on Saturday.

23:17.192 --> 23:18.651
Auri? What's an auri?

23:18.777 --> 23:21.195
lt's my little girl.

23:21.321 --> 23:25.241
My ex never lets me see her on
the weekends, but something came up.

23:25.367 --> 23:27.368
l have her all day on Saturday.

23:28.954 --> 23:30.413
Delightful.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.582
But tonight you belong to me. . .

23:33.708 --> 23:35.751
Yes.

23:35.877 --> 23:37.169
. . .and my walls.

23:42.342 --> 23:45.719
Doakes said I had two choices.
Kill him or let him go.

23:48.140 --> 23:50.433
But he neglected to look
behind door number three...

23:50.559 --> 23:52.768
hand him over to the FBl gift-wrapped.

23:54.187 --> 23:58.816
l don't need Doakes dead, l just need
his fingerprints to complete my frame job.

24:07.951 --> 24:10.077
Almost forgot.

24:13.206 --> 24:15.416
One needs small comforts.

24:35.770 --> 24:41.775
Every Saturday, beginning dive classes
practice underwater skills beside this dock.

24:42.694 --> 24:45.779
Tomorrow they"ll find
a morbid little surprise.

24:49.075 --> 24:52.495
When the feds receive these kiII tooIs
with their suspect"s prints on them,

24:52.621 --> 24:57.291
the only threat to me will be
the inane rants of a murderous madman.

25:03.298 --> 25:05.132
So close, l can feel it.

25:15.936 --> 25:18.771
This tragic tale might still end
in Doakes"s demise,

25:18.897 --> 25:20.856
but not by my hands.

25:20.982 --> 25:23.234
Harry's legacy will remain intact.

25:24.528 --> 25:25.694
Harry.

25:26.821 --> 25:29.740
Why in the hell did Doakes
have to bring up Harry?

25:35.413 --> 25:37.206
Come on.

25:40.168 --> 25:41.794
You just cut the cake, sweetheart.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.462
l'll see who it is.

25:46.716 --> 25:48.801
Tom. This is a surprise. Come on in.

25:48.927 --> 25:50.010
Oh, thanks.

25:51.096 --> 25:53.138
Sweetheart, cut the lieutenant a slice.

25:53.265 --> 25:55.766
- lt's her birthday.
- Oh! Well, happy birthday, hon.

25:55.892 --> 25:57.810
But no cake for me, thanks.

25:57.936 --> 26:01.605
- Can l talk to you in private for a second?
- Sure.

26:01.731 --> 26:03.190
Save me an end piece.

26:07.028 --> 26:09.280
God damn it!

26:10.907 --> 26:14.952
Ryness is gonna walk
because of a goddamn typo?

26:15.078 --> 26:17.037
Faulty warrant, Harry. Nothing we can do.

26:17.163 --> 26:18.664
- This is bullshit!
- Harry!

26:19.874 --> 26:22.751
Now. look. don't worry.
Ryness will make another mistake.

26:22.877 --> 26:25.796
Yeah, right. We just got wait for him
to kill another girl!

26:26.339 --> 26:28.299
Sorry.

26:37.892 --> 26:39.393
Happy birthday, kiddo.

26:43.607 --> 26:45.691
l'll get the vacuum cleaner.

26:56.703 --> 26:58.412
You OK, Dad?

27:01.124 --> 27:03.626
l did the right thing in training you.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.794
This just proves it.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.213
l did the right thing.

27:14.512 --> 27:15.971
Debra.

27:16.097 --> 27:17.765
Will you wait?

27:18.975 --> 27:21.894
- What's going on here?
- Nothing, according to you.

27:23.146 --> 27:24.229
So l said something?

27:24.356 --> 27:27.483
Only that this relationship
has an expiration date.

27:27.609 --> 27:31.236
Hey, if you want to write it off
before it even begins, you go ahead.

27:31.363 --> 27:32.571
When did l say that?

27:32.697 --> 27:36.367
Yesterday morning, you said, "When the case
ends, we end." l'm paraphrasing.

27:38.119 --> 27:41.664
Debra, l thought you understood
when we got involved.

27:41.790 --> 27:44.625
l track killers. That's what l do.
They tend to move around.

27:44.751 --> 27:46.460
l know that.

27:46.586 --> 27:51.090
Then l'm not sure what you thought
would happen when the case ended.

27:53.635 --> 27:55.552
Honestly, l hadn't thought about it,

27:55.679 --> 27:58.555
but it looks like you have, so now l know.

27:58.682 --> 28:00.641
Consider me informed.

28:09.025 --> 28:10.901
One.

28:11.027 --> 28:13.987
How come there's never a circus
when you need one?

28:14.114 --> 28:16.990
l don't know. l'm not sure
l've ever felt that particular need.

28:18.493 --> 28:20.661
Help me out here.

28:20.787 --> 28:24.039
- What does a seven-year-old girl like?
- Astor likes CNN.

28:24.833 --> 28:27.126
Yeah. That's not gonna fly.

28:27.252 --> 28:29.586
l got Auri all day on Saturday.

28:29.713 --> 28:32.089
l want to do something fun.

28:32.215 --> 28:35.050
ldeally a lot more fun than the stuff
her mother does with her.

28:35.176 --> 28:37.720
lt's really not that hard to entertain a kid.

28:37.846 --> 28:40.139
Rita and l are taking hers
to the beach on Saturday.

28:40.265 --> 28:42.015
See, now, that sounds perfect.

28:43.059 --> 28:45.394
lt'd be great if we could tag along.

28:47.981 --> 28:49.398
Sure, l guess.

28:49.524 --> 28:51.442
We'll be there all afternoon.

28:53.987 --> 28:59.199
- Sorry, but what's with the highlights?
- l was helping Lila paint her loft last night.

28:59.325 --> 29:01.994
Red, the color of pasion.

29:03.538 --> 29:04.747
Yeah. About Lila.

29:04.873 --> 29:08.917
Uh. it's probably better for everyone
if she doesn't come along on Saturday.

29:09.043 --> 29:11.086
Bro, l'm not stupid.

29:12.422 --> 29:15.048
Lila is like my after-hours project.

29:15.175 --> 29:17.760
Besides, she should stay off
the beach with skin like that.

29:17.886 --> 29:20.471
Like a perfect porcelain doll.

29:26.019 --> 29:28.604
"'Paid 4 my lift ticket.
Where"s my snow?

29:28.730 --> 29:30.939
"'Don't make me come after u."'

29:31.065 --> 29:34.151
Sounds Iike Mr. Harlow is
not only a master of metaphor,

29:34.277 --> 29:36.612
but aIso incIined toward
vioIent confrontation.

29:36.738 --> 29:39.406
Better find out who he is
in case I have to deaI with him.

29:43.995 --> 29:47.414
Armed with a phone number, obtaining
the mysterious text messenger's lD

29:47.540 --> 29:49.750
wasn"t too hard, but is he a threat?

29:51.795 --> 29:55.547
Christopher Harlow.
Known aIias for Jose Garza.

29:55.673 --> 29:58.217
Narcotics, armed robbery,

29:58.343 --> 30:01.303
and currently a fugitive
from justice for murder.

30:01.429 --> 30:03.096
Approach with caution.

30:17.111 --> 30:19.488
This guy could be trouble
if he has knowledge

30:19.614 --> 30:21.824
of a certain cabin in the Everglades.

30:27.455 --> 30:28.789
I'm safe.

30:30.083 --> 30:31.708
Happy trails, Harlow.

30:43.304 --> 30:44.763
Deb?

30:44.889 --> 30:46.807
Fuck! Sneak much?

30:46.933 --> 30:49.560
Sorry. l wanted to ask you something.

30:50.937 --> 30:52.813
That is some big hair.

30:52.939 --> 30:55.274
Hard to believe he's our guy.

30:55.400 --> 30:59.236
Amazing how easy it is to hide
who you are from people, huh?

30:59.362 --> 31:00.737
Not that easy.

31:04.325 --> 31:06.827
l was thinking about your birthday.

31:06.953 --> 31:08.787
You got, like, three months.

31:08.913 --> 31:10.622
Just get me a gift certificate at Amazon.

31:10.748 --> 31:14.042
Good to know, but the birthday
l was thinking about was. . .

31:14.168 --> 31:16.378
when Dad threw the beer bottle.

31:18.715 --> 31:20.299
Jesus.

31:21.384 --> 31:24.344
Out of the blue. Dex.
What brought that up?

31:25.471 --> 31:28.724
Harry's been on my mind lately.

31:28.850 --> 31:30.767
l was trying to remember. . .

31:32.061 --> 31:34.104
Matthews came over that night, right?

31:35.189 --> 31:36.648
Yeah.

31:36.774 --> 31:38.859
He and Dad got in a fight.

31:38.985 --> 31:42.362
l ended up wiping beer off the walls.
Happy birthday to me.

31:44.282 --> 31:47.326
A killer went free.
That would upset any cop, right?

31:48.536 --> 31:49.912
Nothing weird about that.

31:50.038 --> 31:53.540
No. it wasn't weird. lt was
just another example of Dad's priorities.

31:53.666 --> 31:56.084
Kids versus case. Case always won.

31:57.754 --> 32:00.547
Did he say anything else about it to you?

32:01.799 --> 32:02.966
Right.

32:03.092 --> 32:05.928
Dad sitting down with me
to have a heart-to-heart.

32:06.054 --> 32:07.763
Not that l didn't want to.

32:10.266 --> 32:12.225
Maybe you should have told him that.

32:12.352 --> 32:13.393
Yeah.

32:15.146 --> 32:16.730
Maybe.

32:16.856 --> 32:18.482
Deb had it rough.

32:18.608 --> 32:21.360
Harry had his hands full
teaching me a trade.

32:23.154 --> 32:25.656
But was there something else
going on with him,

32:25.782 --> 32:28.867
or was Doakes just trying to shake me up?

32:28.993 --> 32:31.370
l need to know if there's more to the story.

32:39.420 --> 32:41.421
There's a complication l don't need.

32:43.716 --> 32:46.051
Hey, baby, what brings you back?

32:46.177 --> 32:50.514
l have two more walls at home
waiting for your expertise as a painter.

32:50.640 --> 32:52.891
Oh. there's nothing
l'd like to do more, but. . .

32:54.143 --> 32:56.478
But what, darling?

32:56.604 --> 32:58.146
l'm picking up Auri, remember?

32:58.272 --> 33:01.024
We're meeting Dexter and Rita
at the beach.

33:01.150 --> 33:04.444
You know, l have a friend
at Miami Art Museum

33:04.570 --> 33:07.280
teaches an incredible children's class.

33:07.407 --> 33:08.448
Air-conditioned.

33:10.201 --> 33:12.619
You could bring the whole gang if you like.

33:15.289 --> 33:17.666
You mind if l take a rain check?

33:17.792 --> 33:21.461
You know, with your history with Dexter,
it might be a little awkward.

33:21.587 --> 33:23.672
He's trying to work things out with Rita.

33:26.134 --> 33:27.467
Oh, is he now?

33:28.970 --> 33:32.139
Well, you have a great day.

33:33.975 --> 33:36.309
And watch out
for those sand fleas.

33:40.273 --> 33:42.190
Damn. She better be worth it.

34:09.510 --> 34:12.888
What was that shit last night?
Some kind of fucking scare tactic?

34:13.014 --> 34:17.184
You said something before you passed out
about my father. What was it?

34:18.019 --> 34:21.438
l don't know. What was it?
l was kind of drugged at the time.

34:23.316 --> 34:25.025
Don't test me, Sergeant.

34:26.319 --> 34:27.486
l could have killed you.

34:27.612 --> 34:29.905
l didn't.

34:30.990 --> 34:33.075
You didn't because you can't.

34:33.201 --> 34:36.036
l've had time to think about this, Morgan.

34:36.162 --> 34:39.623
l don't fit that code
you were talking about, do l?

34:41.542 --> 34:44.086
At first l thought the Butcher
only went after criminals

34:44.212 --> 34:47.422
because nobody gives a goddamn
what happens to 'em, but now. . .

34:47.548 --> 34:49.716
now l think you got a conscience.

34:49.842 --> 34:51.676
Of course l have a conscience.

34:53.304 --> 34:55.555
l left you a place to shit, didn't l?

35:02.897 --> 35:04.773
lt's a small conscience.

35:04.899 --> 35:06.942
You're actually angry.

35:07.068 --> 35:09.820
l've never seen you angry, Morgan.
This is good.

35:09.946 --> 35:12.781
l might live to see the outside
of this goddamn cabin after all.

35:12.907 --> 35:15.867
What'd you say about Harry?
The words "whack job" were involved.

35:15.993 --> 35:17.410
Oh, yeah.

35:20.206 --> 35:22.290
ls that what you're worried about, man?

35:22.416 --> 35:25.293
l guess it would bother me, too,
if it were my old man.

35:25.419 --> 35:27.087
Sergeant.

35:28.422 --> 35:29.714
OK. What the fuck?

35:32.260 --> 35:35.679
You know how l've been looking
into your past. right?

35:35.805 --> 35:37.764
That's why you're in a cage.

35:39.100 --> 35:41.643
l found something
l wasn't supposed to see.

35:43.312 --> 35:44.813
lt's about your father's death.

35:44.939 --> 35:47.315
Heart disease, big mystery.

35:47.441 --> 35:49.818
No, the mystery's bigger than that.

35:49.944 --> 35:53.155
And someone up high didn't want it solved.

35:56.284 --> 35:57.701
You're lying.

35:58.911 --> 36:01.830
lt was buried deep, but it was there.

36:04.500 --> 36:05.792
What was there?

36:11.716 --> 36:16.136
How about we go outside and talk about this,
man? l could use some air.

36:19.140 --> 36:23.143
- Not gonna happen.
- Yeah, well, then the mystery remains.

36:33.863 --> 36:37.073
l'm sure special ops taught you
to rattle your captor.

36:37.200 --> 36:41.828
but l should warn you, Sergeant,
you can't play on my feelings.

36:43.289 --> 36:44.998
l don't have any.

36:46.292 --> 36:47.792
Oh, really?

36:47.919 --> 36:50.086
Who's lying now?

36:59.513 --> 37:02.182
Sit down. That's it.

37:07.855 --> 37:09.439
Well.

37:10.483 --> 37:11.900
Hello, Dexter.

37:12.026 --> 37:15.320
- Captain.
- Please. l'm a civilian today. Call me Tom.

37:16.530 --> 37:18.490
You start your round yet?

37:20.534 --> 37:23.495
l'm afraid Bayshore is
a little outside my pay scale.

37:24.538 --> 37:27.874
so. what brings you all the way
out here on a Saturday morning?

37:28.876 --> 37:32.462
l want to know if there was anything unusual
about my father's death.

37:35.049 --> 37:37.050
Go on ahead. l'll catch up.

37:41.347 --> 37:44.057
His heart gave out. You know that.

37:44.183 --> 37:46.059
l heard there was more to it.

37:46.185 --> 37:47.185
From whom?

37:47.311 --> 37:49.688
Does it matter?

37:53.818 --> 37:56.569
l guess it was inevitable
you'd find out one of these days.

37:56.696 --> 37:59.614
You know, Harry was a good friend.

37:59.740 --> 38:01.783
He was a great cop.

38:01.909 --> 38:03.159
But. . .

38:04.203 --> 38:05.954
it's a tough job.

38:06.080 --> 38:08.206
lt can wear on even the best of us.

38:09.458 --> 38:13.920
- My father was always firmly in control.
- That he was. but towards the end...

38:15.923 --> 38:17.757
Look, Dexter.

38:17.883 --> 38:19.843
The system doesn't always work.

38:21.137 --> 38:23.346
Sometimes they get away.
You know that.

38:24.640 --> 38:28.101
And that just got harder and harder
for Harry to deal with.

38:29.186 --> 38:31.271
l think that's what did him in in the end.

38:32.606 --> 38:33.690
What did?

38:39.280 --> 38:41.114
What am l missing here?

38:46.120 --> 38:47.871
He killed himself, Dexter.

38:51.625 --> 38:52.792
How?

38:53.919 --> 38:56.880
The autopsy showed an overdose
of his heart medicine.

39:00.343 --> 39:03.345
That happens all the time.
People accidentally take the wrong dose.

39:03.471 --> 39:05.889
He called me the day before he died.

39:06.015 --> 39:09.059
He asked me to keep an eye
on you and your sister.

39:09.185 --> 39:12.479
l didn't realize what that call meant
until he was gone.

39:13.773 --> 39:16.983
So l made sure that autopsy
never saw the light of day.

39:17.109 --> 39:21.196
l was looking out for the two of you
like l said l would.

39:27.912 --> 39:29.662
l'm sorry, Dexter.

39:32.792 --> 39:36.378
Listen. why don't we go to the club
and have a drink? We can talk some more.

39:36.504 --> 39:37.712
No.

39:38.839 --> 39:40.548
Thank you.

39:45.221 --> 39:47.389
The legendary Harry Morgan,

39:47.515 --> 39:50.725
force forjustice, architect of all that l am.

39:50.851 --> 39:52.894
Suicide.

39:53.020 --> 39:55.146
It doesn't make sense.

40:00.444 --> 40:02.487
Special Agent Lundy.

40:03.572 --> 40:05.115
l have good news.

40:05.241 --> 40:06.991
l could use it. What do you got?

40:07.118 --> 40:11.538
Proof that James Doakes
can't possibly be the Bay Harbor Butcher.

40:13.499 --> 40:15.750
You're looking at
the documentation of a stakeout

40:15.876 --> 40:19.337
that James and l were on
as partners seven years ago.

40:20.714 --> 40:22.173
Very detailed.

40:22.299 --> 40:26.052
We were doing surveillance when one of your
victims, Larry Mueller, went missing.

40:26.178 --> 40:30.348
James and l were holed up
in a motel room 24/7 for two weeks.

40:30.474 --> 40:34.310
He didn't have time to piss,
much less abduct and murder a man.

40:38.399 --> 40:41.568
l respect your compassion
for a friend and colleague. . .

40:43.154 --> 40:45.238
but l'm afraid this proves nothing.

40:46.699 --> 40:49.284
No, it proves that he was with me.

40:49.410 --> 40:54.581
lt's all here. specific dates and times.
These are my personal stakeout logs.

40:54.707 --> 40:58.793
And they're very thorough,
but l can't use them.

41:00.254 --> 41:02.839
No. No. This is bullshit.

41:02.965 --> 41:06.676
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
You can't just ignore legitimate evidence.

41:07.595 --> 41:11.139
l can, and l will ignore it
because you gave me no choice, lady.

41:11.265 --> 41:15.018
Those are your personal logs,
and your credibility was compromised

41:15.144 --> 41:16.644
the second you failed to report a phone call

41:16.770 --> 41:19.939
from the subject
of a goddamn FBl manhunt.

41:20.065 --> 41:22.108
lt was a breach of protocol and ethics,

41:22.234 --> 41:24.444
and you're lucky
l don't bring you up on charges.

41:25.988 --> 41:29.824
What really pisses me off
is you might be right.

41:29.950 --> 41:31.826
But in trying to protect your friend,

41:31.952 --> 41:35.121
you blew the best shot we had
of bringing him in from the cold.

41:37.166 --> 41:40.418
Come back to me
if you find evidence l can use.

41:47.134 --> 41:49.969
l smell. . .monster meat!

41:56.227 --> 41:58.228
l got you!

42:04.777 --> 42:06.110
l tagged you.

42:06.237 --> 42:07.695
So?

42:07.821 --> 42:09.405
So you're a monster now.

42:10.991 --> 42:12.242
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:12.368 --> 42:14.661
Come on, socio. l'm sucking gas here.

42:15.913 --> 42:17.997
Sorry, Angel. My leg's a little tight today.

42:29.009 --> 42:30.843
lt's too soon, isn't it?

42:30.970 --> 42:33.137
For this.

42:33.264 --> 42:34.556
For us.

42:34.682 --> 42:36.057
No.

42:37.893 --> 42:39.978
Rita, that's not it at all.

42:41.021 --> 42:42.814
Then what is it?

42:44.400 --> 42:46.067
Dexter?

42:51.782 --> 42:54.951
l always thought my father died
of heart disease.

42:57.955 --> 42:59.789
And l just found out that's not true.

42:59.915 --> 43:01.833
He committed suicide.

43:04.086 --> 43:05.878
Oh, God.

43:06.005 --> 43:09.674
l don't know why he would do that to himself.

43:13.053 --> 43:14.554
Or me.

43:20.060 --> 43:21.436
Oh, baby.

43:28.777 --> 43:30.778
Whatever Harry did and why,

43:30.904 --> 43:32.947
l can't let it distract me from my mission,

43:33.073 --> 43:34.866
not when freedom is so cIose.

43:39.622 --> 43:42.040
"'Found out where your cabin is.
On my way.

43:42.166 --> 43:44.459
"'l want my fucking snow."'

43:45.502 --> 43:47.170
Shit.

43:53.510 --> 43:56.387
No one appreciates uninvited house guests.

43:59.141 --> 44:02.352
Unless l can make the problem
part of my solution.

44:18.369 --> 44:19.869
Are you Chad?

44:19.995 --> 44:22.372
lt depends on what you're looking for.

44:22.498 --> 44:24.332
Tim said to come to you.

44:26.835 --> 44:28.419
The Rohypnol.

44:28.545 --> 44:30.296
Roofies?

44:30.422 --> 44:31.714
You?

44:34.635 --> 44:36.552
You're just not my normal kind of customer.

44:36.679 --> 44:38.554
Oh, do stop talking.

44:43.811 --> 44:45.687
Good luck with that.

44:58.659 --> 45:00.493
Thanks for coming.

45:04.498 --> 45:06.374
l thought we should talk.

45:06.500 --> 45:09.293
No. l should talk.

45:09.420 --> 45:12.880
l mean, l yell a lot. . .

45:13.882 --> 45:16.384
and bitch and complain and. . .

45:16.510 --> 45:20.722
l keep expecting people to just guess
what l want. but l never really say it.

45:22.516 --> 45:24.350
l'd like to hear it.

45:29.690 --> 45:33.025
You asked me what l thought would happen
when the case ended.

45:34.486 --> 45:36.612
And the truth is. . .

45:36.739 --> 45:38.698
l had no fucking idea.

45:40.075 --> 45:41.617
And that was. . .

45:41.744 --> 45:44.579
exciting, you know?

45:44.705 --> 45:47.123
The not knowing. . .

45:47.249 --> 45:49.417
what might happen, what could be.

45:49.543 --> 45:53.421
lt was all possibility.

45:55.507 --> 45:59.051
And when you just assumed that we ended
when the case ended...

46:01.972 --> 46:03.347
you crushed that.

46:07.269 --> 46:09.479
And l want it back.

46:13.066 --> 46:16.027
Want to know what l thought would happen
when the case ended?

46:16.153 --> 46:17.111
What?

46:17.237 --> 46:22.658
l thought the novelty of my AARP discount
would wear off and you'd get tired of me.

46:24.036 --> 46:25.578
Oh, my God.

46:28.248 --> 46:30.333
That's the sweetest thing you've ever said.

46:43.347 --> 46:44.555
Lundy.

46:49.102 --> 46:52.355
- On our way.
- What do we got?

46:52.481 --> 46:55.233
A hit on one of Doakes's false lDs
at a car rental agency.

46:55.359 --> 46:58.486
- Make, model and licence plate.
- Let's go.

47:10.958 --> 47:12.708
My hero.

47:14.795 --> 47:16.838
This place looks like brand new.

47:18.048 --> 47:22.051
lt's my pleasure, though l feel a little loopy from
the fumes.

47:25.222 --> 47:28.182
So how was your day at the beach?

47:30.227 --> 47:31.394
Auri wore me out.

47:31.520 --> 47:33.271
You ever try and run in the sand?

47:33.397 --> 47:36.816
l never run. You're a better man than me.

47:36.942 --> 47:39.151
l'm glad you think so.

47:40.362 --> 47:42.238
And how are Dexter and Rita?

47:43.949 --> 47:45.908
Things are good for them.

47:47.244 --> 47:48.244
l mean. . .

47:48.370 --> 47:51.372
l think they're gonna work things out.

48:05.846 --> 48:08.890
We going somewhere?

48:11.727 --> 48:15.605
Well, you know, l've been trying to hold off.

48:19.026 --> 48:19.942
But. . .

48:20.068 --> 48:22.945
l don't know. l don't want to any more.

48:23.071 --> 48:25.239
l think it's time.

48:26.992 --> 48:28.534
l need you.

48:29.703 --> 48:31.454
You can have me.

48:32.247 --> 48:35.124
The thing is. . . l like it rough.

48:35.250 --> 48:36.584
Yeah?

48:41.590 --> 48:43.132
OK.

48:48.221 --> 48:50.765
- Who the fuck is that?
- Some guy l picked up in a bar.

48:52.976 --> 48:55.770
He's a known murderer
and your final victim.

48:57.314 --> 49:01.359
- You're not gonna do what l think you are?
- There's no point in hiding it now, Sergeant.

49:01.485 --> 49:07.114
Your life is going to rest in the hands of the
criminal justice system you put your faith in.

49:08.784 --> 49:10.701
l wish you the best of luck.

49:10.827 --> 49:13.871
Come on, Morgan. We were
just getting somewhere. you and me.

49:13.997 --> 49:16.916
You ain't got to do this.
Come on. We'll find a way.

49:19.294 --> 49:21.045
l'm afraid this is the only way for me.

49:23.298 --> 49:26.550
Excuse me. l need to get my supplies.

49:26.677 --> 49:28.511
Morgan!

49:39.564 --> 49:42.441
You are a very bad girl.

49:46.989 --> 49:50.199
l'm only just getting started, baby.

49:51.451 --> 49:52.660
Be right back.

49:56.164 --> 49:57.331
Wow.

50:42.044 --> 50:43.794
Lila, you want a beer?

50:54.890 --> 50:56.265
Jesus.

51:04.858 --> 51:07.902
This is Detective Angel Batista
from Miami Metro Homicide.

51:08.028 --> 51:10.529
l need an ambulance.

51:14.576 --> 51:17.995
There is no way people
are gonna believe l did this shit.

51:18.121 --> 51:21.916
You were US Special Forces.
l'm sure you have done this.

51:22.042 --> 51:25.878
Wartime circumstances, heat of the battle, but
never cold-blooded, Morgan.

51:26.838 --> 51:28.798
l'm sure that made things easier for you.

51:29.800 --> 51:34.303
Morgan, goddamn it, you got a conscience,
man. You said it yourself.

51:34.429 --> 51:37.139
You go after killers.
you take out killers. l get that.

51:37.265 --> 51:39.642
But this? This is some sick-fuck ritual, man.

51:39.768 --> 51:41.185
You need help. Let me help you, man.

51:41.311 --> 51:44.230
Don't worry, l won't make you watch.
l'm not uncivilized.

51:44.356 --> 51:45.648
No. Morgan. Morgan, no!

51:45.774 --> 51:47.399
Morgan!

51:48.318 --> 51:50.986
You don't have to do this!
You don't have to kill this man!

51:51.113 --> 51:54.490
This man is a felon with a body count.

51:54.616 --> 51:58.160
- He brought it on himself.
- Morgan, turn him over to the law.

51:58.286 --> 51:59.912
l live by my father's law.

52:00.831 --> 52:02.123
No! Morgan!

52:02.249 --> 52:03.791
Morgan, don't do this!

52:12.134 --> 52:13.801
Oh, shit.

52:34.823 --> 52:39.285
Sorry it had to go down like this, Sergeant, but
there really was no other way.

52:43.665 --> 52:44.790
Sergeant?

52:48.503 --> 52:50.254
Stay away.

52:52.090 --> 52:54.383
Just stay away from me.

52:55.719 --> 53:00.723
I've heard those words before,
three days before my father's death.

53:03.894 --> 53:06.854
Oh. Hey, Dad.

53:09.357 --> 53:11.442
Look what l did.

53:13.695 --> 53:16.739
lt's Juan Ryness,
the pimp who killed that girl.

53:16.865 --> 53:19.366
l finally got him for you.

53:41.723 --> 53:44.725
Dad, what's wrong? Are you OK?

53:44.851 --> 53:47.603
Just stay away.

53:47.729 --> 53:48.729
Please.

53:48.855 --> 53:50.898
Stay away.

53:54.110 --> 53:55.861
It was me.

53:57.197 --> 53:59.323
The idea of a code was one thing,

53:59.449 --> 54:03.118
a grand idea, a noble cause.

54:03.245 --> 54:05.663
But the reality of it?

54:05.789 --> 54:08.207
Harry walked in on what he created...

54:09.876 --> 54:12.086
and he couIdn't Iive with himseIf.

54:21.221 --> 54:22.596
What, Morgan?

54:24.182 --> 54:25.891
What now?

54:28.103 --> 54:30.271
l killed my father.
