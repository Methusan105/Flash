00:02.298 --> 00:03.507
Previously on Dexter...

00:03.633 --> 00:06.510
What's this big break
in the Bay Harbor Butcher case?

00:06.636 --> 00:09.680
Masuka found algae
inside the garbage bags with the body.

00:09.806 --> 00:12.558
- lt's all about the rocks, baby.
- The rocks?

00:12.684 --> 00:14.768
Yeah, the algae we found on the rocks.

00:14.894 --> 00:17.062
The Butcher used them
to weigh his bags down.

00:17.188 --> 00:19.648
We're assuming he picked them up
where he docks his boat.

00:19.774 --> 00:21.150
October 3, 1 973,

00:21.276 --> 00:24.069
Laura Moser and three others
found chopped up with a chainsaw.

00:24.195 --> 00:27.948
A drug dealer didn't appreciate
Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

00:28.074 --> 00:30.284
What is in that report
Harry didn't want me to see?

00:30.410 --> 00:33.037
You were left there for days, starving,

00:33.163 --> 00:34.997
in blood two inches thick.

00:35.915 --> 00:38.751
- Dexter, this is my mother.
- Gail.

00:39.544 --> 00:42.129
He's hiding something. l'm sure of it.

00:43.757 --> 00:46.550
- Did you kill your wife?
- Yeah.

00:46.676 --> 00:48.385
Don't make me do it, Curtis!

00:53.975 --> 00:55.476
Debra, actually.

00:55.602 --> 00:57.144
l'm Gabriel.

00:57.270 --> 00:59.730
Oh, you're into the kinky stuff, huh?

00:59.856 --> 01:02.274
No, the last guy l had sex with
tried to kill me.

01:03.985 --> 01:06.278
- Oh, there's my sponsor.
- Really? Where?

01:11.951 --> 01:14.453
Dexter, meet Dexter.

01:14.579 --> 01:17.164
l'm gonna help the two of you
get to know each other.

01:17.290 --> 01:20.918
You're going to tell me
all your deepest, darkest secrets.

01:21.044 --> 01:22.669
But the person who did this. . .

01:22.796 --> 01:25.547
ls a person just like me. . .

01:25.673 --> 01:26.757
like you.

01:26.883 --> 01:29.218
We're all good, Dexter,

01:29.344 --> 01:30.761
and we're all evil.

01:30.887 --> 01:33.388
This woman sees me.

01:33.515 --> 01:35.933
She doesn"t know it,
but she's looking behind the mask,

01:36.059 --> 01:37.810
and she's not turning away.

03:32.759 --> 03:35.052
Here's your cappuccino
and scone, ma'am.

03:35.178 --> 03:37.721
Can l help the next person, please?

03:37.847 --> 03:39.973
Most people hate long lines.

03:40.099 --> 03:42.100
Hi. Can l have a coffee and a Danish?

03:42.227 --> 03:45.062
The bank, grocery store,

03:45.188 --> 03:47.022
coffee bar.

03:48.107 --> 03:49.149
Not me.

03:53.154 --> 03:55.781
Buddy, you mind?

03:59.285 --> 04:01.370
Want a real glimpse
of human nature?

04:01.496 --> 04:04.498
Stand in the way
of someone's mocha Iatte.

04:04.624 --> 04:08.460
lt also reminds me that the good people
of Miami and I aren't so different.

04:08.586 --> 04:11.088
They have no more idea
of what I am than I do.

04:11.214 --> 04:14.675
- All l'm saying is these guys had it coming.
- so what. just chop them all up?

04:14.801 --> 04:17.844
As far as l'm concerned, whoever's
doing this shit deserves a medal.

04:17.971 --> 04:21.765
- That'll be 4.20. ma'am.
- Sorry, my wallet's in here somewhere.

04:21.891 --> 04:23.934
Oh, l got it.

04:24.060 --> 04:26.311
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. l insist.

04:26.437 --> 04:28.772
Thank you so much.
You're a godsend.

04:42.453 --> 04:45.080
Oh, sweet Mary,
mother of fuck, that's good!

04:45.206 --> 04:47.624
l think you might have
broken a commandment there.

04:49.335 --> 04:51.795
Burning the late-night oil
with the task force?

04:51.921 --> 04:54.715
Hardly. Till we get the report back
on the algae.

04:54.841 --> 04:57.092
it's just one big reach-around.

04:57.927 --> 05:02.222
The rocks l used to submerge my victims
may eventually sink me too,

05:02.348 --> 05:06.643
but if l'm learning anything in recovery,
it's one day at a time.

05:06.769 --> 05:09.021
Bay Harbor Butcher.

05:10.106 --> 05:12.566
Give me one shot,
l'd put a bullet in the fucker's head.

05:13.401 --> 05:16.278
- You really feel that way?
- He's killing people, Dex.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.781
lf Dad taught us one thing,
it's the value of life.

05:19.907 --> 05:23.201
Yeah, but l think we had
different homework assignments.

05:27.957 --> 05:30.834
Dispatch.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.919
See you tonight?

05:33.046 --> 05:35.464
l think l'm staying at Gabriel's.

05:37.300 --> 05:38.759
l thought you were taking it slow.

05:38.885 --> 05:40.344
We are.

05:40.470 --> 05:41.845
No sex, just cuddling.

05:41.971 --> 05:43.680
My little sister, the cuddler.

05:43.806 --> 05:45.307
l got a scalding beverage here, Dex.

05:45.433 --> 05:47.601
- Don't make me use it.
- Love you too.

05:59.280 --> 06:02.699
l never really got
the whole superhero thing.

06:02.825 --> 06:05.660
But lately, it does seem
we have a Iot in common.

06:05.787 --> 06:07.788
Tragic beginnings,

06:07.914 --> 06:09.915
secret identities,

06:10.041 --> 06:12.000
part human, part mutant...

06:12.835 --> 06:14.878
archenemies.

06:15.004 --> 06:17.130
Great way to start the day, huh?

06:17.256 --> 06:20.217
Shouldn't you be moving
back into your office, boss?

06:20.343 --> 06:21.510
l'd rather be here.

06:21.636 --> 06:25.389
- What can you tell me?
- Blunt force trauma.

06:25.515 --> 06:27.474
The blood spatter here on the counter

06:27.600 --> 06:30.227
suggests that this is where
the initial blow occurred.

06:30.353 --> 06:34.022
lmpact spatter is consistent
with repeated blows to the skull.

06:34.148 --> 06:39.736
The victim tried to flee to the back door
but didn't get far. Who is he?

06:39.862 --> 06:43.407
Denny Foster. Worked here.
Owner said he closed up nights.

06:43.533 --> 06:44.908
Robbery?

06:45.034 --> 06:47.285
There's no money missing from the register.

06:47.412 --> 06:50.622
Something this brutal is personal.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.875
Want to meet your prime suspect?

06:56.671 --> 06:58.588
He has fins.

06:58.714 --> 07:01.007
Should we call the Super Friends for help?

07:01.134 --> 07:03.510
No, l got it covered.

07:03.636 --> 07:06.138
l found traces of blood here on the base.

07:06.264 --> 07:09.599
l'll bring it back to my lab,
confirm it's the murder weapon.

07:09.725 --> 07:11.017
OK.

07:28.744 --> 07:32.497
- Got a next of kin we can notify?
- Denny was. like. a loner.

07:32.623 --> 07:33.999
Who's that?

07:34.125 --> 07:36.293
The Dark Defender.

07:36.419 --> 07:38.503
Denny had this great idea to put a spin

07:38.629 --> 07:41.047
on that vigilante serial killer
we got running around.

07:41.174 --> 07:44.468
Definitely has a nicer ring to it
than the Bay Harbor Butcher.

07:44.594 --> 07:46.678
l'm conducting an interview here, Morgan.

07:46.804 --> 07:50.682
Denny was trying to set up
the Dark Defender as a graphic novel.

07:50.808 --> 07:55.145
"Stalker of the night, his blade of vengeance
turns wrong into right."

07:57.857 --> 07:59.566
l need some air.

08:02.653 --> 08:04.237
Thanks a lot.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.752
The Dark Defender.

08:19.879 --> 08:22.631
No, Miami"s too hot for all that leather.

08:22.757 --> 08:26.426
The first time l got high, l was 1 5.

08:26.552 --> 08:29.471
No, that's not right. l was 14.

08:29.597 --> 08:31.973
No, wait.

08:33.100 --> 08:36.645
l was definitely 1 5
'cause it was my freshman year.

08:37.647 --> 08:41.358
l remember now
'cause l was dating Susie Mitchell.

08:41.484 --> 08:46.196
We broke up 'cause l called her
by her sister Sharon's name once.

08:46.322 --> 08:48.490
She hated when people did that.

08:49.617 --> 08:52.953
What she didn't know
was that l had a thing for Sharon.

08:53.079 --> 08:57.165
Sharon didn't want anything
to do with me. so...

08:58.167 --> 08:59.960
Don't you hurt my baby!

09:01.837 --> 09:03.255
Don't you dare!

09:03.381 --> 09:05.882
Don't look. Close your eyes.

09:06.008 --> 09:07.842
Mommy loves you.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.185
Don't you hurt my baby!

09:49.719 --> 09:51.386
lt's OK, Mom.

09:52.888 --> 09:54.055
You're safe.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.232
That's hot.

10:06.485 --> 10:08.570
Where did you drift off to, anyway?

10:10.072 --> 10:12.574
l was having this bizarre dream. . .

10:13.576 --> 10:15.744
about my mother.

10:15.870 --> 10:17.120
Say no more.

10:17.246 --> 10:18.913
Oedipus complex.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.332
Explains a lot.

10:24.253 --> 10:28.131
so. what were you doing
to your mother in this dream?

10:28.257 --> 10:29.674
Saving her life.

10:31.302 --> 10:33.637
She was murdered.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.805
When l was a boy.

10:35.931 --> 10:37.349
l was there.

10:37.475 --> 10:39.684
l saw it. . .happen.

10:43.356 --> 10:45.357
l've never told anyone that before.

10:47.860 --> 10:49.444
Come on.

10:55.201 --> 11:00.121
Have you thought maybe you weren't
saving your mother in this dream?

11:00.831 --> 11:03.208
Maybe you were saving yourself.

11:03.334 --> 11:06.086
That's not what happened.

11:06.212 --> 11:07.837
Don't be so sure.

11:07.963 --> 11:10.340
When l got clean,
all the seriously fucked-up reasons

11:10.466 --> 11:12.300
l used in the first place began to surface.

11:13.678 --> 11:16.262
This could be where your addiction started.

11:19.475 --> 11:21.976
l hope whoever did it got the bloody chair.

11:24.146 --> 11:26.856
There were three men.

11:30.111 --> 11:32.028
l don't know what happened to them.

11:33.322 --> 11:38.243
Dexter, if these guys are behind bars,
you need to confront them.

11:38.369 --> 11:40.829
lf they're dead, hell,
go piss on their graves,

11:40.955 --> 11:44.332
but you need to do whatever it takes
so you can get closure.

11:46.085 --> 11:48.169
How else do you expect to get better?

11:49.296 --> 11:51.423
l never expected to get better.

12:16.031 --> 12:18.074
My meth lab's in the sock drawer.

12:20.244 --> 12:22.036
This looks bad, doesn't it?

12:22.163 --> 12:23.121
Yeah.

12:23.247 --> 12:24.706
The cute panties help.

12:24.832 --> 12:27.459
Would you believe
l'm trying to get to know you better?

12:27.585 --> 12:30.044
By rifling through my stuff?

12:33.340 --> 12:35.425
l'm retarded.

12:38.053 --> 12:40.221
And you've been so great.

12:48.147 --> 12:51.649
You know how l told you
the last guy l had sex with tried to kill me?

12:54.111 --> 12:56.237
Well, that was kind of true.

12:58.324 --> 13:00.492
He was the lce-Truck Killer.

13:02.495 --> 13:03.745
Who is he?

13:08.250 --> 13:09.501
Not fucking funny.

13:09.627 --> 13:13.129
- Come on, Deb. l never heard of him.
- stop it. Don't screw with me.

13:13.255 --> 13:17.008
Deb, l've been in El Salvador
visiting family for six months.

13:19.220 --> 13:21.095
l just got back.

13:23.182 --> 13:26.392
You sound like every other
jackass out there who thinks...

13:27.436 --> 13:29.229
l'm a trophy fuck.

13:31.106 --> 13:34.108
You had no idea who l was
when you hit on me at the gym?

13:34.235 --> 13:36.820
When l hit on you at the gym,

13:36.946 --> 13:40.114
it was because l thought you were hot.

13:48.624 --> 13:49.916
Good answer.

14:08.102 --> 14:09.978
So, what's hot about me?

14:11.355 --> 14:13.565
- lt's in the corner!
- Don't hurt it!

14:13.691 --> 14:16.985
- Oh, God, Dexter, be careful.
- Use a broom. lt might have rabies.

14:18.362 --> 14:21.865
- Oh, it's right there! Get it!
- Watch it!

14:21.991 --> 14:23.491
Careful.

14:24.285 --> 14:28.037
Yay! All right! He got it!

14:30.749 --> 14:31.875
My hero.

14:34.086 --> 14:37.505
All right, kids. Show's over.
Come on. Let's get dressed for school.

14:45.890 --> 14:48.391
So, any armadillos in Michigan?

14:50.019 --> 14:51.561
No.

14:51.687 --> 14:56.691
We didn't used to have any in Florida,
now it's like an invasion. "Armadillos attack! "

14:58.485 --> 15:00.486
You think you're charming, don't you?

15:01.697 --> 15:04.866
l'm sure that probably works for you
most of the time. lt did for Paul.

15:06.327 --> 15:08.745
l know what you are.

15:10.205 --> 15:11.539
Confused?

15:12.917 --> 15:14.959
l found these in a drawer.

15:15.628 --> 15:17.754
Tell me. Dexter.
why would Rita print out

15:17.880 --> 15:20.590
Narcotics Anonymous literature
if Paul's dead?

15:23.636 --> 15:26.721
Because recently l entered the program.

15:26.847 --> 15:28.097
l knew it.

15:28.223 --> 15:30.433
l would never hurt Rita like Paul did.

15:30.559 --> 15:32.393
l'm not gonna give you that chance.

15:32.519 --> 15:36.272
lt's just a matter of time
before you pull her under just like he did.

15:36.398 --> 15:38.483
Have you discussed any of this with Rita?

15:38.609 --> 15:41.778
No, but l will if you don't
do the right thing here.

15:41.904 --> 15:45.406
lf you truly care about this family
like you say you do.

15:45.532 --> 15:50.078
you will let my daughter
and those sweet children go.

15:53.123 --> 15:56.626
The algae on the rocks
was exposed to both zinc and lead.

15:56.752 --> 16:00.630
There are only three marinas near Bay Harbor
which have restricted water flow

16:00.756 --> 16:04.509
that would account for such high levels
of these specific pollutants.

16:04.635 --> 16:08.554
Turkey Creek, Sunset Keys,
and Coral Cove.

16:08.681 --> 16:11.474
Anyone familiar with these marinas?

16:11.600 --> 16:14.894
Coral Cove is where my dad kept our
family boat. My brother uses the slip now.

16:15.020 --> 16:16.771
l'll bet half the force has boats there.

16:16.897 --> 16:21.609
lt's one of the few marinas left
that's affordable on a cop's salary.

16:22.611 --> 16:25.989
Morgan and l will take that one.
Sodoquist and Lee, Turkey Creek is yours.

16:26.115 --> 16:28.741
And Hill and Ramos.
you've got Sunset Keys.

16:28.867 --> 16:31.369
The rest of you will stay here
with Detective Batista.

16:31.495 --> 16:34.080
When the team reports in,
relay the information back to me.

16:34.206 --> 16:37.208
lf our killer's boat is out there, let's find it.

16:42.172 --> 16:45.341
Sorry it took so long. Couldn't seem
to find any other crime scene files.

16:45.467 --> 16:48.886
Probably lost in storage somewhere.
Anyway, that's what l was able to dig up.

16:49.013 --> 16:50.346
Just one file?

16:50.472 --> 16:52.682
There were three men arrested
for those murders.

16:52.808 --> 16:55.560
Well, one's deceased,
one's doing life without possibility.

16:55.686 --> 16:59.689
That's the only one that's still an open case.
Santos Jiminez.

16:59.815 --> 17:01.441
Why's it an open case?

17:01.567 --> 17:04.694
Jiminez turned state's evidence,
went into witness protection.

17:04.820 --> 17:07.071
There's a business address
in there for him.

17:07.197 --> 17:11.284
l guess after 34 years, he figures all the people
who want him dead are long gone.

17:11.410 --> 17:12.785
He figured wrong.

17:12.911 --> 17:16.122
lf you can't find what you need,
there's audio tapes with this file.

17:16.248 --> 17:18.916
- Tapes?
- Yeah, see that notation?

17:19.043 --> 17:22.837
There was a criminal informant
working a cocaine bust from the inside.

17:24.506 --> 17:26.382
- l'll take those too.
- OK.

17:27.468 --> 17:31.679
Harry always said, "'Never make things
personal. Clouds yourjudgment."'

17:31.805 --> 17:34.015
But l've been living in a fog way too long.

17:34.141 --> 17:37.185
Today is Friday, September 28, 1 973.

17:37.311 --> 17:39.395
This is Detective Harry Morgan.

17:40.355 --> 17:41.314
Dad.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.523
Case fiIe...

17:42.649 --> 17:44.734
l can't fucking do this any more!

17:44.860 --> 17:47.904
I have to know when
the next shipment's coming in, Laura.

17:48.030 --> 17:50.865
Laura Moser...my mother.

17:50.991 --> 17:52.992
l can't take this any more.

17:53.118 --> 17:54.660
Harry, l'm so scared.

17:54.787 --> 17:58.206
Everything's going to be OK.
You just need to calm down.

17:58.332 --> 18:02.043
l already took the cocaine as evidence.
just like you asked. Why isn't that enough?

18:02.169 --> 18:05.046
lf we want Estrada and his men behind bars,

18:05.172 --> 18:07.799
we have to catch them in the act
at the shipyard.

18:07.925 --> 18:11.427
He's gonna find out.
and then he's gonna kill me.

18:12.888 --> 18:14.347
Harry, listen to me.

18:14.473 --> 18:17.183
l think someone may have
followed us to the park.

18:17.309 --> 18:20.186
lf we were followed.
l would have noticed.

18:21.772 --> 18:24.357
l just need you to hold out a little longer.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.653
- This will all be over soon.
- OK.

18:29.488 --> 18:31.280
l need to pick up Brian at school.

18:31.406 --> 18:33.574
l won't let anything happen to you.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.368
Or your boys.

18:40.082 --> 18:42.125
You have my word.

18:43.335 --> 18:45.962
Harry broke his word.

18:46.088 --> 18:48.714
He wasn't caIIed to that crime scene
by chance.

18:48.841 --> 18:50.842
It was his case.

18:50.968 --> 18:53.094
Laura Moser was his informant.

18:53.220 --> 18:54.929
Harry knew my mother.

18:57.808 --> 19:02.145
Our suspect is six-two,
380 pounds, Hispanic,

19:02.271 --> 19:04.480
drives a 1 971 Ford pickup.

19:04.606 --> 19:06.357
Circulate his DMV photo.

19:10.612 --> 19:11.779
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:11.905 --> 19:13.823
- l've got good news.
- Me too.

19:13.949 --> 19:16.701
Turns out our vic, Foster, he had a blog.

19:16.827 --> 19:20.705
He was in some online geek flame war
with a guy calling himself Corndude.

19:20.831 --> 19:23.708
The DA finally signed off on your review.

19:23.834 --> 19:25.251
There won't be any charges.

19:25.377 --> 19:28.171
This Corndude's real name
is Benjamin Alvaro.

19:32.134 --> 19:34.677
Anyone from the shoot team
talk to you about counseling?

19:34.803 --> 19:37.597
Why the fuck would
l need counseling?

19:37.723 --> 19:39.640
'Cause you shot a man last week, James.

19:39.766 --> 19:42.268
That's two shootings
in less than six months.

19:42.394 --> 19:44.020
Come on, it's got to take its toll.

19:44.146 --> 19:46.856
l'm fine, but thanks anyway.

19:46.982 --> 19:51.527
The sushi place next door has a security
camera that covers the parking lot.

19:51.653 --> 19:54.697
You know.
department's chaplain's got a good ear.

19:54.823 --> 19:56.532
Maria, can we stay on the goddamn point?

19:56.658 --> 20:01.120
The camera caught the licence plate of a green
and white pickup. lt belongs to Alvaro.

20:01.246 --> 20:04.540
Timecode puts him here
after the shop closed.

20:04.666 --> 20:07.210
So send some unis
to stake out Alvaro's house,

20:07.336 --> 20:10.922
- and you and l will take where he works.
- No, it's OK. l've got Simms and Giles on it.

20:11.048 --> 20:13.216
- l got backup.
- Come on!

20:13.342 --> 20:14.634
lt'll be like old times.

20:18.805 --> 20:21.057
Nina, l just got a call from my attorney.

20:21.183 --> 20:23.809
We need to talk about
this visitation bullshit.

20:23.936 --> 20:26.187
Can you just try Dexter's office again?

20:26.313 --> 20:28.522
Miss, he's not picking up.

20:28.649 --> 20:30.316
Call me when you get this. Excuse me.

20:30.442 --> 20:32.610
Are you a friend of Dexter's?

20:32.736 --> 20:35.780
l'm his decorator.

20:35.906 --> 20:37.990
Love the hat.

20:39.868 --> 20:43.454
Terrence, give her a visitor's badge.
l'll take her up.

20:43.580 --> 20:46.249
Angel Batista. l'm Dexter's best friend.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.876
Nice to meet you, Angel Batista.

20:56.718 --> 21:00.763
My work requires me to be an expert
in analyzing patterns.

21:00.889 --> 21:03.683
Now a pattern keeps emerging
from my past

21:03.809 --> 21:06.143
that's aII too famiIiar...

21:06.937 --> 21:08.729
Harry lying to me.

21:08.855 --> 21:11.524
No wonder he destroyed the file
on my mother's death.

21:11.650 --> 21:14.944
lt wasn"t to protect me.
lt was to bury his own guilt.

21:16.863 --> 21:18.906
Look who l found.

21:22.995 --> 21:26.622
Listen, when you're done with him,
maybe you can come over to my place.

21:26.748 --> 21:28.958
lt's a mess. Needs a woman's touch.

21:29.084 --> 21:30.334
Yeah?

21:36.341 --> 21:38.509
What did you say to Angel?

21:38.635 --> 21:41.470
Dexter, these are amazing!

21:41.596 --> 21:44.140
Lila, you can't be in here.

21:44.266 --> 21:49.020
Did you find out what happened to the men
responsible for your mother's murder?

21:50.772 --> 21:53.316
Dead or in prison, except for one.

21:53.442 --> 21:57.153
He cut a deal.
Now he lives in Naples, Florida.

21:57.279 --> 21:59.447
He runs a tavern.

22:01.366 --> 22:03.576
And what are you gonna do about it?

22:07.956 --> 22:09.373
Not sure yet.

22:11.126 --> 22:14.754
And you're not the least bit pissed off
that this man got away with murder?

22:16.173 --> 22:17.423
No.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.718
You sure?

22:20.844 --> 22:22.636
Maybe a little.

22:22.763 --> 22:25.056
Then go and tell him.

22:26.391 --> 22:30.978
Healing is all about focusing your rage
on the person that's hurt you.

22:32.230 --> 22:36.692
Naples is, what. . .two hours away?
We could go tonight.

22:38.695 --> 22:40.196
OK.

22:40.322 --> 22:42.448
- Pick me up after work?
- All right.

22:43.992 --> 22:45.451
Can l have one of these?

22:45.577 --> 22:46.994
Sure.

22:55.003 --> 22:57.046
What is this stuff?

22:57.172 --> 22:58.881
lt's corn syrup and dye.

22:59.007 --> 23:01.342
lt's my own recipe.

23:04.513 --> 23:06.514
Not bad.

23:09.267 --> 23:10.309
Thank you.

23:18.110 --> 23:19.068
Oh, God!

23:19.194 --> 23:21.237
Who doesn't fix something like that?

23:21.363 --> 23:23.489
- You all right?
- Yeah.

23:23.615 --> 23:27.201
So, l'm thinking we're assuming our killer owns
a boat, but what if he's. . .

23:34.459 --> 23:36.752
How do you stand this Miami heat?

23:38.046 --> 23:39.630
Makes my toes swell up.

23:39.756 --> 23:44.885
Oh, so. . .anyway, l was thinking,
what if the killer's been renting a boat?

23:45.011 --> 23:46.720
l can cross-reference some names of. . .

23:46.847 --> 23:49.640
You like cucumber sandwiches,
Officer Morgan?

23:49.766 --> 23:50.891
l don't know.

23:51.017 --> 23:55.229
Anyway, we have some of the dates
of when the victims went missing.

23:56.898 --> 23:58.357
lt's all about the cream cheese.

23:59.818 --> 24:02.778
So we could cross-reference those dates
against the rental logs,

24:02.904 --> 24:04.530
and maybe the same names will pop up.

24:08.201 --> 24:11.036
Did you hear anything l just said?

24:11.163 --> 24:13.497
Not one word.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.042
lt's one o'clock.

24:17.169 --> 24:19.128
l always stop and eat lunch at one o'clock.

24:19.254 --> 24:21.172
You'll learn that about me.

24:22.299 --> 24:24.550
Why don't you sit down?

24:25.594 --> 24:27.887
You're welcome to consider it
an order if that helps.

24:38.732 --> 24:40.649
The shoes too.

24:40.775 --> 24:42.443
Shouldn't we be. . .

24:43.820 --> 24:45.988
l don't know, investigating the area?

24:47.491 --> 24:49.325
You're very fidgety.

24:49.451 --> 24:51.494
Anyone ever tell you that?

24:51.620 --> 24:53.621
Yes. My father.

24:54.748 --> 24:57.917
- You applying for the job?
- Just an observation.

24:59.169 --> 25:02.171
l'm sorry. l'm confused. Are you criticizing me
for wanting to do my job?

25:02.297 --> 25:05.508
Yes. lt's one o'clock.

25:10.514 --> 25:13.641
Look, the last time l was around boats,
a killer was kidnapping me,

25:13.767 --> 25:16.101
which might explain why
l'm living with my brother

25:16.228 --> 25:18.854
and snooping on my new boyfriend, so. . .

25:18.980 --> 25:22.191
forgive me for being a little fidgety,
but if it's lunch we're talking,

25:22.317 --> 25:26.195
l'm gonna eat a fat pork sandwich
and l'm sure as shit not gonna eat it here.

25:27.155 --> 25:28.489
- Debra.
- What?

25:29.824 --> 25:31.825
This isn't a commercial marina.

25:31.952 --> 25:34.703
l haven't seen a single rental lD
on any of these hulls.

25:34.829 --> 25:38.707
But l can see the upkeep
on this place is dismal.

25:38.833 --> 25:41.001
Unsecure perimeter, poor lighting.

25:42.045 --> 25:45.381
Come out here at night, no one would know
what the hell you're doing.

25:45.507 --> 25:48.217
That's why l'm going to order
24-hour surveillance on this marina

25:48.343 --> 25:50.135
and the two others.

25:52.013 --> 25:54.098
As soon as l finish my lunch.

26:27.716 --> 26:31.135
l finished my spatter report,
put in for a personal day,

26:31.261 --> 26:33.470
Ieft word with Rita.

26:33.597 --> 26:35.931
Naples, here l come.

26:36.057 --> 26:39.476
l can"t really focus my rage
on the man who killed my mother,

26:39.603 --> 26:41.687
not with Lila along for the ride.

26:42.772 --> 26:44.940
But l can prepare for the day when l do.

26:45.066 --> 26:47.109
Where are you off to so early?

26:47.235 --> 26:49.612
Getting out of town for the night.

26:49.738 --> 26:50.779
Don't wait up for me.

26:50.905 --> 26:53.282
- ln the middle of the week?
- Thought l'd. you know.

26:53.408 --> 26:56.994
- take the minivan out on the open road.
- Who are you?

26:57.120 --> 27:00.623
Good news is you got the place to yourself
if you want to tie up Gabriel again.

27:00.749 --> 27:03.083
Yeah, that one never fucking gets old.

27:03.209 --> 27:06.170
Call me when you get back.
l want to talk to you about Coral Cove.

27:06.296 --> 27:08.297
What about Coral Cove?

27:08.423 --> 27:10.174
The algae on the rocks sent us there.

27:10.300 --> 27:13.052
lf l were you, l would seriously
consider moving your boat.

27:13.178 --> 27:15.638
Security out there sucks ass.

27:15.764 --> 27:17.598
That's kind of the point.

27:19.225 --> 27:22.102
This little green algae
may as well be kryptonite.

27:22.228 --> 27:25.147
If it's ever traced back to me, I'II be heIpIess.

27:29.069 --> 27:31.362
ls this a rental?

27:31.488 --> 27:34.740
Nope, she's all mine.

27:37.452 --> 27:39.828
So your minivan's a she, is she?

27:41.206 --> 27:43.290
Your girlfriend must be jealous.

27:43.416 --> 27:45.334
ls she cool with you doing this?

27:45.460 --> 27:46.835
l didn't tell her.

27:49.214 --> 27:51.715
Rita's mom found out l'm in recovery.

27:51.841 --> 27:55.386
She wants me to leave Rita and the kids.

28:02.018 --> 28:04.561
She could be right.

28:05.730 --> 28:07.564
l can't abandon them.

28:07.691 --> 28:11.777
So, what about what you're gonna say
to this guy when you get there?

28:13.947 --> 28:15.864
l'm sure l'll think of something.

28:19.119 --> 28:22.287
Why don't you practice on me?

28:24.207 --> 28:26.291
l'd. . .rather not.

28:28.503 --> 28:30.003
Just try.

28:32.298 --> 28:33.716
Out loud.

28:40.598 --> 28:42.307
l feel like. . .

28:47.355 --> 28:49.064
you stole my life.

28:53.069 --> 28:54.153
And?

28:55.697 --> 28:57.906
l'm not the person l'm supposed to be.

29:05.498 --> 29:07.541
lt's like l'm hollow.

29:09.669 --> 29:11.295
That's good.

29:12.422 --> 29:13.756
Go on.

29:16.301 --> 29:17.968
l hide in plain sight. . .

29:22.056 --> 29:25.058
unable to reach out to people. . .

29:26.144 --> 29:27.561
close to me.

29:28.563 --> 29:29.772
l'm afraid. . .

29:33.318 --> 29:34.359
l'll hurt them.

29:38.198 --> 29:40.407
Like l've hurt so many others.

29:50.877 --> 29:53.420
This is what he made me become.

29:59.427 --> 30:01.720
Then that's what you should tell him.

30:09.813 --> 30:12.940
What do you remember most
about your mother?

30:18.154 --> 30:20.447
She had long hair.

30:21.699 --> 30:23.617
Soft. . .

30:25.495 --> 30:27.371
like her hands.

30:35.839 --> 30:37.422
That's all.

30:43.179 --> 30:44.721
Yup.

30:44.848 --> 30:46.557
Just like old times.

30:48.685 --> 30:50.727
You live for this and you know it.

30:53.439 --> 30:57.109
We could always get in the car
and pass the time like we used to.

30:57.235 --> 31:00.070
No. No.

31:01.239 --> 31:03.615
l'm not going down that road again.

31:03.741 --> 31:07.870
Code 1 ,
suspect's vehicle spotted, one on board.

31:07.996 --> 31:10.372
- Headed your way.
- Copy that.

31:10.498 --> 31:12.082
- l'll take lead.
- l got it.

31:12.208 --> 31:15.043
We don't want this guy to do anything stupid in
a crowd of people.

31:15.169 --> 31:17.963
Goddamn, that's what you out here for,
to baby-sit me?

31:18.089 --> 31:20.048
l'm out here because
l'm worried about you.

31:20.174 --> 31:22.968
How many fucking ways
do l have to tell you that l'm fine, Maria?

31:23.094 --> 31:26.889
Yeah, and that's what worries me.
You're fine with killing two men?

31:27.015 --> 31:28.891
- You're fine?
- Been more than two.

31:29.017 --> 31:31.643
This isn't the army, James.
This is my department.

31:31.769 --> 31:34.730
l need to know that you are fit for duty. That's
my job as a lieutenant!

31:34.856 --> 31:39.401
That's all you care about, is your job, even
if it meant doing Pascal's man to get it back.

31:45.783 --> 31:47.492
How did you know about Bertrand?

31:48.745 --> 31:50.537
l didn't for sure until just now.

31:52.874 --> 31:55.083
l know you. Maria.
We rode together for two years.

31:55.209 --> 31:56.960
When you want something, you get it.

31:57.086 --> 31:59.922
- Pascal was in your way.
- We're not talking about this.

32:00.048 --> 32:03.759
Oh, l see, you all up in everybody else's shit
as long as it ain't yours.

32:09.182 --> 32:11.058
There's Alvaro.

32:15.605 --> 32:18.565
- Wait until he gets out.
- How long you gonna keep wiping my ass?

32:18.691 --> 32:21.234
Until l see my old partner again.

32:23.947 --> 32:25.238
On my go.

32:30.620 --> 32:32.996
- On the ground!
- Hands where l can see, Alvaro!

32:33.122 --> 32:34.957
Remember, this is about you.

32:35.083 --> 32:36.291
Not about him.

32:36.417 --> 32:39.294
lt's all right if we get there
and you can't go through with this.

32:39.420 --> 32:40.379
l know.

32:40.505 --> 32:42.381
'Cause we can come back another time.

32:42.507 --> 32:43.840
No.

32:46.094 --> 32:48.595
l want to meet him tonight.

32:54.435 --> 32:58.021
This isn't art. This is cottage porn.

33:01.067 --> 33:03.068
lt's Rita.

33:05.238 --> 33:08.156
say no more.
l need to take a shower anyway.

33:08.282 --> 33:10.575
Don't leave without saying goodbye.

33:13.287 --> 33:14.496
Hi.

33:14.622 --> 33:18.291
Hey. lt's so good to hear your voice.
l was starting to get worried.

33:19.627 --> 33:22.087
- You still on the road?
- No, l just got in.

33:22.213 --> 33:24.631
Oh. Well, you said you'd call.

33:25.967 --> 33:26.925
Where are you?

33:27.051 --> 33:29.886
l decided to look up someone from my past.

33:30.013 --> 33:32.472
That's what suddenly came up?

33:32.598 --> 33:34.391
Yep.

33:37.353 --> 33:39.521
Dexter, what's going on?

33:39.647 --> 33:42.816
Well. after this morning.
l figured it'd be better if l kept my distance.

33:44.235 --> 33:46.028
What. . .what happened this morning?

33:46.154 --> 33:49.489
Let's just say your mom isn't a big fan
of men in recovery.

33:50.658 --> 33:51.950
Oh, shit.

33:52.076 --> 33:55.203
Look, this means nothing, OK?

33:55.329 --> 33:58.331
l'm gonna take care of this.
Now, when are you coming back?

33:58.458 --> 34:00.500
Tomorrow morning.

34:00.626 --> 34:02.878
Promise me you'll stop
by the house first thing?

34:04.505 --> 34:05.881
Sure.

34:06.007 --> 34:08.050
l'm so sorry about this, Dexter.

34:09.844 --> 34:12.012
- l'll see you soon.
- OK.

34:38.498 --> 34:40.415
Why are you not in the shower?

34:40.541 --> 34:43.043
l know. l'm just checking some emails.

34:43.169 --> 34:45.879
We have to be at the restaurant
in half an hour.

34:49.509 --> 34:51.593
Sure you don't want to join me?

34:51.719 --> 34:53.428
You stink.

34:53.554 --> 34:56.389
Thought you liked it dirty.

35:21.749 --> 35:24.000
"lce Princess"?

35:25.086 --> 35:26.586
Fuck.

35:41.477 --> 35:43.019
You son of a bitch!

35:43.146 --> 35:44.229
Deb, what did l do?

35:44.355 --> 35:46.231
You lied to me. You're a writer!

35:46.357 --> 35:48.024
l'm trying to be, yeah.

35:48.151 --> 35:50.777
l saw all of those emails
you sent to those publishers.

35:50.903 --> 35:53.196
- The lce Princess!
- Oh, you went through my email!

35:53.322 --> 35:56.783
You got close to me so you could sell
a book about me and the lce-Truck Killer!

35:56.909 --> 36:00.287
- That's crazy, Deb. Those letters. . .
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

36:01.372 --> 36:02.831
Deb!

36:36.115 --> 36:37.699
What can l do you for?

36:41.162 --> 36:43.830
- Drink?
- Beer. Whatever's on tap.

36:46.334 --> 36:48.168
Coming up.

37:06.187 --> 37:07.896
Way to ditch me.

37:08.022 --> 37:09.731
You were in the shower.

37:09.857 --> 37:12.734
So, are you there? Do you see him?

37:14.528 --> 37:16.279
He's staring at me.

37:16.405 --> 37:18.281
You gonna say something?

37:19.116 --> 37:21.159
l don't know what l'm gonna do yet.

37:22.662 --> 37:26.122
- l should go.
- Well, call me when you figure it out.

37:26.249 --> 37:27.290
All right?

37:32.880 --> 37:34.214
Three bucks.

37:41.430 --> 37:43.723
- You had no right!
- He's an addict, Rita.

37:43.849 --> 37:46.226
He is no good for you.

37:48.354 --> 37:50.105
He's already got you smoking again.

37:53.025 --> 37:56.820
You turned your back on me
and your grandchildren.

37:56.946 --> 37:58.905
That was not my fault.

37:59.699 --> 38:03.243
l tried to warn you about Paul.
but you ran away with him anyway.

38:04.203 --> 38:07.372
l wasn't running away with Paul.

38:07.498 --> 38:09.791
But l was running away from you.

38:11.627 --> 38:13.670
Do you have any idea
how much it hurts me

38:13.796 --> 38:17.007
to see you make the same mistakes again?

38:19.969 --> 38:22.804
l've had my fair share of mistakes.

38:22.930 --> 38:25.473
And guess what?
You were right about Paul.

38:25.599 --> 38:28.101
He was a terrible man.

38:28.227 --> 38:31.813
But for the first time,
l feel safe and loved,

38:31.939 --> 38:33.773
and that's because of Dexter.

38:35.276 --> 38:37.777
l can't talk to you when you're like this.
l'm going to bed.

38:39.488 --> 38:42.073
This is my life, Mother.

38:42.199 --> 38:45.118
lf you can't be happy for me,
then maybe you shouldn't be here.

38:45.244 --> 38:48.163
lf you want to abandon me
and the kids again, fine.

38:48.289 --> 38:49.831
That's your choice.

38:49.957 --> 38:51.833
But Dexter is not going anywhere.

39:09.685 --> 39:11.311
Last call was 30 minutes ago.

39:17.735 --> 39:19.778
You hear me?

39:19.904 --> 39:22.405
l need you to finish that up.

39:23.824 --> 39:25.075
Sorry.

39:28.829 --> 39:31.498
l'm avoiding going back to my motel room.

39:32.792 --> 39:35.210
l'm visiting from Miami.

39:35.336 --> 39:36.753
You ever been there?

39:38.881 --> 39:40.882
l can't say that l have.

39:48.682 --> 39:51.226
How long you lived in Naples?

39:51.352 --> 39:54.687
- Oh, a few years now.
- You like it?

39:59.193 --> 40:00.652
All right.

40:00.778 --> 40:02.028
Go.

40:03.114 --> 40:05.990
OK. This is gonna be awkward.

40:07.201 --> 40:09.786
l need to tell you how l feel.

40:09.912 --> 40:15.375
No. what you need to do is leave.
because you been eyeballing me all night.

40:18.379 --> 40:19.963
You really shouldn't do that.

40:20.089 --> 40:22.132
- l said get out of my bar.
- OK.

40:22.258 --> 40:26.428
Just let me say what l need to say
and l'll go.

40:31.267 --> 40:33.726
You stole my life.

40:33.853 --> 40:35.520
What the fuck?

40:35.646 --> 40:37.772
You are really beginning to piss me off.

40:37.898 --> 40:41.401
l'm not the person l'm supposed to be because
you took someone from me.

40:42.570 --> 40:45.655
l will beat your fucking head in

40:45.781 --> 40:48.575
if you don't walk out that door right now!

40:49.618 --> 40:51.161
l tried Lila's way.

41:01.130 --> 41:02.589
1 973!

41:06.135 --> 41:08.136
The port of Miami.

41:08.262 --> 41:11.055
A shipping container. A chainsaw!

41:12.349 --> 41:14.309
Laura Moser.

41:16.103 --> 41:18.480
You remember now?
You remember now?

41:36.290 --> 41:40.043
You got me confused
with someone else!

41:42.296 --> 41:45.965
l know exactly who you are!
You made me into what l am!

41:46.091 --> 41:48.426
OK. OK. l killed her.

41:52.181 --> 41:55.391
- l had to.
- Did you? Did you have to?

41:55.518 --> 41:57.644
Did you have to saw her into little pieces?

41:57.770 --> 42:01.189
Did you have to leave two little boys
soaking in a pool of their mother's blood?

42:02.316 --> 42:04.817
Estrada would have killed me if l didn't.

42:04.944 --> 42:07.737
You slaughtered her like an animal

42:07.863 --> 42:09.864
because she stole his precious cocaine.

42:11.075 --> 42:15.078
No. We found out
she was a snitch for a cop.

42:15.204 --> 42:16.871
She was fucking him.

42:19.208 --> 42:21.626
- Which cop?
- l didn't know his name.

42:21.752 --> 42:24.337
l followed them to. . .to a park.

42:25.172 --> 42:28.633
My mother and Harry.
That's what got her killed?

42:30.511 --> 42:32.095
l'm not done with you yet.

42:33.472 --> 42:37.141
Isn't this what heroes do,
avenge lost loved ones?

42:45.526 --> 42:46.568
What?

42:47.778 --> 42:49.153
Everything OK?

42:51.115 --> 42:53.157
Dexter, what's wrong?

42:54.285 --> 42:55.618
l thought l could resist.

42:55.744 --> 42:57.328
Jesus.

42:57.454 --> 42:58.705
Are you using?

43:00.124 --> 43:02.375
No, but l'm about to.

43:02.501 --> 43:03.876
Tell me where you are

43:04.003 --> 43:07.130
and l'll get in a taxi and l'll come get you.

43:08.257 --> 43:09.882
l have to do this.

43:10.009 --> 43:13.886
No, you don't!
Just tell me where you are.

43:18.309 --> 43:19.559
You'll be too late.

43:19.685 --> 43:23.271
Don't you bloody do this.
You are stronger than that.

43:23.397 --> 43:24.647
l'm not!

43:24.773 --> 43:27.108
Yes, you fucking are.

43:27.234 --> 43:28.901
You've come this far.

43:29.987 --> 43:31.863
lf you turn back now,

43:31.989 --> 43:34.991
you'll go right back to the way you were,

43:35.117 --> 43:36.826
HoIIow,

43:36.952 --> 43:38.786
angry...

43:38.912 --> 43:40.496
Alone.

43:40.623 --> 43:44.375
l will get you through this. l swear.

43:44.501 --> 43:46.836
Just come back to me. OK?

44:11.528 --> 44:14.447
Dexter? Are you all right?

44:14.573 --> 44:16.240
lt's OK.

44:22.081 --> 44:23.623
l didn't. . .

44:25.834 --> 44:27.877
lt's OK.

44:28.003 --> 44:31.005
l don't care what you did.

44:31.131 --> 44:32.924
lt's OK.

44:35.302 --> 44:37.345
l've got you.

44:37.471 --> 44:39.972
Come on. lt's OK.

44:41.934 --> 44:43.518
Baby.

44:43.644 --> 44:45.561
lt's OK.

44:48.273 --> 44:50.650
What are you still doing here?

44:50.776 --> 44:53.695
Making sure our marina surveillance
is in place.

44:53.821 --> 44:55.029
You forget something?

44:55.155 --> 44:56.823
l'm working up rental logs.

44:58.075 --> 44:59.742
On the other two marinas.

44:59.868 --> 45:02.912
- You don't give up, do you?
- Do you?

45:04.707 --> 45:07.250
l'm wide awake anyway.
Dexter's out of town.

45:07.376 --> 45:09.419
l don't really sleep
when l'm there by myself.

45:09.545 --> 45:11.921
What about the new boyfriend?

45:13.048 --> 45:14.507
We sort of broke up.

45:15.634 --> 45:18.720
Well, l broke up with him.

45:21.807 --> 45:24.726
Guess you won't be needing this, then.

45:24.852 --> 45:25.893
What's that?

45:27.771 --> 45:29.147
Background check.

45:30.023 --> 45:32.817
You said you were snooping.
Just thought l'd help.

45:32.943 --> 45:35.528
You ran a background check
on my boyfriend?

45:38.240 --> 45:40.616
- What's it say?
- Gabriel's clean.

45:40.743 --> 45:43.369
Well, except for those parking tickets.

45:45.914 --> 45:48.833
Just because he's not a criminal
doesn't mean he's not an asshole.

45:50.753 --> 45:52.086
l went through his email.

45:52.212 --> 45:54.589
l know, but it was worth it.

45:54.715 --> 45:56.257
l mean. . .

45:56.383 --> 45:59.927
He was using me to shop around a book about
the lce-Truck Killer.

46:03.098 --> 46:05.892
Do you know what kind of writer Gabriel is?

46:13.275 --> 46:14.984
Children's books?

46:20.073 --> 46:22.450
The lce Princess is a children's book.

46:26.330 --> 46:28.456
How could l be so fucking stupid?

46:31.043 --> 46:35.296
When my wife met me,
she was convinced l was a spy.

46:35.422 --> 46:39.008
Connie didn't know it,
but she was actually right.

46:39.134 --> 46:41.219
You ran a background check on her?

46:41.345 --> 46:43.679
No need.

46:43.806 --> 46:45.556
Must be nice. . .

46:46.517 --> 46:48.309
to just know like that.

46:50.979 --> 46:55.483
She died. Two years ago. Cancer.

46:57.110 --> 46:59.070
l'm sorry.

47:00.739 --> 47:03.991
That's how l lost my mom.

47:09.206 --> 47:11.207
l should go.

47:11.333 --> 47:13.501
Let me ask you something.

47:14.962 --> 47:18.714
That boyfriend of yours, did he ever
give you a reason not to trust him?

47:18.841 --> 47:20.341
No.

47:23.470 --> 47:25.179
But l don't think it matters. l mean. . .

47:26.390 --> 47:28.349
l went insane on him.

47:29.560 --> 47:30.893
He'll never forgive me.

47:31.019 --> 47:33.229
Any broken bones involved?

47:33.355 --> 47:36.691
- Facial contusions?
- No.

47:38.235 --> 47:40.319
You'll be fine.

48:18.734 --> 48:21.777
Do you want to know
how l got into the program?

48:30.120 --> 48:32.038
l'd used for years.

48:33.206 --> 48:35.374
Binge, crash.

48:35.500 --> 48:37.543
Thought l had it under control.

48:39.671 --> 48:41.464
Then l met Marco.

48:43.133 --> 48:44.800
What a shit.

48:46.637 --> 48:49.263
Thought he was my boyfriend,

48:49.389 --> 48:51.766
but he turned out to be my dealer.

48:57.147 --> 49:02.902
Bastard had me so strung out
by the time he left. . .nothing mattered.

49:05.322 --> 49:07.365
Nothing was left. . .

49:10.035 --> 49:11.744
but rage.

49:17.292 --> 49:19.168
One night. . .

49:19.294 --> 49:21.921
l was so fucked up. . . God.

49:25.509 --> 49:29.387
l went to his house
and l burnt it to the ground.

49:34.476 --> 49:37.770
What l didn't know was that
Marco was passed out inside.

49:45.487 --> 49:48.030
They blamed the fire on his drugs.

49:51.994 --> 49:53.869
But it was me.

49:57.416 --> 49:59.375
He died because of me.

50:05.465 --> 50:07.717
That night, l went to my first meeting.

50:11.847 --> 50:15.349
Seeing that side of myself was terrifying.

50:17.853 --> 50:20.688
That l could possibly do that
to another person.

50:25.902 --> 50:28.237
Did he deserve it?

50:33.702 --> 50:34.994
Yes.

50:51.470 --> 50:54.638
Then you didn't do anything wrong.

51:20.874 --> 51:22.124
Hey, you.

51:22.250 --> 51:24.418
l wasn't expecting you this early.

51:24.544 --> 51:26.295
l didn't hit any traffic.

51:26.421 --> 51:28.714
You're just in time for breakfast.

51:33.345 --> 51:34.637
Where's your mom?

51:34.763 --> 51:37.723
Oh, l doubt she'll be joining us.

51:37.849 --> 51:39.433
She's been in her room all morning.

51:40.852 --> 51:43.020
My guess is she's packing.

51:46.525 --> 51:48.400
Maybe l should go.

51:49.236 --> 51:50.277
No.

51:51.446 --> 51:54.782
No. you're staying right here
because you're a part of this family.

51:56.952 --> 51:59.912
Are you sure?
l've put you through so much lately.

52:03.375 --> 52:06.585
l'm here for you, Dexter, no matter what.

52:10.507 --> 52:12.341
What's this?

52:15.720 --> 52:17.221
The patch.

52:17.347 --> 52:19.723
l have some quitting of my own to do.

52:21.143 --> 52:23.144
Sit.

52:26.314 --> 52:28.983
ls that anything important?

52:32.529 --> 52:34.238
Nope.

52:36.491 --> 52:37.867
Morning.

52:39.953 --> 52:42.204
- Morning, Dexter.
- Hi...

52:42.330 --> 52:43.664
Gail.

52:47.294 --> 52:50.838
so. Rita assures me
that you are committed to getting better.

52:54.176 --> 52:55.176
l am.

52:56.011 --> 52:58.762
Then l want to be here to help.

52:58.889 --> 53:01.849
ln fact, l've decided to stay in Miami.

53:01.975 --> 53:06.395
l emailed the school board
my letter of resignation this morning.

53:06.521 --> 53:08.898
What about your house?

53:09.024 --> 53:11.025
l'll put it on the market.

53:11.151 --> 53:13.736
Sweetie, l thought about
what you said last night.

53:13.862 --> 53:17.448
l haven't been here for you,
and l want to change that.

53:20.577 --> 53:24.163
My sister's looking for a new apartment.
l'm sure we can help you find one too.

53:24.289 --> 53:26.457
Oh, don't be silly. l'll be living here.

53:26.583 --> 53:29.376
Dexter, be a dear
and pass me the cream, please.

53:31.254 --> 53:32.504
Thank you.

53:36.092 --> 53:40.346
Harry taught me to lie and keep
my darkest secrets from those around me...

53:41.890 --> 53:45.267
which is why l need to make sure
there's not a trace of blood left on my boat.

53:47.062 --> 53:49.480
He also taught me
not to rush to judgment.

53:49.606 --> 53:52.524
Things aren't always
what they appear to be...

53:55.028 --> 53:56.904
including Harry.

53:57.030 --> 53:58.781
And what about me?

53:58.907 --> 54:01.450
Am l the twisted Bay Harbor Butcher...

54:01.576 --> 54:03.911
or the vaIiant Dark Defender?

54:05.330 --> 54:07.206
Only time will tell.

54:07.332 --> 54:10.542
Funny thing is l've met someone
who doesn"t care what l am.

54:12.337 --> 54:14.755
l suppose every hero needs a sidekick...

54:15.340 --> 54:17.508
every villain, a partner in crime.

54:20.845 --> 54:23.764
All my relationships
have been built on not knowing.

54:25.350 --> 54:27.726
But that may be changing.

54:31.898 --> 54:34.525
lmagine that,

54:34.651 --> 54:36.944
a Iife with no more secrets.
