WEBVTT

00:02.257 --> 00:04.008
Previously on Dexter...

00:04.134 --> 00:07.052
Two treasure hunters
made a ghastly discovery today

00:07.178 --> 00:10.180
when they stumbled on what
appears to be an underwater graveyard

00:10.306 --> 00:12.307
in a crevice off the coast of Miami.

00:12.434 --> 00:14.852
Agent Lundy has requested
the following officers

00:14.978 --> 00:16.603
for his joint task force.

00:16.730 --> 00:19.690
We're a team, and our first play
is lDing those bodies.

00:19.816 --> 00:21.316
l'm Dexter Morgan.

00:21.443 --> 00:22.526
l know who you are.

00:22.652 --> 00:24.153
Hoping they'll talk to you?

00:24.279 --> 00:28.615
They always speak.
You just got to ask the right question.

00:28.742 --> 00:29.908
Harry was right.

00:30.035 --> 00:33.454
Nothing stays buried,
perhaps not even me.

00:34.122 --> 00:36.206
Should l be worried about Pascal?

00:36.332 --> 00:37.541
You're asking me because. . .

00:37.667 --> 00:41.045
Because you've done the job.
So, if she's out, that means you're back in.

00:41.171 --> 00:44.548
l won't dignify rumors, Captain.
Pascal's fine.

00:44.966 --> 00:48.802
You need to wrap your wrists,
so you don't hurt yourself again.

00:51.473 --> 00:53.223
l'm sorry.

00:54.309 --> 00:56.060
We'll get you into a program,

00:56.186 --> 00:58.687
we'll get you the help you need,

00:58.813 --> 01:00.230
and l will be there for you.

01:00.356 --> 01:04.026
l'm Dexter,
and l'm not sure what l am.

01:04.152 --> 01:07.613
Everyone in that room
has heard or lived far worse

01:07.739 --> 01:10.115
than anything you've ever done.

01:11.159 --> 01:13.452
- l doubt it.
- How full of shit are you?

01:13.578 --> 01:15.204
The mask is slipping.

01:15.330 --> 01:19.208
People who never mattered before
are suddenly starting to matter.

01:19.334 --> 01:23.337
Didn't your tour in the army
include some special op in Haiti?

01:24.631 --> 01:26.757
- There's my sponsor.
- Really? Where?

03:29.380 --> 03:32.299
Just as the worst heatwave
in years hits Miami,

03:32.425 --> 03:34.092
the heat is aIso on me.

03:35.011 --> 03:38.305
lt"s week three of
the Bay Harbor Butcher investigation,

03:38.431 --> 03:40.515
and super duper Special Agent Lundy

03:40.642 --> 03:42.351
has yet to throw up his hands and say,

03:42.477 --> 03:45.854
"'Wow, this guy's good. l give up."'

03:45.980 --> 03:47.564
Dexter, please.

03:47.690 --> 03:48.732
Do you want me to help?

03:48.858 --> 03:50.484
No. l just...
l just need you to move.

03:52.195 --> 03:55.948
l'm sorry. lt's just, you know,
my mother's coming today.

03:56.074 --> 03:57.241
l certainly do.

03:57.367 --> 04:01.620
l haven't seen her in so long, and. . .
l just want everything to be nice.

04:01.746 --> 04:04.748
We kind of ended things on bad terms.

04:04.874 --> 04:06.583
She and Paul didn't get along so well.

04:06.709 --> 04:08.919
A lot of people and Paul
didn't get along so well.

04:09.045 --> 04:11.296
Yeah. But l. . .

04:11.422 --> 04:14.258
l think she's willing to put that behind us.

04:14.384 --> 04:18.136
she heard about Paul's passing
and she wanted to come and be supportive.

04:18.263 --> 04:20.847
That sounds promising, right?

04:20.974 --> 04:23.392
Absolutely.

04:24.519 --> 04:26.979
You'll like her, Dexter. She's great.

04:27.105 --> 04:29.064
She's a very strong woman.

04:29.190 --> 04:32.025
l'll keep that in mind
in case l have any heavy lifting to do.

04:32.944 --> 04:34.403
lt's too hot.

04:34.529 --> 04:37.239
l know, honey.
Hopefully it'll cool down soon.

04:37.365 --> 04:39.408
Did you sleep any better last night?

04:39.534 --> 04:40.492
More nightmares?

04:40.618 --> 04:42.953
What was it, the big, scary ghost
or the alligator?

04:43.079 --> 04:45.539
No. The Bay Harbor Butcher.

04:46.916 --> 04:48.417
Oh, honey.

04:48.543 --> 04:49.876
He would never hurt you.

04:51.462 --> 04:54.131
But l'll let you in on a secret.

04:54.257 --> 04:57.759
My sister, Debra, who is a secret
police agent ninja warrior.

04:57.885 --> 04:59.928
said he only kills bad people,

05:00.054 --> 05:01.763
and you're not a bad person, are you?

05:01.889 --> 05:03.015
No.

05:03.141 --> 05:04.725
Then you're quite safe.

05:04.851 --> 05:06.101
Why don't you go get dressed

05:06.227 --> 05:09.396
and l will make you
some breakfast, OK?

05:11.983 --> 05:14.109
lt makes me so angry that there's some. . .

05:14.235 --> 05:17.696
monster out there scaring my son.

05:18.573 --> 05:19.948
l got to go to work.

05:20.074 --> 05:21.783
You know, l hope they catch him today.

05:21.909 --> 05:24.619
And l'm not a violent person,
but l hope they hurt him.

05:24.746 --> 05:26.997
Have a good day.

05:27.665 --> 05:29.750
Make up your mind.

05:40.094 --> 05:41.553
ln our most paranoid moments,

05:41.679 --> 05:43.638
we fear that everyone is talking about us.

05:43.765 --> 05:45.307
That's become my reality.

05:47.018 --> 05:49.728
l can't hear what they're saying,
but l know it"s not nice.

05:49.854 --> 05:52.105
Let's get started.

05:52.231 --> 05:55.609
We have positive lDs
on all 1 8 of our complete bodies.

05:55.735 --> 05:58.528
1 3 of those have felony records.

05:58.654 --> 05:59.738
Organized crime.

05:59.864 --> 06:02.240
Nope. No connection to organized crime.

06:02.367 --> 06:04.159
No mutual gang affiliation, either.

06:04.285 --> 06:07.454
But all 1 3 were either tried for murder

06:07.580 --> 06:09.331
or at least suspected of murder.

06:09.457 --> 06:11.166
Still, you have your pattern.

06:11.292 --> 06:14.503
Yes, we just don't know what it means.

06:16.672 --> 06:18.965
l think we go out
with this news immediately.

06:20.468 --> 06:22.511
- What news?
- The news that our serial killer

06:22.637 --> 06:24.805
is only killing the dregs of society,

06:24.931 --> 06:27.849
that good, moral people
have nothing to fear.

06:27.975 --> 06:30.519
But, Captain, that's all. . .

06:30.645 --> 06:32.938
This is the only lead we have.

06:33.064 --> 06:34.981
We need to keep it tightly wrapped.

06:35.108 --> 06:37.609
Last night, an elderly man shot his son
when he came home late.

06:37.735 --> 06:40.404
Thought it was the Bay Harbor Butcher.

06:40.530 --> 06:44.741
- We've got a city in chaos here. Frank.
- l understand you want to reassure people.

06:44.867 --> 06:47.577
Good. Then we're in agreement.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.710
Dex, l got this huge break
in the Bay Harbor case.

06:55.837 --> 06:56.837
Bullshit.

06:56.963 --> 06:58.797
l mean, really?

06:58.923 --> 07:03.176
Guys, guys. You are not going to. . .

07:04.178 --> 07:06.972
l refuse to believe
that Vince Masuka is the man

07:07.098 --> 07:10.725
who single-handedly brings me down.

07:10.852 --> 07:13.937
l also know denial is the first stage
of the grieving process

07:14.063 --> 07:16.314
for those who learn they're going to die.

07:20.486 --> 07:23.572
l need to find out what Masuka knows,

07:23.698 --> 07:26.867
but l've got to be calm and centered...

07:26.993 --> 07:29.119
and focused.

07:30.371 --> 07:32.956
Time for a visit to my sponsor.

07:33.082 --> 07:34.541
l need help.

07:54.604 --> 07:55.937
Hi!

07:56.063 --> 07:57.731
Hey! Just a minute!

08:01.319 --> 08:03.570
- Dexter.
- Hope l'm not interrupting anything.

08:03.696 --> 08:06.490
No. Glad you called.

08:06.616 --> 08:09.826
Just. . .give me a minute.

08:11.037 --> 08:13.079
Yeah, have a look around.

08:22.548 --> 08:26.885
So, hey, l was. . .gonna go
and get some art supplies.

08:27.011 --> 08:29.221
ls that all right?
Do you want to come?

08:30.223 --> 08:31.723
Yeah. l'm just on my lunch break.

08:31.849 --> 08:33.558
Excellent.

08:33.684 --> 08:35.769
Why are they eating each other?

08:36.729 --> 08:38.188
Don't know.

08:38.314 --> 08:39.981
Ask them.

08:51.452 --> 08:53.620
Do you like the heat?

08:54.664 --> 08:57.666
Not really.
l'm partial to air-conditioning.

08:57.792 --> 08:59.834
l love it.

08:59.961 --> 09:03.338
lt makes me feel like the whole world
could explode at any moment.

09:04.382 --> 09:06.675
That's a pleasant thought.

09:06.801 --> 09:09.344
- ls there an art store near here?
- So, you been using?

09:09.470 --> 09:11.179
Using what? Oh.

09:11.305 --> 09:13.890
No. No drugs.

09:14.016 --> 09:17.477
- Perfectly clean.
- Look what we have here!

09:19.313 --> 09:21.314
Jesus. What are you. . .

09:23.442 --> 09:24.859
Come on.

09:30.825 --> 09:32.867
You gonna help or what?

09:46.674 --> 09:49.092
That was a little weird.

09:49.218 --> 09:52.887
So, if you're perfectly clean,
why'd you call?

09:53.014 --> 09:57.058
l'm under a lot of pressure at work.

09:57.184 --> 10:00.353
l. . .was hoping you could maybe
give me some quick tips

10:00.479 --> 10:02.355
on how to deal with the urges.

10:03.316 --> 10:05.066
There are no quick tips.

10:06.068 --> 10:08.862
Oh. l see.

10:18.247 --> 10:19.623
Someone's gonna hear that.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.458
They'll think it's the wind.

10:21.584 --> 10:25.295
- l thought we were getting art supplies.
- That's exactly...

10:25.421 --> 10:27.797
what we're doing.

10:27.923 --> 10:30.508
l work with found art.

10:30.635 --> 10:32.510
lt's more like stolen art.

10:33.512 --> 10:36.264
ls this what a sponsor normally does
on their first meeting?

10:36.390 --> 10:37.349
l don't know.

10:37.475 --> 10:39.768
l've never sponsored anyone before.

10:39.894 --> 10:41.561
- Really?
- Yeah, but don't worry.

10:41.687 --> 10:44.147
l've had all kinds of sponsors.

10:44.273 --> 10:46.024
Learnt from the best.

10:46.150 --> 10:48.485
You do realize l work
with the police department?

10:49.737 --> 10:52.072
lf we get caught.
you can flash your badge.

10:53.491 --> 10:55.992
l don't have a badge.
l have a laminate.

11:00.915 --> 11:03.583
Could we talk about why l called you?

11:03.709 --> 11:05.210
Yeah, sure.

11:06.504 --> 11:08.129
You want help?

11:09.423 --> 11:11.883
So, tell me. . .

11:13.761 --> 11:15.261
why do you use?

11:18.015 --> 11:20.016
Why?

11:21.102 --> 11:23.436
l don't know. lt's just part of who l am.

11:24.563 --> 11:26.398
And who are you?

11:28.818 --> 11:29.984
l'm a. . .

11:32.488 --> 11:33.571
bad person.

11:35.616 --> 11:38.785
You haven't got the first idea
who you are. have you?

11:39.995 --> 11:42.956
Dexter, meet Dexter.

11:43.082 --> 11:46.292
l'm gonna help the two of you
get to know each other.

11:48.129 --> 11:50.338
That doesn't really seem necessary.

11:50.464 --> 11:53.258
The first step to recovery
is accepting who you are.

11:53.384 --> 11:56.845
l thought the first step was
admitting you have a problem.

11:56.971 --> 12:00.640
And before you can accept who you are,
you have to know who you are.

12:00.766 --> 12:02.350
So that's our first job.

12:02.476 --> 12:06.396
You're going to tell me all your
deepest. darkest secrets.

12:09.900 --> 12:12.610
There's something
off about him, Harry.

12:14.113 --> 12:15.321
You know why.

12:16.282 --> 12:17.949
All right, look.

12:18.075 --> 12:20.577
lt wouldn't hurt
to have him tested, would it?

12:28.461 --> 12:30.378
Hello? Yes.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.339
lt. . . Just a sec.

12:33.466 --> 12:34.799
l got to get back. Dead body.

12:34.925 --> 12:37.635
Hm! How many times have you
used that one before?

12:40.014 --> 12:43.767
So, the husband's name
is Barnes, B-A-R-N-E-S.

12:46.771 --> 12:48.062
What do we have?

12:48.189 --> 12:49.147
Hello, Dexter.

12:49.273 --> 12:52.650
Gunshot victim.
Alisha Barnes, 36.

12:57.114 --> 13:00.241
So, l heard there may be some big break
in the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

13:00.367 --> 13:02.076
Could be.

13:02.203 --> 13:05.747
The neighbor heard the victim arguing
with her husband last night, Curtis Barnes.

13:05.873 --> 13:07.916
Masuka was pretty excited about it.

13:08.042 --> 13:10.084
His car's gone.
Nobody knows where he is.

13:10.211 --> 13:13.838
- Any idea what they found?
- Can we concentrate on this case, please?

13:15.549 --> 13:17.050
Sure.

13:17.176 --> 13:21.387
The killer was standing right about
where you are. sergeant Doakes.

13:22.598 --> 13:24.265
Two shots to the chest.

13:24.391 --> 13:25.934
l only see one hole in the chest.

13:26.060 --> 13:27.644
Yeah, they are that close together.

13:27.770 --> 13:29.854
lt's very impressive shooting.

13:29.980 --> 13:33.316
lt looks like the bullets
took nearly identical exit paths,

13:33.442 --> 13:34.692
judging from the spray.

13:34.819 --> 13:38.112
And this was all topped off
by a final shot to the head.

13:38.239 --> 13:39.322
She was Mozambiqued.

13:39.448 --> 13:40.907
What?

13:41.033 --> 13:43.326
Triple-tapped.

13:48.082 --> 13:50.250
Oh, shit.

13:50.376 --> 13:52.627
l'm guessing this is Curtis Barnes.

13:52.753 --> 13:55.046
Here he is in what looks like
somalia. Afghanistan.

13:55.172 --> 13:57.090
A Russian grenade, a Kurdish dagger,

13:57.216 --> 13:59.551
and tell me that shit wasn't
from Saddam's palace.

13:59.677 --> 14:00.885
What are you saying?

14:01.011 --> 14:04.055
l'm saying, asshole's special ops.

14:04.181 --> 14:05.390
There's no doubt about it.

14:05.516 --> 14:09.853
They're generally known
for settling their arguments so peaceably.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.021
Don't get smug with me.

14:12.606 --> 14:14.607
Sounds like we're in your world, James.

14:15.651 --> 14:18.152
Yeah, l'll take lead on this one.

14:26.829 --> 14:28.538
Pick a body.

14:28.664 --> 14:29.622
Sir?

14:29.748 --> 14:31.332
l want you each to pick a body.

14:31.458 --> 14:33.793
This is where the case
is going to be made.

14:33.919 --> 14:36.921
We have 1 3 suspected murderers

14:37.047 --> 14:40.508
and then we have these gentlemen.

14:40.634 --> 14:44.470
Robert Thatcher.
janitor for the school district.

14:44.597 --> 14:46.306
with no criminal record.

14:46.932 --> 14:50.018
Marcus White, tow-truck driver,

14:50.144 --> 14:52.687
no criminal record.

14:52.813 --> 14:54.689
And this. . .

14:54.815 --> 14:56.816
this is. . .

14:57.902 --> 14:58.943
Oscar Sota.

15:02.698 --> 15:04.198
What's his story?

15:04.325 --> 15:06.409
Naval engineer for the port of Miami,

15:06.535 --> 15:08.161
member of the stewardship council

15:08.287 --> 15:09.871
of St. Tarsicia Catholic church.

15:09.997 --> 15:13.249
Married, loved, respected.

15:13.375 --> 15:16.711
But he was found in a bag
under the sea with 1 3 killers.

15:16.837 --> 15:20.048
Why? Answer that question.
then we really know something.

15:20.174 --> 15:22.467
l got him.

15:22.593 --> 15:24.344
Oscar Sota.

15:27.389 --> 15:29.307
Why did the killer cut them up like this?

15:29.433 --> 15:31.059
Ease of disposal.

15:31.185 --> 15:32.560
Or for fun.

15:34.605 --> 15:37.523
You don't kill this many people
because it's a chore.

15:37.650 --> 15:39.400
You do it 'cause you like it.

15:40.986 --> 15:42.528
OK.

15:44.031 --> 15:45.907
Great.

15:46.033 --> 15:47.825
Tomorrow.

15:47.952 --> 15:49.243
The Barnes case?

15:49.370 --> 15:51.621
Yeah, that was a buddy of mine
from special ops.

15:51.747 --> 15:53.790
He heard Curtis Barnes
was still in Miami.

15:55.042 --> 15:58.169
The only part of that that l find surprising
is that you have a buddy.

15:59.213 --> 16:02.548
lt turns out Barnes and l both
were Ranger RRD.

16:03.676 --> 16:05.218
Regimental reconnaissance detachment,

16:05.344 --> 16:08.513
the guys you're not supposed to know about
who get in before everybody else.

16:08.639 --> 16:10.390
A brother in arms.

16:10.516 --> 16:11.808
Something like that.

16:11.934 --> 16:15.186
My buddy put me in touch
with a guy from Curtis' unit.

16:15.312 --> 16:17.271
- He's willing to talk to me.
- Good.

16:17.398 --> 16:21.025
l got your blood report.
lt's all pretty straightforward.

16:21.151 --> 16:23.319
- l'd be careful, though.
- Why's that?

16:23.445 --> 16:25.571
The trajectory of the bullets
are all level,

16:25.698 --> 16:27.031
Exact same angle of origin.

16:27.157 --> 16:29.993
l'd say all three shots were
fired in less than a second.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.203
lt's very impressive shooting.

16:34.415 --> 16:35.748
Morgan.

16:42.715 --> 16:44.924
l'm gonna need you to run
some tests on this shirt.

16:45.050 --> 16:47.677
- ls there blood?
- No blood.

16:47.803 --> 16:49.721
l'm really the blood guy.

16:49.847 --> 16:53.558
lt's a smell. lt smells like a woman.

16:55.352 --> 16:57.103
Which part?

16:58.397 --> 16:59.772
Who can identify this for me?

17:04.069 --> 17:06.446
You know, that's really Masuka's area.

17:06.572 --> 17:08.614
He's definitely your man.

17:11.368 --> 17:12.618
Thanks.

17:18.709 --> 17:22.545
Anything l can do to overburden
Masuka is to my advantage.

17:22.671 --> 17:27.050
l'm not above sending pizzas and hookers
to his house in the middle of the night.

17:36.310 --> 17:38.644
Well, everything's unpacked.

17:38.771 --> 17:41.481
The back bedroom's small,
but it's quieter.

17:42.608 --> 17:44.692
l'm just happy to be here, that's all.

17:44.818 --> 17:45.818
You're always welcome.

17:45.944 --> 17:48.613
Am l? l wasn't sure.

17:48.739 --> 17:50.239
Of course you are.

17:52.534 --> 17:55.620
All these years without an invitation.

17:55.746 --> 17:58.498
l just. . . l thought you didn't want to come.
You and Paul. . .

17:58.624 --> 18:00.917
Oh. nonsense.
l wasn't gonna let that keep me away

18:01.043 --> 18:03.711
from my daughter
and my grandchildren.

18:05.339 --> 18:07.507
But you did let it keep you away.

18:08.634 --> 18:10.093
Let's not assign blame, Rita.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.512
Nothing good ever comes of that.

18:12.638 --> 18:15.765
We'll just have to make up
for lost time, that's all.

18:17.434 --> 18:19.102
- Hi.
- Hey.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.899
Dexter, this is my mother.

18:25.025 --> 18:27.235
Gail. So nice to meet you.

18:27.361 --> 18:28.986
Nice to meet you, too, Dexter.

18:34.952 --> 18:38.287
l've always been good with parents.

18:38.413 --> 18:41.207
The key is to simply think of them as aliens

18:41.333 --> 18:43.626
from a distant universe.

18:45.629 --> 18:48.714
"'You have fibers and threads
unknown to us.

18:51.677 --> 18:53.928
"'Your ancient customs intrigue me."'

18:56.890 --> 19:00.685
So, Dexter, tell me everything
there is to know about you.

19:00.811 --> 19:05.356
"'You have made me
your sworn enemy, evil woman."'

19:05.482 --> 19:09.443
l work in the forensics department
for the Miami Metro PD.

19:09.570 --> 19:11.487
and l'm very fond of your daughter.

19:12.781 --> 19:15.158
Good answer.
l'm also very fond of my daughter.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.285
You did a good job raising her.

19:17.411 --> 19:18.661
30 years as a school teacher.

19:18.787 --> 19:21.581
l've got a little experience with children,

19:21.707 --> 19:23.624
and l see a young man who is not eating.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.459
l'm not hungry.

19:25.586 --> 19:28.504
He's scared the Butcher's gonna get him.

19:28.630 --> 19:30.798
Oh. Well. remember.
he only gets bad people.

19:30.924 --> 19:35.469
l was bad today.
l threw a ball at Tommy Alvarez.

19:35.596 --> 19:37.805
Well, that's not too bad.

19:37.931 --> 19:40.474
And even if it was.
the Bay Harbor Butcher doesn't hurt kids.

19:40.601 --> 19:42.018
He doesn't?

19:42.144 --> 19:43.769
Definitely not. You're safe.

19:46.273 --> 19:48.065
When are they gonna hurry up
and catch him?

19:48.192 --> 19:50.943
They are working as hard as they can.

19:51.069 --> 19:54.447
lf what l've heard is true -
that he only goes after criminals -

19:54.573 --> 19:56.991
l say leave him alone.

19:57.117 --> 19:59.243
He's got my seal of approval.

20:02.706 --> 20:06.459
Perhaps l have misjudged you, O wise one.

20:22.351 --> 20:23.768
Really?

20:25.229 --> 20:26.979
Yeah, sister spilled everything.

20:27.105 --> 20:30.191
Thinks he killed their parents
and made it look like a car accident.

20:30.317 --> 20:32.401
The living trust was in his name.

20:33.779 --> 20:35.238
Nice work.

20:35.364 --> 20:38.366
So, what's it gonna be tonight?

20:38.492 --> 20:40.618
Chinese, ltalian?

20:40.744 --> 20:43.371
Actually, l have a. . .

20:43.497 --> 20:45.748
social appointment.

20:47.834 --> 20:49.877
You mean like a date?

20:50.003 --> 20:51.712
l guess you could call it that.

20:52.673 --> 20:54.632
Wow, look at you,

20:54.758 --> 20:56.968
new in town
and already hooking up.

20:57.094 --> 20:59.679
lt's an introduction
arranged by a friend.

20:59.805 --> 21:02.807
One needs to get out
and have a little fun on occasion.

21:02.933 --> 21:05.643
lt's something l strongly
recommend for you as well.

21:05.769 --> 21:08.145
Yeah. With the hours we work. . .

21:08.272 --> 21:11.023
l'm serious. Make time for it.

21:11.149 --> 21:13.109
lt'll help keep you better balanced.

21:14.361 --> 21:15.569
Yes, sir.

21:24.955 --> 21:26.664
Are you OK?

21:26.790 --> 21:28.541
Yeah, it's just. . .

21:30.836 --> 21:32.253
something at work.

21:34.298 --> 21:36.007
Are you handling it OK?

21:37.551 --> 21:40.303
l ended up seeing my sponsor
today at lunch.

21:44.016 --> 21:45.933
How'd that go?

21:46.059 --> 21:49.228
Not so great.
She's a. . .little odd.

21:49.354 --> 21:51.731
Plays a little loose with the 1 2 steps.

21:52.566 --> 21:55.109
That doesn't seem smart,
making up your own.

21:55.235 --> 21:58.738
Maybe it's 'cause it's her first time
being a sponsor.

22:02.659 --> 22:05.703
Well, maybe you should try someone else.

22:05.829 --> 22:09.081
l just want to. . .
do what's best for my recovery.

22:09.207 --> 22:14.670
Well, maybe someone older,
more like you, more. . .manly.

22:15.881 --> 22:17.590
Yeah, maybe.

22:17.716 --> 22:20.009
Yeah.

22:50.582 --> 22:52.792
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:57.005 --> 22:58.339
You remember me?

22:58.465 --> 22:59.715
Yeah.

22:59.841 --> 23:01.384
You're the girl doesn't like tape.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.177
Debra, actually.

23:04.137 --> 23:05.930
l'm Gabriel.

23:07.557 --> 23:09.100
Done for the night?

23:09.226 --> 23:10.476
Yeah.

23:13.146 --> 23:15.272
Any interest in grabbing a drink?

23:21.113 --> 23:23.030
Usually a lady has to buy me dinner first.

23:23.156 --> 23:24.824
Stop talking and get your pants off.

23:28.370 --> 23:29.995
- Are you always like this?
- No.

23:30.122 --> 23:32.748
No, l haven't even had sex since. . .

23:33.291 --> 23:34.834
Since what?

23:37.337 --> 23:39.588
- You all right?
- Yeah, just one second.

23:39.714 --> 23:41.173
Look, we don't have to do this,
you know?

23:41.299 --> 23:42.842
Oh.

23:44.678 --> 23:47.054
Oh, you're into the kinky stuff, huh?

23:47.180 --> 23:50.266
No, the last guy l had sex with
tried to kill me.

24:05.115 --> 24:07.741
"'Who is the Bay Harbor Butcher?"'

24:07.868 --> 24:11.579
God. This obsession
with him is reIentIess.

24:11.705 --> 24:14.081
Just Iike Deb and that damn treadmiII.

24:24.301 --> 24:26.051
Deb, do you ever stop?

24:26.178 --> 24:28.554
Dexter. Jesus.
you're supposed to be at Rita's!

24:28.680 --> 24:30.222
Sorry. Sorry.

24:33.518 --> 24:34.977
Fuck.

24:49.826 --> 24:51.160
Morning.

24:52.412 --> 24:54.830
So, that was a little weird last night.

24:54.956 --> 24:57.917
No, yeah, well, it was dark.

24:58.043 --> 25:01.545
My eyes hadn't adjusted.
All l could see were shadows.

25:01.671 --> 25:06.008
Yeah. Well, please put those
shadows out of your mind.

25:07.219 --> 25:10.888
What's this big break in the Bay Harbor
Butcher case l keep hearing about?

25:11.014 --> 25:13.849
- Algae.
- Algae?

25:13.975 --> 25:18.562
Yeah. Masuka found microscopic algae
inside the garbage bags with the bodies.

25:19.940 --> 25:23.317
Algae under the sea, imagine that.

25:23.443 --> 25:25.069
How does that help?

25:25.195 --> 25:27.905
'Cause there are over 1 00,000 species,
all different.

25:28.031 --> 25:32.826
Masuka thinks he can use them to pinpoint
in which harbor the killer keeps his boat.

25:33.954 --> 25:35.829
He's got some marine biologists coming.

25:35.956 --> 25:40.668
Can you imagine something so little
being the thing that breaks this case?

25:40.794 --> 25:43.504
l got to go. l'll see you at the station.

25:46.258 --> 25:47.883
It doesn't make sense.

25:48.009 --> 25:49.385
lf there's algae on my victims,

25:49.511 --> 25:52.513
it would have to come from
the ocean where l dumped them.

25:52.639 --> 25:54.473
Obviously, l'm missing something,

25:54.599 --> 25:56.141
and I don't Iike that.

25:58.770 --> 26:02.815
Mrs. sota. l understand you wanting
to protect your husband's reputation,

26:02.941 --> 26:06.151
but your cooperation could
help us catch a serial killer.

26:06.278 --> 26:07.278
l am cooperating.

26:07.404 --> 26:09.071
You haven't told me anything.

26:09.197 --> 26:11.865
'Cause there's nothing to tell!

26:19.165 --> 26:22.668
- Maria.
- You off to meet the man from Curtis' unit?

26:22.794 --> 26:25.921
- Yeah, at the Blue Wing Marina.
- You have backup?

26:26.047 --> 26:28.757
Oh, yeah, all kinds of backup.
Helicopters and shit.

26:29.759 --> 26:32.553
- James.
- Listen, we got a missing murder suspect.

26:32.679 --> 26:35.806
This guy's a friend of his.
l'm just gonna go talk to him.

26:38.810 --> 26:40.144
Right.

26:41.438 --> 26:42.855
You're the lone holdout.

26:42.981 --> 26:44.773
Every other suspect has a criminal past

26:44.899 --> 26:47.484
and not just any criminal past.

26:47.611 --> 26:49.069
They were all linked to murder.

26:49.195 --> 26:51.155
Oscar never murdered anybody.

26:51.281 --> 26:52.323
Then why was he killed?

26:52.449 --> 26:55.075
l don't know. Maybe he found out
who the serial killer is!

26:55.201 --> 26:57.661
OK, so your husband is an engineer

26:57.787 --> 26:59.330
and a secret crime fighter.

27:00.498 --> 27:02.708
- Are you through?
- You're gonna tell me what he did.

27:02.834 --> 27:04.960
Oh, no. You are through.

27:08.089 --> 27:09.465
Just what l need.

27:32.656 --> 27:34.406
Hello?

27:45.794 --> 27:47.544
You Doakes?

27:47.671 --> 27:49.755
l am.

27:49.881 --> 27:52.841
And l'm guessing you're not
gonna tell me your name.

27:52.967 --> 27:54.093
l'm Curtis Barnes.

27:58.306 --> 28:00.849
l checked you out.
We know a lot of the same people.

28:00.975 --> 28:02.476
Everyone says l can trust you.

28:03.478 --> 28:05.062
You can trust me.

28:05.188 --> 28:07.064
l just need 48 hours.

28:07.190 --> 28:08.941
Somebody's gonna take me to Cuba,

28:09.067 --> 28:11.026
but it'll take a day to get the papers l need.

28:11.152 --> 28:12.653
So, what are you asking?

28:12.779 --> 28:14.655
Stall the investigation.

28:19.035 --> 28:20.577
Let me ask you one question.

28:22.664 --> 28:24.123
Yeah.

28:26.459 --> 28:28.544
Did you kill your wife?

28:32.048 --> 28:34.299
Yeah. l killed Alisha.

28:36.469 --> 28:37.928
Turn around.

28:38.054 --> 28:40.931
- Turn the fuck around!
- No, you are not arresting me.

28:41.057 --> 28:43.434
- Put the fucking gun down!
- l don't think so.

28:55.572 --> 28:59.116
So, how'd your social
appointment go last night?

29:00.326 --> 29:02.161
You know. . .

29:03.371 --> 29:04.455
l took your advice.

29:05.790 --> 29:07.040
My advice?

29:08.042 --> 29:09.710
To get out and have some fun.

29:09.836 --> 29:11.962
Got laid big-time.

29:15.175 --> 29:17.676
Well.

29:21.598 --> 29:23.932
Oh, l mean. . .

29:24.058 --> 29:28.187
l don't usually just go to the gym
and pick up strangers.

29:28.313 --> 29:29.813
The gym?

29:31.065 --> 29:33.859
Really, you have to save me here,
or l'm gonna shoot myself.

29:33.985 --> 29:36.528
The way you're going, you'd probably miss.

29:37.614 --> 29:39.198
Thanks.

29:39.324 --> 29:40.741
My date. . .

29:40.867 --> 29:42.409
was horrible.

29:42.535 --> 29:44.620
l picked her up.
and l don't know Miami,

29:44.746 --> 29:45.954
so l got us completely lost

29:46.080 --> 29:50.292
and she was chattering away the whole time
about this yogi master l just have to meet,

29:50.418 --> 29:52.753
so when we got to the restaurant,
l was tearing my hair out.

29:52.879 --> 29:54.421
Oh, God. l'm sorry.

29:54.547 --> 29:55.756
No, it was good.

29:55.882 --> 29:59.134
lt was a reminder that. . .

29:59.260 --> 30:00.636
l shouldn't be dating.

30:01.971 --> 30:04.223
Of course you should be.

30:04.349 --> 30:05.390
No.

30:06.476 --> 30:09.019
lt all comes down
to simple mathematics.

30:09.145 --> 30:13.524
A really beautiful relationship
is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. . .

30:14.692 --> 30:16.151
and l've already had mine.

30:20.698 --> 30:21.949
Lundy.

30:30.500 --> 30:32.626
Hey, so, l heard you found some algae

30:32.752 --> 30:35.295
- that might help crack the big case.
- You heard right.

30:35.421 --> 30:36.630
What kind of algae?

30:36.756 --> 30:38.131
Diatoms.

30:40.218 --> 30:42.094
Eukaryotic algae.

30:42.887 --> 30:46.014
OK, this is the first time
l regret not being a bigger nerd.

30:46.140 --> 30:47.140
Eukaryotic?

30:47.267 --> 30:48.976
l'll let Manny explain it to you.

30:49.102 --> 30:52.312
He's picking up the evidence tomorrow
so he can study it in his own lab.

30:52.438 --> 30:54.773
You know marine biologists,
real prima donnas.

30:54.899 --> 30:58.485
- Any chance you could show me?
- Masuka. Up front.

30:58.611 --> 31:00.279
Oh, no. lt's that crazy witch.

31:08.580 --> 31:10.330
What is this shit?

31:10.456 --> 31:12.499
l told you to find a smell.

31:12.625 --> 31:14.293
How fucking hard can that be?

31:14.419 --> 31:17.212
Look, l told you, a smell isn't. . .

31:17.338 --> 31:20.549
lt smells like another woman. l can smell it!

31:20.675 --> 31:21.967
Why can't you?

31:22.760 --> 31:24.887
This man is ruining my life

31:25.013 --> 31:28.181
and you all go on like
nothing is happening!

31:29.350 --> 31:31.518
Esmee.

31:32.937 --> 31:35.272
Come on, come on.

31:37.817 --> 31:41.320
This is the kind of thing that
makes me glad l have no feelings.

31:41.446 --> 31:44.615
Like they always say,
never take your dirty laundry to work.

32:03.009 --> 32:04.551
We can stand here all fucking day.

32:04.677 --> 32:07.387
l don't give a fuck.
but you're gonna put that gun down.

32:07.513 --> 32:10.098
Now, we were both rangers.
That bond goes deep.

32:10.224 --> 32:12.476
That doesn't mean anything to you?

32:12.602 --> 32:15.729
lf you weren't a ranger.
l'd have shot your ass by now.

32:17.523 --> 32:18.857
You killed your wife, man.

32:24.030 --> 32:26.281
l didn't mean to.

32:27.951 --> 32:29.368
lt happened, man.

32:32.038 --> 32:33.246
You married?

32:34.874 --> 32:35.874
No.

32:37.293 --> 32:39.086
Ever?

32:39.212 --> 32:40.712
Once.

32:40.838 --> 32:43.382
She dropped your ass, didn't she?

32:45.134 --> 32:46.593
What?

32:46.719 --> 32:50.097
Got tired of you
punching holes in the walls,

32:50.223 --> 32:52.599
waking up in the middle
of the night screaming?

32:53.977 --> 32:58.063
she's always yelling.
"You got to get help! "

32:59.232 --> 33:01.733
So she sends you to some doctor,

33:01.859 --> 33:04.152
but you don't go. . .

33:05.196 --> 33:09.241
'cause you know there's no help
for this kind of fucked-up.

33:10.118 --> 33:11.952
And finally, she can't take it any more,

33:12.078 --> 33:13.245
and she just says. . .

33:23.339 --> 33:25.257
That sound about right?

33:28.136 --> 33:30.012
You got it wrong, man.

33:32.265 --> 33:33.807
l left her.

33:35.977 --> 33:37.394
And why was that?

33:39.731 --> 33:42.107
'Cause l was afraid if l didn't, l'd kill her.

33:48.531 --> 33:51.158
Let's take the boat out.

33:52.285 --> 33:53.827
Now, why would we want to do that, man?

33:53.953 --> 33:56.747
We'd get out of this heat, for one.

33:56.873 --> 33:59.750
Nice ocean breeze.

34:01.377 --> 34:03.962
Maybe head toward Cuba.

34:04.088 --> 34:05.464
No.

34:05.590 --> 34:07.257
Come on, just get me to within sight.

34:07.383 --> 34:08.425
l could swim from there.

34:08.551 --> 34:10.093
Once l'm there, l could find the. . .

34:10.219 --> 34:11.845
You're wasting your time.

34:12.930 --> 34:15.432
Curtis, you're going back
to the station with me.

34:15.558 --> 34:18.727
No. l'm not going to prison.

34:19.187 --> 34:20.771
l didn't mean to kill her.

34:20.897 --> 34:22.564
lt's the only way out of here.

34:26.944 --> 34:28.862
Can't get you to reconsider?

34:30.990 --> 34:32.240
Not a chance.

34:34.368 --> 34:35.827
Well, that's too bad. . .

34:37.038 --> 34:40.040
'cause like l said, l'm not going to prison.

34:40.166 --> 34:42.501
Put the fucking gun down, Curtis.

34:42.627 --> 34:44.503
Don't make me do it, Curtis!

34:53.679 --> 34:55.347
Motherfucker.

35:08.903 --> 35:10.654
You gonna tell me how you're doing?

35:12.031 --> 35:13.573
l'm fine.

35:14.867 --> 35:16.660
Come on, Dex. Open up.

35:17.787 --> 35:19.162
Very fine?

35:21.707 --> 35:24.543
You're gonna have to do better than that.

35:24.669 --> 35:27.379
What's going on inside your head?

35:27.505 --> 35:30.006
What are you thinking?

35:31.801 --> 35:34.427
l'm afraid we're. . .

35:34.554 --> 35:36.054
done. . .

35:36.180 --> 35:38.056
you and l.

35:39.225 --> 35:40.725
Serious?

35:41.811 --> 35:44.187
You're breaking up with me?

35:45.398 --> 35:49.484
Actually, l don't think l want
to answer any more questions.

35:49.610 --> 35:52.988
Listen, Dexter, whatever
you think is right, is wrong.

35:53.114 --> 35:56.324
He asks you a question.
l want you to think of your answer first

35:56.450 --> 36:00.287
and then tell him the exact opposite, OK?

36:00.413 --> 36:02.122
So, let's just jump in, all right?

36:02.248 --> 36:06.376
Does it make you angry when
your teachers tell you what to do?

36:07.503 --> 36:09.045
No.

36:10.089 --> 36:11.423
Are you often bored?

36:13.926 --> 36:15.594
No.

36:15.720 --> 36:17.971
Have you ever killed an animal?

36:18.598 --> 36:19.598
No.

36:19.724 --> 36:21.141
Never.

36:28.733 --> 36:31.151
l should get back to work.

36:32.278 --> 36:35.405
Thanks. . .for everything.

36:49.879 --> 36:52.505
l heard about Pascal's little meltdown.

36:52.632 --> 36:54.549
She's been under a lot of stress.

36:54.675 --> 36:57.719
- You're still doing it.
- What's that?

36:58.387 --> 36:59.387
Sticking up for her.

36:59.513 --> 37:02.140
She is my superior.

37:03.643 --> 37:06.561
You know, l may have
misjudged you. Maria.

37:07.647 --> 37:10.857
Maybe you are more
than a political animal.

37:11.692 --> 37:13.193
You just might be a real cop.

37:14.362 --> 37:16.655
That's what l've been trying to tell you.

37:17.615 --> 37:19.532
You're back in charge of Homicide,

37:19.659 --> 37:21.826
effective immediately.

37:25.623 --> 37:26.831
Thank you.

37:28.834 --> 37:32.671
Pascal just set women
in the department back 20 years.

37:32.797 --> 37:35.006
lt's up to you to turn that around.

37:44.642 --> 37:45.892
There it is,

37:46.018 --> 37:48.311
like a gigantic white whale.

37:48.437 --> 37:50.522
My Moby-Dick.

37:55.611 --> 37:59.531
Man, this heat. l can't take it.

38:02.201 --> 38:05.537
l've got to get in my car
before l fucking melt.

38:07.915 --> 38:09.708
Which is exactly what needs to happen

38:09.834 --> 38:12.544
to my dearly departed friends.

38:24.765 --> 38:26.808
- Lila, what are you doing here?
- Hey.

38:26.934 --> 38:30.353
Dexter, you know, l've been thinking

38:30.479 --> 38:32.188
about you breaking up with me,

38:32.315 --> 38:34.607
and, well. . .

38:34.734 --> 38:37.777
l don't think it's in your best interest.

38:40.740 --> 38:44.409
l'm tired...
and hot, and l have somewhere to be.

38:44.535 --> 38:46.619
l think you should give me another chance.

38:46.746 --> 38:49.789
There's nothing you can do to help me.

38:49.915 --> 38:51.041
lt's not even you. lt's me.

38:51.167 --> 38:54.753
l am who l am.
and nobody's gonna change that.

38:55.921 --> 38:58.548
Whatever you think you are,

38:58.674 --> 39:00.759
you don't have to be that.

39:02.428 --> 39:03.887
That's where you're wrong.

39:05.473 --> 39:07.015
Stop judging yourself.

39:07.141 --> 39:09.184
There are no absolutes.

39:09.310 --> 39:12.604
No one's all good or evil.

39:18.819 --> 39:22.072
You're just gonna have to trust me on this.

39:22.782 --> 39:25.283
Jesus. Dexter!
What are you so fucking scared of?

39:25.826 --> 39:27.452
You make yourself into a monster

39:27.578 --> 39:30.663
so you no longer
bear responsibility for what you do.

39:30.790 --> 39:32.665
"l can't help it. l'm a monster.

39:32.792 --> 39:36.211
"Oh, of course l was gonna do that,
l'm a monster." lt's sad.

39:36.337 --> 39:38.004
And it's pathetic.

39:38.130 --> 39:40.757
And it breaks my heart.

39:41.926 --> 39:44.177
You don't think there are monsters
in this world?

39:44.303 --> 39:46.054
You don't believe people are evil?

39:51.644 --> 39:53.478
l'll show you evil.

40:09.495 --> 40:11.871
Well, you want me to open one?

40:25.219 --> 40:26.678
Joseph Cepeda.

40:34.228 --> 40:35.687
Wow.

40:38.858 --> 40:40.108
Can l touch?

40:42.278 --> 40:43.528
OK.

40:50.202 --> 40:52.579
This isn't exactly the reaction
l was looking for.

40:53.539 --> 40:56.875
Well, l've never seen anything
like this before.

40:58.043 --> 40:59.836
You're not disgusted. . .

41:00.921 --> 41:03.006
appalled, horrified?

41:05.759 --> 41:07.927
This. . .

41:09.221 --> 41:10.972
lncredible.

41:13.601 --> 41:15.560
But the person who did this. . .

41:15.686 --> 41:18.062
ls a person just like me. . .

41:19.148 --> 41:20.815
like you.

41:21.775 --> 41:23.693
We're all good, Dexter,

41:23.819 --> 41:26.529
and we're all evil.

41:29.575 --> 41:30.700
l thought l closed the door

41:30.826 --> 41:32.785
to anyone ever seeing me for who l am,

41:32.912 --> 41:34.746
but this woman sees me.

41:35.748 --> 41:37.540
She doesn't know it

41:37.666 --> 41:41.419
but she's looking behind the mask
and she"s not turning away.

41:43.047 --> 41:44.672
You really impressed me
in there today, son.

41:44.798 --> 41:47.800
l don't know how you did it,
but great job.

41:49.220 --> 41:50.803
l just pretended to be someone else.

41:50.930 --> 41:52.305
lt's working. Keep doing it.

41:52.431 --> 41:55.266
l mean, that doctor didn't even
see the monster inside you.

41:59.396 --> 42:00.813
l mean, not monster.

42:00.940 --> 42:04.484
lt's just, son, you know
that you have these dark urges.

42:04.610 --> 42:07.278
Anyway, good job.

42:12.743 --> 42:14.827
And somehow, even under all this pressure,

42:14.954 --> 42:18.665
she's abIe to make me
feeI OK about who I am

42:18.791 --> 42:20.458
and what I am.

42:28.300 --> 42:29.968
So. . .

42:32.805 --> 42:34.055
see you soon?

42:36.308 --> 42:37.517
Yes.

42:45.526 --> 42:47.151
l'm here for you.

43:18.392 --> 43:19.934
l've already told you everything.

43:20.060 --> 43:22.395
l know. l'm sorry.

43:23.439 --> 43:25.565
l came here to apologies.

43:27.359 --> 43:29.861
- You were very rude.
- l was.

43:30.946 --> 43:34.657
lt was shameful of me to disgrace
the memory of your husband.

43:37.536 --> 43:39.370
Thank you.

43:41.749 --> 43:44.208
lt's been a rough few days,

43:44.335 --> 43:47.879
not that you should care
about that. but...

43:49.048 --> 43:52.091
You know, all these bodies. . .

43:52.217 --> 43:54.218
l've never seen anything like it.

43:56.472 --> 43:58.348
All murdered. . .

43:59.475 --> 44:02.018
cut into pieces.

44:04.438 --> 44:06.356
The only way l could
make sense out of it

44:06.482 --> 44:09.984
was to convince myself
that they deserved it.

44:10.110 --> 44:13.613
They all needed to be bad people.

44:13.739 --> 44:16.491
But l should never have
taken it out on you.

44:27.378 --> 44:28.503
Can you feel it?

44:29.797 --> 44:32.090
The breeze?

44:32.216 --> 44:33.883
Coming over the water?

44:35.636 --> 44:36.969
lt's nice.

44:37.096 --> 44:39.013
Yeah.

44:39.139 --> 44:40.932
lt's finally cooling down.

44:48.232 --> 44:49.565
Have a nice evening.

44:50.526 --> 44:52.276
Wait.

44:56.115 --> 44:58.491
My husband. . .

44:58.617 --> 45:01.869
he kept guns...
hidden in the walls.

45:01.995 --> 45:03.663
l can show you.

45:30.816 --> 45:33.192
I've never broken into
my own place of employment,

45:33.318 --> 45:35.069
but desperate times...

45:48.000 --> 45:50.334
Garbage men can be so careless.

45:53.338 --> 45:56.174
l say put this
Bay Harbor Butcher on the city payroll.

45:56.300 --> 45:58.593
Give him a corner office, a company car,

45:58.719 --> 46:00.136
and aII the ammunition he needs.

46:00.262 --> 46:03.848
At least somebody is doing
something to clean up Miami,

46:03.974 --> 46:05.266
which is more than l can say

46:05.392 --> 46:07.477
for those folks down at City Hall.

46:16.278 --> 46:17.904
- Hey, Debra.
- Hi.

46:19.072 --> 46:20.907
Sorry about last night.

46:22.409 --> 46:24.577
Don't be.

46:24.703 --> 46:26.788
Maybe we can. . .

46:26.914 --> 46:28.039
do it again.

46:30.417 --> 46:31.959
How would you feel about a real date -

46:32.085 --> 46:35.588
you know, with clothes on?

46:36.173 --> 46:38.466
Where we actually talk
and get to know each other?

46:38.592 --> 46:39.801
Something like that.

46:40.719 --> 46:43.221
Sounds good. How about Saturday?

46:44.640 --> 46:46.098
Deal.

46:47.100 --> 46:49.602
Pick you up at eight.

46:55.359 --> 46:57.985
And with us right now,
we have psychologist Sandy Ramos

46:58.111 --> 47:00.530
to provide insight into
the Bay Harbor Butcher -

47:00.656 --> 47:04.116
eviI seriaI kiIIer
or avenging force for good?

47:08.539 --> 47:10.832
This is the last time.

47:10.958 --> 47:12.625
Bertrand?

47:12.751 --> 47:16.337
Oh. babe. come on.
You don't mean that.

47:16.463 --> 47:18.673
No, l do mean it. l do.

47:18.799 --> 47:20.216
l can't see you any more.

47:20.342 --> 47:23.511
Wait, wait, wait, wait, no.
No. wait. no.

47:23.637 --> 47:25.847
l don't understand, Maria.

47:25.973 --> 47:28.432
This. . .this is done.

47:28.559 --> 47:30.184
She's gone. lt's over with.

47:30.310 --> 47:34.939
We can finally be out in the open.

47:35.065 --> 47:37.775
Just you and me, OK?

47:37.901 --> 47:41.028
Just like what we wanted.

47:41.154 --> 47:43.573
No, Bertrand, stop.

47:43.699 --> 47:47.326
Stop it. Stop, stop, stop. Stop!

47:49.329 --> 47:52.498
Go back to Esmee.

47:55.586 --> 47:57.628
So, what, this is how it is?

48:00.215 --> 48:04.051
You get your job back...
and now you. . .you're through with me?

48:04.177 --> 48:05.720
Look, don't play the victim.

48:05.846 --> 48:07.847
You knew what this was
from the beginning.

48:10.517 --> 48:13.686
You are one cold-hearted bitch,
l'll tell you that.

48:15.063 --> 48:17.398
No, you don't get to tell me anything!

48:18.275 --> 48:20.568
l am not the piece of shit
fucking another woman

48:20.694 --> 48:21.903
behind his fiancee's back!

48:22.029 --> 48:24.196
You try and judge me, asshole.

48:27.868 --> 48:30.369
You don't know the first thing about me.

48:43.050 --> 48:45.217
Yeah, so, l think l misjudged Lila.

48:46.803 --> 48:48.262
Are you sure?

48:48.388 --> 48:52.099
l mean, she's unconventional
but l think she's the best sponsor. . .

48:52.225 --> 48:53.643
for me.

48:55.562 --> 48:57.939
Well, if she can help keep you clean. . .

48:58.065 --> 49:00.274
Chop, chop, chop, chop,
chop, chop, chop, chop!

49:00.400 --> 49:03.194
Whoa, who's this?
Could it be Robin Hood?

49:03.320 --> 49:05.404
No, l'm the Butcher Man!

49:06.239 --> 49:07.448
l made it for him.

49:07.574 --> 49:09.659
l thought it might help with the nightmares.

49:09.785 --> 49:11.702
Bet you didn't know you could fly.

49:19.127 --> 49:24.006
Have l misjudged Lila? l have no idea.

49:24.132 --> 49:26.926
l do know she's helping me look
at myself in a different way.

49:30.305 --> 49:31.722
He's good, that one.

49:31.848 --> 49:34.141
l know. l got lucky.

49:34.267 --> 49:36.394
Quite an actor.

49:37.521 --> 49:40.773
He's hiding something. l'm sure of it.

49:50.617 --> 49:52.827
For example.
we find the genus Nitzschia,

49:52.953 --> 49:55.371
and we know we're talking
about a freshwater marina,

49:55.497 --> 49:57.456
and the algae can tell us more

49:57.582 --> 50:00.167
about what kind of pollutants
are in the water.

50:00.293 --> 50:02.211
which would even further narrow. . .

50:20.689 --> 50:22.064
Damn it!

50:25.027 --> 50:27.194
For the first time,
l feel the future might hold

50:27.320 --> 50:28.863
something different for me.

50:28.989 --> 50:32.033
lt's possible l'm just fooling myself,

50:32.159 --> 50:34.452
but l'm willing to take the risk.

50:37.289 --> 50:38.998
Fucking garbage men.

50:40.125 --> 50:43.002
Broke the refrigeration unit.
lt blew hot air all night.

50:43.128 --> 50:45.838
Turned the bodies into pink mush.

50:45.964 --> 50:47.882
How awful!

50:48.008 --> 50:50.342
Completely ruined.

50:52.137 --> 50:54.680
You brought your marine
biologist and everything.

50:54.806 --> 50:58.059
Yeah. Made him vomit.

51:02.230 --> 51:04.482
Good thing the heat
didn't affect the rocks.

51:04.608 --> 51:07.318
Lundy had us store them separately.

51:08.195 --> 51:09.153
The rocks?

51:09.279 --> 51:12.239
Yeah. The algae we found on the rocks.

51:12.365 --> 51:14.909
The Bay Harbor Butcher used them
to weigh his bags down.

51:15.035 --> 51:18.204
We're assuming he picked them up
where he docks his boat.

51:22.709 --> 51:25.628
But l thought the marine biologist
came to examine the bodies.

51:25.754 --> 51:28.631
No. No, it's all about the rocks, baby.

51:28.757 --> 51:31.467
Manny took him to his lab.
Should have results in a week or so.

51:31.593 --> 51:35.262
That should help us narrow down
what marina they came from.

51:36.014 --> 51:38.265
lt's an odd sensation to be experiencing

51:38.391 --> 51:41.268
what might be called hope
for the first time in my life.

51:41.394 --> 51:44.355
At the same time, l suddenly
find myself weighing the benefits

51:44.481 --> 51:48.317
of electrocution versus lethal injection.

51:48.443 --> 51:50.569
But here I am.
