WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:03.799
Previously on Dexter.

00:03.925 --> 00:06.301
We must catch them at the shipyard.

00:06.428 --> 00:09.930
He's gonna find out
and then he's gonna kill me.

00:10.932 --> 00:13.225
Harry knew my mother.

00:13.351 --> 00:17.021
Why would Rita have Narcotics Anonymous
literature if Paul's dead?

00:17.147 --> 00:20.357
Because recently l entered the program.

00:20.483 --> 00:23.110
How many fucking ways
do l have to tell you l'm fine?

00:23.236 --> 00:27.156
This is my department. l need to know
you're fit for duty. That's my job.

00:27.282 --> 00:30.701
l always eat lunch at one o'clock.
You'll learn that about me.

00:30.827 --> 00:32.786
Sit down.

00:32.912 --> 00:35.664
You're very fidgety.
Anyone ever tell you that?

00:35.790 --> 00:39.168
My father. You applying for the job?

00:39.294 --> 00:43.047
But you said you'd call. Where are you
and when are you coming back?

00:43.757 --> 00:47.509
- Tomorrow morning.
- Promise you'll stop by the house?

00:47.635 --> 00:49.887
- l'll see you soon.
- ls she cool with this?

00:50.013 --> 00:52.181
- l didn't tell her.
- l don't care what you did.

00:52.307 --> 00:54.391
I'm not sure who made me what I am.

00:54.517 --> 00:56.810
Thing is, l've met someone
who doesn't care.

00:56.936 --> 00:59.021
l want to talk to you about Coral Cove.

00:59.147 --> 01:02.483
- What about it?
- The algae on the rocks sent us there.

01:02.609 --> 01:06.528
l'd seriously consider moving your boat.
Security out there sucks ass.

01:06.654 --> 01:10.324
When l get back, l need to make sure there's
no blood traces on my boat.

01:10.450 --> 01:14.369
This isn't a commerciaI marina
but l see the upkeep is dismal,

01:14.496 --> 01:17.873
so l'm ordering 24-hour surveillance
on this marina and the others.

03:17.285 --> 03:21.288
There's another shipment
coming in tomorrow. Cocaine.

03:23.458 --> 03:26.168
- How much?
- 300 bricks, give or take.

03:29.005 --> 03:33.425
- Can you get your hands on some?
- That wasn't part of our agreement.

03:33.551 --> 03:39.473
Look, we need hard evidence, otherwise
it's just your word against Estrada's.

03:39.599 --> 03:43.101
l'll protect you. l promise.

03:47.815 --> 03:49.858
You better.

03:51.361 --> 03:53.445
Would you meet me later?

03:53.988 --> 03:56.156
Laura, the tape's still rolling.

04:04.832 --> 04:06.667
Very convincing.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.462
What was that?

04:16.427 --> 04:18.512
Laura, the tape's still rolling.

04:21.266 --> 04:23.058
Damn it.

04:23.184 --> 04:27.062
My mother,
confidentiaI informant and mumbIer.

04:29.357 --> 04:32.734
Whatever she had to whisper,
l probably don"t want to hear.

04:35.738 --> 04:40.075
lt seems that my foster father and
my biological mother were having an affair.

04:40.201 --> 04:44.162
lt's bad enough l can't shake the visual
but the questions...

04:44.289 --> 04:47.791
Did he bIame himseIf for her death?
ls that why he took me in?

04:48.251 --> 04:51.044
Did he love her or was he just using her?

04:52.046 --> 04:53.880
Was he using me?

04:54.465 --> 04:58.427
l thought Harry's code was on-the-spot
creative problem solving

04:58.553 --> 05:01.722
but maybe he planned for me
to settle the score all along.

05:04.350 --> 05:07.269
It's times Iike this I wish
l really were a drug addict.

05:07.395 --> 05:10.188
l had problems as a kid
because of what happened to my mother.

05:10.315 --> 05:13.483
Harry said he'd help me
but we only talked about his rules.

05:13.609 --> 05:16.695
l spent so much time trying
to live up to his expectations

05:16.821 --> 05:19.239
because l thought he had
my interests in mind but. . .

05:19.365 --> 05:23.660
lf you come over this late,
at least you could bring me a coffee.

05:23.786 --> 05:27.372
- sorry.
- Cappuccino. Make a note of it.

05:34.339 --> 05:38.175
Truth is, Dex, doesn't really matter
why Harry did what he did.

05:38.301 --> 05:41.636
The result's the same.
You have an addiction.

05:43.598 --> 05:45.932
Do you think Harry made me what l am?

05:46.517 --> 05:50.687
Plenty of people go through trauma
without turning to addiction.

05:50.813 --> 05:54.483
Whatever Harry taught you
led you down the wrong path.

05:55.360 --> 05:59.571
But l built everything in my life
on what Harry said l was supposed to be.

05:59.697 --> 06:01.698
My job, girlfriend. . .

06:03.034 --> 06:05.577
lt's all what Harry told me l needed.

06:06.287 --> 06:08.121
What do you think you need?

06:11.125 --> 06:12.709
l have no idea.

06:12.835 --> 06:17.589
Whatever's inside you is splattered
all over that paper that l took from your lab.

06:19.133 --> 06:21.134
Looks messy.

06:21.260 --> 06:23.845
lt probably is.

06:23.971 --> 06:25.847
Look, Dexter,

06:27.308 --> 06:29.351
everyone has a moment when they realize

06:29.477 --> 06:33.355
that their value system
is different from their parents'.

06:33.481 --> 06:37.484
Mine was in college, but, hey,
maybe you're a late bloomer.

06:37.610 --> 06:40.362
- Lucky me.
- Damn right, lucky you.

06:41.155 --> 06:43.490
You get to have a fresh start.

06:43.616 --> 06:46.827
Whatever you thought,
whatever you did doesn't matter.

06:47.453 --> 06:50.038
Now you get to figure out who you are.

06:55.378 --> 06:59.339
l went to Lila for answers
but now all l have is more questions.

06:59.465 --> 07:01.716
Who am I? What do I need?

07:01.843 --> 07:03.927
What do I want?

07:04.053 --> 07:06.555
Coffee. l really want a cup of coffee.

07:06.681 --> 07:09.224
- What up, half-day?
- ls there coffee left?

07:09.350 --> 07:12.477
- You're late.
- l fell asleep before you got home.

07:12.603 --> 07:14.688
Were you at Rita's?

07:16.732 --> 07:18.859
You're welcome, ass.

07:18.985 --> 07:21.903
- Your brother looks like shit.
- Tell me about it.

07:22.029 --> 07:25.907
l may be out of line with this
but did he fall off the wagon?

07:26.534 --> 07:30.871
What wagon? The only wagon
Dexter's ever had is a Radio Flyer.

07:30.997 --> 07:33.123
Your brother's a junkie.

07:33.875 --> 07:36.042
- lsn't he?
- Dexter?

07:37.378 --> 07:40.505
Are you high? He's never even
smoked a cigarette.

07:41.632 --> 07:47.012
l'm glad you got some new material, though,
'cause "freak" and "psycho" were getting tired.

08:00.193 --> 08:02.068
Agent Lundy.

08:02.487 --> 08:06.114
So, l hear a rumor you're tracking
all our internet activity.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.074
So is it true?

08:08.201 --> 08:10.827
'Cause l can explain all that she-male stuff.

08:12.747 --> 08:16.791
- l need my team outside in five minutes.
- That sounds important.

08:16.918 --> 08:21.546
Got a major break. Patrol found a guy
saying he escaped the Bay Harbor Butcher.

08:21.672 --> 08:24.466
He claimed he was captured
a couple hours ago.

08:24.592 --> 08:28.929
Well, that"s a neat trick, considering
l was asleep. At least trying to sleep.

08:29.055 --> 08:31.139
- Could be good news for me.
- Morgan.

08:31.265 --> 08:33.266
- Yes.
- The other Morgan.

08:34.101 --> 08:36.478
l'd like you to join us if you can spare him.

08:36.604 --> 08:38.647
That's fine with me.

08:38.773 --> 08:40.941
- ls there blood?
- Not that l'm aware of.

08:41.067 --> 08:45.487
- But what about Masuka?
- Yeah, l'm the lead forensics investigator.

08:45.613 --> 08:49.407
Masuka's lab work is pressing.
l need him to hold down the fort here.

08:49.534 --> 08:51.910
He totally saw the she-male stuff.

08:52.036 --> 08:54.913
So, what do you say? l'll buy you lunch after.

08:55.039 --> 08:58.917
- Pork sandwich, right?
- Yes. sure.

08:59.043 --> 09:03.338
Good. l figured it was time to get
a fresh perspective on the case.

09:03.464 --> 09:07.259
Rumor has it you have a knack
for attracting serial killers.

09:07.385 --> 09:11.012
- l hear the same about you.
- Dexter also enjoys walks on the beach

09:11.138 --> 09:15.100
- and foreign films.
- Then we've got a lot to talk about.

09:38.165 --> 09:41.126
He knocked me out.
Then, when l woke up,

09:41.252 --> 09:43.628
l was tied up in that train car over there.

09:43.754 --> 09:46.298
- You said he used rope?
- Dumb fuck.

09:47.383 --> 09:50.927
l stretched it out so l can get my legs free
and then busted out.

09:51.053 --> 09:53.722
Ran across the road.
almost got hit by that guy's car.

09:53.848 --> 09:57.017
So that's the alleged victim
of the Bay Harbor Butcher.

09:58.644 --> 10:00.729
But I've never seen him before.

10:00.855 --> 10:02.897
Dex!

10:03.024 --> 10:06.985
O'Connor, Singer. Make sure
you take pictures of those footprints.

10:07.111 --> 10:08.570
- Hey, Dex.
- Hey.

10:08.696 --> 10:12.240
So the victim says the Butcher
held him in this train car.

10:12.366 --> 10:16.161
Lundy wants a search for trace evidence.
Your spidey sense tingling?

10:16.287 --> 10:19.164
- We'll see when l get inside.
- Take your time.

10:19.290 --> 10:22.083
We've never been this close to this pendejo.

10:22.209 --> 10:24.336
Closer than you think, amigo.

10:36.223 --> 10:38.099
He may have borrowed my pseudonym

10:38.225 --> 10:42.062
but this guy doesn't know
the first thing about my techniques.

10:42.188 --> 10:44.022
Amateur.

10:44.148 --> 10:45.774
What makes you think it was the Butcher?

10:45.900 --> 10:49.778
He said the Bay Harbor Butcher's
gonna clean up Miami.

10:49.904 --> 10:52.197
He said, "You're gonna get
what you deserve."

10:52.323 --> 10:54.449
And what do you deserve, Mr. Henry?

10:54.575 --> 10:58.078
Well, look, the butcher kills criminals, right?

10:58.871 --> 11:00.538
l just got out of jail, you know?

11:00.665 --> 11:04.250
Six years for aggravated assault
and home invasion. so...

11:04.377 --> 11:08.088
He kills murderers.
You didn't kill anyone, did you?

11:08.214 --> 11:11.091
All right, l gave this old guy a heart attack.

11:12.259 --> 11:14.469
lt's not like l was doing it on purpose.

11:14.595 --> 11:17.806
l used to hit. you know.
retirement homes, communities.

11:17.932 --> 11:20.600
Snowbirds are easy targets.

11:20.726 --> 11:23.978
And l don't do that any more. l did my time.

11:24.105 --> 11:26.356
Your mother must be so proud.

11:28.275 --> 11:31.236
l want to check out
the train car with your brother.

11:32.196 --> 11:36.491
Why don't you, er, keep an eye on our friend
here while we confirm his story?

11:37.326 --> 11:40.161
Oh, yeah. Sure.

11:42.957 --> 11:46.167
Killing tools left behind.
I'd never be this careIess.

11:46.293 --> 11:49.295
whoever did this would
never pass Harry's muster.

11:50.464 --> 11:52.340
Then again, neither would Harry.

11:52.466 --> 11:57.595
He lied about my past. He cheated on my
foster mother with my biological mother.

11:58.222 --> 12:01.182
Maybe Lila"s right. lt"s time
for a new set of standards.

12:01.308 --> 12:05.603
lf you were the Bay Harbor Butcher,
would you use a place like this?

12:07.815 --> 12:12.569
Actually, yes. Locationwise,
it's not a bad choice.

12:12.695 --> 12:15.488
lt's quiet, remote.

12:16.782 --> 12:20.452
Could use an upgrade
in the lighting department, but. . .

12:24.206 --> 12:26.291
So you think this is our guy?

12:27.543 --> 12:29.753
Not exactly.

12:30.921 --> 12:34.632
From what l understand, this space
doesn't support his MO.

12:34.759 --> 12:36.718
lt's filthy, for one thing.

12:39.346 --> 12:42.557
Butcher's clean, orderly. . .

12:48.522 --> 12:50.982
. . .and some people would say compulsive.

12:54.445 --> 12:58.448
- Really? You think he's compulsive?
- This doesn't fit. either.

12:58.574 --> 13:00.450
A hatchet is sloppy.

13:01.535 --> 13:04.412
The butcher uses precise
surgical instruments.

13:04.955 --> 13:10.460
Well. he's not that predictable. is he?
He mixes it up, different tools every time.

13:10.586 --> 13:12.420
And never rope.

13:12.546 --> 13:14.964
He uses duct tape and plastic wrap.

13:15.090 --> 13:19.010
- Plastic wrap? How can you tell?
- Depression patterns in the skin.

13:20.805 --> 13:23.723
Maybe the butcher's
having an identity crisis.

13:25.226 --> 13:28.019
- lt's entirely possible.
- But not likely.

13:29.188 --> 13:34.234
My guess is we're looking for a vigilante
inspired by the butcher's principles.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.653
Bet he never thought he'd be a role model.

13:36.779 --> 13:38.655
l bet you're right.

13:40.241 --> 13:43.493
So, any new leads on the real guy?

13:43.619 --> 13:47.413
Not yet. We're hoping the cameras'll
turn something up.

13:47.998 --> 13:49.749
- Cameras?
- ln the marinas.

13:49.875 --> 13:54.254
Put them in a couple of days ago
to monitor for suspicious activities.

13:54.839 --> 13:58.049
Good news for all those cops
who keep boats at Coral Cove.

13:58.175 --> 14:00.343
You've got one, too, right?

14:04.098 --> 14:08.226
Yeah. Yeah. we've been needing
a security upgrade for a long time now.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.605
Has Lundy seen me on the tape?

14:12.731 --> 14:15.775
ls that why he invited me along today,
to mess with me?

14:21.282 --> 14:27.161
Hey. l'm sorry if l was short with you this
morning. l'm lost without my morning coffee.

14:27.288 --> 14:29.497
Whatever.

14:29.623 --> 14:32.500
How was your play date with Lundy?
Did you bond?

14:33.419 --> 14:36.588
You didn't say they put up
security cameras at the marinas.

14:36.714 --> 14:40.842
They're not doing any good. We have
to update the station's computer system

14:40.968 --> 14:43.094
before we can synch
with Lundy's equipment.

14:43.220 --> 14:47.557
- so the cameras aren't recording?
- They are but nobody's seen the footage.

14:47.683 --> 14:51.811
- Lundy said it should be fixed by tonight.
- Well, that's a relief.

15:02.781 --> 15:05.658
Your mom told me about
your cultural presentation.

15:05.784 --> 15:08.161
Did your teacher assign you a country yet?

15:09.455 --> 15:11.331
Saudi Arabia.

15:11.832 --> 15:13.791
No. That's lsrael.

15:14.335 --> 15:18.463
- l won't tell the Saudis you said that.
- Cody's enjoying himself.

15:18.589 --> 15:22.342
- Dexter's very patient with him.
- Dexter's a saint.

15:23.552 --> 15:26.512
- Where's Astor?
- She's by the water.

15:28.015 --> 15:29.724
l want to say goodbye.

15:29.850 --> 15:33.519
l got to go. l was supposed
to meet Lila ten minutes ago.

15:35.731 --> 15:38.900
- Who's Lila?
- His sponsor.

15:39.026 --> 15:41.069
Really? A woman?

15:41.779 --> 15:46.324
Yes, Mom. Dexter's sponsor is a woman.
ls that a problem?

15:47.409 --> 15:49.494
ls she attractive?

15:49.620 --> 15:52.080
- Look. Mom...
- l'm just curious.

15:52.998 --> 15:54.958
ls she?

15:55.709 --> 15:59.337
l have an idea. Why don't you and Lila
have dinner with us?

16:00.631 --> 16:03.091
That's very kind of you, Gail, but, erm. . .

16:03.217 --> 16:07.053
lt would be nice if we got to know the woman
you're spending so much time with.

16:07.179 --> 16:10.723
- Mom, they're doing step work.
- But they have to eat, right?

16:17.147 --> 16:19.732
- Oh, here. Let me help.
- Thank you.

16:24.071 --> 16:26.155
So lovely of you to have me over.

16:27.741 --> 16:29.909
Now l can put names to faces.

16:30.035 --> 16:32.412
Dexter talks about you all the time.

16:33.247 --> 16:35.081
Good things, l hope.

16:36.083 --> 16:38.668
Dexter never says a bad word
about anyone.

16:49.722 --> 16:54.017
Tell me, Lila. What exactly
are you recovering from?

16:55.269 --> 16:57.270
l'm a meth addict.

16:57.396 --> 16:59.355
Sober five years.

16:59.481 --> 17:03.151
l don't know much about meth.
Rita's ex-husband shot heroin.

17:03.277 --> 17:05.653
Like Dexter.

17:05.779 --> 17:07.864
Guess we know your type, don't we?

17:08.782 --> 17:10.742
Just can't seem to help myself.

17:13.454 --> 17:15.246
You have nothing to worry about.

17:15.372 --> 17:17.874
With Dexter, l mean.

17:19.043 --> 17:20.752
l'm sitting right here.

17:20.878 --> 17:24.505
- l didn't mean to imply. . .
- No. l completely understand.

17:24.631 --> 17:28.760
Rita's your little baby.
You have every right to be concerned.

17:28.886 --> 17:32.638
But if l can reassure you,
Dexter's doing incredibly well.

17:34.683 --> 17:36.934
Well, l'm happy to hear that.

17:37.061 --> 17:39.562
l'm sure it has everything to do with you two.

17:39.688 --> 17:42.482
From what he tells me,
you're very supportive.

17:42.608 --> 17:44.650
Dexter's lucky to have you.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.361
That's very sweet of you to say.

17:48.280 --> 17:53.701
So, Lila, tell us more about yourself.
Dexter tells me you're an artist.

17:53.827 --> 17:58.122
Yeah, she does amazing things
with a blowtorch. What's it called?

17:58.957 --> 18:00.833
Talent?

18:03.045 --> 18:07.381
But l'm not the only artist
at the table.

18:09.510 --> 18:12.470
Dexter? Since when?

18:12.596 --> 18:17.100
lt's not really art. She's talking
about a blood-spatter pattern from work.

18:17.226 --> 18:20.394
What kind of career choice
is blood spatter. exactly?

18:22.523 --> 18:24.607
He helps catch criminals, Mother.

18:25.776 --> 18:31.030
And it makes perfect sense, really.
What with Dexter's mother and everything.

18:33.367 --> 18:35.034
You know.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.370
She's. . .dead.

18:43.377 --> 18:45.211
Forgot the bread.

18:47.172 --> 18:51.134
Dinner was fantastic, Rita.
And this dessert. Wow.

18:56.515 --> 18:59.600
l never thought l'd say this
but l kind of like her.

19:00.644 --> 19:03.062
Yeah, me too. She's really helping me.

19:05.607 --> 19:08.317
l wish she didn't have to help you tonight.

19:09.361 --> 19:13.114
- Why? What are you thinking?
- Mm. My mom could watch the kids.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.408
l have to swing by the office tonight.

19:16.451 --> 19:19.370
l need to take care
of something really important.

19:19.997 --> 19:22.790
Oh, honey, can't it wait till morning?

19:22.916 --> 19:24.959
l promise we'll go straight to bed.

19:25.085 --> 19:29.005
You're very convincing
but it needs to get done tonight.

19:30.465 --> 19:32.466
Just give me an hour, OK?

19:33.093 --> 19:35.386
- Meet you back at my place?
- OK.

19:42.561 --> 19:45.104
l think it's funny you write children's books.

19:45.230 --> 19:50.067
Yeah. a big. tough guy like me should do
something manly, huh, like wrangling cattle?

19:50.194 --> 19:54.405
l don't even know any kids' books.
My dad told me cop stories before bed.

19:55.782 --> 19:59.118
lt was really the only alone time
l ever got with him.

20:01.622 --> 20:03.915
- You OK?
- Yeah.

20:05.667 --> 20:08.461
Sorry. Just an annoying day at work.

20:12.758 --> 20:15.676
You know that FBl guy l was talking about?

20:15.802 --> 20:19.347
l was really starting to feel
like l was his go-to girl but. . .

20:20.724 --> 20:24.185
- He realized Dexter is the superior Morgan.
- That's not true.

20:24.311 --> 20:27.605
l should be used to it.
lt was like that with my dad, work.

20:28.982 --> 20:31.692
- l hoped with Lundy it would be different.
- Why?

20:31.818 --> 20:34.320
l don't know.

20:35.322 --> 20:37.323
l respect him.

20:37.991 --> 20:40.368
He's great at his job,

20:40.494 --> 20:42.453
super smart,

20:43.622 --> 20:47.792
and funny but in this really dry way
where he doesn't even know it.

20:48.585 --> 20:50.628
You love him.

20:51.171 --> 20:53.172
What?

20:53.298 --> 20:56.050
- No.
- You do. You have a crush on Grundy.

20:56.176 --> 20:58.594
- Lundy.
- Oh, now you're touchy about it.

20:58.720 --> 21:03.349
l don't have a crush on him. He's like
my dad. except l spent my whole life

21:03.475 --> 21:08.020
trying to get my dad to notice me and he
actually pays attention to what l have to say.

21:08.146 --> 21:12.358
- And Grundy loves you.
- Oh. fuck off.

21:30.627 --> 21:32.670
Lundy's good. Double locked.

21:34.047 --> 21:36.090
And a bit beyond my expertise.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.052
l could try to crack it open
but in my own station...

21:41.221 --> 21:43.055
Too risky.

21:53.191 --> 21:56.068
l can do this more often
now that my mom's in town.

21:58.322 --> 22:00.406
l feel like we're being bad.

22:04.077 --> 22:06.495
Bad? Bad is good.

22:08.081 --> 22:09.874
Oh, let the machine get it.

22:11.835 --> 22:14.003
Hey, Dex, just calling to check in.

22:14.129 --> 22:18.257
To have a debriefing on dinner.
l thought it went well, don't you?

22:18.383 --> 22:23.262
- l'd say so.
- Rita's sweet. Very Martha Stewart.

22:24.222 --> 22:26.307
l love Martha Stewart.

22:26.433 --> 22:30.144
God, her mum. She"s got quite
the rod up her arse, doesn't she?

22:30.270 --> 22:34.482
By the way, l am such a twat. l can't believe l
almost slipped up about your mum.

22:34.608 --> 22:38.527
CouId have been worse. I couId have
spilled the beans about our road trip.

22:38.653 --> 22:41.322
- Don't you dare.
- Can you imagine Rita's face

22:41.448 --> 22:45.368
if l'd told her that you and l
had spent the night together in a hotel?

22:45.494 --> 22:49.038
- Anyway...
- You and Lila stayed in a hotel together?

22:49.164 --> 22:52.124
- We had adjoining rooms.
- Adjoining rooms? Right.

22:52.626 --> 22:56.003
l am such an idiot. l can't believe
l defended you to my mother

22:56.129 --> 22:58.381
- while you slept with another woman.
- Wait.

22:58.507 --> 23:01.342
l thought you were different than Paul
but you're the same.

23:01.468 --> 23:04.637
Actually. you're worse.
You made me trust you.

23:06.431 --> 23:09.058
- Rita, please, let me expl. . .
- l've had it!

23:09.184 --> 23:13.396
l have been patient and understanding
but there's only so much l can take.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.981
You're a liar and a cheat and l am through.

23:16.691 --> 23:18.651
lt's over, Dexter.

23:24.825 --> 23:28.452
Tracy was given
the Iiver of an accident victim...

23:28.578 --> 23:32.957
Hi, honey. l thought you were
spending the night at Dexter's?

23:33.083 --> 23:36.335
We had a fight. l think we broke up.

23:37.212 --> 23:39.046
What?

23:43.218 --> 23:45.094
Mama's here.

23:53.103 --> 23:56.856
Yesterday l was so hopeful.
A new me, a new life.

23:58.275 --> 24:00.860
But a life without Rita seems strange.

24:03.363 --> 24:06.866
What in the name of fuck
are you doing up so early?

24:06.992 --> 24:08.909
l got to get to the station.

24:21.381 --> 24:23.591
Are you OK?

24:23.717 --> 24:27.178
You seem weird, weirder than usual.

24:28.054 --> 24:30.264
Rita broke up with me last night.

24:30.807 --> 24:32.766
Seriously?

24:35.395 --> 24:37.396
What happened?

24:37.939 --> 24:39.857
lt's a long story.

24:39.983 --> 24:44.111
- l've got time.
- Yeah, but l don't.

24:45.030 --> 24:50.117
- Cliff Notes.
- She thinks l did something bad but l didn't.

24:52.204 --> 24:54.121
- Did you tell her that?
- l tried.

24:54.247 --> 24:58.250
But she dumped me
before l had a chance to explain.

24:58.376 --> 25:01.962
- She said, "lt's over," and left.
- Well. did you go after her?

25:02.088 --> 25:05.299
- Was l supposed to?
- You're such a guy.

25:05.425 --> 25:09.970
When l get pissed, l say stuff l don't mean.
"l hate you." "l faked it."

25:10.096 --> 25:12.306
- "You're hung like a grape."
- You lost me.

25:12.432 --> 25:17.144
When Rita said, "lt's over,"
l'm sure she didn't actually mean it's over.

25:17.270 --> 25:20.981
Stop being a douchebag
and go fight for her.

25:21.107 --> 25:24.318
- She's fucking perfect.
- l know.

25:33.203 --> 25:35.996
Hello? Oh, hey.

25:38.291 --> 25:40.459
Sure, l'll be right there.

25:42.837 --> 25:44.755
Yeah. l'll tell him.

25:45.465 --> 25:47.383
Bye.

25:50.053 --> 25:53.055
- Who's that, Gabriel?
- No. Lundy.

25:53.181 --> 25:57.059
He's holding a meeting at the station
about the Bay Harbor case.

25:57.185 --> 25:59.853
He specifically requested that you be there.

25:59.980 --> 26:02.731
l missed my window.
He's already seen the footage.

26:03.650 --> 26:06.443
- Me? Why?
- Because you're his new butt buddy.

26:08.655 --> 26:12.241
- You gonna be OK?
- Check back with me later.

26:18.081 --> 26:21.625
The show's started but have they seen
the feature presentation,

26:21.751 --> 26:25.546
Bane Of The Bay Harbor Butcher,
starring Dexter Morgan as himself?

26:25.672 --> 26:27.881
- So, it's all synched up?
- Yep.

26:28.008 --> 26:31.552
You can watch streaming video
of the marina now if you want to.

26:31.678 --> 26:34.847
Yeah. Maybe you'll get to see
some pontoon poon.

26:37.017 --> 26:39.018
Did you. . .need something?

26:39.811 --> 26:42.354
That's not my marina...yet.

26:43.273 --> 26:48.235
l'll make my on-screen debut soon. l've got to
figure out how to get to those video files.

26:48.361 --> 26:51.447
The media frenzy on the Bay Harbor Butcher's
come back to bite us.

26:51.573 --> 26:52.656
Big surprise.

26:52.782 --> 26:55.200
Now we've got a wannabe
vigilante out there

26:55.327 --> 26:59.830
who liked the Butcher's style and thought,
"Hey, l should try this at home."

27:01.750 --> 27:04.043
He attacked this man, John Henry,

27:04.628 --> 27:06.629
ex-convict, preyed on the elderly.

27:06.755 --> 27:11.842
lt gets better. l have already
received reports of ads on craigslist

27:11.968 --> 27:15.346
and shop bulletin boards.
requesting the butcher's services.

27:15.472 --> 27:18.682
People think they've found
their own personal Batman.

27:19.392 --> 27:23.979
This is not good news. This kind of thing
catches on, we're looking at an epidemic.

27:24.105 --> 27:26.982
- Like herpes.
- Fuck, Masuka, l'm trying to listen.

27:27.108 --> 27:29.443
One in four, Morgan. One in four.

27:29.569 --> 27:31.987
Vigilante justice is domestic terrorism.

27:32.781 --> 27:35.991
And terrorism prevention
is the FBl's top priority.

27:36.117 --> 27:42.164
l have done my best to be diplomatic
but if we lose one life to a vigilante,

27:42.707 --> 27:44.750
l will pull this case from Miami Metro

27:44.876 --> 27:48.170
and hand it over in full to the bureau,
that's a promise.

27:48.296 --> 27:51.465
That"s a disaster.
lt'd be raining Feds in Miami.

27:51.591 --> 27:56.011
So, if we want to keep the investigation here,
we need to nip this in the bud.

27:56.137 --> 27:58.722
make an example of our would-be vigilante.

27:58.848 --> 28:01.517
We don't need a bunch
of weekend warriors...

28:01.643 --> 28:03.727
l think l found a suspect.

28:07.190 --> 28:09.066
- Could you?
- Yeah.

28:12.654 --> 28:17.449
Ken Olson. Olson's mother was hurt badly
in a home-invasion robbery.

28:18.159 --> 28:21.036
- Guess who hurt her?
- Oh, please tell me John Henry,

28:21.162 --> 28:24.832
- our train-car victim?
- l think Olson attacked him for revenge.

28:24.958 --> 28:26.875
- Any evidence?
- Circumstantial.

28:27.001 --> 28:29.837
- Can you get him in for questioning?
- Can't find him.

28:29.963 --> 28:33.173
OK. Leak this to some
of your media contacts.

28:33.299 --> 28:37.177
Let's beat this guy out of the bushes.
Nice work. Let's get moving.

28:37.303 --> 28:41.974
l need hard evidence on this Olson and fast.
And if you can find the guy, even better.

28:42.809 --> 28:46.186
The full force of the FBl?
That's the last thing l need.

28:46.312 --> 28:48.188
l've gotta make sure Lundy gets his man

28:48.314 --> 28:53.026
after l figure out a way to erase the marina
files and make up with my girlfriend.

28:53.153 --> 28:56.989
Then l'll tackle world hunger
because things can't get much worse.

28:58.616 --> 29:02.661
There's another shipment
coming in tomorrow. Cocaine.

29:02.787 --> 29:06.290
- How much?
- 300 bricks, give or take.

29:06.416 --> 29:09.752
- Turn it off.
- That wasn't part of our agreement, Harry.

29:10.295 --> 29:12.254
l said turn it off.

29:13.047 --> 29:16.133
l heard what you said.
l just don't take orders from you.

29:16.259 --> 29:19.052
ls there a reason you're
in my lab, Sergeant Doakes?

29:19.179 --> 29:23.140
ls there a reason you're listening to tapes
as old as you are, Morgan?

29:23.892 --> 29:28.020
l had a little talk with your sister.
She didn't know you were in program.

29:28.146 --> 29:32.107
- Anonymous. sergeant.
- How long you say you been clean?

29:32.233 --> 29:35.861
Actually. l didn't. because
it's none of your goddamn business.

29:35.987 --> 29:38.572
So if l took a hair from your desk
and ran it for drugs.

29:38.698 --> 29:41.575
it would come back positive, right?

29:41.701 --> 29:45.496
Because why would someone
pretend to be an addict if he's not. . .

29:45.622 --> 29:48.832
Unless he's got something
a hell of a lot worse to hide?

29:48.958 --> 29:50.709
Back. . .

29:50.835 --> 29:53.670
the fuck. . .off.

29:53.797 --> 29:56.548
You wanna hit me? Go for it.

29:57.509 --> 30:00.677
l been waiting for a chance
to take your ass out.

30:02.180 --> 30:04.223
l know how you feel, Sergeant.

30:19.155 --> 30:21.782
l wanna file a formal complaint
against Doakes.

30:21.908 --> 30:23.909
Jesus, Dexter, the two of you. . .

30:24.035 --> 30:26.995
He crossed the line, Lieutenant.
He broke into my lab.

30:27.121 --> 30:29.498
He went through my personal things.
He threatened me.

30:29.624 --> 30:33.126
- He'll probably start tailing me again.
- Doakes tailed you?

30:33.253 --> 30:35.921
For weeks, maybe longer.

30:37.799 --> 30:41.635
OK, you have every right to file a complaint
but. before you do that.

30:41.761 --> 30:46.265
- l'd like the chance to talk to James myself.
- He's really not much of a talker.

30:46.391 --> 30:50.102
l'm asking you, as a personal favor
to me, to hold off.

30:51.271 --> 30:53.772
Can you do that?

30:53.898 --> 30:55.774
Yeah.

30:56.109 --> 31:00.487
ln the meantime, l strongly encourage you
to take a break for a couple of hours.

31:00.613 --> 31:03.448
- Just go somewhere. Cool off.
- No.

31:04.117 --> 31:06.743
- Excuse me?
- l need to be here, Lieutenant.

31:06.870 --> 31:11.290
- This is not a good time for me to leave.
- lt isn't a suggestion. lt's an order.

31:11.416 --> 31:16.378
Clear the station. Clear your head.
l don't want to see you here until after lunch.

31:17.630 --> 31:19.506
Understood?

31:43.740 --> 31:45.657
Blimey, look at you.

31:54.334 --> 31:56.710
You want to tell me what's going on?

31:57.295 --> 32:00.422
What's going on? Being the new me sucks.

32:02.050 --> 32:05.969
l'm about to be found out at work
for what l am, for what l really am.

32:07.138 --> 32:11.224
And l can't stop it because l got kicked out
of the office to cool off.

32:11.351 --> 32:13.560
Well, it seems to be going well for you.

32:14.312 --> 32:18.065
Add to that that Rita heard your message
and dumped me last night.

32:18.191 --> 32:21.401
l explained that nothing happened
but she wouldn't listen.

32:21.527 --> 32:24.821
- Nobody fucking listens to me!
- You need to calm down. OK?

32:24.948 --> 32:27.532
Last time l saw you like this,
you came back covered in blood.

32:27.659 --> 32:31.411
so? You're the one who said
l'm supposed to feel my feelings.

32:31.537 --> 32:33.872
Now l'm telling you
to get them under control.

32:33.998 --> 32:37.125
- You don't understand.
- Why don't you make me?

33:34.517 --> 33:36.101
Which step was that?

33:41.482 --> 33:43.442
The naughty one.

33:49.449 --> 33:51.450
What are you thinking?

33:56.039 --> 33:58.123
Absolutely nothing.

34:01.419 --> 34:04.796
l guess we found a way to quiet
the voices in your head.

34:06.132 --> 34:08.133
l guess so.

34:13.139 --> 34:15.140
How do you feel?

34:16.476 --> 34:19.352
Much better, actually.

34:21.939 --> 34:24.983
l guess l must be a good sponsor after all.

34:27.653 --> 34:29.529
Definitely.

34:37.830 --> 34:39.956
And where are you off to?

34:40.083 --> 34:42.959
l still have that thing at work to deal with.

34:43.086 --> 34:48.423
Well, come back tomorrow.
l promise you some serious recovery.

34:58.601 --> 35:00.644
- Hello?
- Dexter, hey.

35:01.354 --> 35:04.648
- You at work?
- Er, l will be soon.

35:05.775 --> 35:07.776
l was just taking a break.

35:08.569 --> 35:12.030
- What's going on?
- l'd really like to get together and talk.

35:12.156 --> 35:14.825
l don't like how our last conversation ended.

35:14.951 --> 35:17.410
- Me neither.
- You said you wanted to explain,

35:17.537 --> 35:20.872
and l owe it to you to hear
you out, l owe it to us.

35:21.415 --> 35:24.668
Oh. Wow, OK.

35:26.129 --> 35:28.338
So, can you come over after work?

35:30.216 --> 35:32.592
- Sure.
- Great.

35:32.718 --> 35:34.177
Great.

35:34.303 --> 35:37.722
Apparently my new life
involves a love triangle.

35:37.849 --> 35:39.808
l'm that guy.

35:41.018 --> 35:43.311
The voices are back. ExceIIent.

35:51.195 --> 35:53.071
James.

35:53.990 --> 35:56.741
You were tailing Dexter?
What were you thinking?

35:56.868 --> 35:59.286
lf you wanted lunch, you could have asked.

35:59.412 --> 36:03.874
lf Dexter files a complaint, you will be
kicked off the force. end of story.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.127
There's a reason he hasn't
reported me until now.

36:07.253 --> 36:11.339
- He's hiding something. l can feel it.
- ls this one of your conspiracy theories?

36:11.465 --> 36:14.759
lt's instinct and a hell of a lot of experience.

36:14.886 --> 36:19.598
l've spent years looking the enemy in the
face. l'm telling you Morgan is dangerous.

36:19.724 --> 36:23.935
Your instincts haven't been
that great these days, James.

36:24.061 --> 36:27.814
Two shootings in the last six months,
stalking a police employee. . .

36:27.940 --> 36:29.941
Listen to me.

36:31.861 --> 36:36.156
He lied about the lce-Truck Killer.
That crack pipe knew more than he told us.

36:36.282 --> 36:39.075
He was trying to protect his sister.
You should understand that.

36:39.202 --> 36:43.246
l followed him to an NA meeting.
That asshole lied about that, too.

36:43.831 --> 36:45.415
- You're obsessed.
- l'm not.

36:45.541 --> 36:48.210
You are, and l need you to see it,

36:48.336 --> 36:50.295
as your boss and as your friend.

36:51.297 --> 36:55.217
We've been here before.
Last time it cost you our relationship.

36:55.343 --> 36:58.803
This time it's gonna get you
kicked off the force or worse.

36:59.388 --> 37:01.598
l'll take my chances.

37:05.603 --> 37:07.979
Let it go. l mean it.

37:08.606 --> 37:10.690
Leave Dexter alone.

37:19.533 --> 37:22.702
Did Batista's suspect come in yet?
The wannabe vigilante?

37:22.828 --> 37:25.664
Olson just came in.
Saw himself on the three o'clock news

37:25.790 --> 37:27.874
and showed up with his lawyer.

37:29.001 --> 37:31.169
l hope we nail his ass to the wall.

37:31.796 --> 37:33.964
l love it when you talk dirty.

37:37.510 --> 37:39.386
- Morgan.
- Right here.

37:39.512 --> 37:41.680
Oh, the other Morgan.

37:41.806 --> 37:44.474
l didn't know you were a smoker. Mm.

37:47.645 --> 37:49.646
Have you seen Dexter Morgan?

37:49.772 --> 37:51.731
Oh, he's on a break. Why?

37:51.857 --> 37:54.651
Batista's got a suspect
in interview room one.

37:54.777 --> 37:57.654
We think he's the vigilante
who attacked our train-car victim.

37:57.780 --> 37:59.572
l need Morgan to take scrapings.

37:59.699 --> 38:03.660
You want to use Dexter again?
lsn't Masuka on your task force?

38:05.705 --> 38:07.664
Yes, he is.

38:10.334 --> 38:14.170
Mr. Olson, the man who assaulted your mom
was attacked yesterday.

38:14.297 --> 38:17.340
- Did you know that?
- No. Can't say l'm upset, though.

38:17.466 --> 38:21.469
- Son of a bitch almost killed my mom.
- My client's emotional.

38:21.595 --> 38:24.264
- He's not trying to say. . .
- Any idea who did it?

38:24.390 --> 38:27.350
l don't know. Maybe it was the Butcher.

38:28.394 --> 38:31.813
lf you ask me. that guy should be
running the police force, not hiding from it.

38:31.939 --> 38:35.442
- ls this a lion or a hippo?
- l think it's a lion.

38:37.570 --> 38:39.446
Tastes like a hippo.

38:39.572 --> 38:42.407
- Animal Cracker?
- No. thank you.

38:43.701 --> 38:46.578
What do you do
for a living, Mr. Olson?

38:46.704 --> 38:49.372
- l just lost my job.
- That's too bad.

38:51.083 --> 38:55.795
l see that you have a minor assault record
and no alibi for yesterday morning.

38:55.921 --> 38:58.173
My client didn't realize he needed one.

38:58.299 --> 39:02.218
- Do you have a girlfriend, Mr. Olson?
- she just broke up with me.

39:02.345 --> 39:04.763
- Why, you interested?
- Just curious.

39:05.681 --> 39:07.932
Now, this is a lion.

39:08.893 --> 39:11.478
All right, let me keep this all straight.

39:12.063 --> 39:14.564
No job, no relationship.

39:15.274 --> 39:18.985
- You got guns and a minor assault record.
- And l voted for George Bush...

39:19.111 --> 39:21.529
Detective, were you getting at something?

39:21.655 --> 39:25.325
What he's getting at
is that your client fits the profile

39:25.451 --> 39:27.535
of someone who'd commit
a vigilante offence.

39:27.661 --> 39:29.662
l think you're a ticking time bomb.

39:29.789 --> 39:34.000
You ask me, you just needed a reason
to take the law into your own hands.

39:34.126 --> 39:36.086
The Butcher was the perfect excuse.

39:36.212 --> 39:38.838
- You don't know me.
- We know you attacked John Henry.

39:38.964 --> 39:43.134
You need proof to make those
kinds of accusations, Detective.

39:43.260 --> 39:46.304
You heard the man, Detective.
We've got work to do.

39:47.014 --> 39:50.809
Make yourself comfortable.
We're just getting started with you.

40:01.654 --> 40:03.655
That's my marina.

40:04.198 --> 40:07.158
And, in Iess than 30 minutes,
I'II be on that screen.

40:08.702 --> 40:10.870
I need to take care of this and fast.

40:12.373 --> 40:14.582
I'm out of time.

40:14.708 --> 40:17.502
l need an idea, a sign, anything.

40:18.254 --> 40:20.463
What wouId the oId Dexter do?

40:24.468 --> 40:26.469
Definitely not that.

40:28.472 --> 40:30.723
No security cameras.

40:36.939 --> 40:41.609
Apparently the new Dexter's stuck
in high school. Maybe l am a late bloomer.

40:46.866 --> 40:49.742
A fire drill? Are you kidding?
We have work to do.

40:49.869 --> 40:54.914
lt's probably one of those kids in the bullpen.
lt's something l would have done.

40:55.040 --> 40:57.167
Well, at least it stopped raining.

41:19.356 --> 41:21.316
All clear. Everybody out.

41:21.442 --> 41:23.735
All clear! Everybody out!

41:25.362 --> 41:29.532
Respect the vest.
Don't make me take out my hose.

41:38.626 --> 41:40.585
Like it never happened.

41:41.378 --> 41:44.464
lf only the rest of life
were so easy to figure out.

41:47.301 --> 41:50.053
Where you headed? l figured
you'd be checking out the firemen.

41:50.179 --> 41:54.057
Arranging protective custody
for that piece-of-shit train car victim.

41:54.183 --> 41:56.100
- Why?
- We have nothing on Olson.

41:56.227 --> 41:58.811
Not even enough to get a search warrant.

41:58.938 --> 42:00.897
ls that Olson's file?

42:02.233 --> 42:06.528
lf we don't get something soon,
Lundy has to let him go, Olson'll kill again,

42:06.654 --> 42:10.365
we lose the Bay Harbor Butcher case
to the FBl and we're all fucked.

42:10.491 --> 42:12.617
- Some more than others.
- No shit.

42:12.743 --> 42:17.372
Till Lundy showed up, l felt like the dipshit
who slept with the lce-Truck Killer.

42:17.498 --> 42:20.875
lf he pulls the plug, l go back
to being the resident retard.

42:21.001 --> 42:25.296
Chin up, little sister. These things
have a way of working themselves out.

42:37.977 --> 42:42.480
I have to find a piece of evidence to make
sure Lundy catches Olson fair and square.

43:17.224 --> 43:19.934
Looks like l have a fan club,
membership of one.

43:38.037 --> 43:40.163
Why are you interested
in the Bay Harbor Butcher?

43:40.289 --> 43:45.001
- Who the fuck are you?
- Holy shit, you're him, aren't you?

43:45.127 --> 43:48.212
Stop. Stop. Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

43:48.714 --> 43:51.424
l'm like you. l take out criminals.

43:51.550 --> 43:53.426
You mean you try. . .pitifully.

43:53.552 --> 43:56.012
No, that was just the last one.

43:56.138 --> 43:59.474
He got away. l should have
never made it personal.

43:59.600 --> 44:02.101
- You've killed others?
- That's what l'm saying.

44:02.227 --> 44:05.855
First was a drug dealer.
l ran him down with my car.

44:05.981 --> 44:08.900
lt felt, it felt fucking great,

44:09.735 --> 44:12.612
even better than the free stash
l got off him.

44:12.738 --> 44:16.824
And then this guy at work
found out l was fucking his wife.

44:16.950 --> 44:20.286
He started to beat on her.
so l pushed him down a stairwell.

44:20.412 --> 44:23.414
The cops thought it was
an accident, but it was me.

44:23.540 --> 44:26.459
See, you can't kill me.

44:26.585 --> 44:28.753
l wasn't going to. . .

44:31.590 --> 44:33.549
. . .until now.

44:45.229 --> 44:47.647
This is what the kill room should look like,

44:48.565 --> 44:50.817
the inside of a big plastic bag.

44:53.278 --> 44:55.697
l spent hours working
in this train car yesterday,

44:55.823 --> 44:58.700
so l'm not too worried
about trace evidence.

45:00.619 --> 45:03.329
To your credit, your location
was well chosen.

45:03.455 --> 45:08.668
lt just needed a little cleaning,
a few lights, proper tools, of course.

45:09.920 --> 45:12.004
- l did it because of you.
- No.

45:13.757 --> 45:17.301
- You attacked them because you wanted to.
- But you inspired me.

45:17.428 --> 45:19.178
- l didn't.
- With your principles.

45:19.304 --> 45:21.347
- They're not my principles.
- They are.

45:21.473 --> 45:23.474
Don't tell me who l am.

45:24.685 --> 45:28.688
All my life, l've done what someone else said l
should. been who he said l should be.

45:28.814 --> 45:31.107
l followed his rules, stuck to his plan.

45:31.233 --> 45:35.319
l never stopped to think about what l wanted
and what l needed.

45:35.446 --> 45:38.364
And now l don't know
who l'm supposed to be.

45:39.158 --> 45:42.744
l'll tell you one thing, though.
l'm not the Bay Harbor Butcher.

45:43.746 --> 45:45.538
l'm not anybody's role model.

45:45.664 --> 45:48.541
What are you talking about, then?
Who are you?

45:48.667 --> 45:52.795
l'll let you know when l figure that out.
Though. l gotta tell you.

45:52.921 --> 45:58.634
l am well on my way. because. as sure
as l'm standing here, l don't need to kill you.

45:58.761 --> 46:01.763
- That's a relief.
- That need from within

46:01.889 --> 46:04.307
that always drives me to this table,

46:04.850 --> 46:06.809
l don't feel it.

46:10.147 --> 46:13.608
- l'm in recovery.
- Well, l knew you weren't gonna kill me.

46:13.734 --> 46:17.779
No, l'm gonna kill you. l have to.
l just don't need to.

46:17.905 --> 46:20.072
lt's very empowering.

46:46.767 --> 46:49.268
Anyone in there, make yourself known!

47:01.448 --> 47:04.200
- Arm.
- Leg.

47:04.910 --> 47:06.786
Head.

47:07.996 --> 47:10.206
lt's Olson, gift-wrapped.

47:10.332 --> 47:14.752
lt would seem the Butcher is watching us,
tracking the investigation.

47:14.878 --> 47:18.923
That wouldn't be too hard.
But why leave the body for us? That's a first.

47:19.049 --> 47:22.802
Probably didn't take too kindly
to the idea of Olson imitating him.

47:22.928 --> 47:25.096
lt's a pretty way to discourage others.

47:25.222 --> 47:28.266
l hate to say it but he probably
did us a favor.

47:28.392 --> 47:32.103
Take the law into your own hands.
the Bay Harbor boogeyman'll get you.

47:32.229 --> 47:36.524
lt's the first time we've been where
the Bay Harbor Butcher's actually been.

47:36.650 --> 47:38.734
Let's get busy.

47:44.825 --> 47:47.493
- Anybody seen Lundy?
- Over there on the phone.

47:47.619 --> 47:49.412
He's talking to DC, l think.

47:49.538 --> 47:52.164
Oh, shit. ls he gonna pull the case from us?

47:57.671 --> 48:00.506
Sure, have Robinson call me.
He's got my cell.

48:02.009 --> 48:04.385
l came over here for some privacy, Morgan.

48:04.511 --> 48:07.388
- sorry...
- Too much background noise over there.

48:07.514 --> 48:10.766
Hearing's the first thing to go.
Or is it memory? l always forget.

48:10.893 --> 48:14.437
You gonna pull the case from us?
You said if anybody died...

48:14.563 --> 48:17.440
At the hands of a vigilante.
This was our killer.

48:18.317 --> 48:23.070
l'm afraid you're still stuck with me.
Will your brother be here tomorrow?

48:23.864 --> 48:25.740
Yeah, l think so.

48:26.783 --> 48:29.410
l'll tell him you want him
in shouting distance.

48:29.536 --> 48:33.539
- Hey, what just happened?
- lt's cool.

48:33.665 --> 48:36.083
- He's always been the family superstar.
- Who?

48:36.209 --> 48:38.252
Dexter, your new go-to guy.

48:39.087 --> 48:43.215
Oh, this isn't about Dexter.
lt's about Masuka. l can't stand him.

48:43.342 --> 48:46.427
lf l hear one more titty joke,
l'll punch him in the face.

48:46.553 --> 48:48.721
Really?

48:50.724 --> 48:55.394
Any north unit,
request for escort from Orange Belt to JMS.

49:04.154 --> 49:06.030
Hey.

49:07.074 --> 49:08.991
Come on in.

49:09.576 --> 49:11.494
Sit down.

49:16.625 --> 49:19.168
l was angry before
when you tried to explain.

49:19.294 --> 49:21.420
This time l'll listen.

49:24.591 --> 49:27.468
l'm sorry l didn't tell you
about the road trip.

49:28.887 --> 49:30.763
Lila. . .

49:32.474 --> 49:35.726
came with me to Naples as my sponsor.

49:35.852 --> 49:39.605
- That's all.
- Why would you need her in Naples?

49:39.731 --> 49:42.108
You remember when l went out of town?

49:42.234 --> 49:44.902
l went to find the man who killed my mother.

49:45.028 --> 49:47.279
What are you talking about?

49:47.781 --> 49:52.702
A lot of stuff has been coming up for me in
recovery, things l never thought l'd deal with.

49:54.663 --> 49:58.499
l watched my mother die when l was three.

49:58.625 --> 50:00.501
Oh, Dexter.

50:02.754 --> 50:06.966
- l'm so sorry.
- She was murdered in front of me.

50:07.968 --> 50:09.927
l saw it happen.

50:11.638 --> 50:14.223
l think that has a lot to do
with why l'm...

50:17.602 --> 50:19.979
Why l do the things l do.

50:21.189 --> 50:23.399
Of course. Of course, it makes sense.

50:23.525 --> 50:27.194
l found the man who killed her in Naples.

50:27.320 --> 50:32.491
l thought maybe if l talked to him,
l could find some kind of closure.

50:34.161 --> 50:36.495
That's why Lila came with me, for support.

50:39.708 --> 50:44.462
- What?
- This was a huge moment in your life

50:45.714 --> 50:49.008
and you chose to include Lila but not me.

50:50.135 --> 50:52.845
- She's my sponsor.
- And l'm your girlfriend.

50:53.472 --> 50:56.265
l was afraid you wouldn't understand.

51:01.730 --> 51:03.481
OK.

51:05.108 --> 51:09.862
OK. So, let me try to understand now.

51:11.656 --> 51:14.325
You and Lila went away together

51:14.451 --> 51:17.078
as sponsor and sponsee.

51:19.164 --> 51:21.874
And you really did have adjoining rooms.

51:22.375 --> 51:24.126
Yes.

51:24.795 --> 51:27.588
- So, you didn't have sex that night?
- No.

51:29.674 --> 51:31.550
OK.

51:34.513 --> 51:36.514
Not that night.

51:41.436 --> 51:43.604
Leave.

51:43.730 --> 51:45.523
Rita.

51:46.566 --> 51:49.151
No, please. Leave now.

52:06.336 --> 52:09.880
There was a time I wouId have
done anything to protect Rita.

52:10.006 --> 52:13.592
I wouId have even Iied.
But today l told the truth

52:15.303 --> 52:17.304
even though l knew she'd get hurt.

52:27.440 --> 52:30.109
Maybe l am leaving the old me behind.
