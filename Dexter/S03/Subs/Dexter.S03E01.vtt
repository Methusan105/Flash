WEBVTT

00:12.434 --> 00:13.475
Last season on Dexter...

00:13.601 --> 00:17.521
(Reporter) The butchered bodies were
submerged inside these garbage bags...

00:17.647 --> 00:20.149
(Debra) Did you hear that?
30 bags. Do you know what that means?

00:20.275 --> 00:21.984
There might be
a new mass murderer out there

00:22.110 --> 00:24.486
- way worse than the Ice Truck Killer.
- (Dexter) Uh-oh.

00:24.612 --> 00:27.364
Eight confirmed victims
of the Bay Harbor Butcher.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.908
That's what the press is calling
whoever dumped those bodies offshore.

00:30.035 --> 00:32.286
Last thing Miami needs
is another serial killer.

00:33.621 --> 00:36.331
- (Doakes) Any idea who the FBI is sending?
- Some guy named Lundy.

00:36.458 --> 00:39.084
We have positive IDs
on all 18 of our complete bodies.

00:39.210 --> 00:42.838
All 13 were either tried for murder
or at least suspected of murder.

00:42.964 --> 00:46.341
(Debra) Bay Harbor Butcher? Give me one
shot, I'd put a bullet in the fucker's head.

00:46.468 --> 00:47.551
You really feel that way?

00:47.677 --> 00:49.762
If Dad taught us one thing,
it's the value of human life.

00:49.888 --> 00:52.181
(Dexter) Yeah, but I think we had
different homework assignments.

00:55.018 --> 00:58.312
Tell me the truth.
Are you an addict?

00:58.438 --> 00:59.855
(Dexter) Yes, I have an addiction.

00:59.981 --> 01:01.774
- I'm Dexter.
- (All) Hi, Dexter.

01:02.358 --> 01:03.901
There's my sponsor.

01:04.027 --> 01:07.863
So tell me, exactly how full of shit are you?

01:07.989 --> 01:09.531
(Dexter) This woman sees me.

01:09.657 --> 01:12.701
Somehow she's able to make me feel OK
about what I am.

01:12.827 --> 01:16.413
You're going to tell me
all your deepest, darkest secrets.

01:16.539 --> 01:19.583
Laura Moser, my mother,
she was murdered.

01:19.709 --> 01:21.794
I've never told anyone that before.

01:21.920 --> 01:25.631
(Lila) Did you find out what happened to the
men responsible for your mother's murder?

01:25.757 --> 01:29.551
Santos Jimenez. Turned state's evidence,
went into witness protection.

01:29.677 --> 01:31.595
- Where are you?
- I've decided to look up

01:31.721 --> 01:33.055
someone from my past.

01:33.181 --> 01:34.932
1976!

01:35.058 --> 01:38.102
You slaughtered her
cause she stole cocaine.

01:38.228 --> 01:40.979
She was a snitch for a cop.
She was fucking him.

01:41.106 --> 01:45.192
(Dexter) It seems my foster father and
my biological mother were having an affair.

01:45.318 --> 01:48.570
Did he blame himself for her death?
Is that why he took me in?

01:48.696 --> 01:51.240
Or was he just using her?
Was he using me?

01:51.366 --> 01:54.284
But there ain't no paper trail
on the early years of Dexter Morgan.

01:54.410 --> 01:56.870
Your past is a bigger mystery
than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.

01:56.996 --> 01:59.623
Back...off.

01:59.749 --> 02:01.375
Ow! Fuck!

02:04.546 --> 02:07.089
If Dexter files a complaint,
you will be kicked off the force.

02:07.215 --> 02:09.299
(Doakes) He's hiding something, Maria.
I can feel it.

02:09.425 --> 02:10.968
I need some blood slides analyzed.

02:11.094 --> 02:13.428
I'm about to be found out
at work for what I really am.

02:13.555 --> 02:16.306
- You don't understand.
- Why don't you make me?

02:22.730 --> 02:25.941
- Who the fuck are you?
- Oh, pardon my tits.

02:26.067 --> 02:29.403
How could you do this to Rita,
not to mention her kids?

02:29.529 --> 02:31.780
(Rita) You and Lila
stayed in a hotel together.

02:31.906 --> 02:33.740
It's over, Dexter.

02:35.076 --> 02:38.370
I'm sure that you heard we have a suspect
in the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

02:38.496 --> 02:39.788
Sergeant James Doakes.

02:39.914 --> 02:41.290
He had the slides.

02:41.416 --> 02:43.792
Carefully hidden in the trunk of his car
at the airport.

02:43.918 --> 02:46.503
Jesus Christ, Morgan.
You're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

02:46.629 --> 02:48.922
You sure about that?
You might want to check with Lundy.

02:51.009 --> 02:52.426
(Screaming)

02:54.137 --> 02:57.347
What's it gonna be, Morgan?
Kill me now or set me free!

02:57.473 --> 02:59.766
Don't worry,
I'll send the FBI your way soon enough.

02:59.893 --> 03:01.268
So you're still gonna try to frame me?

03:01.394 --> 03:02.895
(Dexter) Mission accomplished.

03:03.021 --> 03:06.148
After tomorrow, I'll be out of reach.
Permanently.

03:06.274 --> 03:08.734
- You're going somewhere?
- Goodbye, Lila.

03:10.820 --> 03:15.240
(Female voice) Welcome. Previous
destinations. Starting route guidance.

03:15.366 --> 03:17.910
Hey! Who's out there?
Anybody out there?

03:18.036 --> 03:20.037
- Who put you in there?
- His name is Dexter Morgan.

03:20.163 --> 03:23.207
I found out that he's the Bay Harbor Butcher.
Please, just open this gate!

03:23.333 --> 03:26.501
- Poor thing, all alone.
- I'm OK.

03:26.628 --> 03:29.296
Not you. Dexter.

03:32.008 --> 03:36.178
What the fuck are you doing? Turn that off!
Do you understand this is murder?

03:43.394 --> 03:47.856
- What were you thinking? Are you insane?
- I was trying to bring us back together.

03:47.982 --> 03:50.317
(Dexter) The Lila experiment
is officially over.

03:50.443 --> 03:52.152
Could have had it all, Dexter.

03:57.242 --> 03:58.992
(Coughing)

04:04.374 --> 04:07.751
(Dexter) I've never put much weight
into the idea of a higher power,

04:07.877 --> 04:09.294
but if I didn't know better,

04:09.420 --> 04:13.715
I'd have to believe that some force out there
wants me to keep doing what I'm doing.

04:13.841 --> 04:17.219
You wanted to be close to me, Lila?
This is the most I have to offer.

04:17.345 --> 04:19.888
You taught me to accept what I am.

04:21.099 --> 04:22.349
Thank you.

04:23.559 --> 04:26.228
(Dexter) The code is mine now
and mine alone.

04:26.354 --> 04:29.439
So too are the relationships I cultivate.

04:29.565 --> 04:33.694
My father might not approve,
but I'm no longer his disciple.

04:33.820 --> 04:35.279
I'm a master now.

04:37.198 --> 04:39.908
An idea transcended into life.

06:34.649 --> 06:36.316
(Dexter) Ah, life.

06:36.442 --> 06:38.443
Life is a ritual.

06:38.569 --> 06:39.653
Routine.

06:39.779 --> 06:41.905
- Control.
- (High-pitched whirring)

06:43.157 --> 06:45.659
And an essential part of that routine...

06:47.662 --> 06:49.371
regular oral hygiene.

06:52.834 --> 06:56.294
There we go.
A few minutes, that'll numb right up.

06:57.505 --> 07:00.132
So how was your summer, Dexter ?

07:00.258 --> 07:02.008
I went to the carnival.

07:04.554 --> 07:07.514
I even won a prize.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.516
Hope you stayed away
from all the sweet stuff.

07:09.642 --> 07:13.728
Usually I'm good,
but sometimes I indulge.

07:16.441 --> 07:19.025
I also made it a point to meet new people.

07:21.112 --> 07:23.280
Can never have too many friends.

07:23.406 --> 07:25.907
Now, this temporary crown
is gonna go way in the back.

07:26.033 --> 07:28.076
So there may be some blood.

07:28.202 --> 07:30.579
- Not a problem.
- OK.

07:30.705 --> 07:33.582
- So you still have your boat?
- Oh, you bet.

07:33.708 --> 07:37.085
It's the only place
I can really let everything go.

07:37.211 --> 07:41.006
That's great. I'm gonna have you up
and out on that water in no time.

08:01.027 --> 08:04.529
For someone who needs to spend his life
pretending to be normal,

08:04.655 --> 08:07.908
I've been able to finally settle in...

08:08.034 --> 08:12.204
- (Moaning)
- ...to a nice, normal world.

08:33.893 --> 08:38.021
And Rita is the scaffolding
that holds that world in place.

08:38.147 --> 08:40.232
What are you thinking?

08:43.611 --> 08:45.654
Life is good.

08:45.780 --> 08:46.947
Hmm.

08:53.204 --> 08:58.250
Here you go, buddy. OK, Astor, you're up.
Mickey Mouse, unicorns or starfish?

08:58.376 --> 09:00.627
Just plain, round pancakes, Dexter.

09:02.255 --> 09:04.673
She's growing up.

09:04.799 --> 09:06.800
It starts with pancakes?

09:06.926 --> 09:08.635
It starts when it starts.

09:08.761 --> 09:10.011
Hey, Dexter?

09:10.137 --> 09:14.975
Um, can you come to Dad Day
at my school tomorrow?

09:19.522 --> 09:20.814
Just tell me what to do.

09:30.992 --> 09:32.284
(Car horn honks)

09:32.410 --> 09:34.035
There's Charlotte.

09:34.161 --> 09:36.830
- Bye, Mom. See you, Dexter.
- Bye, Mom.

09:36.956 --> 09:38.665
- (Rita) Bye.
- Get your bag.

09:48.551 --> 09:49.884
You hear that?

09:50.928 --> 09:53.013
Hear what?

09:54.056 --> 09:55.515
The calm.

09:56.517 --> 10:00.604
Everything's falling into place
for the first time in my life.

10:00.730 --> 10:03.023
I've got these terrific kids.

10:03.149 --> 10:06.109
There's no more drama haunting me.

10:06.235 --> 10:11.031
And I have this great,
generous, gentle guy.

10:16.829 --> 10:20.582
Most normal people
enjoy a sacred pact with society -

10:20.708 --> 10:23.793
live a good life
and society will take care of you.

10:23.919 --> 10:28.340
But if society drops the ball,
then someone else has to pick up the slack.

10:28.466 --> 10:30.842
That's where I come in.

10:30.968 --> 10:33.219
Fred Bowman, AKA Freebo.

10:33.346 --> 10:36.931
Kills two college girls
and skates on a state police screw-up,

10:37.058 --> 10:39.601
otherwise known as Florida's
catch and release program.

10:39.727 --> 10:44.939
He does the deed, gets away with murder
and falls off the radar.

10:45.066 --> 10:46.733
Everyone's radar but mine.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.821
You got a birthday coming up, Dad.

10:51.947 --> 10:54.783
What to get the man
who had everything?

10:55.826 --> 10:58.203
How about...Freebo?

11:03.626 --> 11:04.918
(Bell)

11:06.003 --> 11:09.297
- (Man) Morning, Dex.
- (Dexter) Dexter the doughnut guy.

11:09.423 --> 11:10.882
Part of my routine.

11:11.008 --> 11:15.261
But let the record show
I'm not the only one with a daily ritual.

11:15.388 --> 11:18.098
Angel Batista - bear claw.

11:19.058 --> 11:21.768
Vince Masuka - lemon custard.

11:23.938 --> 11:27.482
Mmm, better than sex. (Chuckles)

11:27.608 --> 11:30.276
Actually, no, it's not. (Chuckles)

11:30.403 --> 11:34.739
Hey, I need a favor. Do you think
you can proof an article I'm writing for FQ?

11:34.865 --> 11:36.783
- Forensics Quarterly.
- Right, yeah.

11:36.909 --> 11:40.161
- They reached out cause I was the LFI...
- Lead forensic investigator.

11:40.287 --> 11:41.830
- ...on the BHB.
- Bay Harbor Butcher.

11:41.956 --> 11:42.997
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:43.124 --> 11:46.751
- No biggie. I've been published before.
- (Debra) "DearPenthouse" doesn't count.

11:46.877 --> 11:51.172
- Hey, that letter was famous.
- Death by pastry. (Chuckles)

11:51.298 --> 11:53.675
You changed your hair.

11:53.801 --> 11:56.302
- Makes you look younger.
- I don't wanna look younger.

11:56.429 --> 12:00.014
Bad call, then. By the way,
nice work on the Rinaldi case.

12:00.141 --> 12:03.560
Yeah, well, murder-suicide.
Pretty straightforward.

12:03.686 --> 12:06.604
Well, still, I mean,
your report was spot-on, right?

12:11.902 --> 12:13.153
All right.

12:14.155 --> 12:17.157
Quinn's been in Homicide two weeks
and he noticed.

12:17.283 --> 12:19.617
- Noticed what?
- My hair.

12:20.494 --> 12:24.080
I changed my hairstyle
for the first time since I was eight.

12:24.206 --> 12:28.585
Oh, yeah. It's short...er. Shorter.

12:30.463 --> 12:33.882
- Quinn, he's showing off his detective skills.
- You think he thinks I'm a potential lay?

12:34.008 --> 12:38.094
That is not happening. As long as you're
not noticing things, you've also not noticed

12:38.220 --> 12:43.141
that I've given up men, liquor and smokes
for the last 27 days.

12:43.267 --> 12:46.186
This is you remembering
Dad's birthday though, right?

12:46.312 --> 12:47.771
Dad. Birthday. Right.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.273
Blue room, 7:30, like always.

12:52.902 --> 12:56.654
- I tried calling you last night.
- I, uh, wasn't home.

12:56.781 --> 13:03.328
I also tried your cellphone. You're wearing
the same pants you had on yesterday.

13:03.454 --> 13:04.954
That shirt's the backup
you keep in your locker.

13:05.080 --> 13:08.625
Ayúdeme aquí. I thought part
of your restructuring our department

13:08.751 --> 13:11.252
was you staying out of our personal lives.

13:11.378 --> 13:13.588
Anything you want me to know?

13:13.714 --> 13:18.426
Know this. I went out and had a great time
last night, and you should be happy for me.

13:18.552 --> 13:21.137
Besides, since when do you care?

13:23.557 --> 13:25.683
Since this. Follow me.

13:31.524 --> 13:33.358
OK, guys, listen up.

13:34.318 --> 13:37.821
I just got word from upstairs that

13:37.947 --> 13:41.783
Angel will no longer be
Detective Batista.

13:41.909 --> 13:43.535
What?

13:43.661 --> 13:48.957
In two days,
he will be Detective Sergeant Batista.

13:49.083 --> 13:51.042
(Applause, cheering)

13:51.168 --> 13:56.589
Sorry for all the red tape and the hoops.
Nobody deserves it more than you, Angel.

13:56.715 --> 13:59.926
When this is really official...

14:01.178 --> 14:06.432
when I can trade this in for that gold badge...
drinks are on me.

14:06.559 --> 14:09.018
(Cheering, applause)

14:12.940 --> 14:14.315
(Groans)

14:14.441 --> 14:16.526
Angel gets his wings.
Know what this means?

14:16.652 --> 14:18.820
(Sighs) Pay raise?

14:18.946 --> 14:21.531
No, dildo, it means he's my supervisor

14:21.657 --> 14:25.118
which means I'm a lock
for my detective shield.

14:26.328 --> 14:28.246
- Where are you going?
- Research.

14:28.372 --> 14:33.376
Dex. Typos, grammar,
something could be clearer, whatever.

14:34.461 --> 14:35.962
Haircut?

14:38.465 --> 14:39.799
Yep.

14:44.680 --> 14:48.182
Time to get the lay of the land
on Freebo and his...

14:48.309 --> 14:50.143
pink house.

14:57.192 --> 14:58.818
(Car lock beeps)

15:05.200 --> 15:06.284
(Whistles)

15:07.828 --> 15:09.662
What you need?

15:11.457 --> 15:13.666
Freebo. I need Freebo.

15:15.336 --> 15:18.880
- And you know him how?
- He sells the best shit anywhere.

15:19.006 --> 15:22.717
(Chuckles) Come on, man, what,
you Google him or something?

15:22.843 --> 15:24.260
Know what? Fuck it.

15:24.386 --> 15:26.638
- There's other dope spots.
- Hey, come here!

15:26.764 --> 15:28.848
Don't walk away all "fuck you" on me.

15:37.524 --> 15:39.150
(Buzzer)

15:39.276 --> 15:41.277
- (Man) What?
- Ding, ding.

15:42.029 --> 15:43.404
(Door buzzes)

15:46.742 --> 15:49.035
(♪ Rock)

15:58.504 --> 16:00.672
I'm looking to hold some product.

16:02.758 --> 16:08.221
Ordinarily, I don't accept new clientele,
but I've had a desultory third quarter.

16:08.347 --> 16:09.889
- Mmm!
- (Game beeps)

16:10.015 --> 16:11.557
Oh, come on!

16:12.977 --> 16:16.270
Need a little more hook
before breaking to the pocket.

16:16.397 --> 16:17.814
(Scoffs)

16:19.400 --> 16:23.194
You know, I bought this TV for six grand
but I'll let you have it for three.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.989
More interested in scoring some tar.

16:26.115 --> 16:28.950
Oh, another yuppie turns to the dark side.

16:30.995 --> 16:34.455
- I need a hit.
- Jeez, Teegan, I'm transacting here.

16:34.581 --> 16:37.375
- One toot.
- Did you hear what I said?

16:37.501 --> 16:39.460
Fuck off, Teegan.

16:39.586 --> 16:43.506
Fine, I guess your dick
can suck itself from now on.

16:44.967 --> 16:46.217
(Sighs)

16:47.678 --> 16:51.305
Stupid cunt's gonna
redefine "short-term relationship".

16:51.432 --> 16:55.309
- Catch my drift?
- (Snorts) Yeah, I catch your drift.

16:55.436 --> 16:58.312
(Dexter) And I'm entirely confident
you've earned the privilege

16:58.439 --> 17:00.898
of being repurposed as fish food.

17:07.573 --> 17:10.450
Narcotics raided this place
at noon today.

17:13.787 --> 17:17.290
The drug rats won't return
to their nest for a while.

17:27.134 --> 17:31.512
Plenty of time
to do what I have to do.

17:37.519 --> 17:39.479
(Woman) Raw. You like it raw.

17:40.647 --> 17:45.234
- Excuse me?
- The sugar. You like the raw stuff.

17:45.360 --> 17:48.863
It's my job to notice things.
Morgan, right?

17:48.989 --> 17:52.116
- Do I know you?
- New haircut. It's cute.

17:52.242 --> 17:57.789
- All right, who the fuck are you?
- (Chuckles) Yuki Amado, Internal Affairs.

17:57.915 --> 17:59.707
And?

17:59.833 --> 18:04.337
- You know a Joey Quinn?
- Why?

18:04.463 --> 18:09.342
Well, he started drawing our attention
back when he was in Narcotics.

18:09.468 --> 18:11.219
He's in your orbit now.

18:11.345 --> 18:13.346
I don't know the guy
except to hand in my paperwork.

18:13.472 --> 18:16.808
Be really cool if you could
get next to him, you know?

18:16.934 --> 18:19.727
- Do a little recon.
- Are you high?

18:19.853 --> 18:21.687
No, never been.

18:21.814 --> 18:23.189
Well...

18:24.483 --> 18:26.150
Yuki, that's not gonna happen.

18:26.276 --> 18:30.029
Cooperation with IA
has its upside in the department.

18:30.155 --> 18:32.073
- Yeah, maybe for rodents.
- OK.

18:33.033 --> 18:37.787
Well, it was nice to finally meet you.
In person, you know.

18:37.913 --> 18:39.539
Bye.

18:39.665 --> 18:42.792
And what is it
you think Quinn did exactly?

18:42.918 --> 18:47.922
Mm! Mm-mm. You don't get
to blow me off and still ask questions.

18:53.053 --> 18:55.179
(♪ Hip-hop)

18:57.432 --> 19:00.268
Loud music.
Cover of darkness.

19:03.355 --> 19:04.814
Perfect.

19:15.159 --> 19:16.617
(Music continues)

19:39.474 --> 19:41.934
- (Man) Get off! No!
- (Smashing)

19:42.811 --> 19:44.437
(Grunting, groaning)

19:47.399 --> 19:49.358
Freebo, get back here!

20:02.873 --> 20:04.123
(Groaning)

20:06.460 --> 20:09.295
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

20:13.467 --> 20:15.343
Shit! Oh!

20:17.012 --> 20:19.722
- (Knocking)
- (Boy) Yo, Freebo, man.

20:30.150 --> 20:32.109
What the fuck happened back there?

20:32.236 --> 20:36.948
I went to kill Freebo
and ended up killing a total stranger.

20:37.074 --> 20:39.784
I've never killed anyone
I didn't completely vet before,

20:39.910 --> 20:42.703
whose guilt I wasn't absolutely certain of.

20:42.829 --> 20:47.458
I did something wholly inside the moment
and wholly outside the code.

20:50.295 --> 20:53.005
Something spontaneous.

20:54.716 --> 20:56.217
Who did I just kill?

20:57.761 --> 20:59.553
Freebo's doorman.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.515
I...am...fucked.

21:04.977 --> 21:07.812
Just a matter of time
before someone calls it in.

21:07.938 --> 21:09.438
(Cellphone rings)

21:12.150 --> 21:14.652
- Hey, you.
- (Rita) Dexter, hey.

21:14.778 --> 21:19.907
I know it's not one of our regular nights
but...can you come over?

21:20.033 --> 21:22.451
Uh, sure. Everything OK?

21:22.577 --> 21:27.623
Yeah. Just...
Just missing you, that's all.

21:27.749 --> 21:29.208
(Moaning)

21:31.545 --> 21:33.754
God, you're on fire lately.

21:35.340 --> 21:37.383
Are you complaining?

21:38.719 --> 21:40.803
I'm complying.

21:50.063 --> 21:51.689
Where are you?

21:52.566 --> 21:54.275
I'm right here.

21:56.778 --> 21:58.612
In a safe place.

22:01.575 --> 22:03.409
(Both moan)

22:05.620 --> 22:09.290
God created pudding
and then He rested.

22:12.627 --> 22:14.337
Pudding of chocolate.

22:14.463 --> 22:16.213
Manna from heaven.

22:16.340 --> 22:18.257
(Chuckles)

22:19.259 --> 22:22.720
What are the kids gonna do
for dessert tomorrow

22:24.097 --> 22:25.389
Tangerines.

22:25.515 --> 22:27.475
(Chuckles)

22:27.601 --> 22:29.101
(Cellphone rings)

22:37.444 --> 22:38.986
Dexter Morgan.

22:40.572 --> 22:43.699
Yes, I'm happy
with my long-distance provider.

22:45.118 --> 22:50.331
What the hell ever happened
to "do not call"? It's three in the morning.

22:50.457 --> 22:52.375
Not in India.

22:56.088 --> 22:58.714
I have an insanely busy morning
tomorrow,

22:58.840 --> 23:02.093
so I'll be gone
before you and the kids wake up.

23:03.512 --> 23:07.348
Dexter, you've been working
such killer hours lately.

23:07.474 --> 23:09.600
Just hold me till you have to go.

23:26.618 --> 23:28.994
Just a matter of time.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.377
(Cellphone rings)

23:37.462 --> 23:38.587
Morning, Sergeant.

23:38.713 --> 23:41.507
(Batista) How long for you to get
to 118 Calendar?

23:41.633 --> 23:44.593
Um, 20, 30 minutes.

23:46.179 --> 23:48.264
(Police radio chatter)

23:56.440 --> 23:58.858
- I got it, Dex.
- Got what?

23:58.984 --> 24:01.360
Only the case that's
gonna get me my shield. It's huge.

24:01.486 --> 24:03.779
Angel put me on it. Officially on it.

24:03.905 --> 24:05.739
Huge?

24:12.664 --> 24:16.834
- (Dexter) Who the hell are you?
- Bet you're wondering who the hell he is.

24:18.086 --> 24:21.255
Who he is is what makes this case huge.
That's Miguel Prado.

24:21.381 --> 24:25.468
He's that ADA who's been on a mission
to put away as many bad guys as he can.

24:25.594 --> 24:29.096
You know?
"A safe Miami is the only Miami."

24:29.222 --> 24:31.682
A safe Miami
and we're all unemployed.

24:33.935 --> 24:35.978
Why's he look so familiar?

24:36.104 --> 24:38.439
He just made
the cover of Florida magazine.

24:38.565 --> 24:41.567
Top prosecutor in the state
three years in a row.

24:41.693 --> 24:44.778
He and LaGuerta go way back.
You know, that whole cubano thing.

24:44.905 --> 24:48.657
The other guy is Ramon Prado,
Miguel's middle brother.

24:48.783 --> 24:50.951
He's a lieutenant
with the sheriff's department.

24:51.077 --> 24:54.538
(Debra) Made himself quite the reputation
for being a law-and-order hard-ass.

24:54.664 --> 24:56.081
And...

24:56.917 --> 24:58.459
Oscar.

24:58.585 --> 25:01.921
- Prado?
- As in "baby brother".

25:03.006 --> 25:05.633
(Dexter) So much for spontaneity.

25:05.759 --> 25:07.927
What was he doing in a dump like this?

25:08.053 --> 25:10.596
They're saying he was
a coach at a youth club.

25:10.722 --> 25:14.642
Came here to confront the scumbag
about selling shit to his kids.

25:14.768 --> 25:19.480
- Talk about wrong place at the wrong time.
- Tell me about it.

25:26.154 --> 25:28.572
- Find anything?
- Yeah.

25:30.534 --> 25:32.409
Dead guy with a hole in his chest.

25:43.588 --> 25:46.507
This window's cracked
and there's blood on the wall.

25:46.633 --> 25:49.051
- Who shut these drapes?
- Probably the first on scene.

25:49.177 --> 25:52.012
Some dipshit rookie
who's still outside puking.

26:09.489 --> 26:10.656
So what do we got?

26:10.782 --> 26:16.537
Signs of a majorly big struggle here, there,
everywhere. Single stab wound to the chest.

26:16.663 --> 26:20.040
- You read my article yet?
- Started it. So far it's really good.

26:20.166 --> 26:21.709
Awesome.

26:28.842 --> 26:30.634
(Sobs) God.

26:34.764 --> 26:37.266
Cómo te dejaron a Oscarcito.

26:38.435 --> 26:40.227
Te fallé.

26:40.353 --> 26:43.981
Whoever did this...
he's already wishing he was dead.

26:51.740 --> 26:55.200
Someone really stepped on his dick
with this one.

27:06.796 --> 27:12.092
(Dexter) There were so many lessons
in the vaunted code of Harry.

27:12.218 --> 27:17.389
Twisted commandments handed down
from the only God I ever worshipped.

27:17.515 --> 27:19.892
One through ten...

27:20.018 --> 27:21.769
Don't get caught.

27:23.730 --> 27:25.689
That I got covered.

27:26.983 --> 27:30.694
But killing someone
without knowing if he's guilty...

27:32.238 --> 27:34.907
I'd love some help on this one...

27:35.033 --> 27:37.451
but my God is dead now.

27:39.788 --> 27:41.163
(Dog barking)

27:45.251 --> 27:47.878
Man's best friend, eh, Dex?

27:49.005 --> 27:51.131
Not today.

27:51.257 --> 27:54.760
Hey, my sister said that LaGuerta
knows this Miguel Prado pretty well.

27:54.886 --> 27:57.971
Way back when, when Mig...

27:58.098 --> 28:02.267
Hey, what's up? Way back when,
when Miguel was in law school

28:02.394 --> 28:06.313
and Maria was just starting
in law enforcement, they hooked up.

28:06.439 --> 28:08.023
Hooked up?

28:08.149 --> 28:13.195
Between us, for Maria, Miguel Prado
will always be the one that got away.

28:13.321 --> 28:14.988
(Clicks tongue)

28:20.078 --> 28:25.874
(Batista) Prelim has the victim,
Oscar Prado, 26, dead.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.460
Dead from a single stab wound
to the chest.

28:28.586 --> 28:32.589
The deceased's brother, ADA Miguel Prado,
informed me at the scene

28:32.716 --> 28:37.177
that Oscar went to confront
one Fred Bowman, street name Freebo,

28:37.303 --> 28:40.514
for selling drugs to some youth-club kids.
Morgan?

28:40.640 --> 28:45.185
Freebo's the guy that killed two co-eds
in the Everglades and got away with it.

28:45.311 --> 28:48.355
So the way it looks,
Oscar Prado died a hero.

28:48.481 --> 28:52.901
Also, our team found a shitload of, uh...
a substantial amount of drugs in the house.

28:53.027 --> 28:54.445
Any leads on his whereabouts?

28:54.571 --> 28:58.532
That part of the neighborhood isn't
exactly police-friendly but I'm staying on it.

28:58.658 --> 29:03.328
- Talk to me about forensics.
- Evidence indicates this was no hit-and-run.

29:03.455 --> 29:08.917
It was a furious close-in battle. Whoever...
Or is it "whomever"?

29:09.043 --> 29:12.045
- "Whoever" is good.
- Whoever did this got in a lucky shot

29:12.172 --> 29:14.506
or was really good at handling a blade.

29:14.632 --> 29:19.720
According to the ME, the aorta
was cleanly severed in one penetration.

29:19.846 --> 29:22.055
- Not easy to do.
- Any luck finding the weapon?

29:22.182 --> 29:23.974
It's not on or near the premises.

29:24.100 --> 29:27.394
We've checked roofs, sewers, trash bins
in a five-block radius.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.773
Our conclusion -
the assailant took it with him.

29:30.899 --> 29:32.816
Dexter, what's the blood saying?

29:32.942 --> 29:37.112
Pretty much what everyone else is. I have
some second level on-scene work to do.

29:37.238 --> 29:40.157
- I'll get back to you ASAP.
- Get it to Sergeant Batista.

29:40.283 --> 29:42.326
Full disclosure.

29:42.452 --> 29:46.705
I've had a personal relationship
with the Prado family for many years.

29:46.831 --> 29:50.459
And it goes a lot further
than the whole cubano thing.

29:51.544 --> 29:53.462
Sergeant?

29:53.588 --> 29:57.049
Stating the obvious, Lieutenant,
I like Freebo for this.

29:57.175 --> 29:59.343
(Dexter) Me too.

29:59.469 --> 30:02.471
(LaGuerta) Morgan?
(Debra) Yes, ma'am?

30:02.597 --> 30:05.933
Hit the streets harder.
Learn what you can learn.

30:06.059 --> 30:11.438
Uh, all due respect, Lieutenant,
if Freebo did this, he's not in Miami.

30:11.564 --> 30:12.773
I mean, he's in the wind.

30:12.899 --> 30:15.275
We can sit around
on our asses and speculate

30:15.401 --> 30:18.362
on where we think
the prime suspect may or may not be,

30:18.488 --> 30:21.240
- or we can actually go and look for him.
- Hmm.

30:23.743 --> 30:29.414
As a Miami prosecutor,
I have dedicated my career to fighting crime,

30:29.541 --> 30:32.251
to making our streets safe for everyone.

30:33.837 --> 30:37.422
Every family -
white, black, Latino, Asian -

30:37.549 --> 30:43.971
deserves the full measure
of our devotion to their dignity.

30:44.097 --> 30:50.894
And now that crime has touched my family
in the most profound way imaginable,

30:51.020 --> 30:53.188
I grieve equally for every family

30:53.314 --> 30:57.526
that has been visited
with the same unimaginable news

30:57.652 --> 30:59.194
that we have received today.

30:59.320 --> 31:02.823
Our beautifuI city is a city of families.

31:02.949 --> 31:09.329
And the untimely taking of any of us
touches all of us.

31:10.540 --> 31:14.501
My parents brought
my brother Ramon and me...

31:14.627 --> 31:18.338
(Dexter) Part of my ritual has
always been getting to know my victims,

31:18.464 --> 31:21.174
confirming their guilt beyond all doubt.

31:22.677 --> 31:25.846
Oscar Prado tried to kill Freebo,
then he tried to kill me.

31:25.972 --> 31:29.141
No way he was there on some
noble youth-club mission.

31:29.267 --> 31:33.186
He's got to be guilty of something.
Aren't we all?

31:33.313 --> 31:35.564
So I ask again...

31:36.774 --> 31:38.150
Who are you?

31:46.284 --> 31:49.828
Two speeding tickets
and an illegal U-turn.

31:52.999 --> 31:56.710
Talk about outside the code of Harry.
(Sighs)

31:56.836 --> 31:58.712
Harry finds me in a pool of blood,

31:58.838 --> 32:01.381
turns me into his own
personal vendetta machine,

32:01.507 --> 32:07.304
and when he sees the monster
he created in action, he kills himself.

32:07.430 --> 32:10.015
Deb can drink to his honor
on her own.

32:10.141 --> 32:13.060
Any luck
in the land of reluctant witnesses?

32:13.186 --> 32:15.395
One house I play good cop,
the next I play bad cop.

32:15.521 --> 32:17.981
I still can't get shit
from anybody in that neighborhood.

32:18.107 --> 32:22.778
- You know what the problem is, right?
- Wait, Quinn, let me guess. The "cop" part?

32:22.904 --> 32:26.239
No, they don't owe you anything.
There's no incentive.

32:26.366 --> 32:30.786
Which skews the balance of power
way in their direction, right?

32:30.912 --> 32:33.080
Here, let me do you a favor.

32:33.206 --> 32:36.917
Call this guy. Tell him you know me.

32:37.043 --> 32:39.753
Tell him you want to cash in
one of my coupons.

32:39.879 --> 32:44.007
- Coupons?
- Yeah. He's a CI from my days in Narcotics.

32:44.133 --> 32:48.178
He's got a hook in him
that's not coming out anytime soon.

32:48.304 --> 32:52.683
- What do you want in return?
- For you to remember that I did you a solid.

32:54.310 --> 32:57.479
- What, not even a "thank you"?
- Thank you.

32:57.605 --> 33:00.607
- Stop looking at my ass.
- (Laughs)

33:00.733 --> 33:03.110
- (Gulls)
- (Overlapping chatter)

33:03.236 --> 33:05.278
(Guitar strumming)

33:05.405 --> 33:07.239
Yeah, of course...

33:15.665 --> 33:17.040
(Man) Detective.

33:17.875 --> 33:19.501
Officer. You're Anton?

33:20.420 --> 33:24.047
In the flesh.
You got something you want to show me?

33:28.052 --> 33:29.970
Oh, yeah, I've seen him before.

33:30.096 --> 33:32.848
- Really? Where?
- In the news.

33:32.974 --> 33:35.892
Isn't that that guy you let walk
on those co-ed killings?

33:36.019 --> 33:39.187
Now that there
was a fine piece of police work.

33:40.857 --> 33:43.400
- You know him from the newspaper?
- I saw him on CNN.

33:43.526 --> 33:46.778
- OK. That's all you got?
- That's all you got.

33:49.198 --> 33:52.576
If this is you and Quinn fucking with me,
I'm really not in the mood.

33:52.702 --> 33:54.286
If you need something for that temper,

33:54.412 --> 33:57.706
I got a man down the street with some real
mellow weed can take that edge right off.

33:57.832 --> 34:02.544
- I don't take advice from drug dealers, so...
- Drug dealer? Oh, never that!

34:03.921 --> 34:06.089
A drug user.
Occasionally.

34:06.215 --> 34:11.428
- Strictly weed though, Officer. Strictly weed.
- Then how'd you become Quinn's snitch?

34:11.554 --> 34:15.307
I got caught up in a drug bust. Quinn told me
that if I blew the whistle on the bigger fish,

34:15.433 --> 34:19.019
I'd stay out of jail. So I listened.
Attentively.

34:19.145 --> 34:24.191
Yeah, well...you know,
it never hurts an occasional drug user

34:24.317 --> 34:28.361
- to have more than one friend on the force.
- That's the thing, Officer...

34:28.488 --> 34:31.948
- I got enough friends.
- All right, well, I'm outta here.

34:32.075 --> 34:35.911
Yeah, well, you have a good one, you hear?
(Strums guitar)

34:41.959 --> 34:44.336
What about this Prado guy?

34:46.172 --> 34:49.007
And to determine the impact site,

34:49.133 --> 34:52.177
the exact point
where force encounters a body,

34:52.303 --> 34:55.430
you have to distinguish
the geometric differences

34:55.556 --> 34:57.641
between back-spatter,

34:57.767 --> 34:59.267
satellite spatter,

34:59.393 --> 35:02.395
- misting and arterial spurting.
- Gross!

35:02.522 --> 35:03.772
Shut up.

35:03.898 --> 35:07.150
You remember how before
when Katie's dad

35:07.276 --> 35:09.611
- was talking about being a surgeon?
- Yeah.

35:09.737 --> 35:14.741
And sometimes how he has to
cut into bodies and there's blood?

35:14.867 --> 35:16.660
But he saves lives.

35:16.786 --> 35:18.537
Do you save lives?

35:22.250 --> 35:24.668
OK, you know how there's good guys
and there's bad guys?

35:24.794 --> 35:26.378
So you catch bad guys?

35:26.504 --> 35:29.297
Well, not directly, but I help.

35:29.423 --> 35:30.966
Do you have a uniform?

35:32.093 --> 35:33.593
Lab coat.

35:33.719 --> 35:35.011
A gun?

35:35.138 --> 35:36.429
No.

35:36.556 --> 35:41.143
- He's got a badge.
- (Sighs) It's a laminate.

35:41.269 --> 35:45.772
Well, thank you so much for taking time
from your busy schedule, Mr. Morgan,

35:45.898 --> 35:50.610
- to come and talk to the children.
- It was a real learning experience.

35:55.241 --> 35:58.451
(Puffs) Looks like
I really got through to 'em, huh?

35:58.578 --> 36:02.164
It would have sucked even worse
if I didn't have a dad today.

36:04.292 --> 36:06.585
Thanks for inviting me, buddy.

36:14.468 --> 36:18.763
(Dexter) If anyone should have father
issues - anger, rejection, abandonment -

36:18.890 --> 36:20.265
it's Cody.

36:20.391 --> 36:23.435
And what's he do?
He moves on.

36:26.731 --> 36:28.398
How does that happen?

36:35.072 --> 36:38.116
- I was so bad you're crying?
- No, no.

36:38.910 --> 36:42.078
No, it's just...
just something I've always wanted.

36:42.205 --> 36:44.456
You being here for the kids,

36:44.582 --> 36:48.043
it's all so wonderfully uncomplicated.

36:48.169 --> 36:50.962
- (Rita chuckles)
- (Cellphone rings)

36:55.885 --> 36:57.052
Hello?

36:57.178 --> 37:00.430
Mr. Morgan, this is Miguel Prado.
I need to see you.

37:00.556 --> 37:02.557
Right away.

37:08.397 --> 37:11.149
(Dexter) So much for uncomplicated.

37:29.585 --> 37:32.837
It almost feels like a piece of art.

37:33.965 --> 37:38.009
Thank you, sir.
But to me it's more like a story.

37:40.346 --> 37:42.639
Tell me that story, Mr. Morgan.

37:47.728 --> 37:50.605
- The encounter started over here.
- Mmm.

37:50.731 --> 37:55.068
The scuff marks on the linoleum,
the crumpling of the throw rug,

37:55.194 --> 37:58.238
they all have a directional quality
that leads to...

37:58.364 --> 38:02.450
Now this is where your brother and Freebo...

38:03.286 --> 38:06.329
He's my lieutenant's prime suspect...

38:07.623 --> 38:09.708
But you know that.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.253
There was a brutal struggle.

38:13.379 --> 38:18.883
I gotta say, it looks like
your brother fought like a hero...

38:20.761 --> 38:26.141
but he was overmatched and sustained
a fatal stab wound to his chest.

38:29.061 --> 38:33.690
Everything about the blood suggests
that your brother bled out almost instantly.

38:33.816 --> 38:37.402
- He didn't suffer?
- Blood never lies.

38:40.156 --> 38:42.365
So now I know how he died.

38:44.452 --> 38:45.994
The question is why.

38:47.204 --> 38:49.205
One more thing, Mr. Morgan.

38:50.541 --> 38:54.210
Why would a blood spatter analyst

38:54.337 --> 38:57.464
spend time searching
the sheriff department's database

38:57.590 --> 39:00.050
for information on my dead brother?

39:01.719 --> 39:03.094
Um...

39:07.600 --> 39:10.769
Like you, sir, I wanted to understand
what happened here.

39:10.895 --> 39:15.774
I thought that knowing some details
about your brother's life

39:15.900 --> 39:18.485
would help me make sense
out of his death.

39:18.611 --> 39:24.407
In your line of work, Mr. Morgan,
is it usual for you to get so involved?

39:28.788 --> 39:31.414
I just sounded like a prosecutor there.

39:31.540 --> 39:33.166
I'm sorry.

39:33.292 --> 39:37.087
It's not a problem, sir, and no,
it's not usual for me to get so involved,

39:37.213 --> 39:41.132
but this one, this death, got to me.

39:44.845 --> 39:48.807
It's just...
It seems so unreal that, uh...

39:51.310 --> 39:52.602
he's gone.

39:53.687 --> 39:55.146
Yeah, I know.

39:57.483 --> 40:04.197
So a man dies, Mr. Morgan, and what's left,
his soul? And what is that exactly?

40:05.574 --> 40:07.033
I really couldn't tell you.

40:07.159 --> 40:10.412
Cause some people say
the soul just lives on forever.

40:12.665 --> 40:16.000
- I hope not.
- Which makes you a cynic.

40:17.378 --> 40:20.046
It makes me a scientist.

40:22.383 --> 40:26.428
So no one you've ever loved has died?

40:28.931 --> 40:32.016
My father died when I was in my 20s.

40:34.228 --> 40:36.813
And you don't believe that...

40:36.939 --> 40:41.067
that his soul,
call it his life force, is still here?

40:41.193 --> 40:43.403
Somehow it's living inside you?

40:47.450 --> 40:49.117
Because I...

40:51.620 --> 40:55.582
- I should have been there for him.
- You can't blame yourself, sir.

40:55.708 --> 40:58.543
That's easier said than done,
Mr. Morgan.

41:04.967 --> 41:09.512
Do me a favor. You really want
to get to know my brother like you say,

41:09.638 --> 41:13.349
come to his wake tonight.
Come see how much and how...

41:13.476 --> 41:16.644
how fully he was loved.

41:16.770 --> 41:18.480
OK.

41:19.732 --> 41:22.859
I've taken up enough of your day.
Thank you.

41:24.403 --> 41:26.070
Dexter.

41:35.498 --> 41:37.540
These reports final?

41:37.666 --> 41:41.294
Blood specimens I collected all came back
belonging to Oscar Prado.

41:41.420 --> 41:44.422
Trace prints on and around the victim
all point to Freebo.

41:44.548 --> 41:45.965
Anyone out there talking?

41:46.091 --> 41:49.761
Officer Morgan was hitting up
the usual firewall of clammed-up witnesses

41:49.887 --> 41:53.348
and non-witnesses,
so I put her in touch with an old CI of mine.

41:53.474 --> 41:55.350
- Hopefully...
- Hey, Quinn.

41:55.476 --> 41:58.061
That CI you put me on
was totally useless for Freebo.

41:58.187 --> 42:00.897
- Sadly, it's not a perfect world.
- Yeah.

42:01.023 --> 42:03.107
For all we know,
Freebo's in Nebraska by now.

42:03.234 --> 42:07.153
- I guess you don't owe me that favor, then.
- How come he gets favors?

42:07.279 --> 42:10.740
Oh, he doesn't.
But what the CI told me about the victim...

42:10.866 --> 42:14.118
he wasn't some hero coach who went
into the hood and took one for the team.

42:14.245 --> 42:15.286
What do you mean?

42:15.412 --> 42:19.332
Oscar Prado was into Freebo
for some serious cash.

42:19.458 --> 42:22.544
Now why would someone be
into a drug dealer for big bucks?

42:22.670 --> 42:23.962
- Shh!
- Because Oscar Prado,

42:24.088 --> 42:27.423
the pride of Little Havana,
was a fucking junkie!

42:32.388 --> 42:34.264
Thanks, Maria.

42:36.976 --> 42:38.977
Good one, Morgan.

42:56.245 --> 42:58.371
She's been in better moods.

42:59.373 --> 43:02.417
- I didn't exactly brighten her day.
- No, you didn't.

43:02.543 --> 43:05.086
Excuse me for doing my fucking job.

43:05.212 --> 43:08.965
You see any other supercops
coming in here with any leads?

43:09.091 --> 43:14.721
- You're definitely amazing but you gotta...
- I know, be aware of my surroundings,

43:14.847 --> 43:17.473
take the temperature of the room
before I open my mouth.

43:17.600 --> 43:20.810
- It's a bad habit. I admit it.
- Well, look on the bright side.

43:20.936 --> 43:23.438
Now that you've given up
men, booze and cigarettes,

43:23.564 --> 43:26.482
running your mouth's
the only bad habit you have left.

43:26.609 --> 43:30.236
That's right.
I'm a model of fucking perfection.

43:32.489 --> 43:36.743
- You remember what today is, right?
- How could I forget?

43:36.869 --> 43:39.370
7:30. I'll buy your first drink.

43:45.127 --> 43:47.253
- (Knocks)
- You wanted to see me?

43:47.379 --> 43:48.630
Siéntate.

43:51.175 --> 43:55.094
I need you to think about
Debra Morgan's continued involvement

43:55.220 --> 43:57.305
on the Oscar Prado case.

43:59.558 --> 44:02.518
You want me to throw her under the bus
for being overzealous?

44:02.645 --> 44:07.857
It's not about zeal. It's about tact and
sensitivity. It's also about the real world.

44:07.983 --> 44:11.277
This case is as high profile as it gets.
Óyeme, Angel.

44:11.403 --> 44:16.783
Morgan is resourceful and tenacious and
usually the right amount of pain-in-the-ass.

44:16.909 --> 44:19.118
But there are political ramifications.

44:19.244 --> 44:24.624
My history with Miguel Prado aside,
this case is just too big for her.

44:24.750 --> 44:27.377
Just say the word
and I will follow your orders.

44:27.503 --> 44:31.130
Becoming a Homicide sergeant
is more than just a bump in pay scale.

44:31.256 --> 44:35.677
It's a quantum leap in responsibility.
All part of moving up the chain.

44:37.054 --> 44:39.806
If I bounce her, she'll hate me.

44:39.932 --> 44:42.642
You're her boss, Angel, not her friend.

44:45.229 --> 44:47.021
It's up to you.

44:50.359 --> 44:52.485
(Overlapping chatter)

45:15.384 --> 45:18.720
(Miguel) He touched many people,
many hearts.

45:25.144 --> 45:27.019
Qué bien que viniste.

45:31.942 --> 45:36.070
- Can I get another cranberryjuice?
- That makes three. Problems down under?

45:36.196 --> 45:39.365
Jeez, I like the fucking taste, OK?

45:45.038 --> 45:47.165
Miss you, Dad.

45:56.550 --> 45:59.385
- My condolences.
- Thank you for coming.

46:01.930 --> 46:03.639
Losing my brother,

46:03.766 --> 46:07.935
it's going to leave a pain in my heart
that I don't think is ever going to heal.

46:09.271 --> 46:11.355
You have a brother, Dexter?

46:17.404 --> 46:19.030
(Cellphone vibrates)

46:22.242 --> 46:24.327
No, just the one loud sister.

46:24.453 --> 46:28.790
What she said back at the station,
it's OK.

46:28.916 --> 46:31.292
I know my brother was a good man.

46:31.418 --> 46:35.922
But I can't say that he suffered
from the tragedy of perfection.

46:38.258 --> 46:39.509
Who does?

46:40.928 --> 46:42.553
Who indeed?

46:43.138 --> 46:45.431
Hey, brother. The mayor's here.

46:55.776 --> 46:58.611
(Dexter) You attacked me with a knife
in a dope dealer's house.

46:58.737 --> 47:03.324
No, Oscar, you certainly did not suffer
from the tragedy of perfection.

47:04.368 --> 47:06.661
Then why does this feel so wrong?

47:07.621 --> 47:11.165
Why in your death
are you still so alive in my life?

47:13.168 --> 47:15.294
Did you know him well?

47:16.255 --> 47:18.339
Not as well as I thought.

47:19.675 --> 47:20.800
Sorry.

47:40.863 --> 47:42.363
(Cellphone vibrates)

47:53.166 --> 47:55.668
(Creaking)

48:01.383 --> 48:02.967
Cuervo Black.

48:06.847 --> 48:08.014
Thanks.

48:14.313 --> 48:15.771
Harry.

48:21.904 --> 48:23.070
(Sighs)

48:24.948 --> 48:29.076
- What the hell is that?
- Cranberryjuice. That gonna be a problem?

48:29.202 --> 48:30.870
Not even close to a problem.

48:30.996 --> 48:33.247
But the taste, kind of funky.

48:33.373 --> 48:34.832
(Chuckles)

48:40.505 --> 48:44.216
You know, by the time my dad
was my age, he already had his shield.

48:46.011 --> 48:47.470
Kinda why I'm here.

48:49.222 --> 48:51.849
I'm taking you off
the Oscar Prado case.

49:01.360 --> 49:04.028
I come up with grade-A intel
on Oscar Prado,

49:04.154 --> 49:07.198
and I'm getting tossed off the case
for being a little loud?

49:07.324 --> 49:08.783
In a nutshell.

49:10.285 --> 49:13.829
- LaGuerta put you up to this?
- It was my decision.

49:22.756 --> 49:25.049
I'll tell you one thing, Angel...

49:26.134 --> 49:30.346
I'm not letting anyone
get in the way of me getting my shield.

49:30.472 --> 49:33.349
There's only one person in this department
who can get in your way.

49:33.475 --> 49:34.600
Who?

49:34.726 --> 49:36.560
You.

49:47.114 --> 49:49.782
Can I get a real fucking drink, please?

49:56.957 --> 50:01.585
My sister still lives her life
trying to please our father.

50:04.798 --> 50:06.132
Me...

50:07.968 --> 50:11.387
I'm following the lead
of an eight-year-old kid.

50:13.223 --> 50:15.057
I'm moving on.

50:23.066 --> 50:25.067
Thank you for last night.

50:25.902 --> 50:27.820
It was a nice surprise.

50:30.490 --> 50:32.616
This is where I wanted to be.

50:40.834 --> 50:42.710
(Groans)

50:42.836 --> 50:44.754
Again? (Chuckles)

50:46.882 --> 50:50.968
All I want is chocolate pudding...and you.

50:52.179 --> 50:54.513
Not necessarily in that order.

50:55.432 --> 50:57.016
(Cellphone ringing)

51:02.314 --> 51:03.481
Morgan.

51:10.572 --> 51:12.990
- Where the fuck were you last night?
- Rita's.

51:13.116 --> 51:15.451
- It wasn't Rita's night.
- Turns out it was.

51:15.577 --> 51:17.495
- I called you.
- I know.

51:17.621 --> 51:20.748
- And you ignored me?
- Not you. Harry.

51:20.874 --> 51:22.124
Deb...

51:23.376 --> 51:27.254
I'm in a whole 'nother place when it comes
to Dad. I'm working out some personal stuff.

51:27.380 --> 51:29.882
You are such a fucking guy.

51:30.008 --> 51:34.845
What is this, you gotta kill your father so you
can become your own man kind of bullshit?

51:34.971 --> 51:37.306
Dad wasn't perfect...

51:37.432 --> 51:39.558
but he was there for you.

51:40.769 --> 51:42.770
- Deb, wait.
- What?

51:44.773 --> 51:46.899
I'm sorry I didn't notice your haircut.

51:50.737 --> 51:54.198
So what is it? Is it too short,
too young, too dorky, what?

51:54.324 --> 51:56.283
It's beautiful.

51:56.409 --> 51:57.743
Beautiful?

52:08.004 --> 52:09.880
You just said "beautiful".

52:11.049 --> 52:13.175
Yeah, I did, cause it is.

52:14.761 --> 52:19.598
(Sighs) Looks like you honored Dad
for both of us last night anyway.

52:20.433 --> 52:22.268
I had some help.

52:24.771 --> 52:27.648
(Chuckles) You getting along
with the new boss man?

52:27.774 --> 52:31.485
Oh, fuck him. He took me off
the Oscar Prado case and put me on this.

52:31.611 --> 52:33.737
Some dead-end Jane Doe.

52:37.534 --> 52:40.077
A couple of ladies of the night
called this in...

52:40.203 --> 52:41.787
- (Sirens)
- Oh, Madre de Dios.

52:41.913 --> 52:44.290
Could you turn that thing off?!

52:44.416 --> 52:46.959
- (Siren stops)
- We'll work quietly.

52:48.962 --> 52:52.590
About halfway through your article, Vince.
So far, very moving.

52:52.716 --> 52:56.260
Yeah, I was trying to make
second-tier chromosomal analysis sexy.

52:56.386 --> 52:58.345
Glad you're picking up on it.

52:58.471 --> 53:00.764
- Strangled.
- No blood. I'm the blood guy.

53:00.891 --> 53:03.184
- Why call me in?
- Because of this.

53:08.565 --> 53:12.318
- Looks like our evildoer had an agenda.
- Maybe it was a tattoo or something.

53:12.444 --> 53:15.821
Dex, I need to know
if this was ante or postmortem.

53:20.118 --> 53:21.368
Teegan.

53:21.494 --> 53:23.037
Freebo's girlfriend.

53:23.163 --> 53:25.873
Looks like he's still in Miami.

53:25.999 --> 53:27.208
(Camera shutter clicks)

53:33.423 --> 53:34.548
Oye.

53:36.176 --> 53:38.219
- You talk to Morgan yet?
- Yep.

53:38.345 --> 53:40.387
How'd she take it?

53:41.848 --> 53:44.892
- There were curse words involved.
- You did good.

53:46.144 --> 53:47.770
Sergeant.

54:03.036 --> 54:04.578
Way to be.

54:09.334 --> 54:10.376
Thank you.

54:10.502 --> 54:12.378
(♪ Romantic ballad)

54:46.579 --> 54:49.748
(Dentist) There you go, Dexter.
Good as new.

54:58.425 --> 55:01.844
- (Bell)
- Hold the elevator. Hold...

55:06.099 --> 55:07.933
Asshole.

55:08.059 --> 55:11.395
Sorry. Sergeant Asshole.

55:14.232 --> 55:16.525
Vamos, Masuka, Quinn.

55:16.651 --> 55:19.028
¡Vamos!
We got some celebrating to do.

55:22.282 --> 55:25.367
- You can still drink after last night?
- A man has his needs.

55:25.493 --> 55:27.536
You can go back to your
cute little cranberryjuice.

55:27.662 --> 55:32.791
Nah, it tastes like shit. I'm gonna
have a mojito or ten on you, Sarge.

55:32.917 --> 55:34.460
(All chuckling)

55:45.597 --> 55:47.097
(Amado) Morgan.

55:47.974 --> 55:49.725
(Debra) You so have the wrong person.

55:49.851 --> 55:53.062
Oh, there's a good reason
why Quinn's of interest to IA.

55:53.188 --> 55:57.775
No, understand me. When I say
you have the wrong person, I mean me.

55:57.901 --> 56:01.528
These people are more than badge
numbers to me. They're my friends.

56:01.654 --> 56:04.656
- They're my family.
- Shh! Listen.

56:06.076 --> 56:09.787
That's the sound of your shield
calling for help.

56:17.587 --> 56:21.965
Harry said that what was inside me
would be there forever.

56:22.092 --> 56:24.593
And that I wouldn't be able to change.

56:25.762 --> 56:27.679
He was half right.

56:27.806 --> 56:31.433
Killing Oscar Prado
was a bell I can't un-ring.

56:31.559 --> 56:36.647
I have moved on from my father, but
I still need his code, now more than ever.

56:36.773 --> 56:39.691
But it has to evolve,
become my own.

56:41.611 --> 56:43.362
Change is good.

56:43.488 --> 56:45.614
Hey, you.

56:45.740 --> 56:47.116
Hey, yourself.

56:47.242 --> 56:49.326
(♪ Romantic ballad)

56:51.371 --> 56:53.747
This music again?

56:53.873 --> 56:55.666
Chocolate pudding again?

56:58.002 --> 57:00.003
- Oh, shit.
- What?

57:00.130 --> 57:02.047
I've done this before.

57:02.173 --> 57:04.550
- What do you mean?
- I'm pregnant.
