WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:03.215
Previously on Dexter...

00:03.341 --> 00:05.050
God, you're on fire.

00:07.971 --> 00:09.263
- Oh, shit.
- What?

00:09.389 --> 00:11.432
I'm pregnant.

00:11.558 --> 00:16.812
I just got word Angel will be
Detective Sergeant Batista.

00:16.938 --> 00:20.441
(Dexter) Fred Bowman, AKA Freebo,
kills two college girls

00:20.567 --> 00:22.484
and escapes on a state police screw-up.

00:22.610 --> 00:24.278
Looking to hold some product.

00:24.404 --> 00:25.988
- (Scoffs)
- I need a hit.

00:26.114 --> 00:28.282
Did you hear what I said?
Fuck off, Teegan.

00:28.408 --> 00:30.117
Fine, your dick
can suck itself from now on!

00:30.243 --> 00:31.660
(Grunting)

00:34.622 --> 00:35.664
Freebo, get back here!

00:37.125 --> 00:39.251
(Grunting)

00:40.712 --> 00:42.838
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

00:42.964 --> 00:44.465
- I got it, Dex.
- Got what?

00:44.591 --> 00:48.218
(Debra) Only the case that's gonna get me
my shield. It's huge. Angel put me on it.

00:48.344 --> 00:50.220
Who he is is what makes
this case huge.

00:50.346 --> 00:53.891
It's Miguel Prado,
Assistant District Attorney.

00:54.017 --> 00:55.142
He and LaGuerta go way back.

00:55.268 --> 00:58.645
The other guy's Ramon Prado,
Miguel's middle brother.

00:58.772 --> 01:00.439
He's a lieutenant
with the sheriff's department.

01:00.565 --> 01:01.815
And...

01:01.941 --> 01:03.692
- Oscar.
- Prado?

01:03.818 --> 01:05.319
As in baby brother.

01:05.445 --> 01:07.529
I've never killed anyone
I didn't completely vet before,

01:07.655 --> 01:10.365
whose guilt I wasn't
absolutely certain of.

01:10.492 --> 01:13.452
Oscar Prado tried to kill Freebo.
Then he tried to kill me.

01:13.578 --> 01:14.953
He's gotta be guilty of something.

01:15.080 --> 01:18.082
Why would a blood spatter analyst

01:18.208 --> 01:21.293
spend time searching for information
on my dead brother?

01:21.419 --> 01:23.879
This death got to me.

01:24.005 --> 01:26.090
- Morgan, right?
- Do I know you?

01:26.216 --> 01:27.841
Yuki Amado, Internal Affairs.

01:27.967 --> 01:30.177
- And?
- You know Joey Quinn?

01:30.303 --> 01:32.346
I'm gonna do you a favor. Call this guy,

01:32.472 --> 01:34.598
tell him you wanna cash in
one of my coupons.

01:34.724 --> 01:36.892
He's an informant
from my days in Narcotics.

01:37.018 --> 01:39.394
- You're Anton?
- You got something you need to show me?

01:39.521 --> 01:42.523
- What about this Prado guy?
- Oh, yeah, I've seen him before.

01:42.649 --> 01:46.110
Oscar Prado was into Freebo
for some serious cash.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.028
You getting along with the new boss man?

01:48.154 --> 01:51.115
(Debra) Ah, fuck him. He took me off
the Oscar Prado case and put me on this.

01:51.241 --> 01:52.908
Some dead-end Jane Doe.

01:53.660 --> 01:55.994
Teegan. Freebo's girlfriend.

01:56.121 --> 01:58.247
Looks like he's still in Miami.

03:55.865 --> 03:58.283
We're supposed to see hope in children.

03:58.409 --> 04:02.621
But right now, all I see are
little bundles of uncertainty.

04:02.747 --> 04:04.164
And germs.

04:04.290 --> 04:05.499
But that's another matter.

04:05.625 --> 04:07.334
I love kids.

04:07.460 --> 04:09.336
I can play with them, enjoy them...

04:09.462 --> 04:11.213
and leave.

04:11.339 --> 04:15.842
I don't have to worry
about what they'll become.

04:18.263 --> 04:20.430
A Nobel Prize laureate.

04:21.975 --> 04:23.225
A drunk.

04:24.644 --> 04:27.354
President of the United States.

04:28.481 --> 04:30.148
Or someone like me.

04:30.900 --> 04:34.528
Why do parents take the chance?
I've never felt compelled.

04:34.654 --> 04:38.949
But why would l?
I'm not in the business of giving life.

04:39.075 --> 04:41.702
(Child crying)

04:48.042 --> 04:51.336
It's for sure. I'm pregnant, heh.

04:58.344 --> 05:00.053
What should we do?

05:02.640 --> 05:04.099
I don't know.

05:07.228 --> 05:08.520
(Bell)

05:16.696 --> 05:20.157
We should talk.
Weigh all the options.

05:21.034 --> 05:22.034
Together.

05:24.704 --> 05:26.204
I have to get to work.

05:27.915 --> 05:31.293
Weighing options.
The pros and cons.

05:31.419 --> 05:33.920
Something I'm good at, usually.

05:38.718 --> 05:42.095
What the fuck, Dex? I was yelling at you
to hold the elevator, asswipe.

05:42.221 --> 05:45.015
Sorry, I'm feeling off.

05:45.141 --> 05:47.225
So see a doctor.

05:47.352 --> 05:50.187
Saw one. Really didn't help.

05:52.273 --> 05:53.982
The Oscar Prado case?

05:54.108 --> 05:55.942
Yeah, fuckers are on
the career-maker of the year.

05:56.069 --> 05:58.945
They nail this Freebo guy
and they're golden.

05:59.072 --> 06:02.282
The courts already let Freebo go once
for those two girls in the Everglades.

06:02.408 --> 06:05.869
That was then. This time he killed
a senior ADA's brother.

06:05.995 --> 06:08.622
Caffeine fix.

06:08.748 --> 06:11.041
Except he didn't kill Oscar.

06:11.167 --> 06:12.542
I did.

06:12.668 --> 06:14.920
If it hadn't been for Freebo,
Oscar would still be alive,

06:15.046 --> 06:16.505
and I wouldn't be in this mess.

06:16.631 --> 06:19.007
Besides, he's seen my face.

06:19.133 --> 06:21.760
I've gotta find Freebo before they do.

06:21.886 --> 06:24.513
That's one thing I'm sure of, at least.

06:25.431 --> 06:27.265
Nice watch. Knockoff?

06:27.392 --> 06:29.184
Me? No. Real thing only.

06:29.310 --> 06:33.105
I sold a kidney to get it.
I'll show you the scar sometime.

06:33.231 --> 06:34.523
I'll give you a kidney not to.

06:34.649 --> 06:39.820
Hey, Dex, do me a favor. Go over the
Prado blood evidence one more time, OK?

06:39.946 --> 06:41.113
Maybe you missed something.

06:41.239 --> 06:42.489
- OK, but...
- (Man) Sarge!

06:42.615 --> 06:43.990
- Yeah?
- We got Narcotics on the line.

06:44.117 --> 06:46.451
All right.

06:46.577 --> 06:49.246
- Hey, Dex, wait up.
- Oh.

06:52.875 --> 06:55.752
My Jane Doe. See what you see.

06:55.878 --> 06:58.130
Already saw what I saw,
which was nothing.

06:58.256 --> 06:59.923
So see what you see again.

07:00.049 --> 07:03.510
I can't afford an unsolved,
and I've got fuck-all on this.

07:03.636 --> 07:07.180
Coroner says he found a pharmacy in her.
Big surprise, right?

07:07.306 --> 07:09.641
Body dumped near
the waterfront stroll. Shocker.

07:09.767 --> 07:11.351
She looks like every other
tweaker hooker case.

07:11.477 --> 07:16.440
- Except the tattoo peeled off her shoulder.
- Coroner says not a tattoo.

07:18.234 --> 07:20.193
You're getting interested.

07:20.319 --> 07:22.404
(Sighs) Actually, I'm getting sleepy.

07:32.999 --> 07:36.751
It's reassuring to know
I'm not the only one at sea.

07:36.878 --> 07:40.839
I could throw them a line,
tell them their cases are linked.

07:40.965 --> 07:44.426
That Jane Doe was actually
Freebo's girlfriend.

07:45.970 --> 07:49.222
That it was Freebo who killed her.

07:49.849 --> 07:52.017
But I need the head start.

07:56.772 --> 07:59.149
Step away from the incense.

08:02.987 --> 08:05.071
This is America, buddy.
Freedom of religion.

08:05.198 --> 08:09.493
I didn't realize you were a Buddhist, Vince.
Japanese are traditionally Shinto.

08:09.619 --> 08:12.412
Are we? Oh, whatever.

08:12.538 --> 08:15.165
I bought all this shit
off my manicurist.

08:15.291 --> 08:18.919
Need all the luck I can get.
Got a crucifix up there too.

08:19.045 --> 08:21.713
Cause it did so much for Jesus?

08:21.839 --> 08:25.592
Cause Forensics Quarterly is deciding
whether or not to publish my article.

08:25.718 --> 08:29.304
You know, the one you read.
And proofed.

08:29.430 --> 08:31.223
The incense stays.

08:36.395 --> 08:39.314
Coulda used you at the doctor's office.

08:43.110 --> 08:47.113
But you've got to use me, Maria.
ADAs can put pressure on other agencies.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.741
We have Ramon, who's with the sheriff's
department. Together, we...

08:49.867 --> 08:55.038
Miguel, Miguel, tranquilo. I know that
you and Ramon are going to help.

08:55.164 --> 08:58.208
And it's hard to let somebody else
handle Oscar's case.

08:58.334 --> 09:00.627
But I have my best detectives on this.

09:00.753 --> 09:02.337
I got the best forensics team...

09:02.463 --> 09:04.339
- Morgan, right?
- He's part of it.

09:04.465 --> 09:07.759
We are tracking down every one of Freebo's
known associates,

09:07.885 --> 09:09.302
looking under every rock.

09:09.428 --> 09:12.138
We will find him.
This is a good team.

09:12.265 --> 09:16.101
This is the same team, by the way, that
shared a roof with the Bay Harbor Butcher.

09:18.020 --> 09:22.440
That was totally out of line.
I'm... I'm sorry, Maria.

09:26.237 --> 09:31.366
It's just that my...
my fuse is so short ever since Oscar.

09:33.244 --> 09:36.371
Even with Syl. I'm driving her nuts.

09:38.541 --> 09:40.166
I doubt that.

09:41.252 --> 09:42.752
She knows what she's got.

09:52.138 --> 09:54.222
The Bay Harbor Butcher situation...

09:54.348 --> 09:56.474
- No, don't...
- No, please.

09:59.562 --> 10:04.524
I was too personally involved
to see it clearly.

10:06.319 --> 10:08.987
And that's why I've distanced
myself from things.

10:12.241 --> 10:14.784
You should do the same with Oscar.

10:20.458 --> 10:21.916
I know.

10:25.004 --> 10:27.464
I know. You're right.

10:29.300 --> 10:32.010
Some things never change.

10:38.184 --> 10:41.394
We're not as close as we used to be.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.855
But at least I still have you
as a colleague.

10:46.442 --> 10:49.361
And I'm glad that it's you that's here.

10:49.487 --> 10:51.655
- Hmm?
- Gracias.

11:01.582 --> 11:05.335
Miguel Prado's already seen too much
of me. I can't comfort the grieving.

11:09.465 --> 11:12.509
- You got this?
- I got this.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.728
Don't look familiar, hon.

11:23.854 --> 11:26.606
Ooh, but those are
some fine streaks.

11:26.732 --> 11:28.525
Who did her hair?

11:28.651 --> 11:30.944
Christophe of Beverly fuckin' Hills.

11:32.113 --> 11:33.655
Yeah, do you have his number?

11:33.781 --> 11:36.908
Petunia, you are the dumbest whore
on this stroll.

11:37.034 --> 11:39.703
Sorry, sugar. Don't got a name for you.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.204
Keep walkin', girl.

11:41.330 --> 11:43.832
It's all you're good for.

11:44.917 --> 11:46.459
(Yuki) S'up, Deb?

11:46.585 --> 11:48.962
The she-males give you any leads?

11:49.088 --> 11:50.880
It's Officer Morgan to you.

11:51.006 --> 11:52.966
Right, not a detective yet.

11:53.092 --> 11:56.261
Course, an unsolved isn't gonna get you
any closer to a shield.

11:56.387 --> 11:58.555
Look, I don't know why IA picked me, but...

11:58.681 --> 12:00.890
Cause Detective Quinn likes the ladies.

12:01.016 --> 12:03.893
Well, then you don't need a snitch.
You need a fuckin' slut.

12:04.019 --> 12:06.813
So why don't you go talk
to Petunia over there?

12:06.939 --> 12:08.815
I can get you a shield tomorrow.

12:10.484 --> 12:12.318
I'm a sergeant, after all.

12:12.445 --> 12:14.988
You'd give me a shield for being a rat?

12:15.114 --> 12:18.533
No, for being an honest cop, Debra.

12:18.659 --> 12:20.618
Like your father.

12:21.662 --> 12:24.372
You are not goddamn
digging into my father right now.

12:24.498 --> 12:28.668
Digging? Please. The old-timers at IA
talk about him like he's a brother.

12:28.794 --> 12:32.464
The old-timers also talk about
how popular that made him.

12:32.590 --> 12:35.675
Oh, God.
That really matters to you, doesn't it?

12:35.801 --> 12:37.927
Your cop friends.

12:38.053 --> 12:41.222
It's your whole life.
Them, the job, the shield.

12:41.348 --> 12:46.186
Far as I can tell, without that,
you've got nothing.

12:48.147 --> 12:50.356
Except your, uh, treadmill.

12:54.111 --> 12:56.654
Kind of a cunt, aren't you?

12:57.490 --> 13:00.033
(Laughs) Nice.

13:01.035 --> 13:04.829
But seriously, um, you should look into
expanding your world a little.

13:04.955 --> 13:09.542
You know, finding something else fulfilling.
Like gardening or, um...

13:09.668 --> 13:12.295
ooh, scrapbooking.

13:12.421 --> 13:14.088
Just in case.

13:22.097 --> 13:23.890
(Sighs)

13:24.016 --> 13:26.184
Get me a name.

13:27.061 --> 13:28.144
Teegan.

13:29.605 --> 13:31.397
Drove a Volkswagen Rabbit.

13:32.566 --> 13:34.567
That should buy me an address for her.

13:34.693 --> 13:37.403
If I'm Iucky,
she left me a lead to Freebo.

13:37.530 --> 13:40.740
Tee...gun.

13:40.866 --> 13:43.368
How many parents would give
their kid a name like that?

13:45.704 --> 13:46.871
Four.

13:48.332 --> 13:49.958
Nope. Nope.

13:50.084 --> 13:51.501
Bingo.

13:51.627 --> 13:53.211
Teegan Campbell.

13:53.337 --> 13:55.922
Address on Sorority Row.

13:56.048 --> 13:58.091
Guess I know what I'm doing tonight.

13:58.217 --> 13:59.884
Teegan...

14:01.554 --> 14:03.805
No, not a name I'd choose.

14:03.931 --> 14:07.934
Megan. Mary.
Those are classics.

14:08.060 --> 14:10.228
Or, for a boy, Charles...

14:11.897 --> 14:15.608
or Philip.

14:15.734 --> 14:17.235
Or Richard.

14:17.361 --> 14:19.737
(Babies gurgling)

14:19.864 --> 14:22.949
Or what's so bad about...

14:23.075 --> 14:25.159
Dexter, Jr?

14:25.286 --> 14:27.120
(Baby crying)

14:27.246 --> 14:29.831
(Rattling)

14:31.917 --> 14:33.793
Reminds me of you, Dex.

14:36.589 --> 14:38.548
(Rattling)

14:38.674 --> 14:42.677
Harry. The last person I'd turn to
for advice on fatherhood.

14:42.803 --> 14:44.429
Old habits die hard.

14:44.555 --> 14:47.056
Gotta focus on something easier to kill.

14:47.182 --> 14:48.308
Freebo.

14:48.434 --> 14:51.561
Dexter! Momentico.

14:51.687 --> 14:55.815
Shit. Sorry, I'd rather go rifle
through a dead girl's apartment.

14:55.941 --> 14:57.317
Dexter.

14:57.443 --> 14:59.986
We, uh...

15:00.112 --> 15:03.990
I never really got to thank you for, uh,
coming to Oscar's wake.

15:04.116 --> 15:08.745
It really means a lot to me and my family,
knowing that you...

15:08.871 --> 15:10.830
are taking a personal interest
in the case.

15:10.956 --> 15:13.333
OK. Well, you're welcome.

15:13.459 --> 15:14.918
Uh, what are you doing tonight?

15:15.044 --> 15:17.837
- Nothing.
- Oh, well, then, you'll come for dinner.

15:17.963 --> 15:22.508
I rarely take no for an answer.
You're gonna learn that about me.

15:22.635 --> 15:23.593
I will.

15:23.719 --> 15:26.387
Honestly, uh... I wanna pick your brain
about something.

15:26.513 --> 15:29.098
And Syl and I, uh,

15:29.224 --> 15:31.517
you know, we could...
we could use the company.

15:31.644 --> 15:34.562
The more people around,
the less we think about, you know.

15:34.688 --> 15:37.106
- Sure.
- You married? You got kids?

15:37.232 --> 15:39.192
No. No kids. Uh, girlfriend.

15:39.318 --> 15:41.945
Ah, bueno, bueno. Bring her.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.321
Unless you were lying.

15:44.990 --> 15:47.241
You know,
about doing nothing tonight.

15:48.410 --> 15:50.954
(♪ Latin music)

16:29.284 --> 16:30.910
(Cheering and applause)

16:31.036 --> 16:33.579
(Singer) We're gonna towel off,
and we'll be right back.

16:33.706 --> 16:36.582
(♪ Latin music)

16:38.293 --> 16:40.169
Officer Morgan, a music lover.

16:42.297 --> 16:44.298
You ever seen this woman?

16:44.425 --> 16:46.134
Did Quinn send you?

16:46.260 --> 16:48.219
Different case.

16:48.345 --> 16:51.222
- My debt's to Quinn.
- Your debt's with the department.

16:53.559 --> 16:56.477
I'm not an information ATM.

16:57.896 --> 17:00.189
I'm fucking desperate! All right?

17:01.275 --> 17:03.943
I got a steaming heap of crap
all on this case.

17:04.069 --> 17:07.405
I've gone through every scum-sucking
ball sack of a pimp I know,

17:07.531 --> 17:11.909
every whacked-out hooker.
You are my last-ditch ass-fucked effort!

17:14.455 --> 17:17.081
Goddamn, you got
a mouth on you, woman.

17:18.167 --> 17:20.043
Great, thank you.

17:22.087 --> 17:23.963
That's cool. Show me the picture.

17:27.593 --> 17:29.469
Not from the neighborhood.

17:29.595 --> 17:32.180
But from the looks of her,
I doubt she had to pay cash for her habit.

17:32.306 --> 17:36.434
A strawberry? Right. So I'm looking
for a dealer who'll take payment in sex.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.686
Yeah. That'll be about all of 'em.

17:38.812 --> 17:40.438
Yeah.

17:44.651 --> 17:46.986
Look, I can ask around for you, OK?

17:47.112 --> 17:50.823
- Thank you. I'd appreciate it.
- But you should stay.

17:50.949 --> 17:55.495
Grab a drink and work some of that
massive tension out on the dance floor.

17:55.621 --> 17:58.706
Well, you know what? It smells like armpits
in here and I got a lot of work to do.

17:58.832 --> 18:01.918
- There is more to life than policing.
- So I've heard!

18:14.264 --> 18:17.642
If we had a house this big,
it would make sense to have another child.

18:17.768 --> 18:20.144
It's a valuable lot.

18:21.522 --> 18:24.982
Look at the lawn. It's so thick.
Be a great place for kids to play.

18:25.109 --> 18:28.069
Zenith Zoysia.
Thrives in warm weather.

18:29.404 --> 18:32.907
I'm not talking about grass, Dexter.

18:33.033 --> 18:34.158
You're not?

18:34.284 --> 18:38.371
I've been trying to talk about the pregnancy
the whole way here.

18:38.497 --> 18:41.207
Maybe you should be a little
less subtle in the future.

18:41.333 --> 18:44.544
I'm trying not to pressure you.

18:44.670 --> 18:48.005
But we have to make a decision
before one's made for us.

18:48.132 --> 18:50.842
You're right, I know. OK.

19:01.770 --> 19:04.313
Welcome. I'm so glad you came.

19:04.439 --> 19:06.023
- Made it.
- Yeah. Hey.

19:06.150 --> 19:07.233
- Hello.
- I'm Rita.

19:07.359 --> 19:08.734
Miguel. Bienvenidos.

19:08.861 --> 19:11.445
- So you've met Sylvia?
- Syl, please.

19:11.572 --> 19:14.907
- You guys have a beautiful home here.
- Great place for kids.

19:15.033 --> 19:17.493
(Miguel) Come on, I'll give you the tour.

19:20.372 --> 19:22.540
Strong family resemblance.

19:24.459 --> 19:26.043
My father.

19:26.170 --> 19:29.589
He was a drunk and a bastard
but he had a distinctive chin.

19:29.715 --> 19:32.383
Some people just shouldn't
have kids, you know?

19:33.552 --> 19:36.554
- I wish there were a test.
- Yeah.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.974
Oscar, he got the...
the best and the worst of Dad.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.602
Me, I just tried to stay clear, you know?

19:42.728 --> 19:46.647
But, um...
I suppose he's in me too.

19:47.983 --> 19:49.525
Hard to avoid.

19:50.736 --> 19:51.986
Welcome.

19:55.157 --> 19:57.742
I-I shouldn't drink.

19:58.702 --> 20:01.287
What, are you pregnant?

20:01.413 --> 20:02.788
Uh...

20:02.915 --> 20:04.373
You are.

20:04.499 --> 20:05.958
Oh, my God, that's terrific.

20:06.084 --> 20:08.669
Yeah... Yeah.

20:09.755 --> 20:11.631
Or not.

20:11.757 --> 20:13.633
That sounded really bad.

20:13.759 --> 20:16.093
I meant...

20:16.220 --> 20:19.472
Miguel and I have actually
been trying for a while now.

20:19.598 --> 20:21.307
It even took once.

20:21.433 --> 20:27.063
And Miguel, he wants to start a family
before he makes his run for the DA's office.

20:27.189 --> 20:30.858
But I don't know.
I'm happy with the way things are.

20:30.984 --> 20:32.985
I don't wanna force Dexter
into something.

20:33.111 --> 20:35.529
That's kind of what happened
with the ex-husband.

20:35.656 --> 20:37.865
Well, that and the fact
that he was a sociopath.

20:37.991 --> 20:39.200
(Chuckles)

20:39.326 --> 20:43.871
I had an ulterior motive
for inviting you here tonight.

20:43.997 --> 20:46.374
Does it involve charging me
with a felony?

20:46.500 --> 20:47.875
(Both chuckle)

20:48.001 --> 20:49.710
No, the truth is, uh,

20:49.836 --> 20:53.756
I wanted to talk to someone
inside of this investigation.

20:53.882 --> 20:56.384
All I keep getting
is reassurances, reassurances.

20:56.510 --> 20:58.219
Reassurances make me nervous.

20:58.345 --> 21:00.805
You want me to put you at unease?

21:00.931 --> 21:03.182
I want you to be straight with me.

21:03.308 --> 21:06.143
How certain are you
that this bastard Freebo will be found?

21:10.023 --> 21:11.857
Very.

21:11.984 --> 21:15.194
- So I'm gonna get my shot at him in court?
- Well, that could take a while.

21:15.320 --> 21:18.614
Huh? No, no, no. No more waiting.
I'm done waiting.

21:19.908 --> 21:21.617
Is there another option?

21:22.828 --> 21:25.329
I'm an ADA.
My brother Ramon is a sheriff.

21:25.455 --> 21:27.790
You don't think we got resources?

21:27.916 --> 21:31.252
If our lead pans out,
then we'll talk to Homicide.

21:31.378 --> 21:33.546
You have a lead? That's great.
How can I help?

21:33.672 --> 21:35.965
No, Ramon, you know,
he has his own way of doing things.

21:36.091 --> 21:37.967
I don't wanna drag you into it.

21:38.093 --> 21:42.805
You're talking to the guy you caught
breaking into your brother's secure files.

21:45.434 --> 21:46.767
All right.

21:49.187 --> 21:50.855
Well...

21:50.981 --> 21:54.358
Ramon...may have...

21:54.484 --> 21:56.152
borrowed a cellphone...

21:57.696 --> 21:59.864
that belonged to Freebo's mother.

22:02.492 --> 22:05.494
He calls mommy...
We can track him.

22:06.288 --> 22:08.414
Mother's cellphone.
That's good thinking.

22:08.540 --> 22:09.999
It may lead to nothing.

22:10.125 --> 22:13.210
Or it may lead them to Freebo
before I can get to him.

22:13.337 --> 22:16.172
I need to check out Teegan's place
as soon as I can get out of here.

22:21.136 --> 22:25.931
The hunt. My vision is much sharper
through the eyes of my shadow self.

22:26.058 --> 22:29.060
If only I could see
this baby situation as clearly.

22:29.186 --> 22:31.854
I promised Rita
I'd be back in an hour.

22:31.980 --> 22:35.024
So she's nesting while I'm hunting,
stalking my prey.

22:35.150 --> 22:37.693
I'll start with his prey - Teegan.

22:37.819 --> 22:42.031
What she left behind will talk to me,
guide me to him.

22:42.157 --> 22:43.824
Or..

22:43.950 --> 22:45.242
to a kegger.

22:45.369 --> 22:48.371
(Loud chatter)
(♪ Hip-hop)

23:19.111 --> 23:21.570
- What's the password?
- There's a password?

23:21.696 --> 23:24.657
I'm just looking for my girl Teegan.
Where's her room again?

23:24.783 --> 23:27.243
Ew, Teegan?
Ew, that girl's a ho bag.

23:27.369 --> 23:28.786
- She's a ho!
- She's such a ho bag.

23:28.912 --> 23:31.122
She doesn't live here any more.

23:31.248 --> 23:34.333
She's ho'ing off campus,
probably living in her ho pad.

23:34.459 --> 23:36.168
How about you give me
the address of her ho pad

23:36.294 --> 23:38.295
so I can go tell her
what a ho bag she is?

23:38.422 --> 23:40.506
- You have any party favors?
- Oh, yeah.

23:40.632 --> 23:42.758
Uh, sorry. I don't have anything
on me, but...

23:42.884 --> 23:46.137
- We put out.
- We totally do.

23:46.263 --> 23:48.681
All right, that is
so totally off the hook.

23:48.807 --> 23:52.518
But how about I just trade you
for Teegan's address?

23:52.644 --> 23:55.229
- OK.
- OK.

23:57.107 --> 23:58.607
(Beeping)

23:58.733 --> 24:01.527
22 Lincoln Log.

24:01.653 --> 24:03.362
I suspect that's Lincoln Lane?

24:03.488 --> 24:05.364
Whatever. Let's get high.

24:05.490 --> 24:07.366
You two wait here.
I'll go get my stash.

24:07.492 --> 24:08.576
OK.

24:12.664 --> 24:14.582
The leaders of tomorrow.

24:16.710 --> 24:19.795
Their parents must be proud.

24:19.921 --> 24:23.007
How much worse
could my child turn out?

24:23.133 --> 24:26.886
Do I even wanna know
the answer to that question?

24:27.971 --> 24:30.389
Teegan's ho pad will have
to wait till tomorrow night.

24:30.515 --> 24:34.560
I've got a girlfriend and a baby
waiting on my promise to come back.

24:34.686 --> 24:38.606
Is this what my life will be like - making
promises I'm not sure I wanna keep?

24:38.732 --> 24:40.191
It's complicated.

24:40.317 --> 24:43.569
The pros and cons of responsibility.

24:43.695 --> 24:45.946
All right. Pros.

24:47.782 --> 24:50.576
Can't we just talk?

24:50.702 --> 24:53.287
Sometimes lists are easier for me.

24:54.956 --> 24:57.416
(Astor) Give it! It's my turn.

24:57.542 --> 24:59.251
All right, pros.

25:01.838 --> 25:03.088
Kids are cute.

25:03.215 --> 25:05.299
(Cody) You've already had it, Astor!

25:05.425 --> 25:07.885
- Mom!
- No soccer in the house!

25:08.011 --> 25:11.138
(Astor) Cody!
(Cody) I have to practice!

25:11.264 --> 25:14.141
- Cons?
- Noise.

25:14.267 --> 25:16.227
Time. Money.

25:16.353 --> 25:19.063
Stretch marks. Saggy boobs.

25:20.148 --> 25:22.233
Less personal freedom.

25:23.902 --> 25:27.905
Personal...freedom.

25:29.950 --> 25:32.034
All right, I thought I said no soccer
in the house.

25:32.160 --> 25:35.496
Now just go to your room
until it's time for school.

25:37.666 --> 25:38.874
Oh!

25:39.000 --> 25:40.751
Son of a...

25:41.836 --> 25:42.962
Ohh.

25:46.508 --> 25:48.592
What am I even thinking?

26:07.153 --> 26:09.572
- Zack Adelman?
- Yeah.

26:09.698 --> 26:11.824
We need to talk to you
about Fred Bowman.

26:11.950 --> 26:12.992
Who?

26:13.118 --> 26:16.662
Your pal, Freebo. The dealer
you got busted with two years ago.

26:16.788 --> 26:18.497
Oh, yeah. Right, right.

26:18.623 --> 26:24.420
Um, yeah, I haven't seen him
in, like, uh, two years.

26:24.546 --> 26:25.838
(Scoffs)

26:25.964 --> 26:27.506
You mind if we come in, Zack?

26:27.632 --> 26:31.302
He actually doesn't have
a choice, Sergeant. He's a parolee.

26:31.428 --> 26:34.054
- Oh, gosh, you're right.
- Yeah.

26:41.813 --> 26:44.440
Couldn't find anything new
on your Jane Doe, sorry.

26:44.566 --> 26:45.774
How's it going?

26:45.900 --> 26:48.736
Backward.
I don't even think Jane was a hooker.

26:50.405 --> 26:52.406
Bummer. So who you looking for?

26:52.532 --> 26:54.199
Her dealer.

26:54.326 --> 26:56.327
What the fuck is scrapbooking?

26:57.662 --> 26:59.788
The tradition of putting
photos and memorabilia

26:59.914 --> 27:03.500
into family keepsake albums,
along with relevant journaling.

27:03.627 --> 27:05.711
I don't even want to know
how you know that.

27:05.837 --> 27:08.797
- So do you know which dealer...
- (Phone rings)

27:08.923 --> 27:11.425
Morgan.

27:12.802 --> 27:13.886
Yeah.

27:14.012 --> 27:16.764
Got it. I'll meet you there.

27:16.890 --> 27:19.224
Might have found
some luck of my own.

27:19.351 --> 27:21.143
The lead on Jane's ID.

27:23.188 --> 27:27.608
As soon as it gets dark, I'm back on
the hunt so I can stay ahead of my sister.

27:27.734 --> 27:31.028
This department is becoming
annoyingly effective.

27:31.154 --> 27:32.821
You home alone here, Zack?

27:32.947 --> 27:35.532
- Totally.
- (Door shuts)

27:35.659 --> 27:38.744
Get on your knees. Put your hands
on your head. Don't move!

27:38.870 --> 27:41.372
Wait! It's just a cat, man.

27:41.498 --> 27:43.707
- It's cool, guys!
- (Batista) Shut the fuck up!

27:47.796 --> 27:50.130
Hi.

27:50.256 --> 27:52.675
Oh, this fuckin' paperwork's
gonna take forever.

27:52.801 --> 27:55.427
Come on, drop it.
Drop it! Come on.

27:55.553 --> 27:57.638
Just a few pills, man.
What's the big deal?

27:57.764 --> 28:00.474
The big deal is you're making me cancel
on a very willing woman.

28:00.600 --> 28:04.311
- Get on your knees next to your boyfriend.
- Let's make a deal, then. Let's trade...

28:04.437 --> 28:06.230
Stop there, asshole.

28:06.356 --> 28:08.732
We don't got time to process
a bribery charge too.

28:08.858 --> 28:12.277
I'm not offering you cash, man.
I've got valuable information.

28:12.404 --> 28:13.654
On Freebo?

28:13.780 --> 28:15.781
Even better.

28:15.907 --> 28:17.157
Chicky Hines.

28:17.283 --> 28:19.451
Who the fuck is Chicky Hines?

28:19.577 --> 28:22.496
Chicky Hines just went down
on a carjacking homicide.

28:22.622 --> 28:24.957
He's waiting on sentencing now.

28:25.083 --> 28:27.418
Yeah, this guy Zack says
Hines didn't do the crime.

28:27.544 --> 28:29.962
He's offering up an alibi for Hines
and another suspect.

28:30.088 --> 28:32.881
I know all about
the Chicky Hines case.

28:33.007 --> 28:35.968
He was a big win for the prosecutor,
and guess who that was.

28:36.094 --> 28:38.846
- Shit.
- Yeah, Miguel Prado.

28:38.972 --> 28:42.558
So now, not only won't I be bringing him
good news about his brother's case.

28:42.684 --> 28:45.477
Worse - I'm gonna undermine
his latest conviction.

28:45.603 --> 28:48.605
- Think that's what he wants to hear?
- Doubtful.

28:49.482 --> 28:51.900
Christ, vet this.
Oh, yeah, vet this.

28:52.026 --> 28:55.487
Completely. I wanna be absolutely certain
that this is solid

28:55.613 --> 28:58.532
before I even think about
bringing it to Miguel.

28:59.826 --> 29:02.453
(Water running)

29:02.579 --> 29:03.912
(Dexter) Hey, Angel.

29:06.958 --> 29:08.417
Case going all right?

29:10.920 --> 29:12.963
No leads, no insights?

29:13.089 --> 29:16.008
Just the pressure, bro.

29:16.134 --> 29:19.219
Expected to make decisions,
take responsibility.

29:19.345 --> 29:21.889
You don't know what it's like.

29:22.015 --> 29:24.600
Probably like finding out
your girlfriend's pregnant.

29:24.726 --> 29:28.187
- Rita's pregnant?
- Looks like it.

29:30.815 --> 29:32.357
Holy shit.

29:32.484 --> 29:34.359
That's fantastic.

29:35.403 --> 29:36.528
It is?

29:36.654 --> 29:39.782
My little girl
is the best thing I ever did.

29:39.908 --> 29:45.245
I've messed up a lot.
But in my darkest hours, Auri's my light.

29:45.371 --> 29:46.955
You wait and see.

29:47.081 --> 29:48.832
OK.

29:48.958 --> 29:50.626
Thank you.

29:50.752 --> 29:52.836
I feel better.

29:58.134 --> 29:59.802
A light.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.386
Hmm.

30:01.513 --> 30:03.680
ls that even possible?

30:07.435 --> 30:09.436
(Swing creaking)

30:09.562 --> 30:12.105
Higher, Daddy!

30:15.235 --> 30:17.986
(Boy) Dexter, come play with us!

30:18.112 --> 30:20.030
(Giggling)

30:23.576 --> 30:24.827
Ah!

30:26.120 --> 30:27.621
Come play with us, Daddy.

30:27.747 --> 30:29.832
I'm right behind you, buddy.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.215
You're it, baby.

30:38.341 --> 30:39.424
(Squealing)

30:41.344 --> 30:45.180
Cody and Astor
would be older, you know.

30:45.306 --> 30:47.516
I like them this age.

30:50.019 --> 30:52.938
(Harry) I always wanted
to be a grandfather.

30:54.399 --> 30:56.650
I think we're better off without you.

30:58.570 --> 31:01.446
Well, it's a beautiful family
you got there, Dex.

31:01.573 --> 31:04.783
You couldn't picture this, could you?

31:07.328 --> 31:09.162
I could have surprised you.

31:10.081 --> 31:13.792
Yeah, there's no reason
it couldn't turn out like this.

31:14.836 --> 31:16.420
(Rita, panicked) Astor!

31:16.546 --> 31:20.424
- Astor!
- Astor!

31:31.936 --> 31:33.896
What have you done?!

31:46.951 --> 31:49.119
Yo, Morgan.

31:53.166 --> 31:54.833
Where the hell have you been?

31:54.959 --> 31:56.877
Street wasn't clear, yo.

31:57.003 --> 31:59.338
I get spotted with you,
no more trusty CI.

31:59.464 --> 32:00.839
Fine. What have you got?

32:00.965 --> 32:04.176
All right, apartment six. Pimp named Javier,
completely new to the game,

32:04.302 --> 32:06.845
but he already has a rep
for his stable of white girls.

32:06.971 --> 32:10.390
If your Jane Doe is a strawberry,
chances are he tried to recruit her.

32:10.516 --> 32:12.392
- This is good. Thank you.
- Yeah.

32:17.482 --> 32:20.067
You get spotted with me,
no more trusty CI.

32:20.193 --> 32:24.154
- Yeah, but he likes 'em white.
- Does he like 'em strapped?

32:24.280 --> 32:27.324
All right, it's cool. But I'll be here,
anything goes sideways.

32:35.375 --> 32:38.502
Miami Metro.
I'm looking for Javier.

32:38.628 --> 32:39.670
Entra, por favor.

32:44.175 --> 32:45.801
(Chuckling)

32:47.345 --> 32:48.971
(Munching)

32:49.097 --> 32:52.224
You're a little young to be
in business for yourself.

32:53.518 --> 32:55.185
I'm a wonder kid. (Chuckles)

32:56.062 --> 32:58.689
OK. Can you identify this woman?

33:00.108 --> 33:03.443
You'd make a shitload more money on
all fours than you do as a cop, mamita.

33:03.569 --> 33:05.320
Oh, like I haven't heard that before.

33:05.446 --> 33:10.534
Look, little one, give me a name for this girl,
I won't bust you for being a piece of shit.

33:10.660 --> 33:13.078
Never seen her. Humph.

33:13.204 --> 33:16.039
Besides, she looks
too used up to be an earner.

33:16.165 --> 33:18.875
But you, damn, mami.

33:19.002 --> 33:21.169
I could get you a thou a night.

33:21.295 --> 33:25.090
Give you some spending money
for, uh, extracurricular activities.

33:25.216 --> 33:27.009
- (Laughs)
-Think I need to hear that?

33:27.135 --> 33:28.760
- Ohh!
- You sleazy piece of shit!

33:28.886 --> 33:32.347
I'm a cop! That's all I need!
I'm not gonna do any fucking scrapbooking!

33:32.473 --> 33:33.432
Scrapbooking?

33:33.558 --> 33:35.267
You fucked her.

33:37.145 --> 33:38.603
Ohh!

33:38.730 --> 33:40.897
- You've seen her?
- (Chuckles)

33:41.024 --> 33:42.524
On his dick.

33:42.650 --> 33:45.986
Hey, she's fading. She doesn't even know
what she's talking about.

33:46.112 --> 33:48.113
I think she does, and I think you fucked
a girl who's now dead.

33:48.239 --> 33:53.577
Fuck. Look, I picked her up at some party.
All right? I thought that I could turn her out.

33:53.703 --> 33:56.079
- What's her name?
- I don't know!

33:56.205 --> 33:57.873
Bitch, cunt, "hey, you."

33:58.458 --> 33:59.583
Yeah?

34:01.753 --> 34:03.170
This doesn't look good, Javier.

34:03.296 --> 34:06.423
I passed her to a friend
who could feed her habit better than I could.

34:06.549 --> 34:09.926
- A friend, right.
- Yeah, yeah, a white guy named Freebo.

34:11.971 --> 34:12.971
Freebo?

34:13.097 --> 34:16.308
Yeah, yeah. He could deal with her shit
longer than I could.

34:16.434 --> 34:18.518
Maybe he's a patient guy.
I don't know.

34:18.644 --> 34:20.145
Yeah, maybe not.

34:20.271 --> 34:23.607
If my first stab at Freebo
had gone as planned,

34:23.733 --> 34:26.860
Oscar Prado might still be alive,
Miguel wouldn't know who I was,

34:26.986 --> 34:29.071
Teegan would have lived
to ho another day,

34:29.197 --> 34:31.364
and Deb wouldn't be chasing
a Jane Doe.

34:31.491 --> 34:35.327
And I wouldn't be watching the clock,
counting the minutes till darkness comes,

34:35.453 --> 34:37.454
trying to get the jump
on my friends in bIue.

34:37.580 --> 34:39.289
Anything?

34:39.415 --> 34:42.292
Uh, running additional DNA tests
on Oscar Prado's clothing.

34:42.418 --> 34:45.420
If Freebo's cut himself,
his blood could be on these clothes.

34:45.546 --> 34:48.673
Slam dunk in court.
Is there a chance?

34:48.800 --> 34:51.176
- Not even remotely.
- Good.

34:53.638 --> 34:56.181
Any idea what your sister found?

34:57.475 --> 34:59.810
- She found something?
- I'm asking you.

34:59.936 --> 35:04.731
She left a message saying she was vetting
a big lead that's gonna make me happy.

35:04.857 --> 35:06.733
No idea.

35:06.859 --> 35:08.693
Got the call. I'm getting published.

35:08.820 --> 35:11.238
- Hey.
- Congratulations. The shrine worked.

35:11.364 --> 35:13.365
Totally.

35:20.456 --> 35:23.708
Freebo just called his mother's cellphone.
I'll have his address by tonight.

35:23.835 --> 35:25.585
And then you will let me
deal with him.

35:25.711 --> 35:29.089
Ramon, you've done your job.
I'm gonna take it from here, OK?

35:29.215 --> 35:31.424
- Go be with your family.
- Don't fucking sideline me on this, Miguel.

35:31.551 --> 35:32.676
Ramon.

35:32.802 --> 35:34.386
Hey, Maria.

35:34.512 --> 35:37.389
Hey. Your assistant told me
you were here.

35:39.058 --> 35:40.767
- What do you have on Freebo, Maria?
- Ramon.

35:40.893 --> 35:43.895
Well, we're working
on some new angles.

35:44.021 --> 35:46.773
- Mm-hm. Which means you've got shit.
- Excuse us.

35:46.899 --> 35:50.777
Oye, coño. Go home.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.030
Cause you're not helping here.

35:56.534 --> 35:58.201
(Scoffs)

36:01.539 --> 36:04.416
- Ramon and his temper.
- Yeah, I remember.

36:04.542 --> 36:05.917
But...I get it.

36:06.043 --> 36:09.296
I mean, him and Oscar were close.

36:09.422 --> 36:12.465
Miguel, I need to talk to you
about something else.

36:13.718 --> 36:15.510
Uh-oh.
I remember that look.

36:22.310 --> 36:24.436
Chicky Hines.

36:24.562 --> 36:25.770
OK.

36:26.981 --> 36:28.982
He didn't do
that carjacking homicide.

36:29.108 --> 36:33.111
We found new evidence,
and it checks out, Miguel.

36:33.237 --> 36:35.572
I think you convicted the wrong man.

36:38.075 --> 36:39.326
You're serious?

36:41.037 --> 36:45.040
I was gonna wait, I mean...
The timing is...

36:45.166 --> 36:46.291
Shit.

36:46.417 --> 36:49.294
But if Hines is innocent, Miguel...

36:52.215 --> 36:53.924
Miguel, I'm sorry.

36:55.259 --> 36:59.471
(Sighs) Oh, this is frustrating
and disappointing.

36:59.597 --> 37:03.934
And, uh...I really hate my job right now.

37:06.145 --> 37:10.523
But, hey... Don't ever think
about holding back on me.

37:10.650 --> 37:14.653
OK? Just like now, you tell me straight.

37:14.779 --> 37:17.864
That's the Maria
that I've always counted on.

37:17.990 --> 37:20.033
And always can.

37:23.371 --> 37:25.830
When all of this is behind us,
I want to get together.

37:26.958 --> 37:28.833
Hmm? The three of us.

37:28.960 --> 37:32.170
You know, as friends.
It's long overdue.

37:39.178 --> 37:40.637
Night time.

37:52.650 --> 37:54.901
(Batista) Why do you think
Freebo's still in town?

37:55.027 --> 37:57.362
Because I think he killed
his girlfriend on Sunday.

37:57.488 --> 37:59.030
Jane Doe.

37:59.156 --> 38:00.782
(LaGuerta) How do you know
it's his girlfriend?

38:00.908 --> 38:03.451
The CI gave me a lead.
I did some follow-up.

38:03.577 --> 38:07.747
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. My CI?
- Do you have a name for Jane yet?

38:07.873 --> 38:11.334
No, but she was strangled,
which is consistent with Freebo's MO.

38:11.460 --> 38:15.755
If you're right, the Oscar Prado
and Jane Doe cases are linked.

38:15.881 --> 38:19.301
I guess we'll just
have to merge them.

38:24.807 --> 38:27.767
Freebo's still out there killing.
We've got to catch him fast.

38:27.893 --> 38:32.647
But we got a lead now. We find
the girlfriend's ID, we find her place,

38:32.773 --> 38:34.983
her friends, her family,
then we find him.

38:35.109 --> 38:38.778
- I'll coordinate with the Feds.
- Ramos, reach out to street patrol.

38:40.323 --> 38:45.452
Anton is my contact.
If you wear him out or blow his cover...

38:45.578 --> 38:48.038
I know how to work a CI, Quinn,

38:48.164 --> 38:52.083
so unless there's some other reason
you don't want me to talk to him...

38:55.796 --> 39:00.091
Hey... Solid police work, Morgan.
That's how you earn your shield.

39:01.552 --> 39:03.553
- Thanks, Sarge.
- All right.

39:03.679 --> 39:06.765
All right, people.
We're gonna be working late on this.

39:06.891 --> 39:09.768
I'll be working late too.

39:16.025 --> 39:17.901
Ho pad indeed.

39:40.257 --> 39:44.052
All right, Teegan, tell me where
your homicidal beau might be.

39:47.431 --> 39:49.265
(Clunking)

39:50.976 --> 39:52.769
(Yawns)

39:55.272 --> 39:58.817
Freebo. Hiding out
at his dead girlfriend's house?

39:58.943 --> 40:00.151
Risky.

40:00.277 --> 40:04.656
Then again, it took me a while to find this
place and I knew who I was looking for.

40:07.034 --> 40:11.621
No tools, no syringe,
no kill room, no sure thing.

40:12.790 --> 40:15.834
Hang tight, Freebo.
I'll be back before you know it.

40:20.172 --> 40:23.967
Detached garage.
Perfect place for a kill room.

40:31.308 --> 40:35.854
M-6 bayonet, Vietnam-era.
A family keepsake, maybe?

40:35.980 --> 40:38.022
Oscar tried to kill Freebo with it.

40:38.149 --> 40:40.692
It's only fitting I use it
to complete the task.

40:40.818 --> 40:43.820
- (Knock on door)
- Shit.

40:49.326 --> 40:51.453
(Knocking)

41:03.966 --> 41:06.509
It's time for a decision, Dexter.

41:11.557 --> 41:14.058
Having this child is a huge mistake.

41:14.185 --> 41:17.520
I've weighed out all the pros and cons,
and all I've got are cons.

41:22.735 --> 41:25.236
I've been thinking the same thing.

41:26.989 --> 41:28.448
I'm keeping it.

41:31.785 --> 41:36.706
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life
but being a mother was never one of them.

41:38.209 --> 41:40.710
Dexter, I'd rather do this with you.

41:40.836 --> 41:42.795
But I've been a single parent
for a long time now,

41:42.922 --> 41:46.466
and I think Astor and Cody prove
that I'm pretty damn good at it.

41:48.469 --> 41:50.762
Is this you being subtle again?

41:54.892 --> 42:01.147
No, this is me, in all sincerity,
saying I will honor your choice.

42:02.608 --> 42:04.567
This child is happening.

42:04.693 --> 42:07.904
But your role in its life
is entirely up to you.

42:14.703 --> 42:16.829
Should I take the out Rita gave me?

42:16.956 --> 42:21.834
What kind of father would I be?
After all, I kill people.

42:21.961 --> 42:23.586
(Thunder crashes)

42:23.712 --> 42:26.589
(♪ Rock)

42:35.558 --> 42:38.893
(Thunder)

42:43.440 --> 42:44.357
Agh!

42:44.483 --> 42:46.734
Long time, no see.

42:54.868 --> 42:58.413
(Breathing heavily)

43:00.082 --> 43:03.167
(Panting) Oh, God.
What the hell is this?!

43:03.294 --> 43:04.711
(Whimpering)

43:07.798 --> 43:09.507
Show and tell.

43:12.386 --> 43:16.764
It's been so long since you killed them,
I was afraid you'd...forgotten.

43:17.725 --> 43:20.852
Though I'm sure Teegan
is fresh in your mind.

43:20.978 --> 43:22.562
(Thunder rumbling)

43:22.688 --> 43:25.315
(♪ Rock)

43:34.199 --> 43:35.199
I didn't...

43:35.326 --> 43:36.993
Aah! Fuck!

43:40.247 --> 43:41.331
Ohh.

43:41.457 --> 43:43.458
You killed those girls
in the Everglades

43:43.584 --> 43:46.252
and you got away with it
on a bad warrant.

43:46.378 --> 43:48.379
I love those.

43:50.341 --> 43:51.883
And then Teegan came along.

43:55.262 --> 43:58.306
(Thunder rumbling)

44:10.402 --> 44:14.322
First, you drained her
of her self-respect and hope.

44:16.867 --> 44:19.535
Then last Sunday,
you choked the life out of her.

44:19.662 --> 44:21.704
No, last Sunday...

44:21.830 --> 44:25.083
I was gettin' high with...
it was Cheri or...Carrie.

44:25.209 --> 44:28.753
She's at... She's at...
She's at Alpha Fee...

44:28.879 --> 44:31.673
(Muffled shouting and whimpering)

44:35.386 --> 44:37.220
You seem uncertain.

44:38.597 --> 44:40.765
It's uncomfortable, isn't it?

44:40.891 --> 44:43.101
(Hyperventilating)

44:43.227 --> 44:44.977
Just when you think you've answered
all the questions,

44:45.104 --> 44:46.854
another one smacks you in the face.

44:46.980 --> 44:49.440
Life, life, life.

44:51.151 --> 44:53.653
Life is just like that.

44:53.779 --> 44:55.238
(Whimpering)

44:59.743 --> 45:01.786
Which is why I prefer death.

45:06.250 --> 45:07.333
(Grunts)

45:33.777 --> 45:36.154
(Door creaks)

45:56.925 --> 45:58.050
Dexter?

45:59.845 --> 46:01.012
Is that you?

46:08.353 --> 46:10.062
I had the phone records.

46:10.189 --> 46:12.690
Well, what are...

46:15.486 --> 46:16.736
Is he in there?

46:22.242 --> 46:23.910
Alive?

46:36.882 --> 46:38.758
(Exhales)

46:41.261 --> 46:42.887
It was self-defense.

46:50.103 --> 46:52.563
I found a forensics lead.

46:54.608 --> 46:56.984
It was a long shot.
I wanted to check it out before...

46:57.110 --> 47:00.071
I wasted anyone's time.

47:00.197 --> 47:03.115
I didn't expect Freebo to be here.

47:03.951 --> 47:05.952
He surprised me. He jumped me...

47:06.078 --> 47:08.120
with this knife.

47:08.247 --> 47:12.250
That looks like my father's knife from...
from Vietnam. He gave that to Oscar.

47:19.591 --> 47:22.051
I didn't know what to do.
I fought back.

47:29.268 --> 47:32.353
The knife ended up in his neck.

47:40.279 --> 47:42.154
- I...
- I'm gonna tell you something.

47:43.365 --> 47:46.325
I wasn't sure that I could do this.

47:46.451 --> 47:49.787
But you did. You did.

47:53.750 --> 47:56.335
- We're gonna get rid of the evidence.
- No. No!

47:56.461 --> 47:57.962
- You should leave. Now.
- No!

47:58.088 --> 48:00.131
Plausible deniability.

48:08.140 --> 48:10.433
Thank you.

48:13.937 --> 48:15.855
You're welcome.
