WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:03.632
Previously on Dexter...

00:03.758 --> 00:05.968
I found a fucking lead
on the Skinner case.

00:06.094 --> 00:08.971
The Skinner is using tree-trimming
as a cover for surveillance.

00:09.097 --> 00:12.349
He watches from the trees,
and when the time is right, he grabs them.

00:12.475 --> 00:16.186
Mr. King. We met at the scene of
our second victim, is that correct?

00:16.312 --> 00:17.396
(King) Yes, that is correct.

00:17.522 --> 00:19.314
Mario Astorga?

00:19.441 --> 00:20.399
I don't know anything.

00:20.525 --> 00:23.444
Then why would George King
suggest otherwise?

00:23.570 --> 00:25.029
What are you so afraid of, Mario?

00:25.155 --> 00:27.948
This is the shirt I was wearing
when Freebo met his end.

00:28.074 --> 00:29.742
That's his blood right there.

00:29.868 --> 00:32.953
This shirt implicates me
in his death.

00:33.079 --> 00:35.622
I trust you, and I want you to trust me.

00:35.749 --> 00:39.209
But he's being secretive.
He's never home. He says he's with Dexter.

00:39.335 --> 00:41.378
But I think it's a cover.

00:42.380 --> 00:44.048
(Dexter) Freebo's final resting place.

00:44.174 --> 00:47.217
Hiding a body in a cemetery.
You're fucking brilliant.

00:47.343 --> 00:49.803
We need to go
after the root cause,

00:49.929 --> 00:53.265
his bloodsucking, soulless
defense attorney, Ellen Wolf!

00:53.391 --> 00:56.143
- We can't kill her.
- I see.

00:56.269 --> 00:58.937
- This is personal.
- Fuck, yes, this is personal.

00:59.064 --> 01:01.648
I'm asking you to do this
for me as my friend.

01:01.775 --> 01:04.276
- I'm sorry. No.
- Well, then, fuck you!

01:04.402 --> 01:07.780
Someone loaned Freebo some money
and is willing to skin people to get it back.

01:07.906 --> 01:10.657
We're gonna spread the word
that Anton knows where Freebo is.

01:10.784 --> 01:13.410
Which means that the Skinner
will be looking for me.

01:13.536 --> 01:14.703
What are you hiding?

01:14.829 --> 01:17.206
Anton is not officially a CI.

01:17.332 --> 01:19.291
We used him as bait.

01:19.417 --> 01:21.502
What, are you in love with the guy?

01:23.755 --> 01:25.005
Anton, you in there?

01:25.131 --> 01:27.800
Shit. Trimmed trees.
The Skinner's been here.

01:27.926 --> 01:29.885
I'm ready to get my hands dirty.

01:30.011 --> 01:31.595
(Dexter) I've always done the deed alone.

01:31.721 --> 01:33.430
Never stood outside,

01:33.556 --> 01:35.724
been a witness to this moment.

01:36.601 --> 01:38.143
(Muffled scream)

01:38.269 --> 01:40.896
(Harry) You've set something
in motion here.

01:41.022 --> 01:44.149
Everything Miguel does from now on
is connected to you.

03:40.892 --> 03:43.977
(Dexter) Today I wake up,

03:44.103 --> 03:46.188
kiss the wife-to-be...

03:51.319 --> 03:53.695
...feed the stepkids-to-be...

03:56.741 --> 04:00.285
...dress myself
in the usual pants, shirt...

04:03.289 --> 04:05.374
...and pretence.

04:06.918 --> 04:09.628
But last night, it was no pretence.

04:09.754 --> 04:11.588
Miguel and I took a life.

04:11.714 --> 04:16.635
Together. And today,
someone knows my truth,

04:16.761 --> 04:19.096
shares my reality.

04:19.222 --> 04:21.682
- I'm not alone.
- (Knock on door)

04:26.938 --> 04:28.480
Sylvia, good morning.

04:28.606 --> 04:30.482
Sorry for coming over so early.

04:30.608 --> 04:32.567
- It's OK.
- But...

04:32.694 --> 04:35.988
I need to see your face
when I ask you.

04:36.114 --> 04:37.322
Ask me?

04:37.448 --> 04:39.574
Syl, what is it?

04:39.701 --> 04:42.369
Miguel was out till all hours
last night.

04:42.495 --> 04:45.122
He says he was with you.
Is that true?

04:46.624 --> 04:48.917
Absolutely. We were...

04:49.043 --> 04:50.419
just hanging.

04:50.545 --> 04:53.672
- Being guys. You know.
- Miguel was telling the truth.

04:53.798 --> 04:57.592
You see, there's nothing to worry about.
Dexter didn't get here till late.

04:57.719 --> 05:00.429
- It was...
- It had to be almost midnight.

05:00.555 --> 05:02.639
Miguel got home an hour ago.

05:03.850 --> 05:05.475
Oh.

05:06.936 --> 05:09.146
He's having an affair.

05:09.272 --> 05:12.399
Oh, no. No, no.
You don't know that.

05:12.525 --> 05:14.401
When you've been married
as long as we have,

05:14.527 --> 05:16.111
you know when your husband's lying.

05:16.237 --> 05:18.530
(Dexter) Something to look forward to.

05:18.656 --> 05:21.575
Maybe Dexter knows
where he went.

05:22.660 --> 05:24.077
I really don't.

05:24.203 --> 05:25.162
(Sobs)

05:25.288 --> 05:30.125
But he did talk about a case
he needed to look over.

05:30.251 --> 05:32.044
At the office.

05:32.170 --> 05:34.755
This really isn't your problem.
I should go.

05:34.881 --> 05:36.465
No. No, no, no.

05:36.591 --> 05:39.343
You stay here for as long
as you need to, OK?

05:39.469 --> 05:40.886
(Sobs)

05:42.680 --> 05:44.348
I'll just...leave.

05:50.313 --> 05:51.855
Work.

05:56.110 --> 05:58.195
With a detour on the way.

06:02.784 --> 06:04.868
(♪ Whistling Camptown Races)

06:07.789 --> 06:09.456
(Car lock beeps)

06:14.045 --> 06:15.128
Dex.

06:15.254 --> 06:17.047
Dex, man.

06:21.052 --> 06:22.552
How you doing? You OK?

06:22.678 --> 06:24.596
- I'm good.
- Me too.

06:24.722 --> 06:27.140
It's like there was
an imbalance in the world,

06:27.266 --> 06:30.602
and we righted it,
with our own hands.

06:30.728 --> 06:33.772
- It was deserving.
- I don't know. I feel real.

06:33.898 --> 06:35.982
Like, maybe for the first time in my life.

06:36.109 --> 06:38.068
I know what you mean.

06:40.530 --> 06:43.365
But if we're thinking
about continuing

06:43.491 --> 06:46.243
- these extracurricular activities...
- Absolutely.

06:46.369 --> 06:47.786
...you need to work on your alibis.

06:47.912 --> 06:50.455
Syl stopped by this morning,
wondering where you'd been.

06:50.581 --> 06:52.040
Ah, shit.

06:52.166 --> 06:53.917
Coño. I'm a moron.

06:54.043 --> 06:56.711
I tried to cover for you,
but I thought you went home.

06:56.838 --> 06:58.547
I'm sorry, man.

06:58.673 --> 07:01.716
I went over to Jack's Hideaway
over on 57th. I was, like, so wired.

07:01.843 --> 07:05.387
The next thing I know,
the sun was coming up.

07:06.305 --> 07:08.014
Jack's Hideaway.

07:08.141 --> 07:10.517
Don't worry about Syl.
I can handle that.

07:10.643 --> 07:14.938
I got a motion hearing this morning, though,
I don't wanna miss.

07:15.064 --> 07:18.108
(Car door shuts, engine starts)

07:20.653 --> 07:23.613
I'll get better at this. With your help.

07:23.739 --> 07:27.033
(Dexter) I stalked a wife-killer
at Jack's Hideaway last year,

07:27.160 --> 07:28.994
grabbed him right at closing...

07:29.120 --> 07:30.328
at 2am.

07:31.414 --> 07:33.790
Sylvia said Miguel got home
an hour ago.

07:35.293 --> 07:38.003
Did he just lie? To me?

07:38.129 --> 07:39.754
(Cellphone rings)

07:41.799 --> 07:43.133
Another detour.

07:51.601 --> 07:54.269
- There's nothing here either.
- Well, what about the blinds?

07:54.395 --> 07:57.606
- What about the glass?
- Checked them. Deb, there's no blood.

07:57.732 --> 08:00.275
Anton didn't just follow
the Skinner out of here.

08:00.401 --> 08:02.110
I'll keep looking.

08:02.236 --> 08:05.614
- I think we need to recanvass.
- We've talked to everyone in the building.

08:05.740 --> 08:07.532
What about the kids?
They're awake now.

08:07.658 --> 08:09.910
- We'll talk to the kids.
- (Batista) What do we got?

08:10.036 --> 08:11.995
The Skinner has Anton.
Did you see the trees?

08:12.121 --> 08:14.664
I saw them.
It doesn't mean he got nabbed.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.710
The coffee pot was left burning.
I mean, he definitely left in a hurry.

08:18.836 --> 08:21.296
What the hell was Anton doing
back in town?

08:21.422 --> 08:24.633
He never left. He contacted me,
but he wouldn't agree to surveillance.

08:24.759 --> 08:27.594
Who cares if he agrees? He's a CI.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.222
That's why we used him as bait
in the first place.

08:30.348 --> 08:32.349
Guys.

08:32.475 --> 08:35.852
- No liner.
- The building trash dumpster.

08:39.148 --> 08:41.650
Subscription renewal form
from Rolling Stone

08:41.776 --> 08:45.070
- addressed to Anton Briggs.
- This is his garbage.

08:45.196 --> 08:48.240
So the bag split on impact
with the dumpster here.

08:48.366 --> 08:50.158
He threw it. Defensive move.

08:51.035 --> 08:52.702
Why the hell didn't he use his fists?

08:52.828 --> 08:56.289
He was hurt.
There's blood and some hair.

08:56.415 --> 08:59.918
- Looks like he hit his head against the wall.
- How bad?

09:00.044 --> 09:03.922
Hard enough to daze him. A blow from
behind could have propelled him forward.

09:04.048 --> 09:06.925
So Anton comes down to empty
the garbage,

09:07.051 --> 09:09.094
the Skinner clocks him,

09:09.220 --> 09:10.762
he does a header into the wall,

09:10.888 --> 09:12.889
throws the bag as a last ditch.

09:13.015 --> 09:16.893
Skinner tosses him in the car
and peels out. Got tire marks here.

09:18.271 --> 09:19.521
Fuck.

09:19.647 --> 09:23.108
(Batista) All right, we got a confirmed
missing person. Anton Briggs.

09:23.234 --> 09:26.403
Find a photo. Get his face out
to all patrols and the media.

09:26.529 --> 09:30.115
Set up a tip line. Pull in some off-duties
to man the phone bank.

09:30.241 --> 09:34.202
Skinner's had him for 24 hours.
How long do you think he can hold out?

09:34.328 --> 09:38.290
Well, the ME's report on the other victims
suggests the Skinner starts slow.

09:38.416 --> 09:42.127
Probably to build fear.
Anton's a big guy. A lot of skin.

09:43.254 --> 09:45.630
That's meant to be comforting.

09:46.674 --> 09:48.300
George King, we need to bring him in.

09:48.426 --> 09:51.303
We gotta find him first.
We got BOLOs out on him all night long.

09:51.429 --> 09:54.097
Haven't found him yet.
We could search his house, though.

09:54.223 --> 09:56.516
We're still holding King's foreman
on resisting arrest?

09:56.642 --> 09:58.560
He give us anything
that'll buy us a warrant?

09:58.686 --> 10:02.105
Mario Astorga clammed up.
Too scared of King.

10:02.231 --> 10:06.610
He would rather be deported
away from his family than talk about King.

10:06.736 --> 10:09.613
- Is that all we got?
- Yeah.

10:10.531 --> 10:12.532
I'll try and find a flexible judge.

10:12.658 --> 10:15.118
Let me know when it comes in.
I'll go sit on King's house.

10:15.244 --> 10:17.537
We'll go sit on King's house.

10:18.247 --> 10:20.624
Hey, I want this above board.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.084
Use restraint. Wait on a warrant.

10:25.379 --> 10:27.922
And I hope they find something
because even if we nab King,

10:28.049 --> 10:30.425
we got nothing to hold him on past today.

10:30.551 --> 10:32.844
A day can save a lot of skin.

10:38.559 --> 10:41.561
(Hyperventilating)

10:41.687 --> 10:44.814
I keep...I keep telling you.
You have to listen.

10:45.566 --> 10:46.650
If...

10:46.776 --> 10:49.569
If I knew where Freebo was,

10:49.695 --> 10:51.363
I'd tell you.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.534
Don't you fucking understand, man?

10:56.661 --> 11:00.330
It was the cops. I was...I was fucking bait.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.710
All right, all right, you're right.

11:05.836 --> 11:08.838
I know where he is.
I can show you. I can show you.

11:11.175 --> 11:13.760
All right, listen to me.
He owes you money, right?

11:13.886 --> 11:17.305
He owes you money?
I can get you money. I can find you money.

11:20.518 --> 11:22.352
I don't want your money.

11:24.188 --> 11:26.439
I loaned Freebo that money.

11:29.110 --> 11:32.821
This is about respect.

11:43.999 --> 11:47.877
With your first cut, you had all night
to consider my questions.

11:50.381 --> 11:55.260
This cut, you have only one hour.

11:55.386 --> 11:57.929
And when I return, there'll be no rest.

11:59.223 --> 12:01.349
Use the time to think about...

12:02.393 --> 12:04.644
the skin you have left

12:04.770 --> 12:06.396
to lose.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.774
(Anton weeps)

12:19.744 --> 12:21.119
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

12:21.245 --> 12:22.954
Are you screening your calls?

12:23.080 --> 12:26.541
Ellen? I'm surprised you missed
the motion hearing this morning.

12:26.667 --> 12:28.543
So was Chicky Hines.

12:28.669 --> 12:30.754
Of course, Miguel was perfectly
happy to get a continuance.

12:30.880 --> 12:34.466
Uh, listen, if you're sick,
I can bring you over a sopa de pollo.

12:34.592 --> 12:36.760
Either way, let me know you're all right.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.928
OK? Bye.

12:40.639 --> 12:43.767
Miguel went missing last night.

12:43.893 --> 12:46.478
Ellen's missing this morning.

12:46.604 --> 12:49.272
Could be a coincidence.

12:57.448 --> 13:01.284
Patrol's been set up here all night.
King's not inside.

13:01.410 --> 13:03.661
Well, something in there's
gonna tell us where he is.

13:03.788 --> 13:05.872
Warrant should be here soon.

13:13.339 --> 13:15.131
Motherfuck.

13:16.550 --> 13:19.344
Anton? Anton, you in there?

13:19.470 --> 13:22.680
- Anton, are you in there?
- Hey, I don't hear anything.

13:24.141 --> 13:27.977
Yeah, well, I do. I hear somebody calling
for help. That's probable cause, right?

13:28.103 --> 13:30.563
We're doing this above board.
The warrant's on its way.

13:30.689 --> 13:32.732
Right. Restraint.

13:33.651 --> 13:35.443
What the fuck are you doing?

13:35.569 --> 13:37.529
Anton?

13:37.655 --> 13:38.988
Shit.

13:39.114 --> 13:41.574
Hey, you're not the only one
working this case, Morgan.

13:45.996 --> 13:47.372
(Ringing tone)

13:47.498 --> 13:50.375
- (Miguel over loud music) Prado here.
- Hey.

13:50.501 --> 13:53.211
Just checking in.
How'd the motion hearing go?

13:53.337 --> 13:54.796
Continued.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.716
- That's too bad.
- Oh, no, serendipitous actually.

13:58.843 --> 14:00.552
It worked in my favor.

14:00.678 --> 14:04.138
Listen, you don't have
to keep on checking on me.

14:05.182 --> 14:07.892
Yeah, I know, I'm just a...

14:08.018 --> 14:09.894
- concerned friend.
- Well, don't be.

14:10.020 --> 14:12.564
In fact, why don't you meet me
at Cojimar for lunch?

14:12.690 --> 14:15.358
Cause I been coming up
with some more, uh...

14:15.484 --> 14:16.693
projects.

14:16.819 --> 14:18.653
(Dexter) Another kill so soon?

14:18.779 --> 14:22.198
I can't. I gotta keep an eye
on the situation here.

14:22.324 --> 14:25.451
I heard. The Skinner grabbed up
another victim, huh?

14:25.578 --> 14:27.120
Let me know if I can help.

14:27.997 --> 14:34.252
Adiós.

14:34.378 --> 14:37.005
- (Gianna) Miami Metro hotline.
- (Phones ringing)

14:37.131 --> 14:39.883
What location?
Who am I speaking with?

14:40.009 --> 14:41.259
Can you spell that, please?

14:41.385 --> 14:44.387
Anton Briggs' photo
hit the media an hour ago.

14:44.513 --> 14:48.099
I'm gonna bring King's employee
up from holding, take another run at him.

14:48.225 --> 14:50.810
Mario Astorga,
already in interview two.

14:50.936 --> 14:53.563
- Thought I'd take a stab.
- I can handle it.

14:54.565 --> 14:56.608
I know. But I wanna help.

14:57.610 --> 14:59.903
Tired of standing
behind my glass wall.

15:00.029 --> 15:02.113
Well, we can use the help today.

15:02.239 --> 15:04.324
(Masuka) No, I knew,
I knew half those hookers

15:04.450 --> 15:06.743
were pre-op trannies, but is it true...

15:06.869 --> 15:09.203
theirjunk still works,
but nothing comes out?

15:09.330 --> 15:11.289
It's called slug-fucking.

15:11.415 --> 15:12.624
Hey. Hello.

15:12.750 --> 15:16.127
Babe. Hey, Vice got word
you needed extra bodies.

15:16.253 --> 15:18.504
- Thought I'd help out.
- That's cause you're the best.

15:18.631 --> 15:19.756
- Aw.
- Mwah.

15:19.882 --> 15:22.759
Hey, hey, get a room.
Actually, no, don't.

15:22.885 --> 15:24.636
(Masuka chuckles)

15:24.762 --> 15:26.930
Miami Metro tip line.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.765
Vince, you got a second?

15:36.065 --> 15:38.066
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What?

15:38.192 --> 15:40.151
Helping out on my day off.
You're welcome.

15:40.277 --> 15:42.528
Good place to meet chicks
from other departments.

15:42.655 --> 15:46.324
Yeah, well, that's my chick.
I don't want you talking your filth at her.

15:46.450 --> 15:48.451
Whoa, whoa, hold up, gaucho.

15:48.577 --> 15:50.787
I didn't bring that up. She did.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.331
- Bullshit.
- Seriously.

15:53.457 --> 15:55.959
She's like the Wikipedia of perv.

15:56.085 --> 15:59.087
(Chuckles) I gotta find me
a girlfriend from Vice.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.881
She's awesome.

16:09.181 --> 16:12.392
Fuck. Fucking nothing.
King could be anywhere.

16:12.518 --> 16:15.144
- Or right here.
- (Car pulling up)

16:16.313 --> 16:18.398
Holy shit.

16:18.524 --> 16:21.067
Remember,
we need his cooperation.

16:21.193 --> 16:22.735
Restraint, right.

16:22.861 --> 16:24.988
What are you doing at my house?

16:25.114 --> 16:27.198
Mr. King, we have a warrant
to search the premises.

16:27.324 --> 16:28.491
What are you looking for?

16:28.617 --> 16:31.119
More like who. You wanna tell us
where you've been all night?

16:31.245 --> 16:33.746
Oh, I work, ma'am. Nights. Mornings.

16:33.872 --> 16:36.290
Trees keep growing.
It's a good business.

16:36.417 --> 16:37.917
I'm only home to have breakfast.

16:38.043 --> 16:40.503
You wanna grab a bagel
down at the station?

16:40.629 --> 16:43.339
- Answer some questions?
- I'm happy to answer right here, sir.

16:43.465 --> 16:46.342
What, you got somewhere
you need to be?

16:46.468 --> 16:47.385
Trees.

16:47.511 --> 16:48.928
They'll wait.

16:50.931 --> 16:52.348
Am I under arrest, sir?

16:52.474 --> 16:54.600
No, but we can hold you
for questioning.

16:54.727 --> 16:57.603
- For the day.
- What are you, a lawyer?

16:57.730 --> 17:00.106
No, wait, I forgot.
You're a fucking tree-trimmer.

17:02.484 --> 17:06.612
I moved to this country
for its amazing liberties. I know my rights.

17:06.739 --> 17:08.489
Great.

17:12.077 --> 17:17.749
George King is hanging you out to dry,
Mario. I thought you might want a chance...

17:17.875 --> 17:21.335
(Dexter) l've seen fear.
An-inch-away-from-death fear.

17:21.462 --> 17:25.965
(LaGuerta) It'd be a shame to leave
your wife and your little baby behind.

17:26.091 --> 17:28.176
(Dexter) His is real.

17:29.053 --> 17:31.345
What makes you so scary,
George King?

17:31.472 --> 17:33.681
(Quinn) You miss your country, George?

17:33.807 --> 17:35.266
I like this country, sir.

17:35.392 --> 17:39.437
- I like Miami, sir.
- Nicaragua can be a rough place, huh?

17:39.563 --> 17:41.397
You in the military down there?

17:42.733 --> 17:45.401
Death squads, Contras.

17:45.527 --> 17:48.488
You woulda been about the right age
to get caught up in that.

17:48.614 --> 17:50.865
You learn a few things there, George?

17:50.991 --> 17:52.909
I learn respect, sir.

17:53.035 --> 17:55.161
No interrogation techniques?

17:56.705 --> 17:59.665
Maybe a little snatch and grab?
What do they call that? Renditioning?

17:59.792 --> 18:01.793
Oh, I don't know that, ma'am.

18:01.919 --> 18:03.419
Ma'am, sir.

18:05.255 --> 18:06.547
You did learn respect.

18:09.176 --> 18:12.804
Did you show any fucking respect
to Wendell when you tore his skin off?

18:12.930 --> 18:15.223
How about Anton when you bashed him
over the goddamn head?

18:15.349 --> 18:18.184
Morgan, you want a coffee?

18:18.310 --> 18:20.436
Why don't you get a coffee?

18:21.772 --> 18:23.147
Yeah.

18:24.316 --> 18:25.650
Sure.

18:34.076 --> 18:36.160
He looks harmless, doesn't he?

18:37.329 --> 18:39.497
They usually do.

18:39.623 --> 18:42.500
(Debra) I don't know.
Maybe he's not our guy.

18:42.626 --> 18:45.086
Well, you should trust
your instincts on this one.

18:45.212 --> 18:49.465
- This one of your creepy insights?
- Why does it always have to be creepy?

18:49.591 --> 18:51.384
Fucking tell me.

18:52.636 --> 18:56.806
He's held life and death in his hands.
He likes it.

18:57.766 --> 18:59.058
I knew it.

19:00.144 --> 19:02.353
So how do I crack
this sick fuck's brain?

19:02.479 --> 19:04.105
(Snorts)

19:04.231 --> 19:06.691
From what I've read
about these sick fucks,

19:06.817 --> 19:10.194
they usually have some sort of...code.

19:11.280 --> 19:15.324
I'd say disrespect is high
on his list of violations.

19:15.450 --> 19:18.494
Maybe if you came at him
with deference.

19:20.164 --> 19:21.831
Deference, huh?

19:23.834 --> 19:25.251
Yeah, think about it.

19:25.377 --> 19:28.171
Hey, Lieutenant.
I heard you say your friend Ellen is ill.

19:28.297 --> 19:31.382
Was it a stomach thing?
Because I just read this article...

19:31.508 --> 19:33.926
I don't know what it is.
I haven't heard back from her.

19:34.052 --> 19:37.263
I left her three messages.
I'm a little worried.

19:37.389 --> 19:39.098
(Dexter) Yeah, me too.

19:39.224 --> 19:41.934
I hope she didn't get
in an accident or something.

19:42.060 --> 19:45.021
Excuse me.
I have an errand to run.

19:54.239 --> 19:55.948
(Dexter) A home office.

19:56.074 --> 19:58.201
If she were sick,
this is where she'd be.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.411
(Doorbell rings)

20:11.840 --> 20:15.009
Her car's here. She could have gone
for a really long walk.

20:15.135 --> 20:16.761
Or borrowed a friend's car.

20:16.887 --> 20:19.388
Or maybe LaGuerta's right
and Ellen is comatose

20:19.514 --> 20:22.183
in some hospital, post-accident.

20:22.309 --> 20:23.684
One can hope.

20:24.728 --> 20:27.146
Not that there are any signs
of fouI play here.

20:29.441 --> 20:32.068
But Harry did raise me
to be paranoid.

20:41.745 --> 20:43.663
Blood. Damn it.

20:43.789 --> 20:46.082
No. Miguel wouldn't do this.

20:46.208 --> 20:48.167
We agreed Ellen Wolf is innocent.

20:48.293 --> 20:49.502
(Harry) Hello.

20:57.469 --> 21:01.138
It's just blood. There's no body.
He wouldn't even know what to do with one.

21:01.265 --> 21:03.307
I never taught him
how to dispose...

21:07.312 --> 21:10.147
As far as Miguel knows,
the best place to dispose of a body

21:10.274 --> 21:12.191
is beneath an open grave.

21:13.318 --> 21:14.402
Good thinking.

21:25.455 --> 21:28.833
- Hello.
- Uh, setups are in the kitchen.

21:30.335 --> 21:33.045
- Miguel?
- Hi.

21:33.171 --> 21:35.256
Any bites?

21:35.382 --> 21:37.675
No, just nosy neighbors so far.

21:37.801 --> 21:41.345
Syl's office said that she would be here.
Is she out back, or...?

21:41.471 --> 21:45.808
No, she wasn't feeling up
to an open house, so I'm sitting it for her.

21:48.145 --> 21:50.146
Well, you're a good friend.

21:50.772 --> 21:53.399
Here. You should have these.

21:58.071 --> 22:00.031
How about I make sure Syl gets them?

22:02.159 --> 22:04.327
Miguel.

22:06.538 --> 22:09.290
Flowers are a good start,
but can I be honest?

22:09.416 --> 22:11.375
I like honest.

22:12.836 --> 22:15.296
- You're an idiot.
- That's honest.

22:15.422 --> 22:18.132
You were smart enough
to ask her to marry you,

22:18.258 --> 22:20.259
and she's still
that same fantastic woman.

22:20.385 --> 22:23.679
- You don't think I know that?
- Well, you're not acting that way.

22:23.805 --> 22:25.306
I am not having a goddamn affair, OK?

22:25.432 --> 22:27.558
- All right, let's say that's the truth.
- It is.

22:27.684 --> 22:33.064
- Either way, you violated her trust.
- I just needed space.

22:33.190 --> 22:35.483
I've got everything
falling apart around me now,

22:35.609 --> 22:38.277
you know, Oscar, Ramon,
now my cases...

22:38.403 --> 22:41.906
And the same things
are falling apart for her

22:42.032 --> 22:43.866
because she's your partner.

22:48.121 --> 22:51.082
You're a wise person, aren't you?

22:51.208 --> 22:53.751
(Laughs)

22:53.877 --> 22:56.337
Well, if I am,
it's only because I've learned

22:56.463 --> 22:59.298
from my many, many mistakes.

22:59.424 --> 23:01.092
You have insight.

23:02.386 --> 23:04.136
And I tell you what.

23:06.723 --> 23:09.100
I'm gonna follow your lead.

23:12.229 --> 23:15.064
So point the way.

23:24.408 --> 23:27.243
Mr. King, I understand
that respect is very important to you.

23:28.495 --> 23:29.578
Yes, ma'am.

23:30.705 --> 23:35.376
And I'm sure you feel
that people have to earn your respect.

23:35.502 --> 23:37.128
Yes, ma'am.

23:38.255 --> 23:40.297
I feel like you've earned this.

23:41.842 --> 23:44.176
What's the matter,
little gardener? Huh?

23:44.302 --> 23:46.137
You feel disrespected?

23:46.263 --> 23:49.849
You'll get used to it in prison
because your foreman Mario's next door,

23:49.975 --> 23:51.851
and he is spilling his guts.

23:55.439 --> 23:57.773
You are so sure
he's afraid of you. Why?

23:57.899 --> 24:00.234
What did you do to him?
What did you do to Anton?

24:00.360 --> 24:02.111
- What did you do?!
- Morgan! Morgan!

24:04.865 --> 24:06.157
Fuck.

24:15.792 --> 24:18.627
- (Truck horn blaring)
- Help!

24:18.753 --> 24:21.005
(Gasping)

24:21.673 --> 24:23.674
Aah!

24:25.510 --> 24:27.386
Help me!

24:34.144 --> 24:36.228
Hey. We're supposed
to be working together.

24:36.354 --> 24:38.689
You keep going off half-cocked.
How am I supposed to trust you?

24:38.815 --> 24:40.191
You trust me? Unbelievable.

24:40.317 --> 24:43.569
You're lucky Batista wasn't watching the
monitors. What the fuck were you thinking?

24:43.695 --> 24:46.030
I was thinking about Anton.
You oughta try it some time.

24:46.156 --> 24:48.324
I want to find him just as bad as you do.

24:49.534 --> 24:53.078
If you gave a shit about Anton,
you wouldn't have made him your fake CI

24:53.205 --> 24:54.705
and he wouldn't be messed up in this.

24:54.831 --> 24:57.708
You were too busy boning him
to provide him with protective surveillance.

24:57.834 --> 24:59.585
You are so crossing the line right now.

24:59.711 --> 25:01.337
Am I?

25:01.463 --> 25:03.047
You knew Anton was in town.

25:03.173 --> 25:05.341
And I fucking told him to call it in.

25:05.467 --> 25:08.511
You should have called it in
your fucking self.

25:13.808 --> 25:15.684
I know. It's my fault.

25:15.810 --> 25:17.686
No.

25:18.939 --> 25:20.064
You're right.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.734
I used him.

25:25.862 --> 25:29.657
I...just fucking used him.

25:36.706 --> 25:40.501
We can only hold George King
for a few more hours.

25:42.462 --> 25:44.171
We better get back to work.

25:52.430 --> 25:54.932
(Dexter) Schedule says
there are four funerals today.

25:55.058 --> 25:57.685
Graves back-hoed last night.

25:57.811 --> 26:00.396
That's four
Miguel could have chosen from.

26:18.248 --> 26:20.624
She's not here. That's one down.

26:29.259 --> 26:32.011
That blood might not even
belong to Ellen.

26:36.349 --> 26:39.268
Could be a client's blood.
Or the previous owner's.

26:44.357 --> 26:46.108
Huh.

26:57.954 --> 26:59.455
He did it.

26:59.581 --> 27:01.206
Miguel really did it.

27:02.292 --> 27:05.836
And I taught him how.
I guided him to this.

27:05.962 --> 27:07.671
I created...

27:07.797 --> 27:09.465
this.

27:09.591 --> 27:11.634
I'm sorry.

27:24.606 --> 27:27.149
(♪ Harry whistling Camptown Races)

27:32.238 --> 27:34.823
Miguel's making
his own choices now.

27:40.497 --> 27:43.207
Look who he chose.

27:50.674 --> 27:52.841
She didn't deserve this.

27:54.636 --> 27:57.346
You can say it.

27:57.472 --> 28:01.642
Won't change anything, Dex,
whether I told you so or not.

28:01.768 --> 28:03.477
Easier to accept it.

28:04.771 --> 28:07.523
Cause there'll be plenty more
where Ellen came from.

28:21.579 --> 28:23.706
No, there won't.

28:33.091 --> 28:36.343
Hey, Miguel, is it too late
to grab that lunch?

28:38.346 --> 28:41.682
So what do you think
of this George King sicko?

28:43.476 --> 28:45.310
- Skinner suspect?
- Mm-hm.

28:46.396 --> 28:48.814
I gotta go from here
to your precinct

28:48.940 --> 28:52.943
to discuss whether we're gonna
file charges against this guy.

28:54.028 --> 28:56.780
- You think he's the guy?
- He's the guy.

28:56.906 --> 28:57.948
Skinner.

28:59.117 --> 29:01.618
Well, if the law can't get him...

29:03.329 --> 29:05.956
you and I can. In fact...

29:06.082 --> 29:09.418
I could have this guy out on the streets
in a few hours.

29:11.755 --> 29:15.758
You need some help on this one,
or is this another solo project?

29:22.932 --> 29:24.933
We agreed to leave
Ellen Wolf alone.

29:25.059 --> 29:29.480
Technically, we agreed
not to kill her together. And we didn't.

29:29.606 --> 29:33.650
- Technically?
- I know. That's... That's bullshit.

29:33.777 --> 29:36.653
I didn't tell you
because I know you wouldn't approve.

29:36.780 --> 29:37.946
Cause she wasn't guilty.

29:38.072 --> 29:40.115
We have a different definition of that word.

29:40.241 --> 29:43.577
You got rid of her
because she got in your way.

29:46.664 --> 29:49.208
Whatever happened
to serving justice?

29:50.251 --> 29:52.878
Is that really why you do this, Dex?
To serve justice?

29:55.632 --> 29:58.509
- We don't have to pretend with each other.
- That's what I thought.

29:58.635 --> 30:00.385
OK.

30:02.305 --> 30:04.223
I should have told you.

30:06.643 --> 30:09.311
It was a chickenshit thing to do,
and I abused your trust...

30:09.437 --> 30:12.022
a trust, by the way,
that wasn't easy to earn.

30:12.148 --> 30:14.233
That's not lost on me.

30:15.777 --> 30:19.655
I gave you my shirt
linking me to Freebo's death.

30:19.781 --> 30:21.782
I wish I had another one
to prove to you

30:21.908 --> 30:23.909
how important
this partnership is to me.

30:24.035 --> 30:25.911
I'd take a little remorse.

30:26.037 --> 30:28.038
You would know that I don't feel it.

30:28.164 --> 30:30.499
Yeah, you'll feel it if you get caught.

30:30.625 --> 30:33.085
I didn't leave any evidence.

30:33.211 --> 30:37.089
They're just gonna think it was
one of her scumbag clients.

30:37.215 --> 30:38.882
Right.

30:40.176 --> 30:43.303
Right, just another lowlife
who beat and stabbed an innocent woman.

30:48.017 --> 30:51.186
Again, different definitions.

30:55.650 --> 30:57.234
Dex.

30:58.444 --> 31:00.362
This is the nature
of a real friendship.

31:00.488 --> 31:03.031
Hmm?

31:03.157 --> 31:04.825
We're gonna disagree.

31:04.951 --> 31:07.077
And when we do,
we just go our own way.

31:07.203 --> 31:09.204
No. No more individual projects.

31:09.330 --> 31:11.999
Individuality is what makes
America great, man.

31:12.125 --> 31:14.418
I don't think that's what
our forefathers had in mind.

31:14.544 --> 31:18.839
Look. I'm a big boy.
I know what I'm doing.

31:20.675 --> 31:22.301
Eventually...

31:23.761 --> 31:26.305
you're gonna trust that too.

31:27.307 --> 31:28.974
I'll see you over at the precinct.

31:29.100 --> 31:31.184
(Dexter) He thinks he's untouchable.

31:32.770 --> 31:35.689
He's not. It's time he learned that.

31:57.587 --> 31:59.796
Probably not a lot of leads
on that screen.

31:59.923 --> 32:01.590
King's a ghost.

32:02.550 --> 32:05.427
He grabbed Anton without
a single security camera in the area

32:05.553 --> 32:07.304
picking up him or his truck.

32:07.430 --> 32:09.431
There's not one shot
to implicate him.

32:12.435 --> 32:14.937
So we'll have to get it out of King.

32:16.272 --> 32:18.106
You gonna let Quinn do it on his own?

32:21.611 --> 32:24.571
My time is better spent here.

32:24.697 --> 32:26.740
Away from people.

32:27.784 --> 32:30.077
You know, someone,

32:30.203 --> 32:33.497
a good friend, actually,

32:33.623 --> 32:35.666
told me I had a big wall around me.

32:35.792 --> 32:38.126
I thought it made me a better cop.

32:39.963 --> 32:41.797
I don't think it did.

33:08.950 --> 33:12.077
(Dexter) They look at him
and see a defender of truth, justice,

33:12.203 --> 33:14.204
and the American way.

33:14.330 --> 33:16.915
I see a man about to learn
a hard lesson.

33:17.041 --> 33:20.252
(Batista) Tire tracks in the alley
are consistent with King's truck.

33:20.378 --> 33:23.630
And several other thousand trucks
in the Miami Metro area.

33:23.756 --> 33:26.550
King's company trims trees.

33:26.676 --> 33:29.302
Trimmed trees were found
in every one of the victims' homes.

33:29.429 --> 33:32.806
- That's the lead that nailed him.
- I don't know about nailed.

33:33.683 --> 33:35.559
The trees at my place
just got trimmed too.

33:35.685 --> 33:38.478
- But Mario Astorga...
- We're talking about a foreman.

33:38.604 --> 33:40.355
A foreman who's terrified of his boss.

33:40.481 --> 33:42.941
You can arrest my boss
on that same evidence.

33:43.067 --> 33:45.777
- He's the fucking guy.
- (Batista clears throat)

33:47.071 --> 33:50.699
- Sir.
- Miguel. May I?

33:55.204 --> 33:56.872
We really need your help on this one.

33:56.998 --> 33:59.416
And you do owe us
for getting Ramon off.

33:59.542 --> 34:03.837
I do. But I can't very well charge Mr. King
with assault on a palm tree.

34:05.256 --> 34:08.467
You have your ways, Miguel.
You've bent rules before,

34:08.593 --> 34:11.261
getting people lost in the system.

34:12.430 --> 34:15.057
We need to buy time for Anton Briggs.

34:18.644 --> 34:21.354
For you, I'll do everything in my power.

34:26.402 --> 34:28.528
We'll be right there.

34:31.741 --> 34:33.533
Show time.

34:33.659 --> 34:36.203
Dex, get your kit. You too, Masuka.

34:36.329 --> 34:38.705
- Hey, it's called off-duty.
- Not any more.

34:38.831 --> 34:42.292
You two, you stay on King.
Don't let up. We got another body.

34:44.378 --> 34:45.337
Anton?

34:45.463 --> 34:47.172
A female at the cemetery.

35:14.951 --> 35:17.285
- Cause of death?
- Take your pick.

35:17.411 --> 35:19.663
Severe beating, strangulation...

35:20.790 --> 35:22.958
plus three stab wounds.

35:25.795 --> 35:27.629
Whoever did this was not a fan.

35:27.755 --> 35:29.548
(Dexter) You have no idea.

35:29.674 --> 35:32.801
I think our killer's a pro. I haven't seen
many body dumps this clean.

35:32.927 --> 35:34.094
(Dexter) I made sure of that.

35:34.220 --> 35:37.222
Miguel getting caught
isn't part of the lesson plan.

35:37.348 --> 35:40.142
(Masuka) Angel, don't let her see this.

35:41.519 --> 35:44.771
(LaGuerta) No, they said it was her.
But it's not, is it?

35:44.897 --> 35:46.523
Maria, I'm sorry.

35:46.649 --> 35:48.942
No, I don't believe...

35:50.945 --> 35:53.488
- Oh, my God.
- Walk with me.

35:58.995 --> 36:02.205
Too many people are affected
when the innocent die.

36:02.331 --> 36:05.500
(Dexter) That is part of the lesson plan.

36:08.337 --> 36:11.423
No one is untouchable.
I learned that the hard way.

36:11.549 --> 36:12.841
So will Miguel.

36:12.967 --> 36:17.387
His own vulnerability
is about to become very real to him...

36:18.764 --> 36:20.390
after the stage show ends.

36:39.493 --> 36:42.579
- They won't find anything.
- I know.

36:42.705 --> 36:46.208
So you're just making a point.

36:47.585 --> 36:51.922
- Am I?
- We follow the code. Or else.

36:52.048 --> 36:54.257
There are a lot of other subtleties,

36:54.383 --> 36:57.886
but if that's what you've gleaned,
then yeah, that's my point.

37:05.061 --> 37:07.729
You're a wise person, aren't you?

37:09.523 --> 37:13.443
- You're being facetious.
- No, no, you have insight.

37:14.612 --> 37:17.739
I'd be a fool not to follow your lead.

37:25.039 --> 37:27.457
I think you're gonna save my life.

37:30.253 --> 37:32.420
(Dexter) Is this real?

37:32.546 --> 37:35.090
I should go make a statement
to the press.

37:36.300 --> 37:39.552
I wouldn't want anyone getting ideas
about killing lawyers.

37:46.143 --> 37:48.144
(Dexter) Lesson learned...

37:48.271 --> 37:50.313
it seems.

37:53.067 --> 37:56.152
Oh, good. Good. You're here.

37:56.279 --> 37:58.363
Come here. Taste this.

38:02.285 --> 38:03.535
This one.

38:08.457 --> 38:10.834
And now this one.

38:16.299 --> 38:17.465
Which one?

38:17.591 --> 38:20.135
I'm more in the mood for steak.

38:21.554 --> 38:23.847
No, this is for the wedding cake.

38:23.973 --> 38:26.558
We have to choose one.
Chocolate or hazelnut?

38:26.684 --> 38:28.601
Is Sylvia still here?

38:28.728 --> 38:31.521
No, because of me.

38:31.647 --> 38:33.857
I intervened.

38:33.983 --> 38:36.484
Apparently, I'm a very wise person.

38:38.738 --> 38:40.363
Apparently?

38:40.489 --> 38:45.452
According to Miguel. He came
to the open house I was sitting for Syl.

38:45.578 --> 38:48.496
- Really?
- We... We talked for a while.

38:48.622 --> 38:51.416
Actually, I talked.
I just...I gave him some insight.

38:53.753 --> 38:55.670
Insight.

38:55.796 --> 38:58.965
He said he thinks I could...

38:59.091 --> 39:00.383
(Dexter) Save his life.

39:00.509 --> 39:02.177
...save his life.

39:02.303 --> 39:04.804
Every word, bullshit.

39:04.930 --> 39:06.890
When did he start lying? With Ellen?

39:07.016 --> 39:08.850
Before her?

39:08.976 --> 39:10.393
So, chocolate?

39:10.519 --> 39:13.188
What about that shirt?

39:13.314 --> 39:15.690
The shirt.

39:17.443 --> 39:19.444
Dexter, what's wrong?

39:19.570 --> 39:22.364
I have to go look at some blood.

39:23.532 --> 39:26.701
Evidence. For a crime.

39:26.827 --> 39:28.620
Hazelnut.

39:48.557 --> 39:51.851
Maria, why don't you head home,
get some rest?

39:51.977 --> 39:53.311
I can't.

39:53.437 --> 39:56.648
I have to...do something.

39:56.774 --> 40:00.443
Sure. I'm here if you need me. OK?

40:07.493 --> 40:09.369
(Exhales)

40:14.166 --> 40:16.292
Tell me that we're close
on the Skinner.

40:16.419 --> 40:18.878
Cause this Ellen Wolf thing
is about to take over.

40:19.004 --> 40:21.131
Still running down tips,
but they're bullshit.

40:21.257 --> 40:24.050
They'll keep being bullshit
because nobody saw King take Anton.

40:24.176 --> 40:26.970
- What about Mario Astorga?
- As tight-lipped as King.

40:27.096 --> 40:28.638
Maybe I can help.

40:30.099 --> 40:34.102
She could use a win right now.
We all could.

40:34.228 --> 40:35.770
You gonna charge King?

40:35.896 --> 40:38.773
- Not with what you have.
- We release him, he's in the wind.

40:38.899 --> 40:39.858
Anton's dead.

40:39.984 --> 40:42.152
So has King asked
for legal counsel yet?

40:42.278 --> 40:44.863
King knows we have nothing on him.
Why would he waste the money?

40:44.989 --> 40:48.533
Technically, if he's not represented,
I can't walk in and offer him any deals.

40:49.910 --> 40:51.953
Not on the record, anyway.

40:52.079 --> 40:53.830
Come on. No one'll know the difference.

40:53.956 --> 40:57.542
Till a year from now, the recorded document
shows up on CNN, uh-uh.

40:57.668 --> 41:01.337
Actually, that camera's been
on the fritz.

41:03.132 --> 41:05.675
It wouldn't surprise me
if it didn't record anything.

41:26.155 --> 41:30.116
(Door opens and closes)

41:44.507 --> 41:48.426
Freebo's blood.
The link between his murder and Miguel.

41:48.552 --> 41:51.387
If I go down,
I can take Miguel with me.

41:51.514 --> 41:55.350
A mutual assurance.
A symbol of trust.

41:59.730 --> 42:01.397
- Mm-mm.
- Fuck. That's it?

42:01.524 --> 42:04.192
No way we're gonna let
that monster walk.

42:05.402 --> 42:07.403
Are we?

42:16.705 --> 42:18.414
(Dexter) I hope we meet again.

42:18.541 --> 42:21.209
I'd like to get to know you better.

42:30.928 --> 42:33.429
But how well
can you really know someone?

42:33.556 --> 42:35.640
How much do you want to know?

43:11.468 --> 43:13.928
There's gotta be something.

43:14.054 --> 43:16.973
(Sighing) All we got is Mario
who won't say shit.

43:17.099 --> 43:20.059
We could start skinning him ourselves
before he'd talk.

43:20.894 --> 43:23.271
Morgan, we're not skinning Mario.

43:24.565 --> 43:26.149
I got a better idea.

43:26.275 --> 43:28.109
Wanna share with the whole class?

43:28.235 --> 43:32.614
No, just you. I need a partner on this.

43:43.167 --> 43:45.209
Here we are. Home sweet home.

43:45.961 --> 43:49.130
It's too bad Anton won't ever get to do that.
Thanks to you.

43:53.636 --> 43:54.677
What?

43:58.307 --> 44:00.058
(Mario) Los árboles.

44:05.397 --> 44:06.356
Holy shit.

44:06.482 --> 44:08.858
- You told him I revealed things?
- We didn't tell him shit.

44:08.984 --> 44:11.694
He knew you were in holding.
He must have thought you caved.

44:11.820 --> 44:13.363
I didn't tell anyone anything.

44:13.489 --> 44:16.824
I'm sorry. We didn't mean to get
your family caught up in this, all right?

44:16.950 --> 44:21.287
- We'll do everything we can to help you.
- What can you do? Nothing!

44:22.665 --> 44:25.500
You're right. We don't even know
where this guy is.

44:28.504 --> 44:31.339
You gotta help me,
or I can't do anything to help you.

44:32.508 --> 44:35.176
- (Sighs)
- Then that's it. I'm sorry.

44:35.302 --> 44:37.929
¿Qué va a pasar? Wait!

44:38.055 --> 44:39.847
He has a building.

44:39.973 --> 44:43.559
We went through all of his holdings. There's
no record of him owning any building.

44:43.686 --> 44:46.646
He rents it with cash.
He had me go there and pay once.

44:46.772 --> 44:49.565
- He's trying to grow trees to sell.
- Where?

44:50.693 --> 44:53.194
On 164th under the highway.

44:53.320 --> 44:54.362
It's all I know.

44:56.073 --> 44:57.573
Mi familia.

44:57.700 --> 45:01.577
Go inside. Lock the door.
I'll send a patrol car. Go.

45:10.379 --> 45:12.588
It worked. Get in.

45:12.715 --> 45:14.215
Thank you.

45:42.953 --> 45:45.371
(Tires screeching)

45:59.720 --> 46:01.137
Anton!

46:01.263 --> 46:02.805
Anton, are you in there?

46:02.931 --> 46:05.057
- (Banging)
- Anton?

46:05.476 --> 46:07.602
Watch out.

46:10.606 --> 46:12.690
Fuck restraint. Here.

46:12.816 --> 46:14.942
(Car engine starts)

46:17.154 --> 46:18.654
Morgan! Get out of the way.

46:27.664 --> 46:29.582
(Groaning)

46:32.586 --> 46:35.129
- (Moans)
- It's me. It's OK.

46:35.255 --> 46:36.839
You're safe.

46:38.592 --> 46:40.676
(Moans)

46:45.891 --> 46:50.061
I need an ambulance
at the 164 and the 94 ASAP.

46:50.187 --> 46:52.522
Get an APB out on George King.

46:54.233 --> 46:57.401
You found me. You found me.

46:58.445 --> 47:01.197
You can't get away from me
that easily.

47:09.706 --> 47:11.791
(♪ Whistling Camptown Races)

47:30.811 --> 47:32.019
(Computer beeps)

47:32.145 --> 47:34.605
(Dexter) And the results are...

47:34.731 --> 47:37.066
(Door opens)

47:38.902 --> 47:40.903
Maria.

47:53.375 --> 47:54.917
Come on. I'll take you home.

47:56.628 --> 47:58.504
I can't go home.

48:00.841 --> 48:02.925
There's too much silence.

48:09.516 --> 48:11.559
I know.

48:15.564 --> 48:19.567
You don't want to have to think
about what she went through.

48:19.693 --> 48:21.944
- Only to realize that she's really gone.
- Don't.

48:22.070 --> 48:25.072
- Pero, corazón, she's gone.
- Don't.

48:25.198 --> 48:26.949
OK?

48:27.701 --> 48:31.078
And that's gonna hurt like hell.
I know that too.

48:33.123 --> 48:35.207
But you have friends.

48:35.334 --> 48:37.418
Hey, hey, hey.

48:40.547 --> 48:42.506
You got me.

48:43.717 --> 48:46.052
I'm right here.

48:46.178 --> 48:49.388
OK? I'm right here for you.

48:49.514 --> 48:51.682
To get you through.

48:52.517 --> 48:54.101
My, my, my.

48:54.227 --> 48:55.978
(Sobs)

49:06.740 --> 49:09.575
(Dexter) It's not Freebo's blood.
It's not even human.

49:09.701 --> 49:12.119
It's bovine. Cow's blood.

49:13.580 --> 49:16.415
He's been using me the whole time.

49:16.541 --> 49:19.627
I didn't create a monster,
I was used by one.

49:19.753 --> 49:22.421
He used me.

49:25.175 --> 49:27.176
(Dexter screams)

49:32.933 --> 49:35.518
Miguel!

49:36.645 --> 49:38.688
Nine holes tomorrow?

49:40.607 --> 49:41.816
You bet.

49:52.411 --> 49:55.663
(Dexter) Today I keep up the pretence.

49:55.789 --> 49:58.499
But soon, maybe tomorrow,

49:58.625 --> 50:01.752
Miguel will know exactly how I feel

50:01.878 --> 50:05.756
because finally there's
an emotion I don't have to fake.

50:05.882 --> 50:09.802
Today, I feel something real.
