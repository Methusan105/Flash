WEBVTT

00:03.008 --> 00:04.800
PreviousIy on Dexter...

00:04.926 --> 00:06.927
We need to go after the root cause,

00:07.053 --> 00:09.722
this bloodsucking,
soulless defense attorney Ellen Wolf!

00:09.848 --> 00:12.558
Has she, uh, ever actually killed anyone?

00:12.684 --> 00:13.934
Keep an open mind about her.

00:14.060 --> 00:15.894
Miguel's on his way over here right now.

00:16.021 --> 00:19.148
I know one side of him.
Maybe there's more.

00:19.274 --> 00:22.693
Missing evidence, witness intimidation,
jury tampering.

00:22.819 --> 00:25.654
- You got proof?
- He's a bad guy. He's not a stupid guy.

00:25.780 --> 00:26.739
I'm pregnant.

00:26.865 --> 00:28.699
They say this part should pass soon.

00:30.827 --> 00:32.828
This isn't some kind of weird end run, is it?

00:32.954 --> 00:34.913
Make me see how sensitive
you really are?

00:35.040 --> 00:36.874
- I'm not all that sensitive.
- Yeah, you are.

00:38.293 --> 00:41.754
Someone loaned Freebo some money
and is willing to skin people to get it back.

00:41.880 --> 00:44.298
Which is why I want to use
our CI more aggressively.

00:44.424 --> 00:45.424
Wait. You mean Anton?

00:45.550 --> 00:48.427
Yeah, we're gonna spread the word
that Anton knows where Freebo is.

00:48.553 --> 00:49.678
You're gonna use him as bait?

00:49.804 --> 00:52.347
Which means that the Skinner
will be looking for me.

00:52.474 --> 00:53.557
Am I being set up?

00:54.100 --> 00:56.143
I found the fucking lead
on the Skinner case, OK?

00:56.269 --> 00:59.063
(Debra) The Skinner is using tree-trimming
as a cover for surveillance.

00:59.189 --> 01:02.566
He watches from the trees
and when the time is right, he grabs them.

01:03.068 --> 01:04.234
I know what you did for me.

01:05.612 --> 01:07.029
I will be your bait.

01:08.239 --> 01:10.449
So you told Quinn I was investigating him.

01:10.575 --> 01:13.160
Hey, you're the one who fucked him.
Not my fault he didn't want an encore.

01:13.286 --> 01:16.121
A cop's dead cause Quinn
cut all the wrong corners.

01:16.247 --> 01:17.581
Next dead cop's on you.

01:18.625 --> 01:20.751
What did it feel like to end his life?

01:20.877 --> 01:22.252
Felt like justice.

01:22.378 --> 01:25.714
We're like-minded.
Together we can make a difference.

03:25.168 --> 03:27.961
(Dexter) lt's said that everything
is connected to everything.

03:28.087 --> 03:30.672
The butterfly effect.

03:30.798 --> 03:34.134
You drop a pebble into a pond
and the rippIes radiate outwards,

03:34.260 --> 03:36.803
touching and affecting everything.

03:38.223 --> 03:43.268
UntiI finaIIy a fish grows arms and Iegs
and crawls out of the water.

03:43.394 --> 03:46.480
And picks up a rock and smashes
the next two fish over the head.

03:46.606 --> 03:49.316
And we have the first serial killer.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.069
Mm.

03:53.780 --> 03:56.240
This is good pizza.

03:56.366 --> 03:59.618
- What channel's ESPN over here?
- Uh...

03:59.744 --> 04:02.496
I think it's a big number.

04:04.123 --> 04:06.208
Yeah, there you go.

04:07.502 --> 04:09.920
(Commentator) And now we got Gary
going the other way. Trying to get in.

04:10.046 --> 04:11.129
Oh!

04:11.256 --> 04:14.174
No way! That's not a foul, man!

04:14.300 --> 04:17.678
That was definitely wrong
what that guy did.

04:18.346 --> 04:21.390
You're clearly not a sports fan, are you?

04:21.516 --> 04:22.849
Not really.

04:22.976 --> 04:25.018
l'm more of a NationaI Geographic
kinda guy.

04:25.144 --> 04:27.604
Sharks, bears, the occasional penguin.

04:27.730 --> 04:31.942
- You do have other interests, though.
- Yeah, I suppose I do.

04:34.153 --> 04:36.029
Speaking of which...

04:38.992 --> 04:41.118
Uh-uh. Boundaries.

04:43.371 --> 04:44.830
Yeah, it's encrypted.

04:44.956 --> 04:46.999
Oh, yeah, that's right. Trust issues.

04:47.125 --> 04:49.960
(Dexter) Mm-hm.

04:55.675 --> 04:58.677
- Football.
- See? You do know your sports.

04:58.803 --> 05:03.765
This guy right here. Billy Fleeter.

05:04.767 --> 05:08.061
- Should I know him?
- Not yet, but hopefully you will.

05:08.187 --> 05:10.605
This was from maybe five years ago.

05:10.732 --> 05:14.026
He never went pro.
Drug problem. Turned to gambling.

05:14.152 --> 05:16.320
Unfortunately, he wasn't very good at it.

05:16.446 --> 05:19.948
More than once he's paid his debts off
to his bookies by working as an enforcer.

05:20.074 --> 05:21.199
Breaking fingers?

05:21.326 --> 05:23.952
Crushing skulls with a baseball bat.

05:24.078 --> 05:29.207
I went after him a few years ago, but, uh,
I just couldn't get the evidence.

05:29.334 --> 05:33.462
I had to tell the children
of a 70-year-old man that he had just killed,

05:33.588 --> 05:35.630
that there was nothing we could do.

05:36.841 --> 05:39.718
So here it comes.
MigueI wants me to kiII him.

05:39.844 --> 05:41.261
I don't want you to kill him.

05:41.387 --> 05:42.554
No?

05:44.849 --> 05:46.683
I wanna do it.

05:47.643 --> 05:48.685
You.

05:48.811 --> 05:52.189
I've let you do all of the heavy lifting so far.
Now it's my turn.

05:53.691 --> 05:55.317
I'm ready to get my hands dirty.

06:02.784 --> 06:05.243
It's one thing
to Iet MigueI provide a IittIe backup,

06:05.370 --> 06:07.871
another thing to share the reins with him.

06:07.997 --> 06:10.248
I'm gonna need your help, Dexter.

06:11.542 --> 06:13.085
Not a good idea.

06:15.088 --> 06:17.672
Just, uh, think about it.

06:19.300 --> 06:22.386
No, Dexter,
don't think about it.

06:24.389 --> 06:28.225
The waffle is a lot like the pancake,
only square.

06:28.351 --> 06:29.810
Why is it square?

06:29.936 --> 06:32.479
Because it was invented
by Simon P Waffle

06:32.605 --> 06:35.482
and he liked to stack his waffles in boxes,

06:35.608 --> 06:38.026
and that's just easier to do
if they're square.

06:38.861 --> 06:40.028
You're making that up.

06:40.154 --> 06:42.989
I'm hurt that you would even think that.

06:43.116 --> 06:45.617
Oh, God, Dexter,
you're making a mess.

06:45.743 --> 06:48.453
- That's OK. We'll clean it up.
- It's not the point.

06:49.789 --> 06:51.706
- What is the point?
- I don't know.

06:51.833 --> 06:55.043
The point is not to make
a mess to begin with.

06:55.169 --> 06:58.004
Rita's pregnancy hormones seem to be
ganging up on us this morning.

06:58.131 --> 07:00.424
How come there are no English muffins left?

07:00.550 --> 07:02.968
Uh, I think you ate
the last one yesterday. Waffle?

07:03.094 --> 07:04.970
(Sighs) That's disgusting.

07:05.096 --> 07:06.513
Cody, you need a haircut.

07:06.639 --> 07:10.267
Let's see...
four, five, six more months till she delivers.

07:10.393 --> 07:13.562
- Rita, are you OK?
- No, I'm not OK.

07:13.688 --> 07:16.481
I'm starting a newjob
and I'm planning a wedding all by myself.

07:16.607 --> 07:17.816
What can I do to help?

07:17.942 --> 07:20.652
It's not like you can pick out the DJ.

07:20.778 --> 07:23.655
Last time I got into your car,
your radio was tuned to marching music.

07:23.781 --> 07:25.073
It helps me think.

07:25.199 --> 07:28.326
And it's not like you can pick the florist
or the caterer or even the wedding bands.

07:28.453 --> 07:30.495
I could pick the wedding bands.

07:30.621 --> 07:32.998
Right. Like the engagement ring
you never gave me.

07:33.124 --> 07:35.625
- You said you didn't want one.
- I don't want one.

07:38.254 --> 07:39.838
Who drank all the orange juice?

07:45.803 --> 07:48.180
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

07:50.183 --> 07:53.685
- You have like no hot water in your shower.
- Right.

07:55.313 --> 07:57.189
- I told you to wait, remember?
- I can't wait.

07:57.315 --> 07:59.691
Some of us have jobs to get to.

07:59.817 --> 08:01.526
I'm a musician. I work nights.

08:01.652 --> 08:04.279
Yeah, and what do you do
with the rest of your day?

08:04.405 --> 08:06.281
You take a nap, you watch cartoons.

08:06.407 --> 08:07.866
Jack off.

08:07.992 --> 08:11.119
- Oh, I rarely watch cartoons.
- Fucking hilarious.

08:11.245 --> 08:12.996
Mm.

08:16.042 --> 08:19.252
Well, you better not be writing
any more songs about me.

08:19.378 --> 08:20.837
Most ladies would be flattered.

08:21.547 --> 08:23.548
Well, most ladies aren't cops.

08:24.592 --> 08:26.801
Oh, right, right.

08:46.364 --> 08:47.989
I gotta go.

08:49.617 --> 08:50.700
Yeah, OK.

08:52.828 --> 08:54.246
Come get these.

08:54.372 --> 08:56.039
Yeah.

09:02.713 --> 09:04.089
Freebo's dead,

09:04.215 --> 09:07.092
and now there's a tree-trimmers'
convention in here.

09:07.218 --> 09:09.719
lt seems random, but it's not.

09:09.845 --> 09:12.430
The butterfly effect again.

09:12.557 --> 09:16.142
Of course, it's an odd sensation
when you happen to be the butterfly.

09:16.269 --> 09:18.478
And if I were to heIp MigueI
kill Billy Fleeter,

09:18.604 --> 09:21.439
who knows the effect
that would have on the world?

09:21.566 --> 09:24.234
ls this the beginning
of a whole new level of friendship?

09:25.570 --> 09:27.529
ls it the end of life as l know it?

09:29.740 --> 09:33.243
Mr. King. We met at the scene
of our second victim, is that correct?

09:33.369 --> 09:34.619
Yes, that is correct.

09:34.745 --> 09:37.664
Have you ever worked
at any of these addresses?

09:38.916 --> 09:41.251
No, no, see, these are cityjobs.

09:41.377 --> 09:42.961
I'm a private contractor.

09:43.087 --> 09:45.797
OK, well, I'm gonna need
a list of all of your employees.

09:45.923 --> 09:48.508
I can get you a copy
of my payroll records.

09:48.634 --> 09:49.801
That would be a big help.

09:49.927 --> 09:53.763
- How soon do you need this?
- Ten minutes ago would be great.

09:53.889 --> 09:55.390
- Very well.
- Thank you.

10:01.981 --> 10:03.732
(Bell dings)

10:10.239 --> 10:13.116
Looks like someone got lucky last night.

10:13.242 --> 10:16.745
Uh, let's just say that Barbara and I
have taken it to the next level.

10:16.871 --> 10:19.748
You know that now you've done the deed,
she's gonna be taking notes,

10:19.874 --> 10:23.460
making a checklist of your every move,
to see if you're relationship material.

10:23.586 --> 10:25.253
That's not true. Wait, is it?

10:25.379 --> 10:28.214
Well, it's not like
we write anything down.

10:28.341 --> 10:31.217
It's...more of a mental process.

10:34.972 --> 10:36.514
Morning, Loo.

10:36.641 --> 10:38.183
Third day in a row of this, huh?

10:38.309 --> 10:40.685
Let's hope something
shakes loose on this. Come here.

10:40.811 --> 10:44.439
- Uh, I have a favor to ask you, OK?
- Shoot.

10:44.565 --> 10:48.485
I gotta go to that peace officers
association thing tomorrow night.

10:48.611 --> 10:51.237
You wanna... You wanna be my date?

10:52.865 --> 10:55.825
Maria, um, thank you for the invite.

10:55.951 --> 10:59.663
But I have plans. And if I bail,
I don't think it's gonna go over too well.

11:00.623 --> 11:03.249
Like that. Huh.

11:03.376 --> 11:06.461
- OK. Good for you.
- OK.

11:10.675 --> 11:13.843
ReIationships are compIicated.

11:13.969 --> 11:16.888
Letting MigueI kiII FIeeter
wouId be a gambIe.

11:17.014 --> 11:19.808
This guy's a gambler.
Look where it got him.

11:19.934 --> 11:23.144
Something to consider when MigueI and I
do our research tonight at the casino.

11:34.198 --> 11:36.116
How'd you find out about this place?

11:36.242 --> 11:37.409
Research.

11:37.535 --> 11:39.661
Always a first good step, right?

11:41.622 --> 11:43.415
Move a little closer?

11:43.541 --> 11:46.167
Tonight is just about watching,
learning his routine.

11:46.293 --> 11:49.087
Where does he go and when,
what does he do when he gets there.

11:49.213 --> 11:51.172
- OK.
- Later, we'll meet him.

11:51.298 --> 11:53.133
We?

11:54.218 --> 11:56.177
Yeah, we'll see how it goes.

11:56.303 --> 12:00.056
Right now, we don't want him to notice us.
We don't want anyone to notice us.

12:00.182 --> 12:02.934
Cameras all over the place.

12:03.060 --> 12:06.646
Number one rule of the code
is "don't get caught".

12:06.772 --> 12:08.189
Code? What code?

12:09.066 --> 12:11.109
How much do l tell him?

12:11.235 --> 12:13.653
It's just a series of precautions.

12:13.779 --> 12:15.530
Learned where?

12:18.159 --> 12:20.910
- Common sense mostly.
- A little more than that.

12:21.036 --> 12:24.038
- Well, my dad was a cop.
- Right. So he taught you...

12:24.165 --> 12:25.832
What cops look for in an investigation.

12:25.958 --> 12:28.251
Oh, and so you work it backwards
from there, right?

12:28.377 --> 12:32.088
Plus I spend all day looking at other
people's mistakes. You pick things up.

12:32.214 --> 12:34.090
I'm sure.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.761
(Harry) Am l forgetting something, Dexter?

12:37.887 --> 12:39.471
Was there one final lesson

12:39.597 --> 12:43.808
where I said, "Go now, far and wide,
and preach the code, my son"?

12:43.934 --> 12:45.477
I don't think so.

12:47.855 --> 12:52.025
So when you popped Anton for drug
possession, was it just pot, was it coke...?

12:52.151 --> 12:55.195
- What was it?
- Uh, pot, I think.

12:55.321 --> 12:59.449
Right. It couldn't have been anything too
serious or you wouldn't have made him a CI.

12:59.575 --> 13:00.950
I guess.

13:01.076 --> 13:03.870
- You're just full of answers today.
- No, it's...

13:03.996 --> 13:07.665
I just busted guys like him every day.
I don't remember.

13:08.292 --> 13:12.629
- And it's all written down somewhere.
- Right. CI files.

13:21.764 --> 13:22.764
(Anton) HeIIo?

13:22.890 --> 13:24.474
Hey, lazy, hope I'm waking you up.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.268
Hey, lazy?
I haven't been to bed yet.

13:27.394 --> 13:30.980
Look, I need your CI number.
l'm gonna file a status report.

13:31.106 --> 13:32.315
What's a CI number?

13:32.441 --> 13:35.443
Your assigned
confidential informant number.

13:35.569 --> 13:37.445
It should be on your paychecks.

13:38.823 --> 13:40.323
What checks?

13:40.449 --> 13:43.076
HeIIo, your paychecks from the county.

13:43.202 --> 13:47.831
Hello, I don't get any paychecks.
Quinn always pays me in cash.

13:49.834 --> 13:53.670
Oh. OK. I'll get it from him, then.

13:58.217 --> 14:00.635
My client was supposed
to be sent to County yesterday.

14:00.761 --> 14:04.556
Apparently he was, but then they put him
on the next bus back here in the afternoon.

14:04.682 --> 14:08.351
- I've been chasing him all over the place.
- We shouldn't have those mix-ups.

14:08.477 --> 14:11.563
Is it a mix-up,
or is Miguel fucking with me?

14:11.689 --> 14:13.398
Ever since I started looking into him,

14:13.524 --> 14:16.276
he's been going out of his way
to make my job harder.

14:16.402 --> 14:18.111
Well, you knew that was gonna happen.

14:18.237 --> 14:20.196
Doesn't mean I can't bitch about it.

14:21.532 --> 14:23.825
Oh, anyway, I should go see my client

14:23.951 --> 14:28.246
and ask what perfectly logical reason he had
for lighting his ex-wife's house on fire.

14:28.372 --> 14:29.914
Oh, I wanted to ask you.

14:30.040 --> 14:35.211
Any chance you'd go to a police
charity function with me tomorrow night?

14:35.337 --> 14:36.796
Hmm?

14:36.922 --> 14:40.133
Room full of cops?
I can't imagine anything more fun.

14:41.260 --> 14:42.594
Shouldn't have asked.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.220
I'm kidding. I'd love to go.

14:47.141 --> 14:51.728
OK, next on your list, Mr. King,
Santiago Ramirez.

14:51.854 --> 14:54.772
He no longer works for me.
That didn't end so well.

14:54.899 --> 14:56.941
- Why?
- He was run over.

14:58.485 --> 15:01.362
Uh, Mario Astorga. Didn't I talk to him?

15:01.488 --> 15:04.198
Yes, if you remember, he's the one
who found the body of that man.

15:04.325 --> 15:05.491
Right. Second victim.

15:05.618 --> 15:09.579
- Mario's one of my best foremen.
- So he's a good guy?

15:10.497 --> 15:12.790
What, he's not a good guy?

15:14.960 --> 15:17.337
He has a temper. He gets very angry.

15:17.463 --> 15:19.464
Keep going.

15:19.590 --> 15:22.050
I knew his family back in Nicaragua.

15:22.176 --> 15:24.093
We're both from San Marcos.

15:24.219 --> 15:26.346
- But Mario had to leave.
- Why?

15:28.223 --> 15:30.058
The police were looking for him.

15:30.184 --> 15:33.061
I heard he killed someone with a knife.

15:36.231 --> 15:38.524
Do you know where I can find Mario?

15:38.651 --> 15:41.986
I don't know where he lives.
But tomorrow, he'll be at Bayside Park.

15:42.112 --> 15:44.197
- You sure?
- I make the schedule.

15:49.286 --> 15:53.665
Fleeter pays off his gambling debts
by eIiminating peopIe for his bookie.

15:53.791 --> 15:56.292
A schoolteacher here,
a mother of two there.

15:56.418 --> 15:58.002
PeopIe who can't settIe their debts.

15:58.128 --> 16:01.214
Sending a message to others, "Pay up."

16:01.340 --> 16:05.510
Do I heIp MigueI move forward on this,
or do I Iisten to Harry and shut it down?

16:05.636 --> 16:07.637
(Cellphone buzzes)

16:08.764 --> 16:10.139
Hey, you.

16:10.265 --> 16:13.559
Yeah, I just heard a love song on the radio
that reminded me of you.

16:13.686 --> 16:14.978
Oh, that's sweet.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.397
- And it made me reaIIy angry.
- Oh.

16:17.523 --> 16:19.482
So have you gotten the wedding bands yet?

16:19.608 --> 16:22.485
Um, I'm still doing my research,
but I'm on it.

16:22.611 --> 16:23.903
(Sighs)

16:24.029 --> 16:26.155
I gotta go.

16:33.998 --> 16:37.125
Hey, you know anything
about wedding rings?

16:38.502 --> 16:42.171
Yeah. Wedding rings and nuclear fission
are like my secret specialties.

16:43.507 --> 16:44.966
Thanks.

16:45.092 --> 16:46.843
Your brother's kind of a dweeb, huh?

16:46.969 --> 16:49.178
You say anything more about my brother

16:49.304 --> 16:52.181
and I will kick your fucking nuts
down your throat.

16:52.307 --> 16:54.976
That doesn't even make
any sense.

16:56.770 --> 17:00.356
So, hey, Anton doesn't have any priors,

17:00.482 --> 17:03.359
you pay him in cash,
and I can't find him in the CI database.

17:03.485 --> 17:05.278
Should be in there.

17:05.404 --> 17:07.572
What are you hiding?

17:08.657 --> 17:10.575
Anton is not officially a CI.

17:11.869 --> 17:14.120
- What do you mean?
- Come here for a second.

17:19.084 --> 17:22.253
Look, it was just easier for both of us.

17:22.379 --> 17:26.090
I never filed an arrest report on him
so he has no police record.

17:26.216 --> 17:29.927
I did him a favor. Plus, it saved me
the hassle of all that paperwork.

17:30.054 --> 17:32.930
You have got to be fucking kidding me.

17:34.391 --> 17:36.726
We used him as bait.

17:36.852 --> 17:40.688
He was putting his life at risk, and he was
under no legal obligation to help us.

17:40.814 --> 17:42.982
No, there was just no paperwork, that's all.

17:43.108 --> 17:45.777
Not to mention that,
because he's not officially a CI,

17:45.903 --> 17:48.154
there's no end date
to when he's done working for us

17:48.280 --> 17:49.572
so you can just string him along
as long as you want to.

17:49.698 --> 17:54.452
What are you getting so upset about?
What, are you in love with the guy?

17:54.578 --> 17:56.204
No, I'm not in love with him.

17:57.831 --> 17:59.332
But you're sleeping with him.

18:00.250 --> 18:03.211
Jesus Christ, do you know what kind
of a bonehead mistake that is?

18:03.337 --> 18:06.130
Sleeping with an informant?
That'll screw up your career.

18:06.256 --> 18:09.008
- He's not an informant. You just said it.
- But you didn't know.

18:09.134 --> 18:12.720
- Either way, it makes you look stupid.
- You don't get to lecture me, asshole.

18:12.846 --> 18:16.766
Anton could so easily file a huge lawsuit
against the police department

18:16.892 --> 18:19.060
once he finds out how you fucked him over!

18:19.186 --> 18:21.104
If someone told him.

18:22.106 --> 18:23.564
Of course I'm gonna tell him.

18:23.690 --> 18:27.026
You'll sell out a cop
for some dope you're fucking?

18:29.154 --> 18:32.490
That's not half as bad as being responsible
for another cop dying

18:32.616 --> 18:34.909
because you don't like to play by the rules.

18:36.954 --> 18:38.204
What?

18:38.330 --> 18:41.124
Yuki told me.

18:42.167 --> 18:44.836
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

18:57.391 --> 18:59.100
Despite Harry's warnings,

18:59.226 --> 19:02.311
here l am with Miguel,
outside BiIIy FIeeter's house.

19:11.155 --> 19:14.699
If I'm gonna stop this,
it's gonna have to be soon.

19:14.825 --> 19:17.535
Are you sure you want to do this?
It's breaking and entering.

19:17.661 --> 19:20.496
- But you know that.
- Yes, I do. Let's go.

19:21.832 --> 19:23.875
Here, put these on.

19:25.669 --> 19:27.545
(Laughs)

19:27.671 --> 19:30.298
Forensics guy who always has
latex gloves on him.

19:30.424 --> 19:32.341
No one would ever think twice, huh?

19:34.261 --> 19:36.345
I guess you're right.

19:42.853 --> 19:46.189
I don't want MigueI to see
how easy this is for me.

19:47.941 --> 19:50.526
Uh, you want me to try?

19:52.029 --> 19:53.863
No, I think I...

19:55.782 --> 19:57.658
I got it.

20:03.707 --> 20:05.791
So what are we looking for?

20:05.918 --> 20:08.711
Proof. That he's guilty.

20:08.837 --> 20:15.092
We know he bludgeons people to death,
so look for something...bludgeony.

20:22.893 --> 20:26.062
Uh, this looks like it's been
knocked around some.

20:29.483 --> 20:31.108
Hold it up.

20:37.783 --> 20:38.950
Purple?

20:39.076 --> 20:40.451
Ergo...

20:40.577 --> 20:41.702
Blood.

20:41.828 --> 20:43.412
How easy is this?

20:43.538 --> 20:47.708
I'll test it against the blood of his
alleged victims. Let you know later today.

20:47.834 --> 20:50.044
You know it takes me two days
to get a search warrant,

20:50.170 --> 20:51.921
then another day
to catalogue evidence,

20:52.047 --> 20:54.173
and then a week before I can
get the lab results.

20:54.299 --> 20:56.467
This is definitely the way to go.

20:56.593 --> 20:59.553
We also need to make sure
that he's likely to kill again.

20:59.680 --> 21:03.557
- Why is that?
- It's just one of the rules.

21:03.684 --> 21:07.186
One of these days I'm gonna make you sit
down and write out all these rules for me.

21:07.312 --> 21:09.397
He-He kills whenever he needs money.

21:09.523 --> 21:12.149
That's how he pays off
his debts to the bookie.

21:12.276 --> 21:15.486
Dex, I've tried a lot of these gamblers
before, and they all keep records.

21:15.612 --> 21:20.116
They're, like, anal about their numbers.
There's got to be, like, a ledger somewhere.

21:20.242 --> 21:23.286
Maybe there's a hidden wall safe
or something.

21:23.412 --> 21:26.831
We're talking about the man who leaves
his murder weapon in an umbrella stand.

21:26.957 --> 21:29.125
You're right.
What if we don't find anything?

21:29.251 --> 21:31.127
Then we don't move forward.

21:42.597 --> 21:46.392
(Harry) Leave it, Dex.
Just put it back.

21:46.518 --> 21:50.479
You can stop this right now.
Call it off.

21:50.605 --> 21:52.481
Why should I call it off?

21:52.607 --> 21:56.652
I didn't teach you the code
to share with your buddies.

21:56.778 --> 21:58.863
I taught you the code
to keep you alive.

21:58.989 --> 22:02.033
You don't get to have friends, Dexter.

22:02.159 --> 22:05.036
Nothing good can come out of this.

22:05.162 --> 22:07.455
(Miguel) Hey, Dex, you know what?

22:07.581 --> 22:09.957
I don't think we're gonna
find anything here, man.

22:10.083 --> 22:12.209
(Laughing) Look at you.

22:12.336 --> 22:14.086
It's my Iife, Dad.

22:14.212 --> 22:15.588
30 grand in the hole.

22:15.714 --> 22:18.174
I think we know how he's gonna pay that off.

22:22.721 --> 22:24.555
So, look, we moving forward?

22:24.681 --> 22:27.058
Yeah, moving forward.

22:27.184 --> 22:28.976
If the blood matches.

22:32.606 --> 22:35.483
I can't believe we are just now
sending out invitations.

22:35.609 --> 22:36.817
This is so last-minute.

22:36.943 --> 22:39.403
It's OK. There's plenty of time.

22:39.529 --> 22:40.780
And Dexter's no help.

22:40.906 --> 22:43.616
I asked him for menu suggestions -
do you know what he says?

22:43.742 --> 22:45.201
I don't know.

22:45.327 --> 22:47.828
Steak. He says steak.

22:47.954 --> 22:50.831
Yeah, that's great, Dexter.
That's really great.

22:50.957 --> 22:53.250
We'll start with a steak appetizer,

22:53.377 --> 22:56.670
followed by steak salad,
followed, of course, by a steak.

22:56.797 --> 23:00.216
And then, of course, it'll all be topped off
by a steak fucking cake.

23:00.634 --> 23:01.801
Rita.

23:02.427 --> 23:04.553
- Rita.
- What?

23:04.679 --> 23:07.223
The envelope.
You're making a mess.

23:09.559 --> 23:11.102
Oh...

23:11.228 --> 23:12.686
Shit.

23:12.813 --> 23:16.816
Why don't you stuff for a while?
I'll do the addresses.

23:16.942 --> 23:19.026
OK.

23:24.908 --> 23:26.450
I've got big news.

23:26.576 --> 23:29.078
Yeah, about the Skinner?

23:30.247 --> 23:31.539
No, about you.

23:35.544 --> 23:36.669
You're free.

23:36.795 --> 23:39.380
Oh, yeah, ever since Abe Lincoln.

23:39.506 --> 23:41.882
I mean from the police department.

23:44.928 --> 23:47.596
You're no longer a CI.

23:49.057 --> 23:52.351
Wait a second. The way Quinn
explained it was, that if I play ball,

23:52.477 --> 23:55.813
it would knock down my felony possession
to a misdemeanor,

23:55.939 --> 23:58.149
and if I worked hard enough,
it would go away altogether.

23:58.275 --> 24:00.734
Well, it's gone away.

24:03.738 --> 24:05.614
Hmm, how's that?

24:08.452 --> 24:09.994
Clerical error.

24:10.120 --> 24:12.329
The necessary papers were never filed,

24:12.456 --> 24:15.374
so there were never any charges
for you to work off.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.835
So I've been doing all this shit
when I didn't have to?

24:17.961 --> 24:19.837
Just be glad you don't
have to do it any more.

24:19.963 --> 24:21.589
Hmm.

24:23.592 --> 24:26.177
Well, thank you.

24:28.305 --> 24:30.389
And I want to put protective detail on you.

24:30.515 --> 24:32.558
What? No. No, Debra.

24:32.684 --> 24:34.685
- Anton.
- Listen. You said I'm free,

24:34.811 --> 24:36.604
so I'm free of this.

24:36.730 --> 24:39.023
- So we should celebrate.
- Dinner tonight.

24:39.149 --> 24:41.734
Mm, no, I'm working tonight.

24:41.860 --> 24:43.694
How about we celebrate now?

24:43.820 --> 24:46.030
- I've got to go back to work.
- (Laughs)

24:46.156 --> 24:47.907
Tomorrow. Breakfast.

24:49.826 --> 24:51.285
Perfect.

24:52.245 --> 24:54.663
(Miguel) So I'm guessing
we got a blood match, huh?

24:54.789 --> 24:56.999
(Dexter) That's why we're here.

24:59.794 --> 25:01.253
Life vests?

25:01.379 --> 25:04.256
We can't exactly load up the cart
with axes and machetes, can we?

25:04.382 --> 25:06.050
Exactly right.

25:06.176 --> 25:09.845
So, um, have you given any thought
as to how you want to do this?

25:09.971 --> 25:13.057
Mm-hm.
Small-caliber gun to the head.

25:13.183 --> 25:14.642
Coge.

25:14.768 --> 25:16.810
Then I walk away.

25:16.937 --> 25:19.313
- That happens all the time.
- Guns make noise.

25:19.439 --> 25:22.775
And they leave evidence behind -
bullets, casings, powder residue.

25:22.901 --> 25:25.444
- Not to mention the body.
- OK.

25:25.570 --> 25:27.196
You don't want to create a crime scene.

25:27.322 --> 25:29.740
It's where experts like me
gather evidence against you.

25:29.866 --> 25:31.325
OK, OK. I get it, I get it.

25:31.451 --> 25:33.452
What do you suggest?

25:37.749 --> 25:39.875
Up close and personal.

25:41.711 --> 25:45.548
Hey, in case we have
to tie anybody up.

25:48.176 --> 25:51.428
I'm gonna put together
a starter kit for you.

26:12.909 --> 26:14.493
Hey, you're gettin' better.

26:14.619 --> 26:16.495
Yeah, what do you know?

26:22.377 --> 26:28.257
What better pIace to gambIe on MigueI
than a room full of...games of chance?

26:28.383 --> 26:30.676
Where slot machines go to die, huh?

26:31.720 --> 26:33.596
And at least one gambler.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.732
I think that's it.

26:46.359 --> 26:49.903
- Now we pick up Mr. Fleeter.
- You ever drop a quart of milk?

26:50.030 --> 26:53.073
Watch it spread over the whole
kitchen floor, the mess it makes?

26:53.199 --> 26:54.825
Yeah.

26:54.951 --> 26:58.287
There's six quarts of blood in the
human body. This isn't gonna be pretty.

27:00.582 --> 27:02.124
There's no shame in backing out.

27:03.001 --> 27:06.503
Dex, after 14 years of filing briefs,

27:06.630 --> 27:09.298
trying cases,
and dealing with bullshit...

27:11.051 --> 27:13.636
this is all gonna look
nice and neat in comparison.

27:21.186 --> 27:25.689
I have been to some lame-ass
rubber chicken dinners in my day, OK?

27:25.815 --> 27:28.776
- I know, I know.
- A no-host bar is punishment enough,

27:28.902 --> 27:30.235
but no bar at all is cruel.

27:30.362 --> 27:31.779
And unusual.

27:31.905 --> 27:34.490
- All right, I'm buying the first round.
- Thank you.

27:34.616 --> 27:35.866
That's pretty.

27:35.992 --> 27:37.493
Gift from my first husband.

27:37.619 --> 27:39.953
(Laughing) Nice, nice.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.955
You're handsome!

27:42.082 --> 27:44.541
Dire ethanol emergency here.

27:44.668 --> 27:46.043
What'll it be, ladies?

27:46.169 --> 27:47.878
Uh, Cuba libre for this one.

27:48.004 --> 27:49.254
Gracias.

27:49.381 --> 27:51.882
And a double Scotch,
neat soda back, pourmoi.

27:52.008 --> 27:53.884
Very nice.

27:54.010 --> 27:56.887
Mm. Huh.

27:57.013 --> 27:58.931
- Easy.
- (Laughs)

27:59.057 --> 28:03.727
And who was that guy, that suit and haircut
sitting next to you that wouldn't shut up?

28:03.853 --> 28:09.316
Oh, the, um, the senior liaison
for the Greater Mi... Who knows?

28:09.442 --> 28:13.153
What's sad is that this is the only
social event I've been to in six months.

28:13.279 --> 28:15.239
Oh, that doesn't qualify as a social event.

28:15.365 --> 28:17.282
(Both laugh)

28:17.409 --> 28:18.951
OK.

28:19.077 --> 28:21.328
Can I get you anything else?

28:21.454 --> 28:27.209
Yeah, how about a foot massage
with those big, gorgeous hands of yours?

28:29.546 --> 28:32.089
They're kind of cold from scooping ice.

28:32.215 --> 28:33.340
Mm.

28:33.466 --> 28:35.384
Hmm, but you're hot.

28:37.554 --> 28:38.595
Cheers.

28:38.722 --> 28:39.680
(Chuckles)

28:39.806 --> 28:43.016
- Nothing shy about you, huh?
- No.

28:43.143 --> 28:44.852
Well...

28:44.978 --> 28:47.855
after a pair of empty marriages,
I realized...

28:47.981 --> 28:52.151
the secret to long life
and happiness is...

28:52.277 --> 28:56.739
well, chocolate, and flirting with young,
hopefully hung, men.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.365
(Laughs)

28:58.491 --> 29:00.409
Sounds fattening and dangerous.

29:00.535 --> 29:02.619
- Oh, but so fun.
- Hmm.

29:02.746 --> 29:06.749
- Which clearly, you're not having enough of.
- I am.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.918
Look, believe me, I've had my fun.

29:10.044 --> 29:12.588
You need to be raising hell
and breaking hearts.

29:12.714 --> 29:14.798
- I need to be?
- You need to be.

29:14.924 --> 29:17.050
The skirt-wearing days
do not last forever.

29:17.177 --> 29:19.219
We all end up old and in the way.

29:21.055 --> 29:23.849
(Sport commentary on TV)

29:33.818 --> 29:37.321
(Dexter) l tell Miguel to be inconspicuous,
and what does he do?

29:37.447 --> 29:40.324
He shows up
Iooking Iike the Unabomber.

29:40.450 --> 29:42.534
I've got my work cut out for me.

29:43.453 --> 29:45.621
Oh, close game, close game.

29:45.747 --> 29:48.123
Yeah, good D.

29:50.960 --> 29:52.669
Good game, huh?

29:52.796 --> 29:54.797
No, it's not a good game.

29:54.923 --> 29:57.508
Good game is when they don't
beat the fucking point spread.

29:57.634 --> 30:00.302
Oh, you got a little money riding on this?

30:02.222 --> 30:04.223
A little bit.

30:13.024 --> 30:15.776
- (Game buzzer)
- Shit.

30:15.902 --> 30:17.528
(AppIause)

30:17.654 --> 30:20.531
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

30:20.657 --> 30:23.408
Not half as sorry
as somebody else is gonna be.

30:26.412 --> 30:27.663
Here we go.

30:32.335 --> 30:33.418
Buenas noches, patrón.

30:35.797 --> 30:37.172
Hey, who was that guy?

30:37.298 --> 30:39.299
Uh, I don't know. Some guy.

30:39.425 --> 30:42.219
- How do you know him?
- I don't.

30:42.345 --> 30:44.471
Dex, sometimes people recognize me.

30:46.140 --> 30:47.516
It's off. We're not doing this.

30:48.476 --> 30:51.687
- We need to take down the kill room.
- No, no, Dex, let's just wait.

30:51.813 --> 30:55.482
No one ever goes in that room there.
You saw. Tranquilo, huh?

30:55.608 --> 30:57.401
We decide tomorrow, OK?

30:58.528 --> 31:00.654
We'll see.

31:08.538 --> 31:11.290
Anton. Me again.

31:11.416 --> 31:13.542
Waiting on you still.

31:15.837 --> 31:18.046
The way I figured it,
you gigged until closing,

31:18.172 --> 31:22.384
then you went home and smoked some of
that herb that you keep in your cereal box.

31:22.510 --> 31:25.929
And now, like all self-indulgent,
vaguely adolescent musicians,

31:26.055 --> 31:28.390
you are sleeping in till noon
and I'm OK with that.

31:28.516 --> 31:30.100
OK? I'm OK with that.

31:30.226 --> 31:32.269
As long as you're alone.

31:32.395 --> 31:35.105
OK, OK. Too much caffeine.

31:48.912 --> 31:51.288
A Dutch farmer sees his crop fail.

31:51.414 --> 31:54.750
No money to his name,
he takes a job working on a boat.

31:54.876 --> 31:58.003
An unseasonabIy strong wind
blows him to lndonesia.

31:58.129 --> 32:00.339
He drops a bean into the soiI.

32:00.465 --> 32:03.675
And voiIà, 400 years Iater...

32:03.801 --> 32:05.469
Java.

32:05.595 --> 32:07.054
Everything is connected.

32:07.180 --> 32:10.182
(Cellphone buzzes)

32:11.809 --> 32:13.018
Hello?

32:13.144 --> 32:16.313
Dex, wanna hook up for breakfast?
I'm buying.

32:16.439 --> 32:19.441
I would, Deb,
but I'm already freshly bageled.

32:19.567 --> 32:22.986
- What are you doing up so early?
- Trying to be a good fiancé.

32:23.112 --> 32:25.656
Rita made me vice president
in charge of wedding rings,

32:25.782 --> 32:27.407
so I'm off to the jewellery store.

32:28.451 --> 32:31.078
And what do you know
about buying women jewelry?

32:32.455 --> 32:35.082
- Zero.
- Less than. Jesus, Dex.

32:35.208 --> 32:38.710
Look, I'll meet you at that place
on 2nd Street at ten o'clock, OK?

32:45.927 --> 32:49.471
The wedding band has to match the
engagement ring. What does that look like?

32:49.597 --> 32:51.848
(Sighs)

32:51.975 --> 32:54.685
She said she didn't want one.

32:54.811 --> 32:57.104
My God, you just get dumber every day.

32:57.230 --> 32:59.815
How do you survive in this world?
Of course she wants one.

32:59.941 --> 33:02.067
How am I supposed to know that?

33:02.193 --> 33:05.278
You're such a Y-chromosome cliché.

33:05.405 --> 33:09.700
Just buy her a beautiful, romantic,
"I love you with all of my heart"

33:09.826 --> 33:10.993
fucking engagement ring.

33:11.119 --> 33:13.787
And Dex...size matters.

33:19.252 --> 33:24.589
Can I ask you something
non-jewelry-wise?

33:24.716 --> 33:26.091
Go for it.

33:26.551 --> 33:29.511
OK, hypothetically...

33:31.431 --> 33:35.434
Let's say that this guy has to work
with this girl, but he fucking hates doing it,

33:35.560 --> 33:37.728
and too bad cause he has no fucking choice.

33:37.854 --> 33:39.896
And?

33:40.023 --> 33:43.692
And one thing leads to another...

33:44.360 --> 33:46.903
and this hypothetical guy...

33:48.322 --> 33:51.241
starts having sex
with this hypothetical girl.

33:51.367 --> 33:52.826
Hypothetical sex?

33:52.952 --> 33:55.078
Real sex.

33:55.705 --> 33:57.831
Really real sex.

33:57.957 --> 34:00.417
But then the guy is told
he no longer has to work with this girl,

34:00.543 --> 34:05.047
and poof! He just disappears.
You know, thin air. Adiós.

34:05.173 --> 34:06.590
So I'm wondering,

34:06.716 --> 34:10.177
is it possible Mr. Hypothetical
never really was all that into this girl?

34:10.303 --> 34:13.138
And he was just getting it on
to, I don't know, pass the time

34:13.264 --> 34:16.850
or satisfy primal urges or whatever?

34:17.810 --> 34:19.728
Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.

34:21.397 --> 34:22.731
What the fuck do you know?

34:25.943 --> 34:30.572
That one. I gotta go sit
in a hot car and wait for a suspect.

34:36.412 --> 34:38.914
Hey, Anton.

34:39.499 --> 34:41.041
What the fuck? Call me.

34:56.182 --> 34:58.141
I can bring Mario in myself.

34:58.267 --> 35:01.603
Let you get all the credit for catching
the Skinner? No fucking way.

35:01.729 --> 35:04.940
- We don't know he's the Skinner.
- Closest thing we got.

35:08.111 --> 35:11.279
That was really fucking unfair
what you said yesterday.

35:13.991 --> 35:15.408
Well, is it true?

35:16.619 --> 35:18.411
That a cop died because of you?

35:20.164 --> 35:22.666
- It's not that simple.
- Try me.

35:24.043 --> 35:27.838
Yuki Amado was my partner
in Narcotics.

35:27.964 --> 35:30.966
There was another detective
on our team, Stewart.

35:31.092 --> 35:34.886
He made a bad judgment call
and shot an unarmed coke dealer.

35:36.264 --> 35:38.140
I remember that.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.811
Paralyzed him, right?

35:43.980 --> 35:47.566
Then Stewart went on a bender
until he finally swallowed his own bullet.

35:47.692 --> 35:50.193
How does Yuki make that your fault?

35:50.319 --> 35:54.239
Because Stewart had a problem
with crystal meth.

35:54.365 --> 35:56.324
And I knew it.

35:57.577 --> 36:01.288
And rather than bust him,
I tried to protect him.

36:01.414 --> 36:04.082
So it is your fault.

36:04.208 --> 36:06.751
Listen to you.
Everything is so black and white.

36:06.878 --> 36:09.713
- You could have stopped him.
- Sure, if I knew what I knew now.

36:09.839 --> 36:12.883
- But that's not the way things work.
- I'm sorry, you're just making excuses.

36:13.009 --> 36:14.926
Of course I'm making excuses.

36:15.052 --> 36:17.053
Don't you? How else do you sleep at night?

36:17.180 --> 36:19.472
Who the fuck said I sleep at night?

36:19.599 --> 36:23.185
Then you must be killing yourself
over hooking up with Anton, huh?

36:26.105 --> 36:29.900
Yeah, It was probably a mistake. I think he
lost interest once he realized he was free.

36:30.026 --> 36:32.569
Not so black and white, is it?

36:37.783 --> 36:39.242
Mario.

36:47.168 --> 36:48.251
Mario Astorga?

36:50.963 --> 36:52.547
- Fuck!
- Fuck.

37:05.811 --> 37:07.812
I'm guessing he didn't want
to come in for questioning.

37:07.939 --> 37:11.149
- He made a run for it.
- (Quinn) Interview Two.

37:12.735 --> 37:14.945
- What's his story?
- So far, he hasn't said a word.

37:15.071 --> 37:19.783
Ah, you keep at it. And you check
with Nicaraguan authorities on priors.

37:19.909 --> 37:23.370
- (Debra) We're just waiting to hear back.
- Qué jodienda.

37:23.496 --> 37:24.955
I'm never gonna get out of here.

37:25.081 --> 37:28.375
(Sighs) I gotta call Barbara
and cancel our dinner.

37:28.501 --> 37:31.628
Oh, she's not gonna like that.

37:31.754 --> 37:33.421
I mean, it-it's work.

37:34.757 --> 37:37.467
(Barbara) l'm not here.
Leave a message.

37:37.593 --> 37:39.219
Hello, Barbara.

37:39.345 --> 37:44.140
This is, uh, Sergeant Angel Batista.

37:44.267 --> 37:46.184
Angel to you.

37:46.310 --> 37:47.978
How are you?

37:48.104 --> 37:50.105
Good, I hope.

37:50.231 --> 37:54.901
So I have to cancel our dinner tonight.

37:55.569 --> 37:59.656
And I am deeply, deeply apologetic.

37:59.782 --> 38:03.493
And I hope that you will
let me make it up to you

38:03.619 --> 38:06.663
in whatever possible way

38:06.789 --> 38:11.209
you wish things made up to you...in.

38:23.973 --> 38:26.683
Oh, I can tell by that look on your face,

38:26.809 --> 38:30.353
you're trying to figure out how to tell me
something I don't wanna hear.

38:34.817 --> 38:36.818
Calling off the kill.

38:36.944 --> 38:38.945
- It's over.
- Really, Dex?

38:40.406 --> 38:43.408
Just because some guy
recognized me in a bar?

38:43.534 --> 38:47.329
No one is ever gonna make that connection
once Fleeter disappears.

38:47.455 --> 38:49.581
I'm not taking that chance.

38:49.707 --> 38:51.541
That's not the way you do things, right?

38:51.667 --> 38:53.335
No, it isn't.

38:54.337 --> 38:58.048
- Tell me about that.
- What are you asking?

38:58.174 --> 39:02.135
I wasn't gonna bring it up before
but I'm guessing...

39:02.261 --> 39:04.220
you've been doing this for a while.

39:05.014 --> 39:07.390
Freebo wasn't your first.

39:07.516 --> 39:09.351
Was he?

39:14.273 --> 39:15.690
How many, Dex?

39:17.276 --> 39:20.195
OK, you know what, it doesn't matter.

39:20.946 --> 39:23.156
I will respect your privacy.

39:25.284 --> 39:29.329
But I just don't understand,
why are you not gonna help me here?

39:29.455 --> 39:32.707
Just because we broke
this little rule from your code?

39:32.833 --> 39:34.584
Come on, Dex. It's OK!

39:34.710 --> 39:37.629
No, it's not OK!

39:37.755 --> 39:44.094
(Sighs) You never should have
asked me to help you. You're not ready.

39:44.220 --> 39:46.137
I'm not...? Or is it you that's not ready?

39:46.263 --> 39:50.225
Huh? Because we could have dealt with this
Fleeter problem like three times already

39:50.351 --> 39:53.353
and you keep throwing up these roadblocks
with all this code bullshit.

39:53.479 --> 39:56.773
- It's not bullshit.
- Keep telling yourself that, Dex.

39:56.899 --> 39:59.192
It's like wearing a fucking straitjacket, man.

39:59.318 --> 40:02.946
No, Miguel, it's just the opposite.

40:03.072 --> 40:06.574
If I didn't have the code, the darkness...

40:18.963 --> 40:24.217
I could stand here and tell you
another story about my abusive father,

40:24.343 --> 40:27.429
but what I haven't told you about is that time
that I kicked the shit out of him

40:27.555 --> 40:30.932
and knocked him down a flight of stairs.
And I really enjoyed it.

40:33.978 --> 40:38.481
That was the first time in my life
that I've ever felt...

40:38.607 --> 40:40.692
powerful, like...

40:42.611 --> 40:45.447
like I was in control of-of something.

40:45.573 --> 40:49.534
And ever since then, I've been trying
to get that feeling back again.

40:50.786 --> 40:56.749
So when you talk to me about...
the darkness inside of you...

40:58.627 --> 41:00.462
I understand.

41:02.882 --> 41:04.132
I really do.

41:07.219 --> 41:10.221
I just want to let some of mine out too.

41:10.973 --> 41:12.849
(Sighs)

41:16.854 --> 41:19.147
I know you understand that.

41:26.780 --> 41:30.533
(Debra) You know what, Mr. Astorga?
Maybe I should have opened with my closer.

41:30.659 --> 41:32.535
Meaning?

41:32.661 --> 41:37.540
We know about the incident in Managua,
the one where you stabbed a cab driver.

41:37.666 --> 41:41.211
He touched my sister.
Sadly, he survived.

41:41.337 --> 41:43.671
That's a heartbreaking story!

41:43.797 --> 41:48.343
- Still you are an illegal guest of our country.
- Immigration's on the way.

41:48.469 --> 41:50.094
You're gonna be on a plane
before the sun comes up.

41:50.221 --> 41:51.804
But I have a son.

41:51.931 --> 41:55.058
He was born here. He's a US citizen.
He's my life.

41:55.184 --> 41:57.560
- Your boy's a US citizen?
- Yes.

41:57.686 --> 42:00.438
Then he stays. Maybe your wife too.
We don't know yet.

42:00.564 --> 42:03.149
We do know if you keep stonewalling us
on this Skinner case,

42:03.275 --> 42:04.692
you are gone on a one-way ticket.

42:04.818 --> 42:09.072
No matter what you try to do to me,
the facts ain't changing.

42:09.198 --> 42:11.157
I don't know anything about anything.

42:11.283 --> 42:14.202
Then why would George King
suggest otherwise?

42:19.959 --> 42:21.834
Señor King said I knew something?

42:22.920 --> 42:25.797
In a word? Yup.

42:29.802 --> 42:34.222
And Señor King will be very disappointed
to hear you're calling him a liar.

42:34.348 --> 42:35.932
No!

42:36.058 --> 42:37.141
Please.

42:38.602 --> 42:41.312
What are you so afraid of, Mario?

42:42.147 --> 42:45.483
- Yeah, what'd this guy do to you?
- What can he do to you?

42:45.609 --> 42:47.735
Please.

42:48.654 --> 42:50.446
Send me back to Nicaragua.

42:50.573 --> 42:53.616
- Alone?
- Sí Yes.

42:53.742 --> 42:55.076
Alone.

42:55.202 --> 42:57.579
(Hyperventilating)

43:04.253 --> 43:06.838
We mentioned George King's name
once and he turns to jello.

43:06.964 --> 43:08.339
Scared to death of him.

43:08.465 --> 43:10.550
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yeah, King jobbed us.

43:10.676 --> 43:12.927
I'm gonna issue a BOLO for him.

43:22.146 --> 43:25.315
(Phone rings)

43:25.441 --> 43:27.275
Hello?

43:27.401 --> 43:28.443
Shit.

43:30.779 --> 43:33.156
Who was it?

43:33.282 --> 43:34.324
Uh, me.

43:34.450 --> 43:37.619
I was checking to see
if my phone was working.

43:39.330 --> 43:42.165
Barbara never called me back.

43:42.291 --> 43:43.791
I think I ruined it.

43:44.918 --> 43:46.711
Sorry.

43:46.837 --> 43:48.963
Dating sucks.

43:49.089 --> 43:51.132
Yeah.

43:54.178 --> 43:58.139
Well, I'm outta here. Still no George King,
but we put the word out.

44:11.570 --> 44:12.612
Barbara.

44:15.366 --> 44:17.325
Mm.

44:17.451 --> 44:19.243
You got my message.

44:19.370 --> 44:22.413
Yup. Been listening to it all day.

44:23.123 --> 44:26.000
Makes me laugh every time.

44:27.169 --> 44:30.296
- It's pretty bad, huh?
- Um, the worst.

44:30.422 --> 44:31.714
(Laughs)

44:33.258 --> 44:37.011
- I'm glad I amuse you.
- Not half as glad as I am.

44:41.392 --> 44:43.643
(♪ Upbeat music)

44:48.857 --> 44:50.566
Hey, did they finish already?

44:50.693 --> 44:52.443
They never even started.

44:53.237 --> 44:54.821
What do you mean?
Where's Anton?

44:54.947 --> 44:56.114
He never showed.

44:56.240 --> 44:57.740
- Why?
- I don't know.

44:57.866 --> 45:00.827
They waited an hour. They called.
Doesn't answer.

45:01.995 --> 45:03.788
Thanks.

45:14.049 --> 45:16.426
Oye, chiquitico.

45:16.552 --> 45:19.262
What the f...

45:36.697 --> 45:37.739
Poetic.

45:45.873 --> 45:47.331
Are you ready?

45:48.542 --> 45:49.876
I am.

45:55.257 --> 45:57.133
Thank you.

45:58.552 --> 46:00.303
Thank you for this.

46:00.429 --> 46:02.555
For letting me in.

46:04.016 --> 46:06.434
For showing me the way.

46:14.902 --> 46:15.943
(Snorts)

46:25.412 --> 46:26.829
(Miguel) Look at him.

46:29.625 --> 46:32.585
Look at him trying to figure it all out.

46:32.711 --> 46:34.420
What the fuck?

46:36.089 --> 46:37.924
We're here because of them.

46:38.050 --> 46:42.178
Those lives that you destroyed.

46:44.598 --> 46:45.640
Who are you?

46:47.851 --> 46:49.602
We're justice.

46:54.525 --> 46:58.236
Hey, man, I was just doing
what I had to do.

46:58.362 --> 46:59.612
As are we.

47:05.994 --> 47:07.036
(Grunting)

47:07.162 --> 47:09.121
I've aIways done the deed aIone.

47:09.248 --> 47:11.457
Never stood outside,

47:11.583 --> 47:14.043
been a witness to this moment.

47:18.924 --> 47:20.800
The moment of truth.

47:20.926 --> 47:22.969
Can MigueI go through with it?

47:23.095 --> 47:25.513
Can he step out of the cocoon and fly?

47:46.743 --> 47:48.619
(Shouts)

47:48.745 --> 47:51.664
(Grunting)

48:06.346 --> 48:07.847
How do you feel?

48:16.940 --> 48:19.275
Fantastic.

48:29.161 --> 48:30.953
Shouldn't we get him out of here?

48:33.081 --> 48:34.707
As bonded as we may feeI,

48:34.833 --> 48:37.001
there are stiII things
I can't share with MigueI.

48:37.127 --> 48:38.127
I got it.

48:38.253 --> 48:42.340
No, it's...it's too much work.

48:42.466 --> 48:45.051
Leaving no trace is my area of expertise.

48:46.678 --> 48:48.179
Yeah, but, Dex...

48:48.305 --> 48:51.265
Get home before Sylvia
starts to wonder where you are.

48:51.391 --> 48:53.059
I mean it.

48:53.185 --> 48:54.685
OK.

48:54.811 --> 48:56.312
I'm going.

49:01.610 --> 49:03.653
Not a good idea.

49:07.991 --> 49:10.451
That would be against your code, huh?

49:10.577 --> 49:12.870
Sorry.

49:29.429 --> 49:31.847
Anton, you in there?

49:40.107 --> 49:42.274
Hello, Anton?

50:03.880 --> 50:05.506
Oh, God.

50:13.140 --> 50:16.809
Shit. Trimmed trees.
The Skinner's been here.

50:30.699 --> 50:34.201
(Slot machine beeping)

50:34.327 --> 50:37.538
You were wrong. It went well.

50:37.664 --> 50:40.124
Maybe. Who knows?

50:40.250 --> 50:43.544
You can't admit it. He did good.

50:43.670 --> 50:45.546
That was never the issue, Dex.

50:47.257 --> 50:48.799
I was only thinking about you.

50:48.925 --> 50:50.968
Of course.

50:51.094 --> 50:54.388
You've set something in motion here.

50:54.514 --> 50:56.974
Everything Miguel does from now on
is connected to you.

50:57.100 --> 51:01.520
It's a lot of responsibility,
teaching him what you just did.

51:01.646 --> 51:03.439
A heavy burden.

51:04.483 --> 51:09.111
It was too much for me to bear.
I hope you're a stronger man.

51:41.812 --> 51:42.895
Hey.

51:45.232 --> 51:46.440
You're still up.

51:48.485 --> 51:50.611
I can't sleep.

52:09.589 --> 52:10.714
I hope it's OK.

52:10.841 --> 52:13.342
My God.

52:13.468 --> 52:16.220
It's... It's perfect.

52:16.346 --> 52:18.848
Oh.

52:18.974 --> 52:22.768
Dexter, God, you've been
such a saint through all this.

52:22.894 --> 52:25.187
I don't know how you've put up with me.

52:26.273 --> 52:29.191
If you need me to help out
with more of the wedding stuff...

52:29.317 --> 52:31.360
No. No, it's...

52:33.697 --> 52:35.739
It's the hormones.

52:35.866 --> 52:37.992
I go crazy when I'm pregnant.

52:38.118 --> 52:40.077
Tell me about it.

52:40.203 --> 52:41.370
That's not true.

52:41.496 --> 52:45.916
You should just get out while you can.
Just run for your life.

52:46.042 --> 52:48.752
I won't.

52:48.879 --> 52:50.671
I promise.

52:52.048 --> 52:54.508
It's like I have this monster
living inside of me,

52:54.634 --> 52:56.343
and I don't know how to control it.

53:00.932 --> 53:03.184
Maybe I can help you out with that one.

53:13.028 --> 53:15.738
(Laughing) It's so beautiful.

53:19.367 --> 53:24.622
It's been said that a butterfly
can flap its wings in BraziI...

53:26.958 --> 53:29.627
and set off a storm in Florida.

53:33.423 --> 53:37.051
l'm taking the chance
that's not entireIy true.
