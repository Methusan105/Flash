WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:03.424
Previously on Dexter...

00:03.550 --> 00:04.800
I'm pregnant.

00:04.926 --> 00:07.845
(Dexter) I just think I'm gonna be a lousy
father. I don't wanna screw the kid up.

00:07.971 --> 00:09.805
(Debra) You're gonna be a great father.

00:09.931 --> 00:10.973
The Oscar Prado case?

00:11.099 --> 00:13.183
(Debra) Freebo killed
the senior ADA's brother.

00:13.768 --> 00:16.311
(Dexter) Except he didn't kill Oscar. I did.

00:16.438 --> 00:19.523
Dexter, I don't know if you officially got
to meet my other brother, Ramon.

00:19.649 --> 00:21.942
So you're the guy
that Miguel is always talking about?

00:22.068 --> 00:23.068
Oh.

00:23.194 --> 00:26.530
- What do you have on Freebo, Maria?
- We're working on some new angles.

00:26.656 --> 00:28.365
- Which means you've got shit.
- Excuse us.

00:28.491 --> 00:31.201
Freebo's still out there killing.
We gotta catch him fast.

00:31.327 --> 00:34.204
Holy shit, that's my Jane Doe.
Teegan Campbell.

00:34.330 --> 00:36.623
I was just telling Miguel
how we weren't giving up on Freebo.

00:36.750 --> 00:39.334
Now I have to call him and tell him
that he's probably right.

00:39.461 --> 00:41.837
Freebo's probably long gone,
and he didn't kill Teegan.

00:41.963 --> 00:42.963
Looks that way.

00:43.089 --> 00:45.883
Yuki Amado, Internal Affairs.
Do you know a Joey Quinn?

00:46.009 --> 00:49.219
Be really cool if you could get next to him.
You know, do a little recon.

00:49.345 --> 00:51.138
Yuki, that's not gonna happen.

00:51.264 --> 00:53.724
If you light that, I'll arrest you.

00:53.850 --> 00:56.310
I told you not to fucking do it!

00:56.436 --> 00:59.021
Why the fuck did you lock up my CI?

00:59.147 --> 01:02.024
Why do you keep calling him your CI?
Is there something you're not telling us?

01:02.150 --> 01:04.151
What happened
with the witness I gave you?

01:04.277 --> 01:06.779
I thought he had information
that exonerated Chicky Hines.

01:06.905 --> 01:09.073
I reviewed his statement.
It just didn't add up.

01:09.199 --> 01:12.826
Anton, I feel not good
about what happened.

01:12.952 --> 01:14.953
I feel not good too.

01:15.080 --> 01:18.082
(Miguel) This is the shirt I was wearing
when Freebo met his end.

01:18.208 --> 01:22.628
That's his blood right there.
This shirt implicates me in his death.

01:22.754 --> 01:25.130
I trust you, and I want you to trust me.

01:25.256 --> 01:27.424
(Dexter) ls it possible
I've actually made a friend,

01:27.550 --> 01:29.802
someone I can trust
with my dark secrets?

01:29.928 --> 01:33.013
Or am I being foolish for even
asking myself these questions?

03:25.835 --> 03:28.337
(Children giggling)

03:30.340 --> 03:32.090
(Dexter) Role playing.

03:32.217 --> 03:34.009
It's such an important part
of growing up.

03:34.135 --> 03:36.553
When we were kids,
whatever role Deb assigned me -

03:36.679 --> 03:40.265
evil monster, treacherous Nazi,
horrible alien -

03:40.391 --> 03:43.310
I played them to perfection.

03:45.897 --> 03:47.940
- We should tell them.
- About the baby?

03:48.066 --> 03:50.317
I don't want them
to hear it from somebody else.

03:50.443 --> 03:51.526
OK.

03:52.737 --> 03:54.738
Um... Kids.

03:55.865 --> 03:58.700
Dexter and I have something
we want to talk to you about.

03:58.826 --> 04:00.410
- What?
- We're having a baby.

04:02.997 --> 04:05.249
Um...

04:05.375 --> 04:09.253
You're gonna have a new little brother
or little sister to play with.

04:09.379 --> 04:12.047
- Which one?
- Which one would you like?

04:12.173 --> 04:15.008
- A puppy.
- You can have a puppy and a baby.

04:17.178 --> 04:21.932
- But you're not even married.
- No, no, we're not.

04:22.058 --> 04:25.936
- Why not?
- I...never really thought about it.

04:26.062 --> 04:29.690
You know, I'm gonna grab the potato salad
so I don't forget.

04:30.483 --> 04:33.443
Family man.
Husband and father.

04:33.569 --> 04:35.696
Sounds so upstanding.

04:35.822 --> 04:37.489
Harmless.

04:37.615 --> 04:42.452
Much better than
lives-alone-keeps-to-himself.

04:42.578 --> 04:46.248
Should we?
I mean, it's not the worst idea in the world.

04:46.374 --> 04:48.333
- Should we what?
- Get married.

04:48.459 --> 04:50.460
Dex.

04:50.586 --> 04:53.422
Yeah, cool. You'd be my dad.

04:56.175 --> 04:59.803
Look, this is not something
we're gonna decide today.

04:59.929 --> 05:04.099
Go get your stuff together.
We don't wanna be late for the Prados.

05:06.978 --> 05:08.645
Dex.

05:08.771 --> 05:11.148
That was ridiculous.

05:14.652 --> 05:17.446
The only roles I had trouble
with were good guys -

05:17.572 --> 05:19.823
heroes, knights in shining armor.

05:19.949 --> 05:22.159
It just never felt right.

05:22.285 --> 05:23.452
(Miguel) Not now.

05:23.578 --> 05:25.662
Please, Miguel, listen to me.

05:25.788 --> 05:29.750
- Someone matching his description...
- (Miguel) You can handle this, Ramon.

05:29.876 --> 05:31.293
OK, let me help you.

05:31.419 --> 05:35.047
Oh, no need.
Paper plates go right into the garbage.

05:35.173 --> 05:37.632
- And we'll be back with dessert.
- Thank you.

05:39.302 --> 05:40.886
I'm going.

05:41.012 --> 05:42.554
Please, I really want you to stay.

05:42.680 --> 05:43.722
Hey, easy.

05:43.848 --> 05:47.351
I mean it, Dexter,
what were you thinking?

05:47.477 --> 05:49.186
Proposing to me like that?

05:49.312 --> 05:51.271
Oh. Sorry.

05:51.397 --> 05:53.482
With the baby and all,
it just made sense.

05:53.608 --> 05:57.486
People don't get married
because it makes sense.

05:59.322 --> 06:00.906
They don't?

06:01.032 --> 06:04.326
Would you have asked me
to marry you if I wasn't pregnant?

06:05.912 --> 06:07.037
I don't know.

06:07.163 --> 06:10.082
I married Paul
because I was pregnant.

06:10.208 --> 06:14.461
And I won't marry again
unless it's because someone loves me.

06:16.839 --> 06:19.424
I understand why you feel that way.

06:19.550 --> 06:24.638
Being a father and being a husband
are two very different things.

06:24.764 --> 06:26.306
You don't have to be both.

06:26.432 --> 06:30.352
I don't want both unless it's real.

06:33.773 --> 06:36.733
ReaI. How do you show someone
reaI love

06:36.859 --> 06:39.528
when you don't even know
what it feels like?

06:40.863 --> 06:42.697
(Miguel) Don't leave, Ramon.

06:42.824 --> 06:46.451
It's just another empty lead,
another worthless tip.

06:46.577 --> 06:49.162
I'm gonna keep chasing them
until I find the one that leads to my...

06:49.288 --> 06:51.331
Our brother's killer, OK?

06:51.457 --> 06:53.417
Stay, Ramon. Come on, for your family.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.961
How 'bout I go for my family?

06:56.087 --> 06:57.379
Ramon, no.

06:57.505 --> 06:58.547
- I have to go.
- No.

06:58.673 --> 07:00.215
- Sara.
- I got him.

07:00.341 --> 07:02.843
Ramon. Come here.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.721
Everything all right?

07:06.848 --> 07:10.225
He's obsessed.
He's drinking more than usual.

07:10.351 --> 07:15.730
He's not going to stop looking for Oscar's
killer until it takes him all the way down.

07:16.691 --> 07:20.318
Grief hits some harder than others.

07:20.445 --> 07:24.448
You know, we could help Ramon find peace
if we told him Oscar's killer was dead.

07:24.574 --> 07:27.367
If we told him, then he'd know.

07:27.493 --> 07:31.705
Ramon and I have shared and have kept
each other's secrets all of our lives.

07:31.831 --> 07:34.749
- It's not just your secret.
- Which is why I'm asking you.

07:34.876 --> 07:37.127
Miguel, he seems unstable.

07:37.253 --> 07:38.795
- He's troubled.
- He has a temper.

07:38.921 --> 07:42.799
- He's my brother. I can help him.
- (Carlos) You're it!

07:42.925 --> 07:45.510
You're it!

07:45.636 --> 07:48.513
He needs to know that Freebo's dead.

07:51.350 --> 07:54.644
It's a big burden. Not everybody
can handle a secret like that.

08:00.234 --> 08:02.444
You're uncomfortable enough
with me knowing.

08:02.570 --> 08:05.947
Trusting my brother is just...
it's too much right now.

08:06.073 --> 08:08.950
- I get it.
- Actually, you do.

08:09.076 --> 08:13.288
Don't worry about it.
Ramon, he'll calm down eventually.

08:14.957 --> 08:17.501
Not a chance. This won't go away.

08:17.627 --> 08:21.046
Miguel can't see what
a loose cannon his brother is.

08:21.172 --> 08:23.548
He might need some perspective.

08:23.674 --> 08:26.009
Uncle Miguel, Astor won't let me
play in the cabin.

08:26.135 --> 08:30.013
(Dexter) Don't worry, buddy.
I'll talk to her.

08:30.139 --> 08:32.474
Astor, Carlos wants
to play in the cabin now.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.519
- So?
- So sharing is one of the rules.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.563
Whose rule?
You're not my father.

08:38.689 --> 08:39.981
Astor!

08:40.107 --> 08:42.400
Apologize to Dexter.

08:49.325 --> 08:51.868
Think she's reacting
to my botched proposal?

08:51.994 --> 08:54.496
She's so concerned about us
not being married.

08:54.622 --> 08:57.624
I don't think it's just the marriage.
It's the new baby.

08:57.750 --> 09:00.418
She's afraid she's
not gonna be special any more.

09:00.545 --> 09:02.671
Wow, you're good.

09:02.797 --> 09:04.548
I know my daughter.

09:04.674 --> 09:08.552
She just needs some attention,
some reassurance.

09:08.678 --> 09:10.345
Astor!

09:12.139 --> 09:14.391
(Dexter) Astor is auditioning various roles -

09:14.517 --> 09:17.727
wounded child, sullen pre-teen,
oppressed youth -

09:17.853 --> 09:20.230
finding out who she wants to play.

09:20.356 --> 09:22.440
Dramatic exit stage left.

09:22.567 --> 09:25.235
I can't force my way into Rita's life

09:25.361 --> 09:28.905
any more than I can force Miguel
to trust me over his own brother.

09:29.031 --> 09:31.741
I need to take a cue from Astor,

09:31.867 --> 09:33.910
get their attention.

09:34.036 --> 09:36.246
But first things first.

09:37.498 --> 09:38.957
I do have a dayjob.

09:54.348 --> 09:56.433
That's what real love looks like.

09:57.852 --> 10:00.270
Well, reaI love pIus loss.

10:00.396 --> 10:04.441
ls that what Rita needs to see in me?
CouId be a problem.

10:04.567 --> 10:06.568
That the fiancée?

10:06.694 --> 10:07.944
Not any more.

10:09.322 --> 10:12.115
That's Fiona Kemp.
She came to meet the vic for a movie.

10:12.241 --> 10:15.243
She saw the assailant.
He knocked her over as he fled.

10:15.369 --> 10:16.536
That's how she got the bum knee.

10:16.662 --> 10:19.831
Her description fits the one we've got
in a series of break-ins.

10:19.957 --> 10:22.459
Same MO too,
back door crowbarred open.

10:23.252 --> 10:26.129
We could barely get her to let go of him.

10:26.255 --> 10:28.965
(Cellphone vibrates)

10:29.091 --> 10:31.509
Deb, your butt's buzzing.

10:31.636 --> 10:33.094
Christ.

10:34.347 --> 10:36.056
(Beep)

10:37.516 --> 10:41.019
- Quinn here yet?
- Yeah, I just saw him pull up.

10:44.607 --> 10:47.233
Jesus, you should have
beat me here driving this thing.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.903
I got stuck on the causeway
behind a stalled car.

10:50.029 --> 10:52.405
I know you earn more with a shield,
but come on.

10:52.531 --> 10:55.492
Got a great lease is all.
What do we got?

10:55.618 --> 10:58.578
Jack Rice, 34. His head's caved in.

10:58.704 --> 11:01.623
Looks like a B and E gone sideways.
A bunch of priors in the area.

11:01.749 --> 11:04.167
- Witnesses?
- Just one.

11:04.960 --> 11:09.005
Jack took the day off
to see a matinee with me.

11:09.131 --> 11:11.383
A romantic comedy.

11:11.509 --> 11:15.512
He calls them chick flicks
but he knows they make me happy, so...

11:15.638 --> 11:17.931
I'm sure he was a great guy.

11:19.308 --> 11:22.060
But the man you saw fleeing,
he was about six-foot, you said?

11:22.186 --> 11:24.729
And I met Jack at the coffee place
where I work.

11:24.855 --> 11:30.610
When he came in, something inside of me
just recognized him,

11:30.736 --> 11:33.238
even though we'd never met.

11:33.364 --> 11:36.032
- Have you ever felt that way before?
- Too many times.

11:36.158 --> 11:40.328
We can look at some mug shots. Maybe
describe the man you saw to a sketch artist.

11:40.454 --> 11:45.125
What?
I-I'm staying with Jack.

11:45.251 --> 11:46.668
Jack has to go to the morgue.

11:48.170 --> 11:49.921
Forensics is gonna need her clothes.

11:50.047 --> 11:51.673
Well, why don't you tell her?

11:53.551 --> 11:56.344
You can't take that.
It's his favorite cap.

11:58.180 --> 12:01.599
- Ma'am, the cap needs to come with me.
- Mm-mm.

12:01.726 --> 12:04.978
Sorry, Fiona.
We'll give it back to you when we're done.

12:05.104 --> 12:06.271
You won't.

12:06.397 --> 12:09.274
Hey, look at me.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.359
Come on, right here.

12:11.485 --> 12:16.406
I'm telling you that I, Joseph Quinn,
will personally make sure

12:16.532 --> 12:19.075
that hat comes back to you unharmed.

12:23.038 --> 12:25.415
- He's good.
- Who knew?

12:25.541 --> 12:28.084
Is there anything else
you want to keep of Jack's?

12:28.210 --> 12:30.253
Maybe one of his shirts?

12:31.380 --> 12:33.047
Come on.

12:37.553 --> 12:40.054
He's like the fucking witness whisperer.

12:41.974 --> 12:44.434
Maybe he shouId propose
to Rita for me.

12:50.566 --> 12:53.401
Astor, that's so unfair.

12:54.320 --> 12:57.447
You're my little girl, and you
always will be. You know that, right?

12:57.573 --> 12:58.907
(Knocking at door)

12:59.033 --> 13:02.827
- (Woman) Rita, you in there?
- Yeah, just one second.

13:04.997 --> 13:07.957
Astor, I asked you a question.

13:08.083 --> 13:11.836
(Sighs) Look, whether Dexter and I
get married is between him and me.

13:11.962 --> 13:17.383
You and I have to work on being kinder
with each other. Can you help me with that?

13:18.636 --> 13:19.636
Please?

13:19.762 --> 13:22.263
- (Pounding on door)
- (Woman) Rita, we need you out here.

13:24.183 --> 13:25.975
Look, I've gotta get back to work.

13:26.101 --> 13:28.478
We're gonna talk
about this tonight, OK?

13:28.604 --> 13:30.104
All right.

13:36.821 --> 13:38.196
We need to switch rooms.

13:38.322 --> 13:41.658
We were expecting to watch the sun set
from our honeymoon suite,

13:41.784 --> 13:44.661
because, obviously,
we're on our honeymoon,

13:44.787 --> 13:46.120
but we couldn't see anything.

13:46.247 --> 13:47.789
Right, uh...

13:47.915 --> 13:50.834
Well, the sun sets in the west

13:50.960 --> 13:55.088
and Miami is on the east coast of Florida,
so there's really nothing we can...

13:55.214 --> 13:58.675
The brochure said,
"Watch the sun set over the ocean."

13:58.801 --> 14:00.009
Didn't it, honey?

14:00.135 --> 14:02.512
It may have said "sun rise".

14:02.638 --> 14:06.724
- We want your best room.
- The honeymoon suite is our best room.

14:06.851 --> 14:09.853
There's always a better room.

14:09.979 --> 14:13.356
Look, I'm sorry. Perhaps I can offer you
a complimentary breakfast?

14:13.482 --> 14:16.359
I want a higher floor,
a better view, and better lighting.

14:16.485 --> 14:19.070
It was way too dark in there
with the curtains closed.

14:19.196 --> 14:22.657
- How about a one-hour spa treatment?
- I want a better room.

14:22.783 --> 14:24.367
All right, we don't have a better room

14:24.493 --> 14:27.036
unless you build one, and being a bitch
isn't gonna change that.

14:27.162 --> 14:28.872
Rita.

14:28.998 --> 14:31.833
Excuse me. I'll be right with you.

14:36.380 --> 14:39.257
- We can't have this conversation again.
- I know. I'm sorry.

14:39.383 --> 14:43.052
This is the second time this week. Plus,
you're always on a break or calling in sick.

14:43.178 --> 14:46.222
I don't know what's going on
but, honestly, it's always something.

14:46.348 --> 14:49.225
And now I have to comp
the honeymoon suite.

14:49.351 --> 14:52.854
I'm really sorry, but I just can't afford
to employ you any more.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.400
Now, how can we make this right?

14:57.526 --> 15:00.153
(Dexter) Some people
are ticking time bombs.

15:00.279 --> 15:04.240
Ramon is one of them
and Miguel needs to see him explode.

15:04.366 --> 15:08.703
The inciter, that's a role
I've aIways been good at.

15:09.830 --> 15:12.040
Pick-up for Morgan.

15:14.835 --> 15:16.878
Ramon. Hey, how you doing?

15:18.088 --> 15:19.088
Dexter.

15:19.214 --> 15:22.091
Oh, that's right.
Miguel said you two came here.

15:22.217 --> 15:24.761
It's your secret spot, right?

15:24.887 --> 15:27.013
Not any more.

15:27.139 --> 15:30.350
Oh, don't worry.
I'll keep it between the three of us.

15:31.393 --> 15:33.561
Jefe, another rum and coke.

15:33.687 --> 15:36.397
Oh, and could I get
some extra pickles?

15:39.902 --> 15:43.947
Hey, sorry about the way
Astor treated little Carlos yesterday.

15:44.073 --> 15:47.075
Oh, right, you left.
It was a minor turf war.

15:47.201 --> 15:49.661
Don't worry, I watched out for him.

15:49.787 --> 15:52.288
Carlos is a tough kid.
He can hold his own.

15:52.414 --> 15:53.623
Yeah, I'm sure.

15:57.836 --> 15:59.587
Sure you want to be drinking that?

16:00.756 --> 16:02.924
If I wasn't sure, I wouldn't drink it.

16:03.050 --> 16:06.761
It's just...
You know, Miguel's worried about you.

16:08.389 --> 16:10.223
No offence, Dexter,

16:10.349 --> 16:14.560
but if Miguel has a problem with me,
he will tell me himself.

16:14.687 --> 16:17.563
Right. I mean, he said he did.

16:19.608 --> 16:21.234
But, yeah, he will again if he needs to.

16:21.360 --> 16:26.280
What goes on between me and my brother
is between me and my brother.

16:26.407 --> 16:29.200
Absolutely.

16:29.326 --> 16:34.664
I just happened to be there
when Miguel needed someone to talk to.

16:34.790 --> 16:37.500
Since I've been through it too.

16:37.626 --> 16:40.169
My mother was killed when I was a kid.

16:40.295 --> 16:42.255
I'm sorry.

16:43.340 --> 16:44.716
So I know how it feels.

16:44.842 --> 16:46.676
Ha.

16:46.802 --> 16:49.470
- But it gets easier.
- Hmm.

16:51.140 --> 16:55.309
Like Miguel said, when he accepted his loss
and found closure, he moved on.

16:55.436 --> 16:56.519
Hey!

16:57.396 --> 17:00.565
Nobody is accepting anything. OK?

17:00.691 --> 17:04.277
And when your homicide department gets
off its ass and starts doing its fucking job,

17:04.403 --> 17:07.280
maybe then me and my brother
will move on.

17:08.866 --> 17:10.742
(Man) Extra pickles.

17:11.785 --> 17:13.202
Thanks.

17:16.415 --> 17:18.416
I must have misinterpreted what he said.

17:18.542 --> 17:20.209
Yeah.

17:20.335 --> 17:21.794
You did.

17:23.797 --> 17:25.882
Well, enjoy your dinner.

17:27.301 --> 17:29.510
And tell Carlos I said howdy.

17:42.024 --> 17:43.232
(Knock on door)

17:43.358 --> 17:45.443
I knew I'd find you still here.

17:46.403 --> 17:48.279
No rest for the wicked.

17:49.114 --> 17:51.199
What brings you to these parts?

17:51.325 --> 17:55.536
Uh, I wanted to ask you
about Chicky Hines.

17:55.662 --> 17:56.829
Again?

17:56.955 --> 18:01.209
I got a witness who can provide
an alibi for Hines. It checks out.

18:01.335 --> 18:04.670
- I told you I reviewed his statement.
- But you never talked to him.

18:04.797 --> 18:06.464
Oh, come on, Maria.

18:06.590 --> 18:11.094
Your witness is a habitual criminal
who's just trying to beat his latest drug rap.

18:11.220 --> 18:14.722
Yeah, but that doesn't mean it isn't true.
And he can clear Hines.

18:14.848 --> 18:17.350
Have you even met Chicky Hines?

18:17.476 --> 18:20.436
I mean have... Have you read his jacket?
Because it's...

18:20.562 --> 18:23.314
Hines didn't do this crime.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.274
OK.

18:30.280 --> 18:33.783
- What's this really about?
- An innocent man behind bars.

18:33.909 --> 18:35.118
Maybe.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.745
Maybe there's something else at play.

18:38.831 --> 18:42.583
Accepting the truth about James Doakes,
that was hard for all of us.

18:44.628 --> 18:46.337
Wow.

18:46.463 --> 18:48.047
I wasn't expecting that.

18:48.173 --> 18:50.174
I know.
Look, I shouldn't even mention it.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.385
But, come on, he was your partner.

18:53.887 --> 18:56.055
He's your friend.

18:56.181 --> 18:59.433
Maybe you think he was railroaded,
I don't know.

19:00.769 --> 19:03.146
And maybe that's coloring
how you're seeing Hines.

19:04.148 --> 19:06.274
I'll admit it was hard.

19:07.568 --> 19:09.610
But you know me, you know I'm a pro.

19:11.071 --> 19:13.489
I also know you're human
like the rest of us.

19:26.837 --> 19:29.589
The fiancée's working
with a sketch artist now.

19:29.715 --> 19:32.842
So far it matches what the burglary division
already has on the break-ins,

19:32.968 --> 19:35.178
so she's not giving us anything
we don't already have.

19:35.304 --> 19:39.307
Yeah, except for more stories
about how perfect her dead fiancé was.

19:39.433 --> 19:42.185
Hey, it's not easy realizing
you're alone in the world.

19:45.564 --> 19:47.732
What's the blood splatter telling you?

19:47.858 --> 19:49.775
- Just...
- (Cellphone vibrates)

19:49.902 --> 19:52.987
- Just clarifying some discrepancies.
- Well, clarify fast.

19:53.113 --> 19:55.698
I'm gonna wrap this thing up,
get you two guys back on the Skinner case.

19:55.824 --> 19:58.117
Yeah, you're preaching
to the choir, sir.

19:58.243 --> 20:00.912
- Morgan, your ass is...
- Thank you. I fucking noticed it.

20:01.038 --> 20:04.999
Ta-da! Comp tickets to my keynote address
at the forensics conference.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.959
Not really my thing.

20:07.085 --> 20:10.630
- I'm flea-combing my dog that night.
- I'm seeing my little girl that night.

20:10.756 --> 20:13.549
You don't even know the date.

20:13.675 --> 20:16.219
I-I gotta keep my schedule open for her.

20:20.390 --> 20:22.058
Et tu, Dex-tay?

20:22.184 --> 20:24.101
Wouldn't miss it.

20:29.691 --> 20:32.985
Masuka.
He's chosen the role of court jester.

20:33.111 --> 20:35.655
Now we only like him
when he's making us laugh.

20:35.781 --> 20:38.532
Still, there's something to be said
for being a character actor.

20:38.659 --> 20:43.287
The lead players with all those emotions
must be exhausting.

20:49.169 --> 20:52.922
Looks like the sketch that burglary already
has on the break-in suspect.

20:53.048 --> 20:57.051
- You couldn't get any more out of her?
- Officer Morgan, the woman's a wreck.

21:01.181 --> 21:05.268
So...he didn't have
any distinguishing marks,

21:05.394 --> 21:07.186
any scars or tattoos?

21:07.312 --> 21:09.105
Uh, maybe.

21:09.231 --> 21:11.524
Um, I don't remember.

21:11.650 --> 21:13.150
He ran right by you.

21:13.819 --> 21:16.070
I was... I was surprised.

21:16.196 --> 21:17.738
Let's take a deep breath.

21:18.740 --> 21:22.451
Close your eyes.
Try to picture it again.

21:24.579 --> 21:26.622
It's so horrible.

21:27.791 --> 21:30.918
My Jack just lying there.
Why is this happening?

21:31.044 --> 21:34.255
- OK, let's not picture it any more.
- (Fiona) Jack's never coming back.

21:34.381 --> 21:36.799
Let's focus on something else
right now, OK?

21:36.925 --> 21:38.843
We'll just focus on something else.

21:38.969 --> 21:40.803
- Fiona.
- Hi.

21:42.347 --> 21:45.016
- How are you holding up?
- I'm not helping at all.

21:45.142 --> 21:47.893
Are you kidding?
You're doing great.

21:48.020 --> 21:49.437
You're a champ.

21:49.563 --> 21:51.355
I'm trying, but...

21:53.608 --> 21:57.820
Why don't we take a break from all this
and go look at some pictures together, OK?

21:57.946 --> 21:59.780
OK.

21:59.906 --> 22:01.991
We'll be in Interview Three
with the mug books.

22:02.117 --> 22:03.492
I'll set it up.

22:03.618 --> 22:05.619
That's OK, I got it.

22:25.015 --> 22:27.767
They say this part should pass soon.

22:29.394 --> 22:32.355
They say I should glow.
Am I glowing?

22:34.358 --> 22:36.484
You are to me.

22:41.323 --> 22:44.116
I can't believe I called a guest a bitch.

22:44.242 --> 22:45.993
Sounded like an accurate description.

22:46.119 --> 22:50.373
I think I'm gonna talk to my boss
and ask for my job back.

22:50.499 --> 22:53.417
Really? I always got the impression
you didn't particularly like that job.

22:53.543 --> 22:55.086
It's a job.

22:55.212 --> 22:58.506
No one's gonna hire me
knowing I have to go on maternity leave.

22:58.632 --> 23:01.384
Plus I barely have any savings.

23:01.510 --> 23:02.885
I'm pregnant.

23:03.011 --> 23:04.178
No health insurance.

23:04.304 --> 23:07.014
My insurance would cover you.

23:07.140 --> 23:10.768
Rita, if we got married, we'd have
joint assets. You wouldn't have to worry.

23:10.894 --> 23:15.481
Let's not forget about marital deductions.
With Astor and Cody as dependants...

23:15.607 --> 23:18.025
(Vomits)

23:19.361 --> 23:22.154
(Groans)

23:22.280 --> 23:24.156
- No, huh?
- Uh-uh.

23:32.207 --> 23:34.917
That's one ugly guitar.

23:35.043 --> 23:37.086
Ugly? Pssh.

23:37.212 --> 23:41.090
A beat-up guitar like this speaks
to the experience of its owner.

23:41.216 --> 23:43.259
The many hard roads
we've traveled together.

23:43.385 --> 23:45.261
So you've had it a long time.

23:45.387 --> 23:49.557
No, a couple of weeks.
Picked it up at a pawn shop for 20 bucks.

23:49.683 --> 23:51.475
Gives me a certain mystique, doesn't it?

23:51.601 --> 23:53.853
You are full of shit.

23:54.896 --> 23:56.605
So what do you need, Officer?

23:57.732 --> 24:00.401
A stiff drink after a shit day.

24:00.527 --> 24:03.195
- And you came here?
- For the margaritas, trust me.

24:03.321 --> 24:05.573
One margarita.

24:09.077 --> 24:10.619
How well do you know Quinn?

24:10.745 --> 24:12.746
He have something to do
with your day being shit?

24:12.873 --> 24:14.457
Maybe.

24:14.583 --> 24:16.500
I've heard stuff about him.

24:16.626 --> 24:19.253
And he comes off really slick,
and then he turns around

24:19.379 --> 24:22.298
and he's all sensitive
and caring about people.

24:22.424 --> 24:25.176
What's his story,
is he a good guy or a bad guy?

24:25.302 --> 24:26.927
Does it have to be either/or?

24:27.053 --> 24:31.265
In my world? Yeah. But I can't figure out
which one he decided on.

24:31.391 --> 24:35.311
All I know is, um,

24:35.437 --> 24:37.605
Quinn helped me out of a jam
when I was in trouble.

24:39.941 --> 24:42.818
The man gave me an opportunity,
and I took it.

24:45.030 --> 24:46.447
OK.

24:47.282 --> 24:51.660
Besides, without Quinn,
you would have no CI,

24:51.786 --> 24:53.412
and I'd be drinking alone.

24:56.875 --> 24:59.168
I doubt that.

24:59.294 --> 25:02.087
(Both laugh)

25:06.218 --> 25:08.636
(Keys rattling in lock)

25:21.650 --> 25:24.860
Oh, you're a hungry man.

25:24.986 --> 25:26.820
And you're a beautiful meal.

25:26.947 --> 25:30.241
You, uh, you looking
for anything special tonight?

25:30.367 --> 25:32.576
Your eyes.

25:32.702 --> 25:33.911
They're soulful.

25:34.037 --> 25:35.955
Well, the compliments are free,

25:36.081 --> 25:40.334
but an hour of my time costs.

25:41.586 --> 25:43.587
It might be more than an hour.

25:46.758 --> 25:49.218
Take a pass, Sergeant.

25:52.180 --> 25:55.891
Tonight, for a couple of hours anyway,
I'm not a...

25:57.978 --> 26:01.272
Tonight, all night, I am.

26:05.026 --> 26:07.194
Shit, this is a sting.

26:09.406 --> 26:11.115
(Whispers) Just shut up and go with this.

26:11.241 --> 26:15.286
You goddamn deadbeat! You come up
to my room, and you ain't got no cash!

26:15.412 --> 26:18.622
Well, nobody sees Jazmin
that ain't got no cash.

26:18.748 --> 26:21.458
You wasted my time, you motherfucker.

26:25.880 --> 26:28.007
(Miguel) Wow, so she threw up?

26:28.133 --> 26:31.135
Yep. Her answer apparently.

26:31.261 --> 26:35.014
Not really the response you want to hear
to a marriage proposal.

26:35.140 --> 26:39.143
Yeah, hence my call to you
and the bribe of a beer.

26:39.269 --> 26:41.979
You've obviously had
one successful proposal.

26:42.105 --> 26:43.981
Tell me your secret, o wise one.

26:44.107 --> 26:46.191
OK.

26:47.235 --> 26:49.486
Well, whatever you do,
don't suggest eloping

26:49.613 --> 26:52.448
because a wedding conflicts
with a big case you've got coming up.

26:52.574 --> 26:56.285
- You did that?
- It went over about as well as yours did.

26:56.411 --> 26:58.287
I'm not the only hopeless one.

26:58.413 --> 27:02.875
You and me, buddy,
making the women of America sick.

27:04.919 --> 27:08.213
I did eventually figure out that women
tend to lead with their hearts.

27:08.340 --> 27:10.257
So you might try leading with yours.

27:11.509 --> 27:14.261
- Is that the only option?
- Only one that works, hermano.

27:16.598 --> 27:19.308
Oh, speaking of hermanos,
I ran into Ramon last night.

27:19.434 --> 27:20.434
I heard.

27:20.560 --> 27:23.354
- Actually, I got an earful.
- Sorry.

27:23.480 --> 27:27.107
I tried to reach out to him, make
a connection. I think I just upset him more.

27:27.233 --> 27:30.319
It's OK. It led to a really good talk.

27:32.614 --> 27:33.906
Talk?

27:34.032 --> 27:35.866
Coño. I didn't tell him, Dexter.

27:35.992 --> 27:38.369
I keep my promises.

27:38.495 --> 27:41.872
But when and if you ever
feel comfortable telling him,

27:41.998 --> 27:45.042
I'm just saying
I think Ramon is ready.

27:49.714 --> 27:54.176
Miguel keeps trying to cast Ramon
in the role of misunderstood good guy.

27:54.302 --> 27:58.389
Personally, I think he makes a much better
bad guy. I just have to convince Miguel.

27:59.641 --> 28:01.809
A doughnut
and a ticket to hear me speak?

28:01.935 --> 28:03.811
I'll take a doughnut.

28:07.273 --> 28:08.607
You already got a ticket.

28:08.733 --> 28:10.526
You're bribing people to come
to your keynote address?

28:10.652 --> 28:13.737
The whole doughnut thing
works for you, doesn't it?

28:13.863 --> 28:15.280
The blind leading the blind.

28:15.407 --> 28:17.408
Doughnut and a ticket?

28:20.370 --> 28:22.913
Just fucking take one.

28:23.039 --> 28:24.873
Hey.

28:24.999 --> 28:27.543
Hey. Something up, Lew?

28:27.669 --> 28:30.379
You remember that statement you took
from the Chicky Hines alibi?

28:30.505 --> 28:32.673
You want me to recite it by heart?

28:32.799 --> 28:35.134
So you buy it?

28:35.260 --> 28:38.262
Even though the alibi comes from somebody
trying to beat a drug rap?

28:38.388 --> 28:40.139
It's solid.

28:40.265 --> 28:41.473
(Sighs)

28:41.599 --> 28:44.309
- Is the ADA still sitting on it?
- Mm-hm.

28:44.436 --> 28:47.688
Well, then you did all you could.

28:50.108 --> 28:51.066
Maybe.

28:51.192 --> 28:53.068
(Masuka sighs)

28:54.362 --> 28:58.323
Hell musta froze over
cause cops won't eat donuts any more.

28:58.450 --> 29:01.535
- Maybe the price is a little too high.
- Oh, please.

29:01.661 --> 29:04.872
Why wouldn't they want to support
a colleague during his shining moment?

29:04.998 --> 29:07.249
You want an honest answer to that?

29:07.375 --> 29:08.959
It was rhetorical.

29:10.295 --> 29:12.254
All right.

29:12.380 --> 29:14.006
All right, tell me.

29:15.717 --> 29:18.594
You're, like, the foulest person
I've ever met.

29:18.720 --> 29:22.222
Every line out of your mouth
is a sick joke.

29:22.348 --> 29:23.515
I'm funny.

29:23.641 --> 29:25.476
Yeah, you can be.

29:25.602 --> 29:30.355
You can also be completely revolting
and sometimes that's all people see.

29:30.482 --> 29:33.942
What do you know?
You're the fucking new guy.

29:34.068 --> 29:37.321
Hey, Dr. Phil, your girlfriend's coming in
again to look at more mug books, so...

29:39.991 --> 29:43.744
Hi there, Deb. Help yourself.
I saved you one with the cream filling.

29:44.746 --> 29:46.455
Ugh, freak.

29:52.128 --> 29:53.796
Sergeant Batista.

29:55.924 --> 29:57.674
It's you.

29:57.801 --> 30:00.010
With clothes.
I mean, different clothes...

30:00.136 --> 30:03.096
Yeah, I'm Detective Barbara Gianna,
Metro Vice.

30:03.223 --> 30:04.556
Can we talk?

30:06.559 --> 30:08.435
Yeah.

30:11.105 --> 30:14.233
Look, this department has had

30:14.359 --> 30:17.236
a lot of shit dumped on it
with the Bay Harbor Butcher.

30:17.362 --> 30:22.991
And now you, a sergeant, are looking to
make the news getting busted with hookers.

30:23.117 --> 30:26.495
Now, I turn you in now,
I save this department worse later.

30:26.621 --> 30:29.081
Cause guys like you never learn.

30:29.207 --> 30:30.999
Hey, look,
maybe I'm an asshole, but...

30:31.125 --> 30:32.876
Do not...

30:33.002 --> 30:35.546
insult me by saying
this is your first time.

30:35.672 --> 30:39.758
OK, cause I hear this same horseshit
sob story from everyone I bust.

30:39.884 --> 30:43.804
Does any part of you think that any part of
me is proud of what I've done?

30:45.306 --> 30:47.349
No part of me really cares.

30:47.475 --> 30:49.977
It's just that...

30:51.312 --> 30:53.480
I destroyed my marriage.

30:55.316 --> 30:57.442
I lost my little girl.

31:00.780 --> 31:03.532
I'm a divorced cop

31:03.658 --> 31:05.993
halfway down the road
to a full-blown cliché -

31:08.162 --> 31:10.789
a divorced, alcoholic cop.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.835
And I needed to fight that...

31:18.506 --> 31:20.007
loneliness.

31:22.677 --> 31:25.762
So I found affection any way I could.

31:26.347 --> 31:27.472
I mean, hookers?

31:27.599 --> 31:31.560
I needed to connect with someone,
anyone,

31:31.686 --> 31:33.729
who wouldn't hurt me back no more.

31:38.359 --> 31:40.569
That's it.

31:40.695 --> 31:42.863
Not special.

31:44.866 --> 31:46.325
Just true.

31:49.787 --> 31:52.664
I hate anyone who disgraces the badge.

31:52.790 --> 31:55.292
I hate liars worse.

31:55.418 --> 31:57.336
I'm not lying.

31:58.963 --> 32:01.214
I know.

32:02.175 --> 32:03.342
Are we good?

32:03.468 --> 32:08.388
You keep your dick in your pants
unless you're, A, playing with yourself

32:08.514 --> 32:12.100
or, B, you are doing
something consensual and legal.

32:13.978 --> 32:16.438
Then we're good.

32:19.567 --> 32:21.318
(Sighs)

32:21.444 --> 32:22.903
(Bell)

32:26.032 --> 32:27.449
Ramon, what are you...

32:27.575 --> 32:29.826
Any progress on finding
Oscar's killer?

32:29.953 --> 32:32.621
We're liaising with the Feds
in case he went over the border.

32:32.747 --> 32:34.957
But what if he's right here
in our own backyard?

32:35.083 --> 32:37.084
It's an ongoing concern, Ramon.

32:37.210 --> 32:39.044
But not a priority, right?

32:39.170 --> 32:41.296
- Hey. Is there a problem here?
- Lower your voice.

32:41.422 --> 32:44.466
Yeah, Sergeant, your people don't know
what the fuck they're doing.

32:44.592 --> 32:47.386
Hey, that credit you get for being a cop,
it has a limit.

32:47.512 --> 32:48.971
So you do have a game plan.

32:49.097 --> 32:51.264
Cause it doesn't seem
to involve listening to solid leads.

32:51.391 --> 32:53.642
Every lead has been followed.

32:53.768 --> 32:57.813
Then why am I getting calls from a guy
who says he saw Freebo in Miami?

32:57.939 --> 33:01.191
I'll tell you why, because you ignored him.
He called you four times.

33:01.317 --> 33:02.275
- Never happened.
- OK.

33:02.402 --> 33:03.652
OK. Está bien.

33:03.778 --> 33:07.364
Ramon, you give me this tipster's name,
I will personally follow through.

33:07.490 --> 33:08.824
The motherfucker was anonymous.

33:08.950 --> 33:12.119
Oh, did I forget to leave my name? Sorry.

33:12.245 --> 33:15.914
But he knew things about this case.
Like Freebo had a girlfriend, Teegan.

33:16.040 --> 33:19.167
A lot of people know that, sir.
I passed her photo all over town.

33:19.293 --> 33:21.336
Maybe the tipster wanted reward money.

33:21.462 --> 33:24.506
You can find excuses
or you can get off your asses

33:24.632 --> 33:26.008
and try finding my brother's killer.

33:26.134 --> 33:29.136
OK, Ramon, you need to leave now!

33:38.479 --> 33:41.148
Just do your fucking job.

33:50.908 --> 33:53.243
You wanna give his brother
the heads-up?

33:53.369 --> 33:57.539
You do it. I'm a little tired
of the Prado family right now.

33:58.624 --> 34:00.083
(Sighs)

34:02.003 --> 34:04.421
That was easier than I thought.

34:09.343 --> 34:12.054
Miguel won't be happy to hear
Ramon's throwing tantrums

34:12.180 --> 34:14.848
with fellow law enforcement.

34:14.974 --> 34:17.059
Not that I'll rely on that alone.

34:17.185 --> 34:20.562
The stakes are too high
and I'm on a roll.

34:21.939 --> 34:25.525
Maybe I shouId call Rita
with an anonymous tip to marry me.

34:28.071 --> 34:29.905
Oh, what the fuck, Dex?

34:30.031 --> 34:32.741
Good, you're here.
Put this on.

34:32.867 --> 34:35.786
I don't need a giant condom.
I need your spatter report on Jack Rice.

34:35.912 --> 34:40.749
I'm working on it. Just put on the suit
and the gloves and the mask, please.

34:40.875 --> 34:42.417
Fine.

34:42.543 --> 34:46.505
The sooner I'm done with the
weeping fiancée, the better off I'll be.

34:47.090 --> 34:50.092
Raw emotion.
Not your forte, huh?

34:50.218 --> 34:54.096
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- Hey, it's not mine either.

34:54.222 --> 34:56.640
It's easy as hell for Quinn.

34:56.766 --> 34:59.434
Think he's just nicer than me?

34:59.560 --> 35:01.853
I don't know about nicer.

35:01.979 --> 35:05.065
Although studies show
that emotional intelligence

35:05.191 --> 35:08.360
plays a greater role
in individual success

35:08.486 --> 35:11.404
than anything that can be measured
on a standard IQ test.

35:12.323 --> 35:13.824
Come here.

35:13.950 --> 35:16.993
Stand right here
and bash this for me, will ya?

35:17.829 --> 35:19.621
Are you calling me an emotional idiot?

35:19.747 --> 35:21.414
If you're an idiot, I'm a vegetable.

35:21.541 --> 35:23.583
Well, that's for fucking sure.

35:26.671 --> 35:28.380
Fuckin'-A, Dex!

35:28.506 --> 35:30.048
(Chuckles)

35:30.174 --> 35:31.216
Sorry.

35:35.179 --> 35:37.305
You know what,
Fiona has her facts wrong.

35:38.182 --> 35:41.309
She described the assailant as six-foot.

35:41.435 --> 35:45.230
But calculating Jack Rice's height,
allowing for the upward angle...

35:45.356 --> 35:48.441
- Layman here.
- Well, your body acts as a shield.

35:48.568 --> 35:52.112
And all of this is what
your body doesn't block.

35:53.406 --> 35:56.533
So the killer stuns the victim
with the first blow. He falls to his knees.

35:56.659 --> 35:59.703
The second blow brings us blood.

35:59.829 --> 36:01.746
If the killer was six-foot,

36:01.873 --> 36:06.001
the spatter shadow at the crime scene
would be taller and wider.

36:06.127 --> 36:09.754
Instead, it's an exact match
for your shadow.

36:09.881 --> 36:12.883
Ergo, Rice's killer was approximately
your height and weight.

36:13.009 --> 36:15.594
You mean fucking weep-bag
Fiona's height and weight?

36:15.720 --> 36:18.513
No, I mean...

36:20.308 --> 36:22.934
I missed that. Interesting.

36:37.116 --> 36:40.285
- You and Jack planning a big wedding?
- Yeah.

36:40.411 --> 36:42.412
Jack had a lot of friends, yeah.

36:42.538 --> 36:46.374
You know, the thing is,
I went through his address book

36:46.500 --> 36:49.461
and I called a lot of people,

36:49.587 --> 36:52.881
and none of them
have ever heard of you.

36:53.007 --> 36:55.508
Well, we like to keep
to ourselves, you know?

37:01.307 --> 37:02.682
When was that taken?

37:05.686 --> 37:07.270
It was right after we met.

37:07.396 --> 37:10.482
Did he get a chance to see it
before you killed him?

37:12.610 --> 37:13.860
What?

37:15.529 --> 37:18.531
Uh, what-what is she talking about?
I don't...

37:19.242 --> 37:21.910
It's Photoshopped, Fiona.

37:22.036 --> 37:23.954
It's really good work, though.

37:24.080 --> 37:26.206
Really good.
Did you do it yourself?

37:26.332 --> 37:27.916
God, no.

37:28.042 --> 37:31.086
See, I'm thinking maybe you broke into
his apartment to leave that as a surprise.

37:31.212 --> 37:33.713
He comes home, tries to throw
your ass out, and you kill him.

37:33.839 --> 37:36.716
No, I would never hurt Jack.
We were getting married.

37:36.842 --> 37:41.096
You heard about the break-in on TV,
you create the same sketch that was on TV,

37:41.222 --> 37:42.555
the same crowbar in the back door.

37:42.682 --> 37:45.392
You bash your own fucking knee in!
Did he ever even talk to you, Fiona?

37:45.518 --> 37:49.229
Did he ever even say more than
"one fucking coffee to go"?!

37:49.355 --> 37:53.024
That's it. This is over.

37:53.943 --> 37:55.819
(Sniffles)

37:55.945 --> 37:58.405
I'm sorry.

37:58.531 --> 38:01.700
Wait outside, Officer.
I'll take it from here.

38:12.920 --> 38:16.923
- It's all right.
- Mm-mm.

38:17.049 --> 38:22.762
I know how it really was
between you and Jack.

38:22.888 --> 38:24.889
I know.

38:25.016 --> 38:27.309
You all right?

38:27.435 --> 38:29.019
Yeah.

38:29.145 --> 38:31.146
It's safe. It's just me and you.

38:34.608 --> 38:36.860
Can you believe this shit?

38:36.986 --> 38:38.987
It's amazing.
She's so convincing.

38:39.113 --> 38:42.615
I'm talking about him.
I'm gonna kick his Cadillac-driving ass.

38:42.742 --> 38:46.161
Before Jack,

38:46.287 --> 38:48.621
my life was
an unanswered question.

38:49.498 --> 38:50.874
Unanswered question.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.002
Days and nights
spent looking for something.

38:54.128 --> 38:56.921
Quinn played me
like a fucking $20 guitar.

38:57.048 --> 38:58.256
Shh.

38:59.383 --> 39:04.596
The first time
he came into the café, I... I felt him.

39:08.684 --> 39:10.852
We were connected, you know?

39:13.522 --> 39:16.775
Everywhere I went, he was with me.

39:16.901 --> 39:19.152
Jack made me real.

39:19.278 --> 39:23.239
Made me real. She believes it...
Down to her core.

39:23.366 --> 39:24.532
It's not an act.

39:24.658 --> 39:28.036
The only actor in that room is Quinn.

39:28.162 --> 39:29.662
(Cellphone vibrating)

39:37.088 --> 39:40.548
(Dexter) lf Fiona can be this convincing
about someone she didn't even know,

39:40.674 --> 39:43.009
I should be able to convince Rita...

39:43.135 --> 39:45.095
and others.

39:45.221 --> 39:48.473
Ellen.

39:48.599 --> 39:49.808
Hello?

39:50.935 --> 39:52.352
Ellen?

40:01.904 --> 40:03.071
Mmm.

40:03.197 --> 40:07.075
Thank Christ you found the place.
I couldn't have waited much longer.

40:07.201 --> 40:08.576
A client just sent me these.

40:08.702 --> 40:12.914
Without a responsible adult to share them
with or shame me, I would eat them all.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.124
I would.

40:14.250 --> 40:16.918
- Try that one.
- Mm-mm.

40:17.044 --> 40:19.712
Seriously, ganache frosting.

40:22.383 --> 40:23.675
Oh, what the hell?

40:26.178 --> 40:29.305
So... I'm guessing you wanted
to meet for reasons

40:29.432 --> 40:32.851
other than working up
a case of type 2 diabetes.

40:32.977 --> 40:35.186
The Chicky Hines conviction.

40:37.940 --> 40:39.190
Yeah.

40:40.568 --> 40:42.777
Not the justice system's finest hour.

40:42.903 --> 40:46.489
My people have come across evidence
that could get the case reopened.

40:47.992 --> 40:50.618
I like the sound of the quid.
What's the pro quo?

40:50.744 --> 40:52.036
Nada.

40:54.039 --> 40:58.793
Witness statement giving Hines an alibi,
another suspect. All of which checks out.

41:03.674 --> 41:04.924
Ohh.

41:12.391 --> 41:14.225
Two-plus decades doing this job

41:14.351 --> 41:18.396
and a cop's never once handed me
a get-out-of-jail card.

41:19.982 --> 41:24.527
Especially when that cop's got a history
with the ADA who put my guy away.

41:25.905 --> 41:30.200
This isn't about Miguel Prado.
It's about doing what's right.

41:31.410 --> 41:33.870
Well, I'll take "yes" for an answer then.

41:37.166 --> 41:39.167
Prado know you're coming to me
with this?

41:39.293 --> 41:40.960
(Mouths) No.

41:41.086 --> 41:42.504
Guess he'll find out.

41:43.923 --> 41:45.465
(Both chuckle)

41:46.634 --> 41:48.426
Well, you better be wearing old clothes,

41:48.552 --> 41:51.471
because the shit is gonna be flying
in your direction.

41:51.597 --> 41:53.640
Hmm.

41:54.433 --> 41:57.769
- Hmm?
- Whoa. (Laughs)

41:57.895 --> 41:59.354
Cupcakes and Scotch.

42:00.814 --> 42:01.898
Yes.

42:03.567 --> 42:04.776
Come on.

42:07.029 --> 42:08.154
Two fingers.

42:08.280 --> 42:09.989
Ah.

42:10.115 --> 42:13.243
(Southern accent) Yeah, I'm tellin' you,
I saw Freebo again.

42:13.369 --> 42:15.828
No, man, I'm not comin' in.

42:15.955 --> 42:18.873
Fine, I'll meet you.
You got a favorite bar?

42:18.999 --> 42:22.919
Yeah, I know it. Order me a rum and Coke.
I'll be there in ten.

42:23.045 --> 42:26.130
You can lead a horse to water,
but you can't make him drink.

42:26.257 --> 42:29.676
Unless you order his favourite
and keep him waiting.

42:29.802 --> 42:31.970
And waiting.

42:36.809 --> 42:37.892
Hey.

42:38.018 --> 42:39.727
So the nut job went.

42:39.853 --> 42:43.731
She said she caved his head in
to preserve their love.

42:43.857 --> 42:46.109
Good work.
How about I buy you a drink?

42:46.944 --> 42:49.404
How about you kiss my ass?

42:49.530 --> 42:52.991
Next time you're playing good cop/bad cop,
you fucking let me know I'm playing too.

42:53.117 --> 42:56.744
- I'm sorry about that.
- When'd you figure out she did it?

42:56.870 --> 43:00.707
I had a hunch from the beginning.
But I wasn't sure until you were.

43:00.833 --> 43:03.835
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Cause you'd have blown it.

43:03.961 --> 43:05.753
So fuck you.

43:05.879 --> 43:10.383
Morgan, you got one tool in your toolbox
and that's a hammer.

43:10.509 --> 43:14.053
You can't help yourself.
So I played off it, and it worked.

43:16.473 --> 43:19.225
You just don't have a poker face yet.

43:19.351 --> 43:21.019
Maybe yours is a little too good.

43:31.071 --> 43:32.780
Don't you have a life?

43:32.906 --> 43:35.116
(Scoffs) Not lately.

43:35.242 --> 43:36.409
Whew.

43:36.535 --> 43:39.120
I needed to talk to you about Ramon.

43:39.246 --> 43:42.081
Yeah, I heard he made a scene. Sorry.

43:42.207 --> 43:44.667
Actually, it was an eye-opener.

43:48.964 --> 43:51.049
Made me realize you were right.

43:52.176 --> 43:54.719
- About?
- Telling him...

43:55.638 --> 43:57.055
About Freebo.

43:59.224 --> 44:03.436
He's putting his career at risk.
And it could hurt your reputation.

44:03.562 --> 44:05.146
I'm not gonna be responsible for that.

44:05.272 --> 44:07.815
Don't worry.
Ramon will always put family first.

44:07.941 --> 44:10.109
We worked too hard
to get to where we are.

44:10.235 --> 44:13.279
- He would never jeopardize that.
- And we can trust him?

44:15.240 --> 44:17.617
He's in a lot of pain.

44:19.411 --> 44:22.872
Which we can end. Tonight.

44:25.042 --> 44:26.834
- Dex...
- Please.

44:26.960 --> 44:29.003
Just call him.

44:35.552 --> 44:38.179
Hey, Ramon, what are you up to?

44:38.305 --> 44:41.599
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

44:43.769 --> 44:47.689
Why don't you just get the bartender
to call you a taxi, or I'll...

44:47.815 --> 44:49.482
(Ramon) Nah, fuck you, Miguel.

44:49.608 --> 44:52.485
The motherfucking bartender
won't even give me...

44:54.655 --> 44:55.822
Fuck.

44:55.948 --> 44:57.990
(Overlapping chatter)

45:07.584 --> 45:10.086
Having a big night, huh?

45:10.212 --> 45:15.049
What I'm having is another drink,
but this prick is trying to cut me off.

45:15.175 --> 45:17.677
- Oh, and you're here.
- Boys' night out.

45:17.803 --> 45:19.846
So why don't we just
all go back to my place?

45:19.972 --> 45:22.890
- We can have Syl make a little...
- I'm not going to your place.

45:23.016 --> 45:25.226
I'm not gonna let Sara
and the kids see you like this.

45:25.352 --> 45:27.395
Like you're some kind
of example in this family?

45:27.521 --> 45:30.106
Turning your back on Oscarito!

45:30.232 --> 45:34.235
Oye, this is not the place.
Now, you know that.

45:34.361 --> 45:36.070
Tell me something.

45:36.196 --> 45:39.866
Why are you running your mouth about
family business to a goddamn stranger?

45:39.992 --> 45:43.453
Dexter is not the problem here, Ramon.
Now, come on, please.

45:43.579 --> 45:47.957
The two of you coming in here like some
fucking kind of Batman and Robin.

45:48.083 --> 45:49.083
Whoa.

45:49.209 --> 45:51.586
Keep your fucking hands
off of me, pendejo.

45:51.712 --> 45:53.546
I'm sorry, Dexter. I got this.

45:53.672 --> 45:54.797
You sure?

45:54.923 --> 45:56.424
He said fuck off.

45:58.719 --> 46:00.136
I'm gonna get another drink.

46:00.262 --> 46:03.723
Hey, that guy over there, the drunk one,
he just put his hand on that girl.

46:03.849 --> 46:06.642
She's pretty upset,
and I think I saw a gun.

46:20.657 --> 46:24.327
I take no pleasure
in manipulating Miguel this way.

46:24.453 --> 46:28.164
Still, I think he'd prefer it
to my usuaI aIternative.

46:33.462 --> 46:34.754
(Yuki) Hey.

46:34.880 --> 46:37.423
You didn't return my last text.

46:40.302 --> 46:43.596
Well, I guess I ran out of ways to say
I won't be your fuckin' rat.

46:44.723 --> 46:46.849
Heard you and Quinn
had a tricky case.

46:46.975 --> 46:48.851
I just filed the report.

46:48.977 --> 46:50.728
Yeah, I just read it.

46:50.854 --> 46:55.525
According to the report, Quinn
cracked the case mostly on his own,

46:55.651 --> 46:57.860
and I'm wondering why someone
hoping to get her shield

46:57.986 --> 46:59.821
would let him write it up that way.

47:01.323 --> 47:04.951
I wrote the goddamn report.
Not him.

47:05.077 --> 47:06.953
He got the confession, so it's his win.

47:07.079 --> 47:09.413
Unless he used you.

47:10.666 --> 47:12.041
You see, he's good at that.

47:12.167 --> 47:16.671
You partner with him, you trust him, then
sooner or later, you're questioning yourself.

47:16.797 --> 47:20.716
I mean, he's such a great guy.
It can't be him.

47:20.843 --> 47:26.264
Except the only question he's asking
is how everything can benefit him.

47:34.356 --> 47:37.024
(Engine starts)

47:55.711 --> 47:58.546
Hey, breakfast.

47:58.672 --> 48:01.007
Thanks for coming.

48:07.222 --> 48:11.559
We used to play on this beach right here.
Me, Ramon, Oscar.

48:12.269 --> 48:13.603
Sounds fun.

48:13.729 --> 48:15.897
Ah, we had each other.

48:16.023 --> 48:17.440
Always have.

48:20.193 --> 48:23.070
No matter what kind
of horrible shit you would pull,

48:24.448 --> 48:28.075
they knew you inside-out,
the good and the bad.

48:29.411 --> 48:32.455
And they were there for you,
no matter what.

48:35.042 --> 48:37.084
I never had that.

48:39.254 --> 48:41.589
Maybe you're lucky
you don't have it to lose.

48:44.968 --> 48:47.261
You won't be left with a gaping hole.

48:48.263 --> 48:52.224
No, there are still holes.
I just find other ways to fill them.

48:55.979 --> 49:00.816
I lost Oscar to drugs
long before he was killed.

49:00.943 --> 49:02.526
And now I'm losing Ramon.

49:02.653 --> 49:04.737
I can't fool myself.

49:07.532 --> 49:08.950
He can't be trusted.

49:10.994 --> 49:12.536
It's like...

49:13.455 --> 49:15.164
Coño...

49:15.290 --> 49:17.458
I only have one person
I can trust any more.

49:19.211 --> 49:21.337
Yourself.

49:21.463 --> 49:24.298
(Scoffs) I was thinking of you.

49:29.137 --> 49:30.680
- Oh.
- Oh, don't worry.

49:30.806 --> 49:33.307
I know that trust
doesn't come too easy to you.

49:35.435 --> 49:38.104
- Is it that obvious?
- Well, to me.

49:39.189 --> 49:43.651
I can just see that you're used
to carrying your secrets to yourself.

49:45.278 --> 49:47.321
(Chuckles)

49:48.657 --> 49:52.368
- Tends to be safer that way.
- But it's a hell of a burden, man.

49:53.704 --> 49:55.830
See, I'm used to having a brother.

49:56.873 --> 49:59.250
Share the load.

50:08.385 --> 50:10.469
I'm hoping maybe
you'll get used to it too.

50:14.016 --> 50:16.142
To be a brother.

50:18.186 --> 50:20.312
To have a friend.

50:23.859 --> 50:26.110
To have a wife, a family.

50:32.951 --> 50:35.286
Fiona wanted it so bad
she invented it,

50:35.412 --> 50:38.039
played all the parts herself.

50:41.918 --> 50:45.421
But if you play a role long enough,
really commit,

50:45.547 --> 50:48.049
does it ever become real?

50:53.221 --> 50:55.639
Could I become real?

51:00.520 --> 51:02.438
Hi, Dexter.

51:02.564 --> 51:04.398
(Rita) Dexter?

51:04.524 --> 51:06.484
This is a surprise. You didn't call.

51:08.904 --> 51:11.072
Is everything all right?

51:17.079 --> 51:18.537
Dexter, what is it?

51:20.415 --> 51:24.168
My life has always felt like...

51:24.294 --> 51:25.753
an unanswered question.

51:28.006 --> 51:32.968
A string of days and nights,
waiting for something to happen, but...

51:33.095 --> 51:34.386
I didn't know what.

51:34.513 --> 51:37.306
(Whispering)
Why is he acting so weird?

51:37.432 --> 51:39.642
(Whispering) I don't know.

51:44.106 --> 51:45.856
Rita, we're connected.

51:45.982 --> 51:48.818
Wherever I am...

51:50.445 --> 51:52.154
I feel you...

51:54.074 --> 51:55.616
and the kids...

51:56.743 --> 51:58.119
With me.

51:59.579 --> 52:00.996
You're what makes me real.

52:04.126 --> 52:06.502
I want us to...

52:06.628 --> 52:08.671
always go out for banana splits.

52:10.132 --> 52:13.551
And replant the lemon tree
that keeps dying.

52:13.677 --> 52:16.262
And I never, ever
want to miss a pizza night.

52:19.057 --> 52:22.810
And that's how I know
I want to marry you.

52:22.936 --> 52:26.230
Because something as simple
as pizza night is the highlight of my week.

52:28.567 --> 52:30.276
But not without the kids.

52:32.404 --> 52:34.572
Cody, Astor,

52:34.698 --> 52:36.866
you guys are my family.

52:39.411 --> 52:41.495
I'm gonna hang on to you for dear life.

52:44.708 --> 52:47.042
Please, say yes.

52:53.758 --> 52:55.259
Yes!

52:55.385 --> 52:56.677
Yes, we will marry you.

53:05.145 --> 53:10.524
Most actors toil in obscurity,
never stepping into the spotlight.

53:10.650 --> 53:12.359
But if you hone your craft,

53:12.485 --> 53:14.069
work diligently,

53:14.196 --> 53:19.366
you might just find yourself
cast in the role of a lifetime.
