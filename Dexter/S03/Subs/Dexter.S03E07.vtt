WEBVTT

00:02.465 --> 00:03.507
Previously on Dexter.

00:03.633 --> 00:05.509
(LaGuerta) Remember Camilla
from Records?

00:05.635 --> 00:08.262
She's in the hospital. Lung cancer.
It's terminal.

00:08.388 --> 00:11.807
Dying I can do.
The pain sure is a bear, though.

00:11.933 --> 00:13.017
I'll bet.

00:13.143 --> 00:18.230
(Camilla) My whole life, I've been searching
for the perfect Key lime pie.

00:18.356 --> 00:20.858
How about you start work tomorrow?
I need an assistant.

00:20.984 --> 00:23.402
Having someone I can trust
is everything.

00:23.528 --> 00:28.532
Barbara Gianna here.
So happens, uh, I'm hungry.

00:28.658 --> 00:30.701
Are you asking me out
on a date, Detective?

00:30.827 --> 00:34.747
- Anton is my contact.
- I know how to work a CI, Quinn.

00:34.873 --> 00:37.708
(Debra) Skinner struck again.
The victim's name was Wendell Owens.

00:37.834 --> 00:38.834
He was 15-years-old.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.795
I can't rule out that I put Wendell
in the crosshairs.

00:41.921 --> 00:45.215
He trusted me enough to cooperate,
and look what happened to him.

00:45.341 --> 00:47.676
Hey, look. Don't beat yourself up.

00:48.470 --> 00:51.472
Real reason she's blindfolded
is so she doesn't have to watch everything

00:51.598 --> 00:54.391
she stands for get pissed on
by people like Ellen Wolf.

00:54.517 --> 00:58.395
(Ellen) Miguel has been playing fast and
loose with legal ethics for a long time.

00:58.521 --> 01:01.732
And you've set the stage for your smear
campaign against a stand-up guy.

01:01.858 --> 01:05.944
You ever wanna hear the unexpurgated
version of your guy, come find me, OK?

01:06.071 --> 01:08.113
- We've picked up Ramon Prado.
- For what?

01:08.239 --> 01:11.075
(Quinn) Kidnapping,
false imprisonment and torture.

01:11.201 --> 01:12.201
(Screams)

01:12.327 --> 01:14.411
Internal Affairs is investigating you.

01:14.537 --> 01:16.580
- You're finally telling me?
- I'm finally telling you.

01:16.706 --> 01:19.792
Do you wanna tell me why this IA chick
is so gung ho to bring you down?

01:19.918 --> 01:21.543
Yuki and I have a history.

01:22.462 --> 01:23.504
Hola, amigo.

01:23.630 --> 01:27.216
(Dexter) I can honestIy say I know
who Miguel Prado really is.

01:27.342 --> 01:31.053
My first good friend. And those are
in short supply these days.

03:26.544 --> 03:28.420
(Door opens)

03:30.298 --> 03:31.715
Dad?

03:31.841 --> 03:34.176
You need to throw up...again?

03:40.808 --> 03:42.517
I'm feeling great, amigo.

03:45.271 --> 03:49.441
- How long till you're done in here?
- Not long.

03:49.567 --> 03:51.026
Great. I'll wait.

03:59.369 --> 04:03.664
We'll play a quick nine
when you've finished.

04:05.917 --> 04:08.335
Work on that slice of yours.

04:11.798 --> 04:13.799
Uh.

04:14.676 --> 04:16.718
Nightmare?

04:18.680 --> 04:20.555
Not sure.

04:24.394 --> 04:28.355
You ever have those dreams
where you're exposed?

04:28.481 --> 04:30.649
All the time.

04:30.775 --> 04:32.901
I show up at school bottomless.

04:33.903 --> 04:36.321
Body parts out in the open. Exactly.

04:38.574 --> 04:40.617
It's an anxiety dream.

04:40.743 --> 04:42.995
It's probably about the wedding.

04:44.122 --> 04:45.664
That must be it.

04:45.790 --> 04:48.041
It's a stressful time.

04:48.167 --> 04:50.585
But, hey, we got each other, right?

04:53.840 --> 04:55.632
Mmm.

04:55.758 --> 04:57.634
Except l'm not stressed.

04:57.760 --> 04:58.927
Not about Miguel.

04:59.053 --> 05:03.140
He hasn't seen what Harry saw, but so far,
he hasn't turned away from my truth.

05:03.266 --> 05:04.558
He's embraced it.

05:04.684 --> 05:09.187
There's so much to do to pull off this
wedding before the baby starts showing.

05:09.314 --> 05:11.064
I'm good at taking directions.

05:11.190 --> 05:14.026
Good, because I need your guest list.

05:15.153 --> 05:19.323
And your head count so we can pick
a venue and give a budget to the caterer.

05:19.449 --> 05:22.409
Well, there's Deb and, uh...

05:25.621 --> 05:28.081
Deb, that's it. That's my list.

05:29.959 --> 05:31.835
That's it?

05:31.961 --> 05:33.712
What about your friends?

05:33.838 --> 05:35.630
Angel, Vince?

05:35.757 --> 05:37.674
Miguel.

05:38.718 --> 05:39.676
He's a friend.

05:39.802 --> 05:41.678
See, you're on a roll.

05:42.638 --> 05:44.848
Just make sure
you get names, addresses,

05:44.974 --> 05:46.433
spouses and plus ones.

05:46.559 --> 05:48.393
OK.

05:48.519 --> 05:49.811
I gotta go.

05:49.937 --> 05:52.022
They're moving Camilla
to hospice care today.

05:52.148 --> 05:53.774
I wanna stop by before work.

05:53.900 --> 05:56.443
You've been going there a lot.
You holding up OK?

05:56.569 --> 05:57.903
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

05:58.029 --> 06:02.324
Well, I know you two were close.
Just give her my best.

06:03.659 --> 06:05.535
Mm-hm.

06:05.661 --> 06:09.915
Those cIosest to me have aIways
resided in a box of slides...

06:10.041 --> 06:11.833
until now.

06:20.593 --> 06:25.222
Ooh, how about we pop
some wheelies, boys?

06:25.348 --> 06:29.351
After all, it is the last ride of my life.

06:30.686 --> 06:32.729
You'll be around a long time, Camilla.

06:32.855 --> 06:35.607
Sure as hell better not be.

06:37.652 --> 06:40.487
- You need anything else, just let me know.
- OK.

06:44.033 --> 06:48.328
This... This is the room, Dexter.

06:49.664 --> 06:52.290
The room I'm gonna die in.

06:53.709 --> 06:55.627
The sooner the better.

06:57.713 --> 07:00.257
Well, it's nice.

07:00.383 --> 07:01.633
It's got wallpaper.

07:03.719 --> 07:05.595
That shoebox there.

07:06.764 --> 07:08.723
Get it for me, will you?

07:16.107 --> 07:19.151
I thought you might like to have those.

07:21.696 --> 07:23.905
She loved taking pictures.

07:24.031 --> 07:29.953
Documented every bridge game
we played with Harry and Doris.

07:30.079 --> 07:32.622
Drove me batty with that camera.

07:34.083 --> 07:37.586
But it's nice seeing these now.

07:38.963 --> 07:41.173
Dexter - The Awkward Years.

07:42.383 --> 07:43.925
And now look at you.

07:44.051 --> 07:46.386
Engaged.

07:46.512 --> 07:49.264
Baby on the way.

07:51.267 --> 07:52.976
I'd love to meet Rita.

07:53.102 --> 07:54.728
We'll make that happen.

07:56.189 --> 07:58.690
And that envelope there.

08:00.067 --> 08:02.611
Those are my funeral plans.

08:04.113 --> 08:05.489
I thought I was organized.

08:05.615 --> 08:08.658
Simple Catholic service. Nothing fancy.

08:10.077 --> 08:11.953
It's all arranged.

08:13.998 --> 08:17.667
What family I have left lives up north.

08:17.793 --> 08:20.504
If you wouldn't mind

08:20.630 --> 08:25.008
calling the funeral director
when the time comes.

08:25.134 --> 08:27.469
They'll take care of everything.

08:28.304 --> 08:30.263
Sure, OK.

08:30.389 --> 08:31.806
Isn't this a bit...

08:31.933 --> 08:34.976
What, morbid?

08:37.355 --> 08:40.357
Death will be a mercy, Dexter.

08:40.483 --> 08:44.861
No more pain, no more chemo.

08:44.987 --> 08:47.864
Just...peace.

08:47.990 --> 08:50.659
And the best part?

08:52.828 --> 08:56.248
I'll get to see Gene.

09:00.002 --> 09:02.254
(Sighs)

09:02.380 --> 09:05.048
I gotta get to work,
but I'm gonna be back later, OK?

09:05.174 --> 09:06.633
Don't forget.

09:06.759 --> 09:13.890
You promised to find me
the perfect Key lime pie.

09:16.269 --> 09:18.353
Better move fast.

09:28.239 --> 09:30.907
Where can I get a good Key lime pie?

09:31.033 --> 09:33.326
You can't.
They all taste like sour dog shit.

09:33.452 --> 09:34.744
It's Camilla's favorite.

09:34.870 --> 09:36.913
How's she doing?

09:37.039 --> 09:39.416
She doesn't have much time left.
You should go visit her.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.251
I don't do sick people.

09:41.377 --> 09:42.919
I can't.

09:43.045 --> 09:45.714
Reminds me too much of Mom.

09:49.051 --> 09:51.720
What's Miguel Prado doing here?

09:53.055 --> 09:56.558
He is pulling his brother Ramon
out of some deep doody.

09:56.684 --> 10:00.437
We bust him for kidnap and torture
and he's just gonna walk right outta here.

10:01.606 --> 10:05.442
Fucker's lucky he's got
an ADA in the family.

10:05.568 --> 10:07.444
It was an off-the-grid investigation.

10:07.570 --> 10:09.070
Is that what you call false imprisonment?

10:09.196 --> 10:11.489
I'm not gonna get railroaded
for doing your department's job.

10:11.616 --> 10:14.909
Ramon, if you don't take this offer,
you're looking at jail time here, OK?

10:15.036 --> 10:17.120
The prick isn't even
pressing charges, Miguel.

10:17.246 --> 10:22.208
My detectives will! Unless they know you're
not walking around with a badge and a gun.

10:22.335 --> 10:25.754
What, I give you my shield and then what?
What the hell am I supposed to do?

10:25.880 --> 10:27.255
Get some help!

10:28.841 --> 10:32.093
Hermano...you don't have
a lot of options here, OK?

10:33.721 --> 10:37.182
It's early retirement with benefits.
Union won't be able to do better.

10:37.308 --> 10:38.975
Listen to your PBA rep, will you?

10:39.101 --> 10:41.227
And keep the Prado name
out of the papers, right?

10:42.938 --> 10:46.691
You really wanna put Sara
and the kids through all that?

11:01.248 --> 11:04.334
I'll deliver these to his captain,
start the paperwork.

11:04.460 --> 11:07.754
- Appreciate the consideration, Lieutenant.
- Yeah, OK.

11:14.512 --> 11:16.680
This really would have been bad for me.

11:18.683 --> 11:22.811
On top of the Ellen Wolf accusations,
the Chicky Hines case...

11:22.937 --> 11:26.106
Chicky Hines wasn't personal, Miguel.

11:27.858 --> 11:30.193
Yeah.

11:30.319 --> 11:33.071
Helping Ramon, that was personal.

11:33.197 --> 11:34.322
Thank you.

11:43.791 --> 11:47.335
- Tense in there.
- A lot tenser in here.

11:48.045 --> 11:50.171
I gotta blow off some steam.

11:50.923 --> 11:54.092
After work, you and me,
we're gonna go hit something...

11:54.218 --> 11:55.176
hard.

11:55.302 --> 11:57.721
- We are?
- At the driving range.

11:57.847 --> 12:00.807
Golf, right.
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

12:06.439 --> 12:10.108
So, what, you and the ADA,
you're pals now?

12:11.360 --> 12:13.737
Yeah, we are.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.697
Kiss-ass.

12:17.158 --> 12:19.451
Another crack like that
and you're off the list.

12:21.203 --> 12:23.747
FamiIy and friends...

12:23.873 --> 12:26.624
I see these peopIe every day,
but if they reaIIy knew me,

12:26.751 --> 12:28.710
they'd hardIy caII me friend.

12:28.836 --> 12:30.837
MigueI might be the exception.

12:30.963 --> 12:35.425
So when I say the Skinner is a top priority,
I expect progress.

12:35.551 --> 12:37.051
Understood?

12:37.178 --> 12:39.053
Now where are we
on the national database?

12:39.180 --> 12:42.557
- We ran it. Nothing came back.
- Got a call into Interpol too.

12:42.683 --> 12:44.476
Should l invite Quinn?

12:44.602 --> 12:47.270
He's so...tan.

12:47.396 --> 12:50.064
(Batista) First, someone loaned
Freebo some money

12:50.191 --> 12:52.567
and is willing to skin people
to get it back.

12:52.693 --> 12:56.446
That same someone is drafting off
our investigation. We are being watched.

12:56.572 --> 12:59.282
(Batista) Which is why I wanna use
our CI more aggressively.

12:59.408 --> 13:00.450
You mean Anton?

13:00.576 --> 13:03.453
Yeah, we're gonna spread the word
that Anton knows where Freebo is.

13:03.579 --> 13:04.913
You're gonna use him as bait?

13:05.039 --> 13:08.374
Ramos, Soderquist, I wanna put Anton
under surveillance immediately.

13:09.585 --> 13:12.086
That's his name. Soderquist.

13:12.213 --> 13:14.380
You're gonna tell him, right?

13:14.507 --> 13:16.382
All due respect, Sarge,
we tell him, he bolts.

13:16.509 --> 13:18.676
Two of my witnesses have turned up dead.
You wanna see a third?

13:18.803 --> 13:21.471
Anton's already got
a target on his back by helping us.

13:21.597 --> 13:23.640
- This will protect him.
- Yeah, right.

13:23.766 --> 13:27.811
OK, look. I'm gonna keep Anton
in the dark for now.

13:27.937 --> 13:31.105
But I want eyes on him at all times.
Understand?

13:34.109 --> 13:35.568
- Hey, Deb?
- What?

13:35.694 --> 13:37.445
Are you gonna bring
a date to the wedding?

13:37.571 --> 13:41.074
I don't know, Dex. I might be too busy
picking up pieces of Anton's skin

13:41.200 --> 13:42.826
to even be there.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.494
So you're a "maybe"?

13:44.620 --> 13:47.330
Morgan. Her.

13:47.456 --> 13:50.792
Wendell Owens's mom called. Sounds like
she has something on his murder. I'll drive.

13:50.918 --> 13:52.252
Do not invite Quinn.

13:52.378 --> 13:53.503
No Quinn.

13:53.629 --> 13:55.547
(Masuka) Yo, Morgan.

13:55.673 --> 13:58.591
Him. Grab your kit, buddy.
We got a crime scene.

14:01.095 --> 14:03.012
(Debra) Ah!

14:03.973 --> 14:05.640
Fucking mess.

14:08.352 --> 14:11.020
City pays for the tree trimming
but not the cleanup.

14:11.146 --> 14:13.815
(Quinn) We all can't live in high-class
neighborhoods, Morgan.

14:13.941 --> 14:17.151
Yeah, I'm sure you live
in a real dump, Mr. Cadillac.

14:20.489 --> 14:23.908
Ms. Owens, I understand you have some
new information about your son's murder?

14:24.034 --> 14:26.661
Yes, I do. I found this.

14:33.335 --> 14:34.335
That's my card.

14:34.461 --> 14:36.546
It was in Wendell's shorts.

14:37.923 --> 14:40.174
The ones he was wearing that night.

14:40.301 --> 14:42.302
The ones he got killed in.

14:42.428 --> 14:44.971
- I am so sorry for your loss.
- You stay the hell away from me!

14:45.097 --> 14:47.098
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:48.350 --> 14:50.226
- I didn't mean to...
- You didn't mean to what?

14:50.352 --> 14:54.606
You came to my house.
You talked to my son and I told you not to!

14:55.357 --> 14:57.025
You gotta go back inside.

15:03.032 --> 15:07.035
You led that animal here.
Right here to my only baby.

15:10.539 --> 15:13.082
And now he's gone.

15:14.710 --> 15:17.003
Wendell is gone because of you!

15:17.129 --> 15:18.254
He's gone!

15:18.380 --> 15:20.798
(Sobbing)

15:27.681 --> 15:32.352
Marriage, children.
You never expect it to end in tragedy.

15:33.062 --> 15:35.563
UnIess you're me.

15:35.689 --> 15:41.110
I want all civilians cleared off the street.
We're gonna be rolling out a body.

15:41.236 --> 15:45.323
Lisa Morton. College valedictorian
on her way to Harvard Business School.

15:46.325 --> 15:49.118
Found the murder weapon.
Under the sofa.

15:49.244 --> 15:51.245
Screwdriver's consistent
with the wound.

15:51.372 --> 15:53.539
(Batista) The perp must have used it
to jimmy the front window.

15:53.666 --> 15:56.751
I figure the girl heard it,
came down to check it out,

15:56.877 --> 15:59.629
took a swing at the perp,
missed, knocked over the lamp.

15:59.755 --> 16:02.924
The perp freaked, stabbed her, ran.

16:03.425 --> 16:06.636
Apparently without shoes.
These are sock prints.

16:06.762 --> 16:09.430
- Socks?
- Yeah, looks like he cut himself.

16:09.556 --> 16:11.975
Or stepped on the victim's blood.

16:12.101 --> 16:16.145
No, if it was hers the prints would become
less saturated as he ran away

16:16.271 --> 16:18.356
and got back to the window.

16:18.482 --> 16:21.109
But they're more saturated, see?

16:21.235 --> 16:23.027
Blood belongs to our guy.

16:23.153 --> 16:24.654
Fucking socks.

16:24.780 --> 16:27.824
Run it through the criminal database,
see if anything gets kicked back.

16:27.950 --> 16:32.120
I'll bet you a night of lap dances
I already know who did it.

16:32.246 --> 16:33.913
Albert Chung.

16:35.040 --> 16:38.543
Got arrested six months ago on a B&E.
Knocked an old lady down some stairs...

16:38.669 --> 16:41.879
and he did it all in his socks.

16:42.006 --> 16:44.882
Same old lady, identifies
the wrong guy in the line-up,

16:45.009 --> 16:46.092
shoeless schmo walked.

16:46.218 --> 16:49.053
How do you remember that?
It wasn't even a homicide.

16:49.179 --> 16:51.431
Chung is Asian, bro.
He makes us all look bad.

16:52.558 --> 16:55.393
And taking off his shoes?
Can anyone get more cliché?

16:56.311 --> 16:59.939
Well, he probably did it to keep quiet
or to not leave shoeprints.

17:00.065 --> 17:02.734
So he leaves sock prints.

17:02.860 --> 17:04.318
Frickin' moron.

17:05.195 --> 17:07.196
And Asians are supposed to be smart.

17:07.322 --> 17:10.033
(Chuckling)

17:10.159 --> 17:11.659
Fuckin' Albert Chung.

17:12.953 --> 17:14.871
Fucking Albert Chung.

17:15.831 --> 17:17.957
(Miguel) Fucking Albert Chung.

17:19.043 --> 17:21.753
First, an old lady,
now a college valedictorian.

17:21.879 --> 17:24.338
Well, we've matched his DNA
to the blood at the crime scene.

17:24.465 --> 17:27.800
Mug shots on every media outlet.
Someone will turn him in.

17:27.926 --> 17:31.387
(Sighs) First I got Ramon
drinking himself into a stupor,

17:31.513 --> 17:34.724
then I got Syl nagging me for attention,

17:34.850 --> 17:37.477
and I got scumbags like
Albert Chung running free.

17:37.603 --> 17:39.479
Well, the department's working
on that last one.

17:39.605 --> 17:43.024
And what if they do catch him, eh?
Then what?

17:43.150 --> 17:45.234
His attorney got him off once.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.361
I'll lay you odds
that Chung walks again.

17:48.363 --> 17:50.198
¡Coño!

17:51.200 --> 17:53.242
No. You and I...

17:53.368 --> 17:56.079
we should take
care of this ourselves.

17:56.205 --> 17:59.916
There's a lot of wrong in the world, Dex.
Just ask Lisa Morton's parents.

18:01.043 --> 18:02.085
Argh.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.045
Slice.

18:04.171 --> 18:09.133
I guess it can't hurt to keep tabs on Chung
if the police can't bring him in on their own.

18:09.259 --> 18:12.929
Hell, let them have Albert Chung.
He's just the symptom.

18:13.055 --> 18:17.266
We need to go after the root cause. The one
responsible for putting him on the streets.

18:17.392 --> 18:20.436
His blood-sucking, soulless,
defense attorney...

18:20.562 --> 18:22.021
Ellen Wolf!

18:25.067 --> 18:28.486
She...got her client off.
Isn't that herjob?

18:28.612 --> 18:30.780
Herjob is to uphold the law.

18:30.906 --> 18:34.408
But Ellen Wolf, she twists and bends
the law until it's unrecognizable.

18:34.535 --> 18:36.953
Has she, uh...

18:37.663 --> 18:39.622
ever actually killed anyone?

18:39.748 --> 18:42.959
Chung wasn't the first evil fuck
that she put back on the streets.

18:43.085 --> 18:45.169
The body count is piling up!

18:45.295 --> 18:48.381
If she hasn't done the deed
with her own hands...

18:49.216 --> 18:52.093
- Dexter, you're being too literal.
- I don't think I am.

18:52.219 --> 18:54.345
Do me a favor, OK?

18:54.471 --> 18:56.514
Keep an open mind about her.

18:56.640 --> 19:00.977
Let me show you some files.
No pressure. Just research.

19:04.314 --> 19:06.274
Move your back foot to the left.

19:10.112 --> 19:11.696
Excellent!

19:11.822 --> 19:13.197
Yes.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.451
EIIen WoIf doesn't fit my usuaI code,

19:17.578 --> 19:21.664
but in the interest of friendship
I said I'd keep an open mind.

19:21.790 --> 19:25.626
CamiIIa's request for the perfect
Key Iime pie is much Iess compIicated.

19:25.961 --> 19:29.422
(Camilla) I'm not eating this crap.
Get it out of here! Get it out of my room!

19:29.548 --> 19:32.925
All right, honey, it's gone.
Don't you worry.

19:33.051 --> 19:35.845
- (Coughing)
- She's having a hard day.

19:35.971 --> 19:38.055
Got some news.

19:49.151 --> 19:51.152
Bad news, huh?

19:52.237 --> 19:53.196
Tumors worse?

19:53.322 --> 19:55.323
No.

19:56.491 --> 19:59.285
It's slowing, Goddamn it.

19:59.411 --> 20:02.455
Doctors gave me another month.

20:03.832 --> 20:07.793
Another month of struggling to breathe,

20:07.920 --> 20:10.713
of shitting myself,

20:10.839 --> 20:15.718
of this stupid fucking wallpaper.

20:15.844 --> 20:19.180
I'm...I'm sorry.

20:19.306 --> 20:22.433
I already lived through this with Gene.

20:22.559 --> 20:25.144
The end-stage.

20:26.021 --> 20:29.774
All I want is to be
on the other side of it.

20:31.526 --> 20:33.277
He at least had me.

20:33.403 --> 20:35.446
And you have me.

20:37.032 --> 20:39.825
I'll bring you as many Key lime pies
as you can stand.

20:42.454 --> 20:45.248
Gene wanted me
to end his life, you know?

20:49.878 --> 20:52.546
I would have done it if I could have.

20:54.174 --> 20:56.092
It's kind of illegal.

20:56.218 --> 20:58.719
It's more than illegal.

20:58.845 --> 21:01.722
It's a mortal sin to us Catholics.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.685
One-way ticket to hell.

21:08.605 --> 21:12.984
I can't take my own life either.

21:14.778 --> 21:16.904
But...

21:20.242 --> 21:22.451
you're not Catholic.

21:22.577 --> 21:24.495
No.

21:24.621 --> 21:26.956
I'm definitely not Catholic.

21:28.458 --> 21:32.461
But I do live by a certain code.

21:32.587 --> 21:34.588
Of course you do.

21:34.715 --> 21:39.427
Harry...taught you right.

21:41.138 --> 21:45.224
So what I'm about to ask you is...

21:47.311 --> 21:50.146
the most terrible thing anyone could...

21:50.272 --> 21:51.564
Camilla, I don't...

21:51.690 --> 21:54.108
Just...help me.

21:55.527 --> 21:57.778
Please.

22:00.449 --> 22:02.616
You're strong.

22:04.286 --> 22:06.412
And a good friend.

22:07.622 --> 22:11.834
No, don't...
don't answer now.

22:11.960 --> 22:15.504
Just think about it.

22:15.630 --> 22:18.466
(Weeping)

22:20.886 --> 22:22.470
(Coughing and wheezing)

22:35.484 --> 22:39.236
She couldn't have asked a better person.
Taking Iives is what I do.

22:39.363 --> 22:43.741
But never someone innocent,
and certainIy not a friend.

23:08.558 --> 23:10.351
Get in.

23:15.565 --> 23:18.526
What's so important you had to see me
at the ass-crack of dawn?

23:18.652 --> 23:21.237
Do you have any out-of-town relatives?

23:21.363 --> 23:23.739
Why, you wanna take
a vacation together?

23:27.869 --> 23:29.078
OK.

23:29.204 --> 23:31.247
What's going on?

23:32.207 --> 23:33.666
Uh...

23:36.420 --> 23:38.546
I heard a rumor about you.

23:39.714 --> 23:41.590
That you know where Freebo is.

23:41.716 --> 23:43.259
You know that I don't.

23:43.385 --> 23:45.678
I'm just telling you what I heard.

23:46.596 --> 23:48.472
And the other cops heard it too.

23:50.600 --> 23:54.603
Which means that the Skinner
will be looking for me.

23:54.729 --> 23:57.440
Shit. This shit is crazy.

23:57.732 --> 24:00.317
I've got nothing to do with Freebo
except for helping you,

24:00.444 --> 24:03.571
and no one knows about that
except for the cops.

24:05.574 --> 24:08.033
Wait, are you telling me...

24:08.160 --> 24:09.660
Am I being set up?

24:12.998 --> 24:16.292
Jesus. And here you are
asking me about out-of-town relatives.

24:16.418 --> 24:18.294
- Everybody's got one.
- So you want me to go?

24:18.420 --> 24:20.087
I want you to survive.

24:23.967 --> 24:26.844
I don't wanna lose a good CI, you know.

24:28.513 --> 24:32.349
Listen, you telling me...
me leaving...

24:33.602 --> 24:35.144
it's not gonna help you any.

24:35.270 --> 24:37.396
I'll find another lead.

24:38.648 --> 24:41.317
- So I guess I should go.
- Good.

24:44.613 --> 24:47.114
You watch that mouth of yours.

24:49.075 --> 24:50.534
Fuck you.

25:05.467 --> 25:09.011
The code has aIways been my guide.
Why should this be different?

25:09.137 --> 25:11.805
Taking an innocent life
couId be a dangerous precedent.

25:11.932 --> 25:14.808
I can't just change the ruIes for a friend.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.479
Or maybe I don't want to.

25:21.942 --> 25:24.818
But I can honor MigueI's request
to research Ellen Wolf.

25:24.945 --> 25:26.987
Keep an open mind.

25:27.822 --> 25:29.698
Murderers, rapists, carjackers

25:29.824 --> 25:32.326
set free to commit
more heinous crimes.

25:32.452 --> 25:36.997
Maybe my code couId incIude the person
who unleashed them on the world.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.001
(Cellphone ringing)

25:45.298 --> 25:46.215
Hey, you.

25:46.341 --> 25:47.883
Hey, did you get my messages?

25:48.009 --> 25:52.179
- The list. You need my list.
- ASAP.

25:53.515 --> 25:56.016
Working on it right now.

25:56.142 --> 25:58.185
Thank you, Dexter.

25:59.062 --> 26:00.813
(Sighs)

26:02.232 --> 26:05.234
We still don't have a head count,
so I can't start looking for a venue.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.361
It'll all get done, I promise.

26:07.487 --> 26:11.323
Just made an appointment with the florist.
We can drive by after Carapan.

26:11.449 --> 26:14.243
I'd be having a complete meltdown
if it wasn't for you, Syl.

26:14.369 --> 26:16.870
Believe me, I'm happy for the distraction.

26:16.997 --> 26:19.081
From what? You have such a charmed life.

26:19.207 --> 26:21.500
On the outside, in front of company.

26:21.626 --> 26:24.003
But Miguel, when we're alone he's...

26:24.129 --> 26:25.713
Syl, what?

26:26.590 --> 26:28.340
He just...

26:29.551 --> 26:31.218
He goes to this dark place.

26:31.636 --> 26:35.180
I know he lost his brother and now
his other brother's in trouble, but...

26:35.307 --> 26:38.726
- That would put a strain on anybody.
- But he's being secretive. He's never home.

26:38.852 --> 26:42.396
He says he's with Dexter, but...
I think it's a cover.

26:44.190 --> 26:46.317
Are you sure you're not reading into it?

26:46.443 --> 26:50.070
I went through the same thing with Dexter.
He was disappearing, acting weird.

26:50.196 --> 26:52.364
What happened?

26:52.490 --> 26:54.783
He was...

26:55.619 --> 26:57.119
He...

26:57.245 --> 26:58.912
He was...

26:59.831 --> 27:01.248
going through a difficult time.

27:01.374 --> 27:02.916
Rita, tell me.

27:06.171 --> 27:08.756
(Sighs)

27:10.258 --> 27:13.761
He was doing drugs
and he was having an affair.

27:13.887 --> 27:15.471
Dexter?

27:16.264 --> 27:18.974
God. If someone like Dexter can do that...

27:19.100 --> 27:21.727
Look, we hadn't defined
our relationship yet.

27:21.853 --> 27:23.854
It wasn't like you guys. It was different.

27:23.980 --> 27:26.273
But the important thing
is that I confronted him,

27:26.399 --> 27:29.068
we talked about it, and it actually
brought us closer together.

27:29.194 --> 27:31.737
You just confronted him?

27:31.863 --> 27:36.742
Well, I mean, if you don't deal with your
problems they only get bigger, right?

27:36.868 --> 27:39.745
Dexter? Really?

27:40.705 --> 27:42.873
I know, I know.

27:42.999 --> 27:46.502
There's no way your nickname
was worse than "Fatista".

27:46.628 --> 27:48.045
Cause "Gianna" just rolls off the...

27:48.171 --> 27:50.005
"Vagianna".

27:52.175 --> 27:54.259
OK, you win. Kids can be cruel.

27:54.386 --> 27:56.553
"Fatista", huh?

27:57.597 --> 28:00.099
You can call me whatever you want.

28:01.101 --> 28:02.434
Ah, too soon.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.561
It's OK. I'm very patient.

28:04.688 --> 28:06.647
Actually, Angel, I...

28:07.107 --> 28:09.858
I think you're great, but...

28:09.984 --> 28:12.403
"But". I hate that word.

28:12.529 --> 28:14.738
I like spending time with you.

28:14.864 --> 28:17.574
It's all right. You can say it.

28:18.159 --> 28:20.494
You want us to be just friends.

28:26.668 --> 28:30.713
I...I like our friendship.
You gonna make me feel bad for that?

28:30.839 --> 28:32.798
No. I like it too.

28:32.924 --> 28:34.299
But you want more.

28:34.426 --> 28:36.677
You gonna make me feel bad for that?

28:43.268 --> 28:45.936
- You rang?
- Ellen.

28:46.563 --> 28:48.063
I didn't expect you to come over.

28:48.189 --> 28:49.690
I didn't expect you to call.

28:53.528 --> 28:55.320
So?

28:58.241 --> 29:01.368
I'm starting to think
I'm too close to the Prado family.

29:03.037 --> 29:05.748
I know one side of them.
Maybe there's more.

29:05.874 --> 29:09.710
- There is.
- Such as?

29:09.836 --> 29:11.587
Broad strokes?

29:11.713 --> 29:15.174
Uh, missing evidence,
witness intimidation, jury tampering.

29:15.300 --> 29:18.135
I've got details.
You wanna hear 'em?

29:18.261 --> 29:22.598
- You have proof?
- He's a bad guy. He's not a stupid guy.

29:22.724 --> 29:24.558
Mmm.

29:26.853 --> 29:29.938
He couldn't have changed that much.

29:30.064 --> 29:32.024
Hmm, maybe he didn't.

29:33.109 --> 29:36.945
My ex-husband was always a prick.
I just didn't wanna see it.

29:37.071 --> 29:41.492
It's a little hard
to take in, you know?

29:41.618 --> 29:44.661
It's about to get much harder.
That's actually why I came in person.

29:44.788 --> 29:47.039
Miguel's on his way over here right now.

29:47.165 --> 29:49.625
What? Why?

29:49.751 --> 29:52.628
To negotiate the terms
of Albert Chung's surrender.

29:53.129 --> 29:55.047
You're not representing Albert Chung.

29:55.173 --> 29:59.343
Chung saw himself on TV and called me.
I'm here as his counsel.

29:59.469 --> 30:02.596
You call Miguel Prado a bad guy
while representing someone like that?

30:02.722 --> 30:06.058
- It's not my job to judge, Maria.
- Well, you're certainlyjudging Miguel.

30:06.184 --> 30:09.102
And if he ever gets arrested,
I will defend him too.

30:13.066 --> 30:15.234
(Masuka) Fucking Albert Chung.

30:15.360 --> 30:18.987
That dipshit's photo has gotten more
primetime play than any Asian face in years.

30:19.113 --> 30:20.614
Way to represent.

30:20.740 --> 30:23.742
It also got over 600 tipsters calling in.
Folks up in arms over this one.

30:23.868 --> 30:25.327
Hey, guys?

30:25.453 --> 30:29.289
I need your addresses for the wedding,
and I need to know if you're bringing dates.

30:29.415 --> 30:31.583
Can we bring "just friends"?

30:31.709 --> 30:33.544
I never bring dates to a wedding.

30:33.670 --> 30:35.462
Best man always hooks up
with the maid of honor.

30:35.588 --> 30:37.506
The maid of honor is Rita's daughter.
She's ten.

30:37.632 --> 30:39.174
Masuka's your best man?

30:39.300 --> 30:41.093
- I, uh, hadn't really...
- Why?

30:41.219 --> 30:43.804
- Are you asking Batista?
- Cause I'd be honored, hermano.

30:43.930 --> 30:46.056
Um, uh, I don't...

30:47.141 --> 30:49.518
I'm not having a best man.

30:51.479 --> 30:53.313
Well, what about ushers?

31:01.239 --> 31:03.824
I need back copies of your reports
on the Skinner cases.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.618
All of them.

31:06.744 --> 31:09.872
- You looking for anything in particular?
- Something, anything.

31:09.998 --> 31:12.583
I need a fucking lead, Dex.
I'll be here all night if I have to.

31:13.585 --> 31:16.044
- Diligent.
- Not really.

31:18.798 --> 31:19.840
Did you ever...

31:21.551 --> 31:26.638
you know, compromise an investigation
for personal reasons?

31:28.308 --> 31:31.268
- Never.
- Figures.

31:33.813 --> 31:36.231
- Where did you get these?
- Camilla.

31:38.860 --> 31:40.861
She's in a lot of pain.

31:43.031 --> 31:44.656
Then I hope she goes fast.

31:44.782 --> 31:46.575
Not likely.

31:51.205 --> 31:53.081
Just shoot me if I ever get like that.

31:53.207 --> 31:55.834
- Really?
- Hell, yes.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.086
I'd do the same for you.

31:58.212 --> 32:01.673
Pull the plug, put a pillow
over your head, whatever.

32:01.799 --> 32:04.134
I'd never let you suffer.

32:04.260 --> 32:06.970
- You wouldn't, would you?
- (Knock on door)

32:07.096 --> 32:11.016
Dexter. Will you bring the prelim blood
report on Lisa Morton to the briefing room?

32:11.142 --> 32:12.434
Miguel Prado's asking for it.

32:12.560 --> 32:15.604
- He's here?
- He and Ellen Wolf.

32:15.730 --> 32:19.358
To negotiate the terms
of Albert Chung's surrender.

32:19.484 --> 32:20.984
Wear your flak jacket.

32:21.110 --> 32:22.903
(Sighs)

32:23.029 --> 32:26.949
I'm not interested in your terms, Counselor.
Albert Chung needs to turn himself in.

32:27.075 --> 32:30.202
If you want Albert Chung
I suggest you get interested, Counselor.

32:30.328 --> 32:33.538
Preliminary blood report as requested.

32:33.665 --> 32:35.791
I'd actually like Dexter to stay.

32:35.917 --> 32:38.043
Ms. Wolf might need a forensics expert

32:38.169 --> 32:41.088
to explain to her how hopeless
her case really is.

32:41.214 --> 32:43.298
Oh, please, do stay.

32:43.758 --> 32:44.967
Dexter.

32:45.426 --> 32:49.012
He wants me to see how bad
Ellen Wolf really is.

32:49.138 --> 32:51.431
This is me, open-minded.

32:52.642 --> 32:54.726
Go ahead with your terms, Counselor.

32:54.852 --> 32:57.145
My client requests the news media
be present

32:57.271 --> 32:59.189
and that he be allowed to make a statement.

32:59.315 --> 33:01.650
He requests the charge
be kicked down to manslaughter.

33:01.776 --> 33:03.402
You've gotta be kidding.

33:04.696 --> 33:07.030
He also requests conjugal visitation.

33:07.156 --> 33:09.408
Jesus, you have no shame!

33:09.534 --> 33:13.328
And no case! Run the evidence
from the crime scene, will you?

33:13.454 --> 33:15.455
Blood at the scene belonged
to Albert Chung.

33:15.581 --> 33:18.709
DNA matched his sample in our database.
Odds are 170 million to one

33:18.835 --> 33:21.670
that it's anyone but Albert Chung.

33:21.796 --> 33:24.131
Mmm, it won't hold up.

33:25.341 --> 33:27.175
You do know what odds are?

33:27.301 --> 33:31.680
The jury won't. Not when I get done
discrediting you and your chain of custody.

33:32.807 --> 33:36.143
I think we all know how easy it is
to plant evidence and, well...

33:36.269 --> 33:37.686
you look the type.

33:37.812 --> 33:41.356
Do l see sheets of plastic
in your future?

33:41.816 --> 33:43.984
Dexter's work is solid, Ellen.

33:44.485 --> 33:46.445
Your prosecutor isn't.

33:47.655 --> 33:49.448
Walk in the park
to discredit you, Counselor.

33:49.574 --> 33:51.700
Try it. We're gonna add slander
to aiding and abetting.

33:51.826 --> 33:53.660
- I'm not the one on trial.
- Oh, you should be.

33:53.786 --> 33:56.538
You should be! Getting your brother off
with a slap on the wrist!

33:56.664 --> 33:58.540
Not to mention the Chicky Hines debacle.

33:58.666 --> 33:59.875
All right, let's stay on point here.

34:00.001 --> 34:02.711
If Albert Chung kills again
while you pursue this bullshit,

34:02.837 --> 34:04.212
that blood is gonna be on your hands,

34:04.338 --> 34:06.298
- or do you even care?
- Like you do?!

34:06.424 --> 34:09.468
You spout off about justice
and the Constitution,

34:09.594 --> 34:13.221
except for that pesky part about
everyone deserving a fair trial.

34:13.347 --> 34:16.349
While you set free the scum of the earth
for a fast buck, right?

34:17.185 --> 34:19.561
How many pro bonos
do you take on, Miguel?

34:19.687 --> 34:24.066
Huh? How many innocent people have you
saved from fascistic prosecutors...

34:24.192 --> 34:25.901
- Ellen.
- Don't kid yourself.

34:26.027 --> 34:28.403
You might as well be walking the street
the way you make a living.

34:28.529 --> 34:30.530
- OK, enough, enough!
- (Laughing)

34:34.410 --> 34:36.995
Dexter, would you step outside, please?

34:37.121 --> 34:38.163
Yeah.

34:40.374 --> 34:44.669
(LaGuerta) Miguel, you know that
that was completely out of line.

34:44.796 --> 34:49.633
l'm no fan of Ellen Wolf's, but all l see
is a defense attorney doing herjob.

34:49.759 --> 34:51.218
Maybe too weII.

34:51.344 --> 34:53.220
But l can't kill her for that.

34:53.805 --> 34:56.014
Now I have to teII MigueI no.

34:56.140 --> 34:58.558
Not what he wants to hear.

35:00.645 --> 35:02.646
You're going the wrong way, Morgan.

35:02.772 --> 35:05.899
I'm just grabbing dinner, Sarge. I'm gonna
do some overtime on the Skinner case.

35:06.025 --> 35:07.776
What do you hear from Anton?

35:07.902 --> 35:10.320
He's not answering his calls
but I think he probably...

35:10.446 --> 35:13.532
Yeah, that's good.
OK, see you. Gianna?

35:14.617 --> 35:18.328
- Hey, just heading out.
- Yeah, um...

35:18.454 --> 35:20.789
a buddy of mine is getting married
in a few weeks,

35:20.915 --> 35:23.416
and he asked me
if I was gonna bring a date,

35:23.543 --> 35:25.961
and you're the only one
I wanted to invite.

35:26.087 --> 35:28.296
You're inviting me to a wedding?

35:28.422 --> 35:30.924
Maybe you don't get the concept of friends.

35:31.050 --> 35:34.219
It's not a date. It's... It's a plus one.

35:35.263 --> 35:37.722
The wedding
is besides the point.

35:37.849 --> 35:41.518
It made me realize that you're the one
I wanna spend time with.

35:41.644 --> 35:45.981
And if us being friends
means I get to keep doing that, I'm in.

35:47.817 --> 35:49.818
This isn't some kind
of weird end run is it?

35:49.944 --> 35:51.820
Make me see how sensitive
you really are?

35:51.946 --> 35:54.614
- I'm not all that sensitive.
- Yeah, you are.

35:58.661 --> 36:00.453
I'm confused. I'm...

36:02.999 --> 36:06.793
Hand-hoIding.
So simple. So intimate.

36:07.336 --> 36:10.130
So...uncomfortable.

36:11.465 --> 36:13.341
Sorry about the pie.

36:13.467 --> 36:15.802
I was told it was the best.
It got five stars.

36:15.928 --> 36:17.220
Don't worry about it.

36:18.806 --> 36:23.727
Until you find me the perfect Key lime pie,
I have something to live for.

36:27.857 --> 36:33.486
Dexter, I'm so sorry for putting you
in that horrible position.

36:35.031 --> 36:41.244
Asking you to violate your conscience
was one of the worst things I've ever done.

36:41.370 --> 36:43.747
I want to you help you, Camilla.

36:45.416 --> 36:47.542
If I were someone else, I'd do it.

36:47.668 --> 36:49.669
I know.

36:51.505 --> 36:56.176
I should have thought about your past
before I asked.

36:59.055 --> 37:01.014
My past?

37:02.016 --> 37:04.476
I know your secret, Dexter.

37:08.064 --> 37:09.731
You think...

37:10.816 --> 37:13.193
if you help me die...

37:13.319 --> 37:15.737
you'll be like him.

37:18.532 --> 37:20.325
Your brother.

37:20.451 --> 37:23.036
Brian Moser.

37:23.162 --> 37:25.372
The Ice Truck Killer.

37:26.749 --> 37:28.583
I don't have a brother.

37:28.709 --> 37:31.544
You did.

37:32.088 --> 37:35.382
I read your file before I destroyed it.

37:37.218 --> 37:39.594
Your birth mother was Laura Moser.

37:39.720 --> 37:46.768
When the newspaper said Brian Moser
was the Ice Truck Killer...

37:48.104 --> 37:49.938
I made the connection.

37:51.565 --> 37:53.900
- Camilla...
- It's all right, Dexter.

37:57.655 --> 38:00.156
I'll take it to my grave.

38:04.578 --> 38:08.373
And you could never be like him.

38:13.296 --> 38:15.046
(Mouths)

38:20.803 --> 38:23.346
I had a high opinion of you, Deb.

38:24.932 --> 38:26.516
Guess I was wrong.

38:26.642 --> 38:29.686
I told you repeatedly to stay out of my shit,
and you wouldn't.

38:30.438 --> 38:32.772
So you told Quinn
I was investigating him,

38:32.898 --> 38:35.567
he did what he does
and now the case is dead.

38:35.693 --> 38:37.402
You chose the wrong friend.

38:37.528 --> 38:40.488
Hey, you're the one who fucked him.
Not my fault he didn't want an encore.

38:40.614 --> 38:44.659
- Is that what he told you this was about?
- He didn't have to. It was obvious.

38:44.785 --> 38:48.079
Little Miss Heartbreak
turns a Cadillac and a fancy watch

38:48.205 --> 38:50.707
into a fucking IA investigation.

38:50.833 --> 38:52.208
How is that even original?

38:52.335 --> 38:57.422
What an empty room your world must be
if those are the dots you connected.

38:57.548 --> 38:59.674
I'm happily married.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.594
Seven years.
Working on our second kid.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.764
With zero interest in a waste of clothes
like Quinn.

39:05.890 --> 39:07.891
Fine.

39:08.017 --> 39:09.684
I really don't give a shit.

39:09.810 --> 39:12.312
Well, then give a shit about this.

39:12.438 --> 39:15.065
A cop's dead
cause Quinn cut all of the wrong corners.

39:15.191 --> 39:17.859
I came to you for help
to get him out of circulation.

39:17.985 --> 39:20.445
You refused.

39:21.322 --> 39:22.822
Next dead cop's on you.

39:30.164 --> 39:34.125
A dinner party.
Washing dishes. It seems so mundane.

39:34.251 --> 39:36.461
But it's oddIy...soothing.

39:36.587 --> 39:38.880
Maybe this is what
beIonging feeIs Iike.

39:39.006 --> 39:41.299
Keep this up,
we're looking at dishpan hands.

39:41.425 --> 39:44.803
(Rita) I should add rubber gloves
to our gift registry for Dexter.

39:44.929 --> 39:47.263
- We can do that?
- Oh, you can register for anything.

39:47.390 --> 39:49.933
Furniture, motorcycles, power tools.

39:50.059 --> 39:51.684
(Dexter and Miguel) Power tools.

39:51.811 --> 39:53.395
- (Crash)
- Ah, Jesus, Sylvia!

39:53.521 --> 39:56.648
Come on, use your brains, baby!
We just got this thing re-stained!

39:56.774 --> 39:59.734
- I got it. It's fine.
- Yeah.

39:59.860 --> 40:04.864
Uh, why don't Syl and I finish the dishes
and we'll put dessert in the oven?

40:04.990 --> 40:07.158
And you guys pop a movie in for the kids.

40:07.284 --> 40:09.577
Uh, yeah, sounds good.

40:09.703 --> 40:11.913
- Movie time, kids.
- Come on, muchachos.

40:12.039 --> 40:14.541
Uncle Miguel's
gonna put a movie on for you.

40:18.712 --> 40:20.255
Sorry about that.

40:20.381 --> 40:23.591
He probably invited you guys over
so he wouldn't have to be alone with me.

40:23.717 --> 40:28.346
- Things haven't gotten any better?
- Worse. After I confronted him.

40:28.472 --> 40:29.931
Oh, no.

40:30.057 --> 40:33.768
He just completely shut down. Now
he can't even be civil in front of company.

40:33.894 --> 40:36.729
I'm so sorry.
I never should have said anything.

40:36.856 --> 40:39.315
No. It's not your fault.

40:40.568 --> 40:42.694
Maybe Dexter's a bad influence on him?

40:44.071 --> 40:46.364
I know. Wishful thinking.

40:46.490 --> 40:48.908
He'd be a problem I could actually fix.

40:54.748 --> 40:57.959
He's going to bring up EIIen WoIf,
and l have to tell him no.

40:58.085 --> 40:59.878
Can friends do that?

41:00.004 --> 41:01.921
So, uh, Ellen Wolf.

41:02.047 --> 41:04.382
Piece of work, right?

41:05.759 --> 41:07.844
Go easy. Be tactfuI.

41:07.970 --> 41:09.929
We can't kill her.

41:10.890 --> 41:11.848
I see.

41:11.974 --> 41:14.893
She's...just doing herjob.

41:15.019 --> 41:19.397
You should tell that to the parents of all
of those people that her clients have killed.

41:19.523 --> 41:20.899
Yeah, I read about them.

41:21.025 --> 41:24.235
I also read about the wrongly convicted
people she got off death row.

41:24.361 --> 41:26.321
The defense fund she set up.

41:26.447 --> 41:30.033
She's fucking with the system.
Eating away at it from the inside out.

41:30.159 --> 41:32.410
Control, Dexter.
That's what she likes.

41:32.536 --> 41:35.038
And now she's trying to control me.

41:35.789 --> 41:39.667
Re-opening my cases.
Undermining years of all my hard work.

41:39.793 --> 41:41.544
So...this is personal.

41:41.670 --> 41:43.087
Fuck yes, this is personal.

41:43.214 --> 41:47.425
And it should be personal for you too. As my
friend, I'm asking you to do this for me.

41:47.551 --> 41:50.136
- I'm sorry, no.
- Well, then fuck you!

41:51.472 --> 41:53.932
She's fucking with my life!

41:58.979 --> 42:00.605
I'm gonna go.

42:01.565 --> 42:04.692
I've never been great
at conflict resolution.

42:05.611 --> 42:08.863
Not without a blade
and several rolls of plastic wrap.

42:08.989 --> 42:11.533
Did Dexter and Miguel
have a fight?

42:11.659 --> 42:13.993
(Rita) No, sweetie. Did you?

42:16.288 --> 42:18.998
Uh, why don't you guys
go get ready for bed?

42:21.794 --> 42:23.336
So what happened?

42:23.462 --> 42:25.046
You grabbed us outta there so fast

42:25.172 --> 42:28.883
and you've been grinding your teeth
the whole way home.

42:29.009 --> 42:32.095
- I disagreed with him.
- About the affair?

42:32.221 --> 42:34.806
- What affair?
- Syl thinks there's someone else.

42:34.932 --> 42:36.724
Oh.

42:36.850 --> 42:39.727
He's definitely obsessed with someone,
but there's no affair.

42:39.853 --> 42:42.230
And there's not going to be one either.

42:42.356 --> 42:45.275
- What?
- I'm confusing my metaphor.

42:45.401 --> 42:47.610
Well, friends fight sometimes.

42:51.532 --> 42:54.200
I'm not sure he'd consider me
much of a friend right now.

42:54.326 --> 42:56.035
Hey, you're a great friend.

42:57.454 --> 42:59.622
The problem's his.

43:00.916 --> 43:03.918
Well, either way, life was good before him.

43:04.044 --> 43:06.170
It'll be good after.

43:06.297 --> 43:08.590
It's all right to be upset.

43:09.758 --> 43:11.759
I'm not upset.

43:23.939 --> 43:26.107
Yo, Dex.

43:26.233 --> 43:28.985
Put me down for a plus one
to the wedding.

43:29.111 --> 43:30.903
The list. Right.

43:31.030 --> 43:33.281
Hey, that's a plus one.

43:33.407 --> 43:34.657
OK.

43:34.783 --> 43:36.284
- Sarge.
- Yeah?

43:36.410 --> 43:39.579
I think Morgan needs an intervention.
She's been here all night.

43:39.705 --> 43:41.331
- She find anything?
- I don't know.

43:41.457 --> 43:44.083
She's waiting on you for the big reveal.

43:46.587 --> 43:51.341
Batista may be pIus one,
but after Iast night, I'm minus MigueI.

43:51.467 --> 43:54.510
But with or without my heIp,
CamiIIa's on her way out.

43:54.637 --> 43:57.472
It's OK. I'm better off on my own.

43:57.598 --> 44:01.768
I can't believe this jackass
is still on the run.

44:05.481 --> 44:07.899
You know, he kinda looks like you.

44:08.859 --> 44:10.318
That... That...

44:10.444 --> 44:13.321
That's called racism, buddy,
so don't even...

44:13.447 --> 44:15.365
Oh, shit.

44:15.491 --> 44:18.117
He does look like me.

44:28.796 --> 44:31.130
I found a fucking lead
on the Skinner case.

44:31.256 --> 44:33.257
In the trees, right?

44:33.384 --> 44:35.301
We've had our heads up
our asses, Sarge.

44:35.427 --> 44:39.681
We've been looking down at the bodies
but no one has been looking up.

44:42.059 --> 44:44.102
How much caffeine have you had?

44:44.228 --> 44:45.687
A metric fuck-ton.

44:45.813 --> 44:47.855
You should stop.
It's giving you Tourette's.

44:47.981 --> 44:51.150
Our second victim, right?
Javier Garza.

44:51.276 --> 44:54.195
I'm looking through it, and I remember
talking to this George guy.

44:54.321 --> 44:56.489
This tree-trimmer,
George something.

44:56.615 --> 45:00.410
It reminds me of that fucking mess
at Lorna Owen's house, right?

45:00.536 --> 45:04.122
Where somebody had trimmed the trees
and they didn't bother to clean it up.

45:04.248 --> 45:07.458
So I'm thinking,
"Trimmed trees. Tree-trimmer."

45:07.584 --> 45:09.210
Maybe there's a connection?

45:09.336 --> 45:10.378
OK.

45:10.504 --> 45:16.092
So I go through every fucking photo
of every fucking crime scene,

45:16.218 --> 45:18.428
- and guess what I found?
- Trimmed trees?

45:18.554 --> 45:21.723
No, I didn't find shit.

45:21.849 --> 45:26.060
But when I looked
at the homes of the victims...

45:26.186 --> 45:28.229
motherfucking trimmed trees.

45:28.856 --> 45:31.858
The Skinner is using tree-trimming
as a cover for surveillance.

45:31.984 --> 45:35.236
He watches from the trees
and when the time is right he grabs them.

45:36.572 --> 45:39.240
Tree-trimmers, landscapers...
blends right in.

45:43.412 --> 45:46.789
Check city maintenance schedules.
Get sub-contractors' names.

45:46.915 --> 45:50.543
Anyone who's worked near any of
the victims' homes. Let's bring 'em in.

45:51.670 --> 45:54.505
I still can't get a hold of Anton.
I think he might have skipped town.

45:54.631 --> 45:57.550
Then it's a good thing
you found a new lead. Huh, Morgan?

45:58.427 --> 46:00.720
Good work.

46:06.101 --> 46:09.312
Anton skips town. You find a new lead.

46:09.438 --> 46:11.647
Pretty convenient.

46:11.774 --> 46:13.775
Up all fucking night.

46:13.901 --> 46:15.485
Nothing convenient about it.

46:15.611 --> 46:17.653
Not all of us cut corners, Detective.

46:25.162 --> 46:27.622
(Door opens)

46:31.335 --> 46:34.796
- You haven't been answering the phone.
- I've been busy.

46:34.922 --> 46:37.131
I can see that.

46:38.383 --> 46:41.886
- I can also see that you're troubled.
- Yeah.

46:42.012 --> 46:44.680
That conscience I don't have?
It's been eating away at me.

46:46.642 --> 46:50.186
I know. I'll turn my client in.
Then I'll feel better.

46:50.312 --> 46:52.355
You're only half-joking.

46:52.481 --> 46:55.983
You wanna bring in Albert Chung
as badly as we do.

46:57.319 --> 46:58.945
I'm here to help.

46:59.071 --> 47:00.613
You can't.

47:01.240 --> 47:03.491
I can...if you let me.

47:04.117 --> 47:06.661
If I let you I'll be violating privilege.

47:06.787 --> 47:08.996
Well, that's where
the help part comes in.

47:09.665 --> 47:13.960
See, I'm getting to know you
and that granite set of ethics you've got.

47:14.711 --> 47:16.754
Couldn't crack 'em even if I wanted to.

47:16.880 --> 47:19.215
You know that about me, huh?

47:19.341 --> 47:20.925
Yep.

47:21.385 --> 47:26.013
But it's yourjob to make sure Albert Chung
has his day in court.

47:27.182 --> 47:29.851
And it's myjob to make sure that happens.

47:29.977 --> 47:31.894
I've got several ways of doing that.

47:32.020 --> 47:36.983
For instance, sometimes I set up
surveillance outside his attorney's office.

47:38.861 --> 47:41.654
Only an idiot would ask
for a meeting here.

47:41.780 --> 47:43.948
Only an idiot.

47:48.745 --> 47:51.664
I am not good at this.
Letting people help me.

47:51.790 --> 47:53.875
I know that about you too.

47:54.001 --> 47:55.543
(Chuckling)

47:55.669 --> 47:57.920
Why do you think I brought the Scotch?

47:58.672 --> 48:02.884
Deb, Angel plus one, Vince,
Maria LaGuerta...

48:03.719 --> 48:05.595
Doughnut guy?

48:05.721 --> 48:07.513
I see him every day.

48:07.639 --> 48:10.308
If you don't know his name,
he's not invited.

48:10.434 --> 48:13.519
(Camilla coughing)

48:19.985 --> 48:21.110
We can come back.

48:21.236 --> 48:25.281
Dexter, bring that girl of yours in here.

48:25.407 --> 48:27.575
I'm here. I'm right here.

48:28.493 --> 48:30.953
(Rita) Hi. It's so nice to finally meet you.

48:31.079 --> 48:33.998
Oh, Rita.

48:34.750 --> 48:36.459
You know, I've got it.

48:36.585 --> 48:38.753
(Coughing)

48:57.606 --> 48:58.981
Hey, you came.

48:59.107 --> 49:01.025
You called.

49:02.110 --> 49:04.654
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I live here.

49:04.780 --> 49:06.822
Not here.

49:06.949 --> 49:10.534
Here. We thought you left.
We pulled your security detail.

49:10.661 --> 49:14.497
I have two dead-bolts
and a nosy neighbor. I think I'm safe.

49:15.332 --> 49:17.917
Well, you'd be a lot safer in Chicago.

49:18.043 --> 49:21.128
I didn't wanna go
without talking to you first.

49:22.089 --> 49:24.840
I wanted to say thanks, you know,
for giving me the heads-up.

49:26.677 --> 49:30.513
I do get free long-distance.
You could have called me from Chicago.

49:30.639 --> 49:32.807
I didn't wanna go to Chicago, Debra.

49:40.649 --> 49:42.525
I know what you did for me.

49:43.819 --> 49:46.612
And I know what it could cost you.

49:48.991 --> 49:51.993
And I know how badly
you want your shield.

49:54.913 --> 49:57.581
Not if it means using you as bait.

50:04.715 --> 50:06.590
But I'll do it.

50:08.510 --> 50:10.386
For you.

50:13.348 --> 50:15.599
I'll be your bait.

50:39.541 --> 50:41.667
Thanks for coming.

50:41.793 --> 50:44.754
You hear about Albert Chung?

50:44.880 --> 50:46.380
Who hasn't?

50:47.090 --> 50:49.550
You hear how they got him?

50:50.093 --> 50:51.552
No.

50:52.888 --> 50:56.891
He showed up at Ellen Wolf's
office for a meeting.

50:57.017 --> 51:02.480
Cops got wind of it. Sent SWAT in.
They did the whole shock-and-awe thing.

51:04.775 --> 51:09.820
Apparently Ellen Wolf was in on it.
She helped get him into custody.

51:10.739 --> 51:12.907
You were right about her, Dex.

51:15.577 --> 51:19.080
I told you when we first met,
I usually don't take no for an answer.

51:19.998 --> 51:22.416
That's kind of a button with you, isn't it?

51:24.628 --> 51:28.380
It couldn't have been easy for you.
But a good friend, a real friend...

51:28.507 --> 51:30.758
does the hard thing.

51:30.884 --> 51:34.970
I was out of control. I was letting
personal shit cloud up my thinking.

51:35.097 --> 51:37.723
And you, you reigned me in.

51:37.849 --> 51:39.642
And, uh...

51:41.228 --> 51:43.062
Well, hey, friends fight, right?

51:45.148 --> 51:46.315
I guess so.

51:46.441 --> 51:48.901
They also apologize when they're wrong.

51:49.945 --> 51:51.904
I was wrong.

51:52.030 --> 51:54.115
I apologize.

51:57.536 --> 51:59.620
We're not gonna man-hug, are we?

52:01.248 --> 52:03.624
(Chuckling)

52:03.750 --> 52:06.335
- How about a beer?
- Yeah, I'll get it.

52:07.671 --> 52:09.839
Uh, two bottles.

52:09.965 --> 52:12.133
Am I reaIIy a good friend?

52:16.638 --> 52:17.888
Thanks.

52:18.014 --> 52:21.642
MigueI thinks so. Rita...CamiIIa.

52:23.145 --> 52:26.730
l wouldn't know. l don't have a lot
of experience in that area.

52:28.024 --> 52:30.067
To Ellen Wolf.

52:37.784 --> 52:39.869
Maybe with practice.

52:39.995 --> 52:41.996
Hey, you wanna be my best man?

52:55.844 --> 52:58.053
(Labored breathing)

53:31.129 --> 53:34.215
MigueI says a friend does the hard thing.

53:36.384 --> 53:37.760
I agree.

53:37.886 --> 53:40.971
And l'm about to become
a true friend to Camilla.

53:43.600 --> 53:46.518
My secret ingredient.
Sodium pentothaI.

53:46.645 --> 53:48.729
Coma in half a minute.

53:49.731 --> 53:53.108
Pancuronium stops
her breathing and then...

53:53.235 --> 53:55.152
peace.

53:55.278 --> 53:57.196
For her, anyway.

54:05.830 --> 54:07.331
Dexter.

54:07.457 --> 54:09.875
I have a gift for you.

54:10.001 --> 54:12.586
It'll make you feel better.

54:20.011 --> 54:21.887
Thank you.

54:34.651 --> 54:36.944
Are you sure?

54:37.070 --> 54:39.154
I'm sure.

54:53.545 --> 54:56.255
You finally brought me...

54:58.174 --> 55:01.135
the perfect pie.

55:32.834 --> 55:35.586
I'll tell Gene...

55:41.217 --> 55:44.887
you say hello.

55:48.808 --> 55:51.560
I'm doing a good thing, aren't I?

55:51.686 --> 55:53.645
Then why does it feeI so...

55:53.772 --> 55:56.148
bad?

55:56.900 --> 56:01.028
(Whispers) I want you to know
that you were right...

56:02.238 --> 56:04.365
about my brother.

56:05.450 --> 56:07.534
But there's something else.

56:10.413 --> 56:12.623
I killed him.

56:16.795 --> 56:18.629
It's good...

56:21.174 --> 56:23.384
...you did.

56:36.689 --> 56:40.651
All the lives l've taken,
they've aIways begged for mercy.

56:41.236 --> 56:44.905
l've never understood
that concept untiI now.

56:46.408 --> 56:48.033
This.

56:48.159 --> 56:50.077
This is mercy.

56:51.746 --> 56:54.248
But onIy for a friend.
