WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:03.173
Previously on Dexter.

00:03.299 --> 00:05.134
- Oh, that's pretty.
- Gift from my first husband.

00:05.260 --> 00:06.385
What'll it be, ladies?

00:06.511 --> 00:09.304
How 'bout a foot massage
with those big, gorgeous hands of yours?

00:09.431 --> 00:12.725
- They're kinda cold from scooping ice.
- But you're hot.

00:12.851 --> 00:15.936
(Harry) Miguel went missing last night.
Ellen's missing this morning.

00:16.062 --> 00:17.938
I hope she didn't get
in an accident or something.

00:18.064 --> 00:20.566
(Dexter) He did it. Miguel really did it.

00:20.692 --> 00:21.692
Ellen.

00:21.818 --> 00:23.652
(Miguel) You don't wanna have to think
about what she went through

00:23.778 --> 00:25.279
to realize that she's really gone.

00:25.405 --> 00:28.073
- Don't. Don't.
- Pero, corazón, she's gone.

00:28.199 --> 00:30.409
You got me. I'm right here for you.
To get you through.

00:30.535 --> 00:33.746
(Sylvia) He's having an affair.
(Rita) No. You don't know that.

00:33.872 --> 00:37.249
When you've been married as long as we
have, you know when your husband's lying.

00:37.375 --> 00:39.084
Anton is not officially a CI.

00:39.210 --> 00:40.753
(Debra) We used him as bait.

00:40.879 --> 00:42.171
The Skinner has Anton.

00:42.297 --> 00:43.881
Freebo owes you money?
I can get you money.

00:44.007 --> 00:45.466
I loaned Freebo that money.

00:45.592 --> 00:47.551
This is about respect.

00:50.221 --> 00:51.930
Anton!

00:52.891 --> 00:54.892
(Quinn) Morgan, get outta the way!

00:56.061 --> 00:57.394
(Anton) You found me.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.354
You can't get away from me that easily.

00:59.481 --> 01:02.941
Anton could so easily file a huge lawsuit
against the police department

01:03.068 --> 01:04.860
once he finds out
how you fucked him over!

01:04.986 --> 01:06.779
You don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about!

01:06.905 --> 01:09.198
(Batista)
You're the one I wanna spend time with.

01:10.450 --> 01:13.452
(Rita) My God...it's perfect.

01:13.578 --> 01:15.913
You should just...
get out while you can.

01:16.039 --> 01:18.123
I won't. I promise.

01:18.249 --> 01:22.294
(Miguel) I gave you my shirt
linking me to Freebo's death.

01:22.420 --> 01:26.381
I wish I had another one to prove to you
how important this partnership is to me.

01:26.508 --> 01:28.967
(Dexter) The link between
Freebo's murder and Miguel.

01:29.094 --> 01:32.596
It's not even human.
It's cow's blood. He's been using me.

01:32.722 --> 01:35.641
I didn't create a monster.
I was used by one.

01:35.767 --> 01:37.768
He used me.

03:30.632 --> 03:32.424
How many was it, seven or eight balls?

03:32.550 --> 03:33.926
I lost count.

03:34.052 --> 03:37.221
Putting the 18th tee
in front of a body of water is criminal.

03:37.347 --> 03:41.600
I kept on telling him, "Take the mulligan!
Please, take the mullig..."

03:41.726 --> 03:43.810
This one right here, no.

03:43.937 --> 03:46.230
- I finally got one over, didn't I?
- Yeah.

03:49.943 --> 03:54.404
(Dexter) Just what I ordered - feigned
civility with a heaping side of betrayal.

03:54.530 --> 03:57.824
It's becoming more and more clear
that I'm going to have to deal with Miguel.

03:57.951 --> 03:59.493
Thank you, Chef.

03:59.619 --> 04:01.203
Ah, Chef Babia.

04:01.329 --> 04:03.872
Option one, I kill him.

04:03.998 --> 04:06.124
But he's too high profile.

04:06.251 --> 04:09.336
A popular ADA disappears.
The manhunt would be endless.

04:09.462 --> 04:13.048
Everyone he knew would be scrutinized,
and that incIudes me.

04:13.174 --> 04:17.010
He's also my best man.
I'd be expected to grieve.

04:17.136 --> 04:19.471
How about this pumpkin
and sage ravioli here?

04:19.597 --> 04:21.640
- Oh, no, that's...
- There you go.

04:21.766 --> 04:24.643
Option two, get him
the hell out of my life.

04:24.769 --> 04:29.273
But it's not that simple. He taught me
how to golf. I taught him how to kill.

04:30.191 --> 04:34.027
l'm responsible if Miguel
takes another innocent life.

04:34.153 --> 04:36.822
Tell them, Miguel. I can't wait.

04:36.948 --> 04:37.906
Tell us?

04:38.032 --> 04:40.784
We got a wedding present for you.

04:40.910 --> 04:43.287
Chef Babia and his staff,

04:43.413 --> 04:45.747
they're gonna cater your wedding.

04:45.873 --> 04:47.040
Uh, wh...?

04:47.166 --> 04:49.167
We wanted you to have the very best.

04:49.294 --> 04:52.004
- It's too much. Really.
- I won't take no for an answer.

04:52.130 --> 04:53.463
You might have to.

04:53.589 --> 04:55.465
We're doing this for you. I insist.

04:56.384 --> 05:00.178
So much for option two.
He won't just let our partnership dissolve.

05:00.305 --> 05:04.057
He's trying to get me under his thumb,
and he's using Rita to do it.

05:04.183 --> 05:05.517
(Miguel) No...

05:05.643 --> 05:09.062
(Rita) You are the very best man. (Giggles)

05:09.188 --> 05:11.315
It's working.

05:13.901 --> 05:16.653
OK, so, a toast.

05:16.779 --> 05:18.947
To Dexter and Rita.

05:19.073 --> 05:20.949
May your marriage
be as blessed

05:21.075 --> 05:24.202
as we are to have you
to call friends.

05:24.329 --> 05:25.996
(Clinking)

05:26.122 --> 05:28.373
Which leaves option three.

05:28.499 --> 05:31.043
Get him under my thumb...

05:31.169 --> 05:33.628
and keep him there.

05:35.757 --> 05:37.883
(Rita) God, we're barely moving.

05:38.009 --> 05:41.887
So much for getting Astor home
in time for her bath.

05:42.013 --> 05:43.972
At least the meal was worth it.

05:44.098 --> 05:47.059
And it was great to see Sylvia and Miguel
getting along again.

05:47.185 --> 05:51.188
Do we...have to serve food
at the wedding?

05:54.359 --> 05:57.110
Yes. We have to serve food
at the wedding.

05:57.236 --> 05:59.404
It's just if we can't afford Chef...

05:59.530 --> 06:02.699
what's-his-name on our own,
maybe we shouldn't accept.

06:03.743 --> 06:06.411
We can't say no now.
I mean, it would be insulting.

06:07.580 --> 06:09.873
Believe me, Miguel's ego can handle it.

06:11.334 --> 06:13.627
What's going on, Dexter?

06:13.753 --> 06:16.046
It's just...

06:16.172 --> 06:18.757
Miguel isn't exactly
who I thought he was.

06:18.883 --> 06:21.593
You two seemed to be
getting along fine at dinner.

06:21.719 --> 06:22.886
(Sighs) Yeah.

06:23.012 --> 06:26.473
Wait a minute. Is this about Sylvia?

06:26.599 --> 06:28.558
I mean, did you find something out?

06:28.684 --> 06:30.102
More than I wanted to.

06:30.228 --> 06:32.938
Oh, my God.
He's cheating on her.

06:33.064 --> 06:35.857
- No, that's not what I...
- Oh, that bastard!

06:35.983 --> 06:38.944
He looked me right in the eye
and said he wasn't having an affair.

06:40.446 --> 06:42.697
Oh, God...poor Syl.

06:42.824 --> 06:45.075
How long has it been going on?

06:45.201 --> 06:47.911
Should I tell her?
What would I say?

06:48.037 --> 06:50.872
I think we should just...stay out of it.

06:53.584 --> 06:56.294
- Is it his secretary?
- It's not his secretary!

06:56.421 --> 06:57.838
Could we please just drop this?

06:57.964 --> 06:59.923
- But there is someone.
- I never said that.

07:00.049 --> 07:03.343
All right, Syl said that Miguel's been
spending a lot of time with Maria LaGuerta,

07:03.469 --> 07:06.054
which makes Syl uncomfortable
because they have history.

07:06.180 --> 07:08.348
- Is that true?
- Yes.

07:08.474 --> 07:09.850
Then that's who it is.

07:09.976 --> 07:12.394
They're spending time together
because of a case.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.979
Miguel's brother did die.

07:14.105 --> 07:16.481
Which rekindled the relationship.

07:16.607 --> 07:20.861
That's why you won't say anything.
You're protecting your boss.

07:20.987 --> 07:23.029
Deb. Glad to see ya.

07:23.156 --> 07:24.531
Fight?

07:24.657 --> 07:29.244
His best friend is cheating on my best friend
and he won't tell me with who.

07:29.370 --> 07:31.329
You have a best friend?

07:31.456 --> 07:33.832
What'd you use on her, chloroform?

07:33.958 --> 07:36.209
- I hope she was good.
- Aw, she was a champ.

07:36.335 --> 07:39.337
She almost made it through Saw 1 and 2.

07:39.464 --> 07:41.131
I'm kidding.

07:41.257 --> 07:43.175
She was great. We bonded.

07:43.301 --> 07:44.551
Hey.

07:44.677 --> 07:46.678
Oh. Oh, you...

07:46.804 --> 07:48.597
you have company.

07:48.723 --> 07:51.183
Yeah. Um...this is Anton.

07:51.309 --> 07:53.810
Anton Briggs,
the Skinner victim?

07:53.936 --> 07:55.145
Just Anton.

07:55.271 --> 07:57.147
And yes, the Skinner victim.

07:59.817 --> 08:03.695
Uh, you know, your sister...
she saved my life.

08:03.821 --> 08:06.239
Does this mean you're plus one
for the wedding?

08:07.575 --> 08:11.244
Uh, we haven't really...
talked about...

08:11.370 --> 08:13.497
Um, so, you're getting married.
Oh, kudos.

08:13.623 --> 08:16.166
- Thanks.
- And a baby on the way.

08:16.292 --> 08:21.046
I was hoping to walk down the aisle skinny,
or at least skinnier.

08:21.172 --> 08:22.214
(Whispers) What?

08:23.174 --> 08:24.424
(Whispers) Asshole.

08:26.093 --> 08:28.386
(♪ Jaunty music on TV)

08:43.069 --> 08:44.569
Cocksuck!

08:44.695 --> 08:47.572
(Gasps) Motherfuck!
Anton, wake up. You gotta go.

08:47.698 --> 08:49.741
Fuckin' penguins!

08:49.867 --> 08:52.536
It's just 7:30. I thought
you didn't have to be at work...

08:52.662 --> 08:55.038
Your protective detail's gonna think
that you spent the night!

08:55.164 --> 08:57.582
- I did.
- They're gonna think that we slept together!

08:57.708 --> 08:59.709
- We have, Deb.
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

08:59.835 --> 09:03.171
I know, but if they tell my bosses,
I'm gonna get in a shitload of shit!

09:03.297 --> 09:05.173
Really? For sleeping with your boyfriend?

09:05.299 --> 09:07.759
You are a key witness
in a case I'm investigating.

09:07.885 --> 09:11.263
So if that comes out in trial, King's lawyers
are gonna have a fucking field day,

09:11.389 --> 09:13.056
when we catch him.

09:13.182 --> 09:17.018
So, um, are you sure
that's what this is really about?

09:17.144 --> 09:18.270
Uh-huh.

09:18.396 --> 09:21.523
Um...I gotta get in the shower,
so I'll call you later, OK?

09:21.649 --> 09:23.942
Yeah. OK.

09:26.946 --> 09:30.782
(Dexter) Revisiting option three,
getting Miguel under my thumb.

09:30.908 --> 09:32.284
I need leverage.

09:32.410 --> 09:35.161
Exposing Ellen's body
was supposed to achieve that.

09:35.288 --> 09:36.871
But Miguel wrestled it away.

09:36.998 --> 09:38.957
We have a suspect
for Ellen Wolf's murder.

09:39.083 --> 09:43.211
Is she onto Miguel,
and do I smell leverage?

09:43.337 --> 09:45.589
Toby Edwards, 32.

09:45.715 --> 09:46.798
Oh, well.

09:46.924 --> 09:49.759
Ellen's incoming phone records
show that he called her house three times

09:49.885 --> 09:54.055
on the night of her murder - once at
1 1 :10pm from the bar where he works,

09:54.181 --> 09:59.144
and then twice more at 3:01 and 3:08am
from right outside her house.

09:59.270 --> 10:02.981
She hasn't found the killer,
but she might have found a witness.

10:03.107 --> 10:04.441
And I found my leverage.

10:04.567 --> 10:07.485
Soderquist, vamos. Get an address
on this guy. Haul his ass in.

10:07.612 --> 10:10.989
We're also getting a search warrant.
We're looking for a platinum wedding ring.

10:11.115 --> 10:13.366
I've already catalogued
one wedding ring into evidence.

10:13.492 --> 10:15.160
Well, she wore two.

10:15.286 --> 10:16.661
One for each ex-husband.

10:16.787 --> 10:19.080
Well, why would the killer
only take one ring?

10:19.206 --> 10:21.041
Maybe he got interrupted.

10:21.167 --> 10:23.376
Or he wanted a trophy.

10:23.502 --> 10:26.504
Whatever it is,
we're gonna find out.

10:26.631 --> 10:28.673
A potential witness, a missing ring.

10:28.799 --> 10:31.509
Now Miguel and I have
something to talk about.

10:33.137 --> 10:35.347
Hey, not so fast.
Not so fast.

10:35.473 --> 10:38.016
I am taking donations
for Dexter Morgan's...

10:38.142 --> 10:39.184
bachelor party.

10:39.310 --> 10:42.354
Produced and directed by Vince Masuka,
a Vince Masuka production.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.648
Dig deep now.
It's gonna be off the charts.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.566
I'm gonna have Sergeant Cop-a-Feel,

10:46.692 --> 10:49.444
Jo-Jo the Lezbo Go-Go,
Maureen the Limber Mermaid,

10:49.570 --> 10:52.989
and her even more limber friend
Nadia the Russian gymnast.

10:54.992 --> 10:56.368
What?

10:56.494 --> 10:59.079
Vince, we're in the middle
of two big investigations.

10:59.205 --> 11:02.040
Tell me about it. It's hard
to get people focused on this shindig.

11:02.166 --> 11:04.709
What I mean is that maybe you
should keep the party low-key.

11:04.835 --> 11:07.587
Are you kidding?
I've got a reputation to live up to.

11:07.713 --> 11:09.714
I mean, if my show
does not make people vomit

11:09.840 --> 11:13.009
and have an erection at the same time,
then I've let my audience down.

11:13.135 --> 11:16.930
Strippers, yes. Hookers, no.
And none of that weird shit that you're into.

11:17.056 --> 11:20.183
- Wow. OK, Sergeant Buzzkill.
- I mean it.

11:20.309 --> 11:22.394
Anything illegal, I will arrest you.

11:22.520 --> 11:25.605
Come on. I was just joking.
The party's for Opie out there.

11:25.731 --> 11:28.108
A hooker is a terrible thing to waste.

11:32.363 --> 11:33.905
Damn it.

11:34.031 --> 11:36.449
I'm never gonna get my deposit back.

11:36.575 --> 11:38.326
Yes, ma'am, your landscaper.

11:38.452 --> 11:40.620
When was the last time you saw him?

11:42.873 --> 11:45.291
OK. Do you have any empty structures
on your property

11:45.418 --> 11:48.128
or unoccupied vacation homes
in the area?

11:49.922 --> 11:52.465
Right, ma'am, we'll be sure to clear 'em
as fast as we can

11:52.591 --> 11:54.300
so you don't have to re-sod your lawn,

11:54.427 --> 11:56.302
you fuckhead.

11:58.389 --> 11:59.597
What's this?

11:59.724 --> 12:02.809
Surveillance report
from Anton's protective detail.

12:02.935 --> 12:04.352
Very thorough.

12:04.478 --> 12:06.187
He came over on official business.

12:06.313 --> 12:08.606
Which took all night.

12:08.733 --> 12:09.983
Sarge is gonna see that.

12:10.109 --> 12:13.111
I'll tell him the truth,
that nothing happened.

12:13.237 --> 12:15.280
So you're no longer
sleeping with the...

12:15.406 --> 12:17.323
key witness in this investigation?

12:17.450 --> 12:19.367
What's it to you?

12:19.493 --> 12:21.870
You're right. It's your shield.

12:21.996 --> 12:24.330
If you want people talkin',
be my guest.

12:27.460 --> 12:29.794
You've run out of people
to transfer me to?

12:29.920 --> 12:32.505
Your embassy isn't that big.
Óyeme...

12:32.631 --> 12:35.633
George Washington King.

12:35.760 --> 12:38.178
No, no, no, do not transfer me back.
Escúchame...

12:38.304 --> 12:40.472
Homicide.

12:41.557 --> 12:43.099
Sarge, line two. Says it's urgent.

12:45.770 --> 12:47.604
Sergeant Batista.

12:52.276 --> 12:54.277
I'll be right there.

12:57.281 --> 12:58.948
- Cover for me.
- Is everything OK?

12:59.074 --> 13:00.617
No.

13:00.743 --> 13:04.662
It's all about strategy,
outmaneuvering the opposition,

13:04.789 --> 13:06.206
bending him to your will.

13:06.332 --> 13:08.249
(Game beeping)

13:10.211 --> 13:12.962
What are you doing in my office, Dex?

13:15.633 --> 13:17.634
Winning.

13:19.178 --> 13:21.930
Hope you don't mind. Just keeping
my wits sharp while I waited for you.

13:22.056 --> 13:26.017
You, uh, here to grab...
lunch or something?

13:26.143 --> 13:29.395
Can't. Gotta get back to the station.

13:30.356 --> 13:32.732
The Ellen Wolf case is breaking.

13:32.858 --> 13:34.692
Breaking.

13:34.819 --> 13:36.110
Which way?

13:36.237 --> 13:39.656
It seems Lieutenant LaGuerta
has a suspect.

13:39.782 --> 13:41.199
And who might that be?

13:41.325 --> 13:43.743
Some guy who was...

13:43.869 --> 13:47.497
outside Ellen's place round about the time
she was gettin' strangled.

13:50.501 --> 13:52.544
Or was she stabbed first?
I can't remember.

13:52.670 --> 13:54.379
He couldn't have seen anything.

14:00.845 --> 14:02.637
You sure?

14:05.391 --> 14:07.392
All right.

14:07.518 --> 14:09.102
So what do we do?

14:09.228 --> 14:10.895
We?

14:11.021 --> 14:12.146
Huh.

14:13.941 --> 14:15.733
We are partners.

14:15.860 --> 14:19.445
Yeah, but see,
here's the thing, Miguel.

14:19.572 --> 14:21.948
I don't really want a partner.

14:22.074 --> 14:25.368
Hey, I'm not giving up
on our friendship, Dex.

14:25.494 --> 14:27.245
Hell, I'm standing up at your wedding.

14:27.371 --> 14:30.874
Yeah. But after that,
you go your own way.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.460
And we both go back
to who we were before all of this -

14:34.587 --> 14:38.298
you an honorable ADA
dedicated to upholding the law of the land...

14:38.424 --> 14:41.259
- And you?
- A trusty spatter analyst

14:41.385 --> 14:42.969
who always gets his killer.

14:48.559 --> 14:50.101
In exchange for what?

14:50.227 --> 14:55.189
I'm in a position to protect
the ADA's interests in this case.

14:55.316 --> 14:58.860
I'll do what it takes to keep
the innocent people of Miami safe.

15:08.245 --> 15:10.079
And that's what you want?

15:12.207 --> 15:14.584
That's what I want.

15:22.801 --> 15:24.928
(Dexter) Game over.

15:35.272 --> 15:37.023
- Barbara Gianna?
- In there.

15:37.149 --> 15:38.983
- What do we know?
- Not much.

15:39.109 --> 15:41.444
The meds for the pain have her pretty blurry.

15:41.570 --> 15:44.322
Hey, you that, uh, homicide guy
she keeps talkin' about?

15:44.448 --> 15:48.409
- She talks about me?
- She says you snore like a motherfucker.

15:55.793 --> 15:58.211
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

16:01.924 --> 16:03.341
How you doing?

16:03.467 --> 16:07.637
I feel like I got a Buick
parked on my head.

16:09.098 --> 16:11.516
Wasn't raped...
if that's what you were thinking.

16:11.642 --> 16:13.101
I just got beat on a little.

16:13.227 --> 16:16.062
By who? Any ideas?

16:16.188 --> 16:18.523
Mm, best I can tell...

16:18.649 --> 16:22.026
some would-be john
saw me on the stroll.

16:22.152 --> 16:24.195
Asshole followed me home.

16:24.321 --> 16:26.030
So you got a look at him.

16:26.156 --> 16:27.240
Mm-hm.

16:27.366 --> 16:30.618
Tall, blond, good-looking.

16:30.744 --> 16:31.911
Mm.

16:32.037 --> 16:33.746
Strong.

16:35.541 --> 16:37.750
My weapon was in my purse.

16:37.876 --> 16:40.253
All I had were my keys.

16:40.379 --> 16:43.047
Got my licks in.

16:43.173 --> 16:44.549
He'll be a little...

16:44.675 --> 16:47.218
less handsome tomorrow.

16:52.057 --> 16:54.308
You did good.

16:56.061 --> 16:59.063
- I'm glad you're here.
- Hell, yeah, I'm here.

16:59.189 --> 17:02.400
You're not gonna go through this alone.

17:02.526 --> 17:04.902
And, uh, just for the record...

17:07.990 --> 17:10.199
I don't snore like a motherfucker.

17:10.325 --> 17:14.620
(Woman) Excuse me...we need to get
Detective Gianna upstairs for a cat scan,

17:14.747 --> 17:16.873
- see if we can release her.
- Release her?

17:16.999 --> 17:20.209
- I'm not that bad, Angel.
- Of course you're not.

17:26.425 --> 17:28.176
I'll talk to you later, OK?

17:38.228 --> 17:40.271
(Quiet chatter)

17:41.607 --> 17:44.567
Detective Gianna thinks she got
a piece of the assailant with these.

17:44.693 --> 17:48.446
You're looking for a blond guy, tall.
Could be a john.

17:48.572 --> 17:51.824
Maybe one of your other decoys
might have seen him.

17:51.950 --> 17:55.578
We're all over this. Thanks, Sergeant.

17:55.704 --> 17:58.372
Get this down to the lab fast.

18:07.216 --> 18:08.591
Angel.

18:08.717 --> 18:10.510
What can I do you for?

18:10.636 --> 18:13.471
I, uh, need you to test this for blood.

18:13.597 --> 18:16.307
If it comes back positive,
run it through the criminal database.

18:16.433 --> 18:20.144
No prob.
Might take a day or two for sequencing.

18:20.270 --> 18:23.606
Uh, grease it.
I mean, it's...it's a priority.

18:23.732 --> 18:25.274
- Sure.
- Thanks.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.985
Is this Ellen Wolf or the Skinner?
There's no case number.

18:28.112 --> 18:29.695
Uh, it's...

18:29.822 --> 18:33.116
It's more of...an internal thing.

18:33.242 --> 18:35.326
You know? My eyes only.

18:35.452 --> 18:37.370
Your eyes only.

18:37.496 --> 18:38.913
Thanks.

18:45.838 --> 18:49.507
I'm not hiding anything. I swear.

18:49.633 --> 18:52.051
You were coming on to Ellen. I was there.

18:52.177 --> 18:56.556
She came on to me. I flirted back.

18:56.682 --> 18:58.182
It's part of the job, you know?

18:58.308 --> 19:00.434
How you earn tips.

19:01.979 --> 19:04.147
She left me 20 on a $30 tab.

19:04.273 --> 19:07.066
You figured there was more
where that came from.

19:07.192 --> 19:10.528
You called her again at 1 1 :10pm,

19:10.654 --> 19:16.325
then at 3:01 and 3:08am. That's pretty
late to be calling someone you just met.

19:16.451 --> 19:18.202
I called on my break.

19:18.328 --> 19:20.872
I told her I didn't get off work till after two.

19:20.998 --> 19:22.790
She said to come over anyway.

19:24.084 --> 19:28.129
And then I called again to tell her I wasn't
going to make it. She didn't answer.

19:28.255 --> 19:33.009
I called one more time just in case.
No one picked up.

19:33.135 --> 19:36.345
(Dexter) For someone so innocent,
he sure looks guilty.

19:36.471 --> 19:38.681
Looks like a killer to me.

19:39.975 --> 19:41.851
- He's not.
- Well, but he could be.

19:44.104 --> 19:46.230
(LaGuerta) You wanna know
what I think happened?

19:46.356 --> 19:51.694
I think that you showed up at her house
unannounced, looking for sex.

19:51.820 --> 19:53.571
She wouldn't give it up,
you lost your temper.

19:53.697 --> 19:54.947
That's not what happened.

19:55.073 --> 19:58.117
Then you called twice to make it look like
you thought she was still alive.

19:58.243 --> 20:00.411
That's crazy. You're not listening to me.

20:00.537 --> 20:02.038
Any priors?

20:02.164 --> 20:06.000
You seem to have a problem
with the word "innocent".

20:06.126 --> 20:08.127
No one's getting framed for this.

20:08.253 --> 20:10.630
- Hey, your ball game.
- Why are you here?

20:10.756 --> 20:12.298
Curiosity.

20:12.424 --> 20:14.175
You can't blame me, can you?

20:14.301 --> 20:19.138
- So you didn't go over to her house?
- No. I went home.

20:19.264 --> 20:21.098
You're fucking lying, Toby.

20:21.225 --> 20:25.937
These two calls were routed through
a cellphone tower a block from her house.

20:26.063 --> 20:28.898
- You were there!
- All right!

20:31.401 --> 20:33.277
I have a fiancée...

20:34.947 --> 20:38.199
...who's not gonna like
hearing about a booty call.

20:38.325 --> 20:40.910
So you went there.
She changed her mind.

20:41.036 --> 20:43.079
- You got angry...
- No. No!

20:43.205 --> 20:45.414
I mean, yes, I went to her place,

20:45.540 --> 20:47.917
but she didn't answer the door.

20:48.043 --> 20:51.545
So I called - twice.

20:51.672 --> 20:55.967
I figured she fell asleep.
I went home. I swear to God.

20:56.093 --> 20:58.803
- Not much of a suspect.
- Not much of a witness.

20:58.929 --> 21:00.137
(Knocking)

21:00.264 --> 21:02.640
Lieutenant, do you have a second?

21:02.766 --> 21:04.892
(Dexter) Hmm. New development.

21:05.018 --> 21:06.352
Never know what'll pop up.

21:06.478 --> 21:09.397
Well...I'll know.

21:09.523 --> 21:11.065
I'll keep you posted, as promised.

21:11.191 --> 21:14.402
You're a good friend to have.
I'm just gonna stay here.

21:14.528 --> 21:16.070
My curiosity's piqued.

21:16.196 --> 21:18.322
(LaGuerta)
He's lying through his teeth.

21:18.448 --> 21:20.449
We can put him at the scene.

21:20.575 --> 21:22.994
He's, uh, not our guy.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.162
The fuck he's not.

21:25.289 --> 21:27.164
Four people put him at the bar all night long.

21:27.291 --> 21:31.585
And there's security camera footage of him
closing out when the vic went down.

21:31.712 --> 21:35.381
The vic's name is Ellen,
and he was there. He's our guy.

21:35.507 --> 21:39.176
The time code on the tape checks out.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

21:47.269 --> 21:49.520
You were there
at three in the morning.

21:49.646 --> 21:51.647
Did you see anyone else on the street?

21:51.773 --> 21:54.525
- No. It was dead.
- No unusual activity?

21:54.651 --> 21:57.445
There was some douchebag
with his high beams on.

21:57.571 --> 22:00.323
- Blinding me.
- So someone was on the street.

22:00.449 --> 22:03.034
He was coming the other direction
when I pulled up.

22:04.328 --> 22:06.662
Actually, it wasn't high beams.

22:06.788 --> 22:10.166
It was those big-ass halogens.

22:12.461 --> 22:13.502
What kind of car?

22:13.628 --> 22:14.920
SUV.

22:15.047 --> 22:17.840
Dark. Blue.

22:17.966 --> 22:21.510
Black. I-I-I don't know!
Something like that.

22:25.015 --> 22:27.516
I am indeed a good friend to have.

22:32.314 --> 22:35.316
And one can never have
too many friends, right?

22:37.110 --> 22:39.570
My friend Miguel
isn't giving up without a fight.

22:39.696 --> 22:43.032
He'll do whatever's necessary
to regain the upper hand.

22:44.159 --> 22:46.994
If he controls LaGuerta,
he controls the investigation,

22:47.120 --> 22:50.164
and my leverage disappears.

22:50.290 --> 22:53.209
But she's a tough sell.
He won't get far.

22:54.336 --> 22:55.753
I hope.

22:57.047 --> 22:59.340
(Rita) Ta-da!

23:04.471 --> 23:06.305
You...

23:06.431 --> 23:09.100
are so...beautiful!

23:10.894 --> 23:12.144
Oh...

23:12.270 --> 23:13.270
All right.

23:13.397 --> 23:16.440
Now, you come over here
and admire yourself

23:16.566 --> 23:18.692
while Nina checks the fit.

23:22.155 --> 23:23.823
I feel like Cinderella.

23:23.949 --> 23:26.951
Except for the whole
Disney virgin thing.

23:27.077 --> 23:28.577
Oh, don't worry.

23:28.703 --> 23:31.414
No one'll know Prince Charming
knocked ya up before the ball.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.416
(Chuckles)

23:33.542 --> 23:35.292
Hey, Syl, are you OK?

23:35.419 --> 23:39.255
Yeah. I was just remembering
my wedding day.

23:39.381 --> 23:41.632
I was never happier.

23:41.758 --> 23:46.011
- It's supposed to get even better over time.
- Sweetie, your marriage will, I'm sure of it.

23:46.138 --> 23:48.931
Things still aren't great with Miguel?

23:49.057 --> 23:51.475
Well, we're working on it.

23:51.601 --> 23:53.686
At least I am.

23:55.605 --> 23:58.732
- And what's he doing?
- I wish I knew.

24:00.193 --> 24:02.945
Do you? Really?

24:10.078 --> 24:12.163
What the hell are you doing in here?

24:12.289 --> 24:13.998
Forensics.

24:14.124 --> 24:15.458
On which case?

24:16.460 --> 24:19.503
The new bean-counter
is questioning this lab request.

24:19.629 --> 24:24.216
- What is this key that you're testing?
- It's, uh... It's for an investigation.

24:24.342 --> 24:27.845
Then put an active case number on it, OK?
With all these budget cuts,

24:27.971 --> 24:31.474
they're flagging everything and coming
straight to me with all this bullshit

24:31.600 --> 24:34.351
which I really don't need right now,
Dexter, OK? I don't need it.

24:34.478 --> 24:36.312
OK. I'll straighten it out.

24:41.443 --> 24:44.236
I'm sorry. I just...

24:44.362 --> 24:45.863
No. I'll take care of it.

24:49.451 --> 24:51.535
She's ripe for the picking,
and Miguel knows it.

24:51.661 --> 24:53.579
He'll use her to protect himself.

24:53.705 --> 24:57.041
And there goes my leverage.
Better keep an eye on her.

24:57.167 --> 25:00.669
No, no, no, no. You can't cancel.
The party's in two days.

25:01.880 --> 25:03.589
You're sorry?

25:03.715 --> 25:04.715
(Scoffs)

25:04.841 --> 25:08.636
Well, you can take your sorry
and shove it up your ass!

25:08.845 --> 25:10.387
Fuck!

25:13.308 --> 25:16.143
The erotic clowns just cancelled.
Why is this wedding happening to me?

25:16.269 --> 25:17.895
Bro, let me help you out.

25:18.021 --> 25:21.857
I've been the best man
at more weddings than I can count.

25:21.983 --> 25:25.194
Never a groom, thank Christ,
but I've planned a ton of these.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.238
Platinum Enterprises?

25:27.364 --> 25:31.200
It's a full-service operation,
party boat, food, alcohol.

25:31.326 --> 25:33.953
One phone call, and you're done.
Ask for Tammy.

25:36.331 --> 25:37.915
God bless you, Joseph Quinn.

25:43.838 --> 25:45.589
Hey. He lives.

25:45.715 --> 25:48.092
- Hey, man.
- Good to see you up and moving, man.

25:48.218 --> 25:50.886
Thanks, thanks.
Um...Morgan, she here?

25:51.012 --> 25:53.264
Uh, no, she's out.

25:53.390 --> 25:56.433
Running down a file
on the bastard who did this to you.

25:56.560 --> 25:59.603
- We're gonna find him, Anton, I swear.
- Yeah, I know.

25:59.729 --> 26:02.106
Hey, I just wanted to say,

26:02.232 --> 26:06.151
I never meant for any of this to go down
the way it did, you know?

26:06.278 --> 26:07.486
You didn't sign up for this.

26:07.612 --> 26:13.325
Listen, I was the idiot who got busted in
the first place, right? So...it's kind of on me.

26:13.451 --> 26:18.581
Yeah, but it was me thinking I was doing
you a favor keeping you off the books.

26:18.707 --> 26:21.625
I should have told you
you were free and clear. I messed up.

26:21.751 --> 26:23.752
I wanted to apologize to your face.

26:23.878 --> 26:27.798
(Scoffs)
Deb told me that was a clerical error.

26:29.509 --> 26:32.469
- So that was you?
- Yeah. I assumed she told you.

26:34.014 --> 26:37.141
You lying son of a bitch!
You almost got me killed!

26:37.267 --> 26:38.350
Shit!

26:38.476 --> 26:41.186
- It's all right. Let him go.
- What the hell is this?

26:41.313 --> 26:42.896
Ramos, let him go. Let him go!

26:45.984 --> 26:48.152
This shit ain't over, man.

26:48.278 --> 26:50.112
Anton...

26:52.449 --> 26:54.742
- You OK?
- Yeah.

26:58.913 --> 27:01.332
Anton, stop.
Goddamn it, will you just stop?

27:01.458 --> 27:02.875
His punk ass deserved it!

27:03.001 --> 27:05.252
You can't just walk into a police station
and punch a cop!

27:05.378 --> 27:06.712
Here you are standin' up for him.

27:06.838 --> 27:09.840
- I am not the enemy here.
- Debra, you lied to me!

27:09.966 --> 27:11.675
Clerical error, my ass.

27:11.801 --> 27:15.929
Quinn kept me as his CI bitch
when I could have walked away at any time.

27:16.056 --> 27:17.598
You're right, I lied.

27:17.724 --> 27:20.476
But telling you wasn't
gonna change what he did.

27:20.602 --> 27:22.394
I almost died because of that prick.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.772
Without that prick,
we wouldn't have found you.

27:24.898 --> 27:27.191
You'll be lucky if he doesn't press charges.

27:27.317 --> 27:30.861
What? Let him!
I'll sue this whole fucking department!

27:30.987 --> 27:33.072
Don't talk like that.

27:33.823 --> 27:36.075
I'll talk to Quinn.

27:36.618 --> 27:38.452
Really?

27:39.329 --> 27:42.081
Sure you're not afraid he might find out
we're sleeping together

27:42.207 --> 27:44.708
- and tell everyone?
- He already knows.

27:44.834 --> 27:47.378
And he hasn't told anyone.
Where the hell did that come from?

27:47.504 --> 27:51.715
From your brother's surprised face
when he met me, Debra.

27:51.841 --> 27:53.509
From your boot on my butt

27:53.635 --> 27:56.804
- kickin' me out the door this morning.
- Are you serious?

27:56.930 --> 27:59.890
I am this close to getting my shield,
and I'm putting it all at risk to be with you!

28:00.016 --> 28:02.351
Then, Debra, why are you?

28:03.520 --> 28:05.354
You feel guilty?

28:06.523 --> 28:09.108
You feel responsible
for what happened to me?

28:14.614 --> 28:16.490
Shit. You're bleeding.

28:19.494 --> 28:21.537
You're gonna need new stitches.

28:21.663 --> 28:23.831
Debra, I tell you what I'm gonna need.

28:26.501 --> 28:31.130
I need for you to seriously
think about this.

28:31.256 --> 28:33.215
Think about us.

28:44.519 --> 28:46.353
No, no, para mí, no.

28:46.479 --> 28:48.439
I think I've had enough.

28:48.565 --> 28:50.524
Wine...

28:50.650 --> 28:54.486
invented for the sole purpose
of handling grief.

28:54.612 --> 28:56.029
Hmm?

28:56.156 --> 28:58.782
Believe me, I know.

28:58.908 --> 29:01.910
When Oscar died,
I drowned my share of sorrow.

29:03.997 --> 29:06.415
I know how you feel.
You miss her.

29:08.334 --> 29:10.794
Just... Just...

29:10.920 --> 29:14.590
Last Thursday,
I was having drinks with her.

29:14.716 --> 29:16.633
And then the next day,

29:16.760 --> 29:20.262
I'm staring down at her dead body.

29:22.766 --> 29:25.976
If you're gonna end up in a grave,
it should at least be your own.

29:26.102 --> 29:29.062
And so the only thing you got to go on
right now is that SUV, huh?

29:29.189 --> 29:31.940
We're checking every
intersection surveillance camera

29:32.066 --> 29:34.401
from Ellen's place to the cemetery.

29:34.527 --> 29:36.320
Good. Good.

29:38.990 --> 29:40.866
Thorough.

29:42.994 --> 29:46.121
See, she's lucky to have you
watchin' out for her.

29:46.247 --> 29:50.501
It's just like you watched out for me
with Oscar's case.

29:50.627 --> 29:52.503
Some good that did.

29:52.629 --> 29:54.963
Hey, Maria, come on.

29:56.299 --> 30:01.136
You helped me.

30:02.555 --> 30:05.641
You've always been important to me.
You know that.

30:08.645 --> 30:11.688
You remember that weekend
when we took Oscar with us to the Keys?

30:11.815 --> 30:15.025
I kept telling him,
"I am not sharing...

30:15.151 --> 30:18.529
"the hottest girl in Florida
with my baby brother."

30:18.655 --> 30:21.532
And then you talked me
into letting him come.

30:21.658 --> 30:23.492
He was so cute.

30:24.702 --> 30:27.454
- Those skinny little legs.
- Mm-hm.

30:27.580 --> 30:30.916
Up until that weekend, he was always
my annoying kid brother, you know?

30:31.042 --> 30:32.876
Always in the way.

30:33.002 --> 30:35.420
And then when
he was taken from me,

30:35.547 --> 30:39.633
I kept on thinking back
to that weekend...you know?

30:39.759 --> 30:43.220
Cause that's the way
I wanna remember him, like you said.

30:43.346 --> 30:45.681
You know,
before all the drugs

30:45.807 --> 30:49.017
and all the run-ins
with the cops and all that.

30:50.728 --> 30:55.107
That little boy
with the skinny legs, my brother.

30:57.443 --> 30:58.861
(Whispers) Sorry.

31:03.366 --> 31:06.034
I wouldn't have had that memory
if it wasn't for you.

31:07.745 --> 31:09.204
Seriously.

31:10.832 --> 31:11.874
Thank you.

31:12.750 --> 31:14.084
Gracias.

31:39.444 --> 31:41.236
I miss that.

31:46.242 --> 31:48.035
(Knocking)

31:50.663 --> 31:53.040
Oh, man, I don't know
what came over me.

31:53.166 --> 31:55.542
It's OK. It's OK.

32:01.758 --> 32:04.551
Hey, Lieutenant, I am sorry
to show up unannounced.

32:04.677 --> 32:07.638
I know it's late, but I feel so bad
about that case number screw-up,

32:07.764 --> 32:09.723
and I just wanted to...

32:09.849 --> 32:11.016
Miguel.

32:12.310 --> 32:14.311
- I'm interrupting.
- No, we're just, um...

32:14.437 --> 32:16.438
- Casework.
- Talking casework.

32:16.564 --> 32:19.441
If this was so urgent, Dexter,
you could have called me.

32:19.567 --> 32:21.860
I know, I'm sorry. It's just...

32:21.986 --> 32:24.071
I feel bad,
and this is too important.

32:24.197 --> 32:27.991
The key I tested came from a colleague
in Monroe County.

32:28.117 --> 32:30.410
His department
doesn't have our resources,

32:30.536 --> 32:32.955
and I did him a favor. I'm sorry.

32:33.081 --> 32:35.540
I know how you value the truth.

32:35.667 --> 32:39.461
Look, don't worry about it.
Just let me know next time.

32:39.587 --> 32:41.129
OK.

32:41.255 --> 32:42.589
And call first.

32:42.715 --> 32:45.717
Again, I'm...sorry to interrupt.

32:56.646 --> 33:00.107
I couldn't let LaGuerta become
Miguel's collateral damage.

33:00.233 --> 33:02.526
I need to keep his focus on me.

33:02.652 --> 33:04.945
After tonight, I have his full attention.

33:05.071 --> 33:06.989
(Door opens)

33:10.910 --> 33:12.369
Hey, there.

33:12.495 --> 33:15.664
Please don't hate me,
but I may have done a bad thing.

33:16.833 --> 33:18.333
Do I need to sit down?

33:18.459 --> 33:21.169
I told Sylvia about Miguel and LaGuerta.

33:21.295 --> 33:23.130
I'm gonna sit down.

33:23.256 --> 33:25.841
I was trying on my dress.
We were talking about the wedding.

33:25.967 --> 33:28.552
She seemed so sad.
I mean, I had to say something, didn't I?

33:28.678 --> 33:31.513
- I suppose you did.
- So she called Miguel's office,

33:31.639 --> 33:34.641
and his assistant said that he was
meeting with Lieutenant LaGuerta,

33:34.767 --> 33:37.853
but then Syl checked with your precinct,
and neither of them is there.

33:37.979 --> 33:40.188
So...she thinks Miguel
is at LaGuerta's?

33:41.524 --> 33:43.233
What do you think she's gonna do?

33:53.036 --> 33:55.746
- I'll call you tomorrow, hmm?
- About the case?

33:55.872 --> 33:57.789
Sure. At the office.

33:58.708 --> 33:59.875
Maria...

34:00.001 --> 34:01.877
(Sylvia) You fucker!

34:02.837 --> 34:06.089
- You are too good a liar, Miguel.
- Syl, what are you doing here?

34:06.215 --> 34:08.175
I don't know when you're telling the truth
any more.

34:08.301 --> 34:10.052
You say you're at work. I believe you.

34:10.178 --> 34:12.387
You say you're not having an affair.
I believe you.

34:12.513 --> 34:14.556
Syl, nothing happened here, OK?

34:14.682 --> 34:16.767
- I swear to you.
- You swore to me last Thursday...

34:16.893 --> 34:18.185
when you were out all night.

34:18.311 --> 34:21.146
You swore to me
you weren't with another woman.

34:21.272 --> 34:23.440
But now I think you were here.

34:23.566 --> 34:26.568
- Wait. Last Thursday, he was not...
- You...

34:28.988 --> 34:33.116
You'll probably be a lot better
at seeing through his bullshit than I was,

34:33.242 --> 34:34.576
being a detective and all.

34:34.702 --> 34:36.995
- Good luck.
- Syl, come on, ven.

34:37.121 --> 34:39.247
Don't touch me. I'm done!

34:40.374 --> 34:42.626
- Syl.
- Get out of my life!

34:43.419 --> 34:45.796
(Car door closes, engine starts)

34:59.102 --> 35:01.103
She... She's got it all wrong.

35:02.438 --> 35:04.564
I'll straighten it out. All right?

35:07.276 --> 35:10.070
(Car door closes, engine starts)

35:31.467 --> 35:34.010
- Hey, Francisco!
- What'll it be today, Mr. Morgan?

35:34.137 --> 35:36.138
Olvídate, que ese pide lo de siempre.

35:38.015 --> 35:39.683
I said you'd take the usual.

35:42.812 --> 35:44.688
You're a creature...

35:44.814 --> 35:46.565
of habit.

35:46.691 --> 35:48.608
Come on, take a seat.
While you wait.

35:58.578 --> 36:01.746
Kind of a bitch move there, man.

36:01.873 --> 36:03.540
Sending my wife over to Maria's.

36:03.666 --> 36:05.667
Surprisingly, it wasn't me.

36:05.793 --> 36:07.169
Sure.

36:07.295 --> 36:09.880
You wouldn't play games
with a man's family,

36:10.006 --> 36:12.007
or, uh...

36:12.133 --> 36:14.217
cause pain to an innocent woman.

36:17.597 --> 36:20.557
Neither would I. That's why I wanted
to give you a heads up

36:20.683 --> 36:25.061
that my office is talking about doing
a little ethics probe on your sister.

36:26.189 --> 36:28.023
Cops don't come any cleaner than Deb.

36:28.149 --> 36:31.234
Yeah, huh?
Like, uh, sleeping with a CI?

36:31.360 --> 36:37.157
Cause it's all here in this surveillance report
for...what's-his-name, I got it right here.

36:38.075 --> 36:39.993
Anton Briggs.

36:40.953 --> 36:44.080
Now, mi'jito,
this don't look so good.

36:44.207 --> 36:45.916
Pero...

36:46.042 --> 36:48.418
I'm gonna keep a close eye on it...

36:48.544 --> 36:53.215
just like you're gonna keep a close eye
on Ellen's case for me.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.550
And any other favor I might have.

36:55.676 --> 36:57.844
The usual, Mr. Morgan.

37:01.224 --> 37:02.599
Here.

37:04.018 --> 37:05.810
It's a copy.

37:05.937 --> 37:07.604
Cause after all...

37:07.730 --> 37:10.523
familia is sacred.

37:11.984 --> 37:13.526
Right?

37:14.737 --> 37:17.572
He has no idea
what door he just opened.

37:19.450 --> 37:20.659
Mr. Dexter.

37:20.785 --> 37:22.035
Hey, Norma.

37:22.161 --> 37:24.120
The Prados, they're not home.

37:24.247 --> 37:25.622
That's what I was hoping.

37:25.748 --> 37:28.583
Did you know that Miguel
is gonna be best man for my wedding?

37:28.709 --> 37:31.544
Yeah. I heard him talking about it
with Mrs. Sylvia.

37:31.671 --> 37:33.964
Well, the groom is supposed
to buy his best man a gift.

37:34.090 --> 37:36.549
And I know how much Miguel
loves García Márquez,

37:36.676 --> 37:39.970
so I thought I'd pick up
a limited edition of one of his books.

37:40.096 --> 37:41.846
Oh, he would like that very much.

37:41.973 --> 37:44.474
Do you think it'd be all right
if I looked in Miguel's den

37:44.600 --> 37:46.893
just to see what he already has?

37:47.019 --> 37:48.270
Our secret.

37:49.146 --> 37:50.480
OK.

37:50.606 --> 37:51.940
Come in.

37:55.278 --> 37:57.112
I'll be out in a jiffy.

37:57.238 --> 37:58.697
OK.

38:11.711 --> 38:14.504
Miguel stepped over a line,
and he'll keep stepping

38:14.630 --> 38:18.466
until I have something he can't top,
something that could put him in jail,

38:18.592 --> 38:20.635
if and when I want him there.

38:27.435 --> 38:29.728
That's the only way he'll back off.

38:29.854 --> 38:32.939
I know Miguel killed Ellen Wolf.

38:33.065 --> 38:36.443
And I know he took
one of her rings as a trophy.

38:38.654 --> 38:40.822
The question is, where did he hide it?

38:48.998 --> 38:52.000
Somewhere no one else
would ever look.

39:01.469 --> 39:02.844
Unless...

39:04.805 --> 39:06.848
Unless they're me.

39:26.535 --> 39:28.161
No more games.

39:33.209 --> 39:35.418
Hi. Are you Vince?

39:35.544 --> 39:37.003
Yeah.

39:37.129 --> 39:39.381
I'm Tammy Okama.
Platinum Enterprises.

39:39.507 --> 39:42.092
- May I sit?
- Yeah, sure.

39:45.846 --> 39:48.264
- You're Tammy?
- Mm-hm.

39:48.391 --> 39:50.225
I was expecting someone...

39:50.351 --> 39:51.893
- Trashy?
- Yeah.

39:52.019 --> 39:53.853
That's sweet.

39:53.979 --> 39:56.564
So! We are planning a bachelor party.

39:56.690 --> 39:59.734
Yeah, but, uh, keep it down,
because party boy's in the next room.

39:59.860 --> 40:01.444
(Whispering) Oh! Well...

40:01.570 --> 40:05.865
we have any number of themes
you can choose from.

40:05.991 --> 40:09.369
Well, uh...what's your favorite?

40:09.495 --> 40:12.122
Mm. I'd stick with a nautical theme.

40:12.248 --> 40:16.126
- Riverboat casino, pirates in petticoats.
- Nautical's good.

40:16.252 --> 40:19.921
Mm-hm. You have such nice eyes, Vince.

40:22.466 --> 40:24.008
(He giggles)

40:24.468 --> 40:26.469
(She giggles)

40:26.595 --> 40:28.430
(Knocking)

40:29.348 --> 40:32.308
Hey, Dex, I got your message.
Did you get a DNA match on that key?

40:32.435 --> 40:34.727
Uh, seems so.

40:34.854 --> 40:36.312
Thank you.

40:36.439 --> 40:38.106
I mean it.

40:39.692 --> 40:41.443
So where's the report?

40:45.281 --> 40:47.615
If Angel wants to kill this guy,
that's his business.

40:47.741 --> 40:49.451
I'm done getting involved with friends.

40:49.577 --> 40:52.245
I heard LaGuerta gave you shit for this.

40:52.371 --> 40:53.705
It's all right.

40:53.831 --> 40:55.498
But I knew that I can trust you.

40:55.624 --> 40:57.792
Don't get involved.

40:58.586 --> 41:01.171
I heard about Detective Gianna.
How is she?

41:01.297 --> 41:02.755
What are you doing?

41:02.882 --> 41:05.383
OK. No concussion.

41:07.011 --> 41:08.720
Dex, the...the file.

41:08.846 --> 41:10.305
Yep.

41:13.601 --> 41:16.269
I know how hard it must have been
to see her like that.

41:16.395 --> 41:18.354
I know what it is to...

41:19.273 --> 41:22.150
want to rebalance an unbalanced world.

41:22.276 --> 41:24.027
But it's just...

41:24.153 --> 41:26.905
unbalanced, Angel, and that's it.

41:27.031 --> 41:28.573
OK.

41:28.699 --> 41:31.242
- OK.
- Some doors should stay shut.

41:32.495 --> 41:36.372
You open it, it's too easy
to walk through it a second time.

41:37.833 --> 41:40.543
I've seen it before. Recently, even.

41:46.800 --> 41:48.301
I'll keep it in mind.

41:51.263 --> 41:52.805
Thanks, Dex.

41:56.727 --> 42:00.772
Well, at least I didn't teach him
how to get away with murder. I'm learning.

42:11.534 --> 42:14.494
Thought you said you'd be gone
by the time I got back.

42:14.620 --> 42:18.039
I'm just getting some work stuff here.

42:18.165 --> 42:20.542
Just make sure you get everything.

42:20.668 --> 42:23.086
I don't want you using it
as an excuse to come back.

42:23.212 --> 42:24.963
Syl, look, I...

42:25.089 --> 42:26.923
Jeez.

42:27.049 --> 42:28.216
Damn it!

43:06.380 --> 43:09.591
Please, sir,
this stain just wouldn't come out.

43:09.717 --> 43:14.387
You know, once blood sets,
it's really hard to get out, so no charge.

43:35.618 --> 43:38.161
Devon Parks?

43:47.338 --> 43:49.172
Hey, Deb,

43:49.298 --> 43:52.967
I wanted to talk to you
about the thing you got going with your CI.

43:53.844 --> 43:55.345
Well, he's not a CI.

43:55.471 --> 43:57.805
And we don't have anything going,
not any more.

43:57.931 --> 43:59.474
Well, that settles that.

43:59.600 --> 44:02.727
Only a retard would have gotten involved
with Anton in the first place.

44:02.853 --> 44:05.605
I don't know.
He seemed like a nice enough guy.

44:05.731 --> 44:08.191
You seemed to like him.

44:08.317 --> 44:13.154
When he went missing, all I could think was,
"Please, God, don't let him be dead."

44:13.280 --> 44:15.448
And then I get him back,

44:15.574 --> 44:17.867
and all I can think is...

44:17.993 --> 44:19.994
how wrong he is for me.

44:20.120 --> 44:23.831
You know, like...
how bad it makes me look.

44:24.917 --> 44:26.834
Doesn't matter that he makes me happy

44:26.960 --> 44:30.546
or he makes me feel how you're supposed
to feel when you're with the right person.

44:30.673 --> 44:32.298
Is that crazy?

44:36.428 --> 44:37.887
I got nothin'.

44:38.013 --> 44:39.472
(Laughs)

44:41.058 --> 44:42.642
God.

44:43.560 --> 44:45.478
You are useless. (Laughs)

44:46.980 --> 44:49.065
Love you anyway.

45:19.304 --> 45:21.472
- Think this is funny?
- Not at all.

45:21.598 --> 45:24.392
- They said that stain would come out!
- Fuck you!

45:25.519 --> 45:27.270
I didn't get to where I am, who I am,

45:27.396 --> 45:30.940
by letting some little gusano like you
walk all over me! Where's my ring?

45:31.066 --> 45:33.735
It's not your ring. It's Ellen's.

45:33.861 --> 45:36.112
Though you did leave
a nice, clean print on it.

45:36.238 --> 45:38.906
Oh, there's plenty of blood
on your hands too!

45:39.032 --> 45:41.325
Ethan Turner, Clemson Galt.

45:41.452 --> 45:44.704
All deserving,
with nothing to tie me to their deaths

45:44.830 --> 45:46.831
and no bodies to prove
that they're even dead.

45:46.957 --> 45:48.833
Maybe in a court of law.

45:48.959 --> 45:50.960
But how's that little bride of yours gonna feel

45:51.086 --> 45:53.171
when she has to start
answering some questions?

45:53.297 --> 45:57.675
Cause she's gotta wonder where you go,
what you do, who you really are.

45:57.801 --> 46:00.595
She knows everything she needs to,
and it's gonna stay that way

46:00.721 --> 46:03.848
or that ring might show up
someplace very inconvenient.

46:03.974 --> 46:06.142
I am the last person you wanna fuck with,

46:06.268 --> 46:08.311
because I will fuck you back

46:08.437 --> 46:11.314
in ways you never even imagined!

46:12.775 --> 46:16.527
An anonymous tip,
couple of search warrants. Hmm?

46:16.653 --> 46:21.115
Who knows what the police might find in
your apartment or in that little boat of yours.

46:21.241 --> 46:22.241
You got the ring!

46:22.367 --> 46:25.661
(Spits) I got City fucking Hall!

46:25.788 --> 46:27.705
Wow. I didn't get it before, Miguel,

46:27.831 --> 46:31.209
but you can't be reasoned with,
guilted, controlled.

46:31.335 --> 46:34.128
This whole back-and-forth game
for leverage is pointless.

46:34.254 --> 46:37.381
That's right!
I'll do what I want, when I want,

46:37.508 --> 46:40.051
to whomever I want!
Count on it!

46:41.136 --> 46:42.845
I will.

46:50.020 --> 46:51.604
Thank you.

47:04.326 --> 47:07.703
Harry was right.
He's always been right.

47:07.830 --> 47:10.957
There are the innocent,
and there are the deserving.

47:11.083 --> 47:13.459
(Batista) Have Barbara Gianna ID this guy.

47:13.585 --> 47:16.462
Some doors should stay closed.

47:17.381 --> 47:19.715
Some people can understand that.

47:21.969 --> 47:24.637
Harry also said it's all about choices.

47:26.765 --> 47:28.975
Good and bad.

47:41.196 --> 47:44.365
My search for connection
always ends in blood.

47:44.491 --> 47:46.951
(Cellphone ringing)

47:50.414 --> 47:52.456
You get a good look at him?

47:52.583 --> 47:56.752
(Man) Yes. How do I know
this is not a trap?

47:56.879 --> 47:59.297
Oye. If I wanted you in jail,

47:59.423 --> 48:02.592
I wouldn't have let you loose
in the first place, OK?

48:02.718 --> 48:06.470
And you believe this man
knows where Freebo is?

48:06.597 --> 48:08.472
He's the only one who does.

48:08.599 --> 48:10.349
His name?

48:12.811 --> 48:14.645
(Miguel) Dexter Morgan.

48:14.771 --> 48:16.480
You want Freebo,

48:16.607 --> 48:18.441
you want your money...

48:21.778 --> 48:25.531
then you need to have
a long conversation with him.

48:27.659 --> 48:30.703
Even Harry would agree
Miguel has left me no other choice.

48:30.829 --> 48:34.248
As challenging as it will be,
it's back to option one.

48:35.626 --> 48:37.376
I kill him.

48:58.565 --> 49:00.399
(Cellphone rings)

49:02.986 --> 49:04.987
(Yelling)

49:06.949 --> 49:09.533
(Tires squeal)
