WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:03.298
Previously on Dexter.

00:03.425 --> 00:05.384
I just got off the phone
with the Sheriff's Department.

00:05.510 --> 00:08.053
They've confirmed
their skinning victim is related to ours.

00:08.179 --> 00:09.888
(Debra) That gives us three victims.

00:10.015 --> 00:13.058
I've got Unis bringing in
a 15-year-old kid named Wendell Owens.

00:13.184 --> 00:14.518
He was Freebo's doorman.

00:14.644 --> 00:17.980
But if things get really bad,
you use that card and call me, OK?

00:18.106 --> 00:20.607
You think I cut this kid loose
to make you look bad?

00:20.734 --> 00:23.402
I'm not sure any more...

00:23.528 --> 00:25.070
partner.

00:25.196 --> 00:27.239
(Yuki) You know a Joey Quinn?

00:27.365 --> 00:29.533
Cooperation with IA has its upside.

00:29.659 --> 00:31.744
Yuki, that's not gonna happen.

00:31.870 --> 00:33.120
(Miguel) Ramon's obsessed.

00:33.246 --> 00:35.414
He's not going to stop
looking for Oscar's killer

00:35.540 --> 00:37.082
until it takes him all the way down.

00:37.208 --> 00:39.084
- Is there a problem here?
- Yeah, Sergeant.

00:39.210 --> 00:41.253
Your people don't know
what the fuck they're doing.

00:41.379 --> 00:43.464
(Debra) That guy is wound way too tight.

00:43.590 --> 00:45.924
Where ya been, Dexter?

00:46.051 --> 00:49.678
- How are you, Camilla?
- Ah. I've been better.

00:49.804 --> 00:53.223
Are you, uh, looking for
anything special tonight?

00:53.349 --> 00:55.142
Might be more than an hour.

00:57.645 --> 01:00.022
(Whispering) Take a pass...Sergeant.

01:02.567 --> 01:04.651
Anton, open up. It's me.

01:06.237 --> 01:08.947
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:09.074 --> 01:12.451
The Chicky Hines conviction.
My people have come across evidence

01:12.577 --> 01:13.952
that could get the case reopened.

01:14.079 --> 01:16.080
Prado know you're
coming to me with this?

01:16.206 --> 01:18.457
Don't you see what happened today?

01:18.583 --> 01:22.211
I gave you the chance to avenge
two women whom the system failed,

01:22.337 --> 01:26.632
and just like I hoped,
you seized that opportunity.

01:26.758 --> 01:31.011
I see who you are. I am with you.
Behind you.

01:32.597 --> 01:34.264
And I respect you.

03:30.381 --> 03:33.884
(Miguel) He's tired. Keep on reeling.
You got him.

03:34.010 --> 03:35.761
Here he comes! Come here!

03:35.887 --> 03:37.763
Come here!

03:37.889 --> 03:40.474
- Oh, yeah! Oh, shit!
- (Dexter laughs)

03:41.434 --> 03:43.769
(Dexter) Ah, ah.

03:43.895 --> 03:47.439
- Ah...ah!
- Tranquilo. Coge.

03:47.565 --> 03:49.524
That's gonna be some
mighty fine eatin'.

03:49.651 --> 03:53.111
Hey, man, on the grill
with Syl's mango-and-lime salsa.

03:53.238 --> 03:54.780
Our house tomorrow night.

03:54.906 --> 03:59.326
Check with the little woman...
who's getting bigger as we speak.

03:59.452 --> 04:01.828
(Chuckling)

04:01.955 --> 04:04.331
(Dexter) I could get used to the simple joys
of male bonding.

04:04.457 --> 04:07.417
- Hey, how 'bout a...brewski?
- OK.

04:07.543 --> 04:09.795
Ah, that looks good.

04:11.381 --> 04:13.131
So, Dex...

04:14.259 --> 04:15.509
Ahh.

04:15.635 --> 04:17.719
What was it like, man?

04:17.845 --> 04:19.429
In Bimini.

04:22.725 --> 04:24.977
Flat, mostly. Lots of mangroves.

04:25.103 --> 04:28.355
- Talking about Ethan Turner.
- What about him?

04:28.481 --> 04:31.441
What did it feel like to, uh...
take him out, hmm?

04:31.567 --> 04:33.860
To end his life.

04:35.989 --> 04:39.116
So much for the simple joys
of male bonding.

04:39.951 --> 04:43.453
Like I could explain
or Miguel could understand.

04:44.330 --> 04:47.666
You put people on death row.
You must know what it's like.

04:47.792 --> 04:49.835
Oh, no, but there's, like,
an ocean of bureaucracy

04:49.961 --> 04:53.130
of briefs and appeals between me
and that bad guy taking his last breath.

04:53.256 --> 04:57.342
I'm asking you what did it feel like
to use your hands, to...

04:57.468 --> 04:59.845
to make this a better place?

05:02.682 --> 05:05.142
It felt...right.

05:07.145 --> 05:09.229
Felt like justice.

05:13.526 --> 05:15.360
I've got, like, five floors of prosecutors

05:15.486 --> 05:19.031
and the whole police department at
my fingertips, and you did what I couldn't.

05:19.157 --> 05:21.199
You came through for me, Dex.

05:21.326 --> 05:24.494
I been sleepin' like a baby ever since.

05:27.915 --> 05:29.708
It's hot today, huh?

05:30.835 --> 05:32.878
Like I said the other night,

05:33.004 --> 05:34.379
I know you, Dexter.

05:34.505 --> 05:36.381
I see who you are.

05:36.507 --> 05:39.551
We're like-minded. Hmm?

05:41.012 --> 05:42.804
Together, we can make a difference.

05:44.182 --> 05:46.016
(Dexter) We?

05:46.142 --> 05:49.561
Miguel, my amigo, claims to know me.

05:49.687 --> 05:52.731
On some level,
I suppose maybe that's true.

05:52.857 --> 05:54.608
(Harry) Who are you kidding?

05:56.861 --> 05:59.654
He knows about Freebo.

05:59.781 --> 06:02.699
He detailed me
to the Ethan Turner kill.

06:05.620 --> 06:08.413
He's seen me with blood on my hands
and hasn't blinked.

06:08.539 --> 06:12.209
Miguel's got no clue
what's really going on inside you.

06:12.335 --> 06:13.877
The urge, the ritual.

06:14.003 --> 06:18.048
Miguel has really gone out of his way
to understand who I am...

06:19.008 --> 06:21.885
which is more than you ever did.

06:22.011 --> 06:26.056
Well, I understood.
I just couldn't accept it.

06:27.892 --> 06:29.726
And Miguel won't either.

06:31.020 --> 06:32.646
You didn't want me to have any friends.

06:32.772 --> 06:35.232
You think Miguel's a pal?

06:35.358 --> 06:37.734
Your wingman?

06:37.860 --> 06:41.071
You might wanna put
that notion to the test...

06:41.197 --> 06:43.824
see how like-minded
you and Miguel really are.

06:47.245 --> 06:50.789
Every time you let
someone get close,

06:50.915 --> 06:52.499
it ends badly.

06:56.421 --> 06:59.965
I do need to consider
my spotty record connecting

07:00.091 --> 07:01.842
with others.

07:01.968 --> 07:03.802
But Miguel's not going away.

07:03.928 --> 07:05.887
I need to make him
understand the risks.

07:06.013 --> 07:09.641
When he does, he'll wanna rethink
the like-minded thing.

07:11.144 --> 07:15.564
Just because he can gut a fish
doesn't qualify him to hang with me while I...

07:15.690 --> 07:17.441
do what I do best.

07:23.656 --> 07:26.908
(Police radio chatter)

07:27.952 --> 07:30.454
You need a jump? I have cables.

07:33.624 --> 07:35.208
Skinner struck again.

07:35.334 --> 07:37.210
Super-hard this time.

07:37.336 --> 07:39.880
The victim's name was Wendell Owen.
He was 15-years-old.

07:40.006 --> 07:43.675
It's more collateral damage
in our search for fucking Freebo.

07:43.801 --> 07:45.635
Wendell Owens?

07:47.138 --> 07:49.514
I brought him in
for questioning the other day.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.683
I thought I remembered
hearing his name somewhere.

07:51.809 --> 07:53.768
He might have been mixed up
with some lowlifes,

07:53.895 --> 07:57.647
but Wendell was
a pretty decent kid. (Sobs)

07:58.774 --> 08:01.109
Go do your thing.
I just need a minute.

08:12.246 --> 08:15.332
Body's still warm. Putting time of death
about three hours ago.

08:15.458 --> 08:17.250
Unlike the two previous victims,

08:17.376 --> 08:19.711
this one died from
the skinning process itself.

08:19.837 --> 08:21.296
Jesus Christ.

08:21.422 --> 08:24.299
Freebo's probably in another galaxy,
and the Skinner doesn't even know it.

08:24.425 --> 08:26.635
Meanwhile, he's stepping up his game.

08:26.761 --> 08:29.554
Maybe we let the press know
Freebo got outta Dodge,

08:29.680 --> 08:32.224
might get this guy
to put down his Ginsu knife.

08:32.350 --> 08:33.725
Or he'll keep looking,

08:33.851 --> 08:36.728
take his horror show on the road,
become somebody else's nightmare.

08:36.854 --> 08:39.397
No, I wanna nail
whoever's doing this.

08:39.524 --> 08:43.151
He's definitely not learning to do this
on the fly. He's had plenty of practice.

08:43.277 --> 08:46.071
You run this through
the national database,

08:46.197 --> 08:49.157
see if a similar MO
comes up anywhere else.

08:56.874 --> 08:59.751
What I need to find right now
is a target to present to Miguel

08:59.877 --> 09:03.088
with a high degree
of difficuIty and jeopardy.

09:06.801 --> 09:10.345
So that he truly understands
that he's in way over his head.

09:11.597 --> 09:13.473
Dex. I have a question.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.354
It's serious.
I can't ask any of the other cops.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.482
- I'm all yours.
- It's about the Skinner.

09:22.608 --> 09:25.443
His last two victims,
Wendell and Javier,

09:25.570 --> 09:28.905
they were both killed
after I was done questioning them.

09:30.533 --> 09:33.868
Do you think the Skinner's
drafting off my investigation?

09:36.247 --> 09:38.248
I don't know.
Anything's possible.

09:38.374 --> 09:42.502
Because I'm freaking out that whoever's
looking for Freebo is using me to track him.

09:42.628 --> 09:44.296
Who else knows you brought Wendell in?

09:44.422 --> 09:48.633
His mom, um...
all the cops in the station.

09:48.759 --> 09:50.635
Anton.

09:50.761 --> 09:52.554
Ramon Prado.

09:53.973 --> 09:55.390
Miguel's brother.

09:57.643 --> 09:59.603
The law and order hard-ass sheriff

09:59.729 --> 10:03.189
who's been obsessed about finding Freebo
for killing his little brother?

10:04.317 --> 10:05.525
There's your motive.

10:05.651 --> 10:08.653
Do we seriously think
that Ramon, a fellow cop,

10:08.779 --> 10:10.780
could do something this sick?

10:10.906 --> 10:14.659
Like a career in law enforcement
precludes violent behavior?

10:14.785 --> 10:17.871
Can you imagine the shitstorm
this is gonna create if I'm wrong?

10:17.997 --> 10:20.624
It'll create a worse
shitstorm if you're right.

10:24.337 --> 10:27.547
- Hey, keep me in the loop.
- Yeah.

10:27.673 --> 10:31.384
Ramon's got anger issues.
I don't want you getting hurt.

10:31.510 --> 10:34.346
Aw. You do care about me.

10:36.515 --> 10:39.976
Wait till you see the wine cellar
at The Forge. It is legendary!

10:40.102 --> 10:43.104
(Chuckles) They even have a bottle
of Château d'Yquem...

10:43.230 --> 10:45.523
- belonged to Thomas Jefferson.
- (Phone rings)

10:45.650 --> 10:48.276
I'm kind of a Cuba Libre kinda girl myself.

10:48.402 --> 10:50.111
(Answer machine beeps)

10:50.237 --> 10:52.614
(Man) Ellen, it's me. Nicely done.

10:52.740 --> 10:54.949
Handing Miguel Prado
his head on a pike today -

10:55.076 --> 10:59.579
make the Hines motion stick,
he could be disbarred. Bravissimo.

10:59.705 --> 11:01.373
(Beep)

11:01.499 --> 11:05.502
I was gonna talk to you about this,
if and when my motion's upheld.

11:06.921 --> 11:09.881
How about we talk about it now?

11:10.007 --> 11:11.466
OK.

11:11.592 --> 11:16.346
Miguel's been playing fast and loose
for a long time with legal ethics.

11:16.472 --> 11:19.391
The Chicky Hines case
is just one example

11:19.517 --> 11:21.559
on a very long list
of prosecutorial misconduct.

11:21.686 --> 11:25.230
I came to you with information
to help your client,

11:25.356 --> 11:29.859
not for you to trump up some witch-hunt
against my friend and colleague.

11:31.112 --> 11:34.614
You can't possibly believe
he's either of those things

11:34.740 --> 11:36.366
if you really knew Miguel.

11:36.492 --> 11:38.284
Believe me, I know Miguel.

11:38.411 --> 11:40.912
I will explain everything over dinner.

11:41.038 --> 11:42.706
No, thanks.

11:44.208 --> 11:46.918
I'm not feeling especially
social right now.

11:56.303 --> 11:57.595
Hey.

11:58.889 --> 12:00.390
Hope I'm not interrupting.

12:01.308 --> 12:03.309
(Chuckles) No, I'm alone. Come on in.

12:05.062 --> 12:07.439
- Taking the night off?
- Mm...

12:12.862 --> 12:15.822
- So, um...beer?
- Sure.

12:15.948 --> 12:17.449
Pot?

12:17.575 --> 12:19.242
Fuck you.

12:23.706 --> 12:25.999
Sounded kind of upset on the phone.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.918
I'm kind of upset in person too.

12:30.921 --> 12:35.592
Um...you didn't talk to anyone

12:35.718 --> 12:37.927
about me bringing Wendell in
for questioning?

12:39.472 --> 12:42.056
No. I don't talk to anybody
about anything.

12:42.183 --> 12:44.976
I try to keep the whole CI thing
under wraps, you know?

12:45.102 --> 12:47.729
Then how the hell did it get out?

12:47.855 --> 12:51.441
Well, it's a pretty safe bet
Wendell didn't tell anybody.

12:53.944 --> 12:56.738
You should have seen
what this sicko did to him.

12:56.864 --> 12:59.240
I'm glad I didn't.

12:59.366 --> 13:03.161
What would make anyone go that hard
on some street kid, for Christ's sakes?

13:03.287 --> 13:04.871
There's this guy I'm lookin' at,

13:04.997 --> 13:07.957
he's a cop who had a beef with Freebo.

13:08.083 --> 13:11.586
He saw me in the station
when I was questioning Wendell.

13:11.712 --> 13:13.880
Wouldn't be the first
time the boys in blue

13:14.006 --> 13:16.216
handled their own business, right?

13:18.511 --> 13:22.514
I can't rule out that I put
Wendell in the crosshairs.

13:22.640 --> 13:26.309
He trusted me enough
to cooperate and...

13:28.479 --> 13:30.480
look what happened to him.

13:36.529 --> 13:38.404
Hey, look...

13:40.658 --> 13:42.617
even if you're right,

13:42.743 --> 13:45.411
you couldn't have known, right?

13:47.998 --> 13:49.624
Don't beat yourself up.

13:54.338 --> 13:56.047
It's what I do best, huh?

14:06.851 --> 14:09.102
I should go.

14:09.228 --> 14:11.104
All right.

14:13.399 --> 14:15.984
(Sighs) Hey, um...

14:16.110 --> 14:18.403
Hey, look, um...

14:18.529 --> 14:21.406
that girl from
the other night was...

14:21.532 --> 14:23.241
was nothing serious.

14:23.367 --> 14:27.912
Uh, well...it's none
of my business anyway.

14:28.038 --> 14:29.539
Yeah, right.

14:31.709 --> 14:33.710
Right.

14:33.836 --> 14:35.211
Jenna Kendrick.

14:35.337 --> 14:38.756
One of the first crime scenes
I worked blood spatter.

14:41.176 --> 14:42.969
This was somebody's daughter.

14:44.597 --> 14:48.016
And that was done to her
by this animal.

14:48.142 --> 14:49.309
Clemson Galt.

14:49.435 --> 14:51.144
Aryan affiliated.

14:51.270 --> 14:54.105
Took a claw hammer to her
for getting pregnant.

14:54.231 --> 14:56.983
He was arrested for murder,
even confessed to his cellmate.

14:57.109 --> 14:59.110
He called it "hammer time".

14:59.236 --> 15:00.403
They get a conviction?

15:00.529 --> 15:04.198
Galt's Aryan affiliates
either got witnesses to recant

15:04.325 --> 15:07.452
or made them disappear.
Verdict came back not guilty.

15:07.578 --> 15:10.121
That type of stuff happens way too often.

15:10.247 --> 15:14.375
Galt's doing 15 to 20 for armed robbery
in a supermax upstate.

15:14.501 --> 15:17.253
Well, that's something, at least.
Get him off the streets.

15:17.379 --> 15:19.422
Only he's still running things
from his prison cell.

15:19.548 --> 15:22.425
The wife and three kids
of an Aryan defector,

15:22.551 --> 15:24.427
killed with a claw hammer.

15:26.013 --> 15:29.933
While you're sleeping like a baby,
this is who's keeping me up nights.

15:33.270 --> 15:35.188
(Dexter) Justice comes at a price,

15:35.314 --> 15:38.316
one that Miguel is about to discover
he can't afford.

15:38.442 --> 15:40.443
This asshole doesn't
deserve to breathe, OK?

15:40.569 --> 15:44.113
You're not gonna get
any argument with me about that.

15:44.239 --> 15:48.117
But he's in custody.
In a supermax, no less.

15:48.243 --> 15:50.286
That's always been the problem.

15:53.415 --> 15:56.918
You're the big-deal law enforcement guy.
I bet you could get us access.

15:57.044 --> 16:00.463
That's beyond dangerous, Dexter.
That's crazy!

16:00.589 --> 16:02.340
I knew if I appealed to reason,

16:02.466 --> 16:05.677
Miguel would eventually
understand the downside.

16:05.803 --> 16:08.972
Never mind that my fingerprints
will be all over this!

16:09.098 --> 16:14.352
Reason leads to self-preservation,
a potent force.

16:14.478 --> 16:17.647
We both would be seriously
exposed here.

16:20.234 --> 16:21.776
I just need to sit back.

16:21.902 --> 16:24.862
He'll see the pros are heavily
outweighed by the cons,

16:24.989 --> 16:27.699
and we'll be back to mojitos
and barbecues.

16:30.452 --> 16:31.869
Yeah, when you get right down to it,

16:31.996 --> 16:34.998
I guess Ethan Turner was
an accident of opportunity,

16:35.124 --> 16:36.666
a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

16:37.835 --> 16:39.502
What about Freebo?

16:39.628 --> 16:41.921
Another accident of opportunity?

16:42.047 --> 16:45.758
Well, that situation
just sort of...unfolded.

16:45.884 --> 16:48.469
You're right.

16:48.595 --> 16:51.681
We both have too much to lose.

16:52.516 --> 16:55.435
Hey, we took out
the garbage...twice.

16:55.561 --> 16:57.520
We should quit while we're ahead.

16:57.646 --> 16:59.313
No.

17:01.525 --> 17:05.236
I owe you this one, Dexter.
You stuck your neck out for me twice now.

17:05.362 --> 17:07.196
- No, you don't owe me.
- Fair is fair.

17:07.322 --> 17:09.240
And I won't let you down.

17:12.036 --> 17:15.329
But we need to come up
with a real plan.

17:15.456 --> 17:18.291
Again...we.

17:19.334 --> 17:21.127
Miguel surprised me last night.

17:21.253 --> 17:24.964
I expected him to say no
and he gave me a definite maybe instead.

17:25.090 --> 17:27.133
Hey. No doughnuts today?

17:27.259 --> 17:29.260
Not today, Vince.

17:29.386 --> 17:31.387
Talk about your passive aggressive.

17:31.513 --> 17:34.432
Clemson Galt has been
on my top ten list for years,

17:34.558 --> 17:36.309
and Miguel could be a big help.

17:36.435 --> 17:38.603
But the goal here
isn't to satisfy my need,

17:38.729 --> 17:41.314
it's to get Miguel
to find some other hobby.

17:41.440 --> 17:44.025
Dexter. Got a minute?

17:45.444 --> 17:48.696
- Who's sick?
- Uh, remember Camilla from records?

17:48.822 --> 17:52.492
She's in the hospital. It's not looking good,
so I got everyone to sign.

17:52.618 --> 17:54.452
Camilla's sick?

17:54.578 --> 17:56.579
Sorry, I thought you knew.

17:56.705 --> 17:58.748
Lung cancer. It's terminal.

17:58.874 --> 18:00.416
Just like Gene.

18:00.542 --> 18:02.210
Camilla's husband.

18:02.336 --> 18:05.505
My folks used to play cards with them
when Deb and I were growing up.

18:05.631 --> 18:08.341
He died just last year.
Lung cancer too.

18:08.467 --> 18:10.760
- Smokers?
- Chimneys.

18:12.137 --> 18:15.181
- Life catches up.
- Yeah.

18:15.307 --> 18:17.308
So does death.

18:17.434 --> 18:19.477
It's a shame. She's a good person.

18:19.603 --> 18:21.187
It sounds like she was a friend.

18:21.313 --> 18:23.272
(Pen scratching)

18:23.398 --> 18:25.274
A good friend.

18:26.693 --> 18:29.195
Those are in short supply these days.

18:29.321 --> 18:31.906
Camilla's at Good Samaritan.
You could drop that off,

18:32.032 --> 18:34.033
let her know she's in our prayers.

18:34.159 --> 18:35.827
- I'll do that.
- Thanks.

18:36.787 --> 18:40.498
Detective Gianna.
Sergeant Batista, Miami Metro Homicide.

18:40.624 --> 18:42.333
How can I help you, Sergeant?

18:42.459 --> 18:46.170
(Batista) I was, uh, wondering, Detective.

18:46.964 --> 18:48.965
Maybe we could...

18:49.091 --> 18:51.008
see each other.

18:51.135 --> 18:53.970
As... As in a...a date?

18:55.139 --> 18:57.515
Well, yeah.
You could call it that.

18:57.641 --> 19:00.893
Look, um, Sergeant,
let's be clear.

19:01.019 --> 19:04.689
Cause being clear
will save us both a lot of agita.

19:04.815 --> 19:08.025
Hey! I, uh...

19:08.152 --> 19:11.445
I don't date. Ever.

19:11.572 --> 19:14.949
Do you eat...ever?

19:16.243 --> 19:18.369
Sometimes.

19:18.495 --> 19:20.037
Good nutrition's important.

19:21.832 --> 19:25.960
I'll tell you what, Sergeant.
I get hungry enough, I will call you.

19:34.845 --> 19:36.596
Angel?

19:39.099 --> 19:40.224
What?

19:40.350 --> 19:43.019
Can I throw something at you
that might sound a little crazy?

19:43.145 --> 19:45.563
Crazy? From you?

19:47.191 --> 19:48.816
- Ramon Prado.
- What about him?

19:48.942 --> 19:50.818
Do we like him for the Skinner?

19:55.782 --> 19:57.742
OK, that's not a little crazy.

19:57.868 --> 20:01.078
He has access to all of our records,
so he knows exactly who I've been talking to.

20:01.205 --> 20:03.581
And we've all seen him up close -
this is not a stable guy.

20:03.707 --> 20:06.626
- He's a fucking whack job.
- I looked into his work schedule.

20:06.752 --> 20:09.128
He was off duty
when the last two murders went down.

20:09.254 --> 20:13.841
You seriously wanna look
at Ramon Prado for multiple homicide?

20:13.967 --> 20:15.885
If only to rule him out.

20:16.011 --> 20:19.639
Not only have we not found the perp
that killed Miguel Prado's little brother,

20:19.765 --> 20:23.434
now you wanna investigate
his other brother for murder?

20:23.560 --> 20:24.936
In a nutshell.

20:25.062 --> 20:27.813
Can't ignore something
just cause it's messy.

20:27.940 --> 20:30.274
If I'm right, this is huge.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.860
And if you're wrong,
everyone involved will be shitting blood

20:32.986 --> 20:34.654
due to acts I'd rather not describe.

20:34.780 --> 20:36.572
Thanks for that, Sarge.

20:37.950 --> 20:39.784
I've got a gut feeling.

20:39.910 --> 20:42.620
You, uh, wanna go
to the Lieutenant with this?

20:42.746 --> 20:44.789
I can't go to LaGuerta with this.

20:47.918 --> 20:50.586
You follow up, off the grid,

20:50.712 --> 20:52.964
- and it's on you.
- Thank you, Sarge.

20:53.090 --> 20:56.842
Ramon's off duty tonight and tomorrow.
I'll set up on him, see what shakes loose.

20:56.969 --> 20:59.637
- If you need company...
- I've got it covered.

20:59.763 --> 21:03.891
And try to be discreet, will you?
For a change?

21:04.017 --> 21:06.143
Yeah.

21:36.383 --> 21:37.800
Dexter.

21:39.052 --> 21:40.386
You came.

21:40.512 --> 21:44.348
I also brought you these.
But it looks like somebody beat me to it.

21:44.474 --> 21:46.350
Oh, well...

21:46.476 --> 21:49.228
a new mom in Maternity

21:49.354 --> 21:51.897
donated them to Terminal Care.

21:53.984 --> 21:56.152
Talk about irony, huh?

22:02.659 --> 22:04.493
You know, Dexter,

22:04.619 --> 22:08.539
my whole life
I've been searching for...

22:11.668 --> 22:14.128
The meaning of life?

22:15.005 --> 22:17.256
The perfect...

22:17.382 --> 22:19.216
Key lime pie.

22:20.385 --> 22:23.929
And what do I get
when I'm about to croak?

22:24.056 --> 22:30.227
Fucking pie crust, Reddi-wip,
and green Jell-O.

22:30.354 --> 22:33.773
I'll see what I can do about finding you
the perfect Key lime pie.

22:33.899 --> 22:36.067
You'd better do it fast.

22:37.861 --> 22:39.862
Next thing to go is the appetite.

22:49.581 --> 22:51.916
Gene always had this thing

22:52.042 --> 22:54.627
about lighting my cigarette.

22:54.753 --> 22:57.296
And he'd pass it to me...

22:59.091 --> 23:01.384
before he lit his own.

23:04.429 --> 23:06.639
Sweet, sweet man.

23:13.271 --> 23:17.316
Then... Then it all caught up to him.

23:17.442 --> 23:20.653
I watched him wither to a skeleton.

23:20.779 --> 23:25.950
My six-foot tall,
200-pound husband,

23:26.076 --> 23:28.869
shitting all over himself.

23:32.207 --> 23:34.583
His last breath was a mercy.

23:41.174 --> 23:42.675
(Coughing)

23:42.801 --> 23:44.844
(Sighs)

23:45.887 --> 23:47.972
Dying I can do.

23:48.098 --> 23:50.641
Hell, I'm doing it.

23:50.767 --> 23:53.978
The pain sure is a bear, though.

23:54.104 --> 23:55.479
How bad?

23:55.605 --> 23:58.274
The worst part
of the whole damn thing...

23:58.400 --> 24:01.485
not losing my life...

24:01.611 --> 24:04.405
my time on this earth...

24:05.657 --> 24:08.284
is losing my...my...

24:12.581 --> 24:14.457
(Whispering) Dignity.

24:31.016 --> 24:35.186
- Ah, that fish was great.
- You don't think Miguel overcooked it?

24:35.312 --> 24:38.564
A bit, but the mango salsa
saved the day.

24:38.690 --> 24:40.524
Thank you.

24:40.650 --> 24:44.278
So do you like what you do?
I mean, real estate.

24:44.404 --> 24:46.697
I can't imagine doing anything else.

24:48.783 --> 24:50.951
Yeah, I decided
that losing myjob at the hotel

24:51.077 --> 24:53.829
is not a bad thing but a good thing.

24:53.955 --> 24:56.373
So I'm looking around.

24:56.500 --> 25:00.169
Well, with your people skills,
you'd be great at real estate.

25:00.295 --> 25:01.504
You think?

25:03.882 --> 25:06.175
How 'bout you start work tomorrow?

25:07.844 --> 25:09.720
I'm...I'm sorry, what?

25:09.846 --> 25:12.389
I need an assistant.

25:12.516 --> 25:16.268
Having someone I can trust
is everything.

25:18.855 --> 25:20.272
Salud .

25:27.447 --> 25:30.908
Listen, I've been giving a lot of thought
to this Clemson Galt thing.

25:32.244 --> 25:34.245
Good.

25:34.371 --> 25:35.412
Dígame.

25:37.457 --> 25:41.085
What if we were to travel upstate
and arrange an interview with him?

25:41.211 --> 25:42.962
About?

25:43.088 --> 25:45.172
A career criminal
with a record like his,

25:45.298 --> 25:48.717
he's gotta be an encyclopedia of intel
on tons of other cases.

25:48.843 --> 25:53.514
We would just need
to get Galt alone long enough

25:53.640 --> 25:56.600
to make it look like
another prisoner did the deed.

25:56.726 --> 25:58.727
Last week, an inmate is found

25:58.853 --> 26:01.855
in a prison hallway
drowned in a bucket of water.

26:01.982 --> 26:05.734
This stuff happens all day long
in places like that.

26:07.696 --> 26:10.614
An inmate is found dead
in custody, Dexter,

26:10.740 --> 26:12.700
you got inquiries and investigations.

26:12.826 --> 26:15.119
You got the bleeding hearts
comin' outta the woodwork

26:15.245 --> 26:16.870
whining about prison reform.

26:16.997 --> 26:19.790
Ha. It doesn't sound
like much of a plan.

26:23.336 --> 26:24.753
That is the plan...

26:24.879 --> 26:27.715
so that Miguel finally
includes himself out.

26:27.841 --> 26:29.717
But, um...

26:30.844 --> 26:34.430
I'm in the middle of trying
a racketeering case right now.

26:34.556 --> 26:36.098
Money laundering.

26:36.224 --> 26:40.227
The Aryans, they're masters
at moving cash around.

26:40.353 --> 26:44.815
(Laughs) I subpoena Galt
as an expert witness,

26:44.941 --> 26:47.651
Corrections transports him
down here to testify.

26:47.777 --> 26:50.487
Then Galt is within our reach, hmm?

26:50.614 --> 26:52.740
And on my turf.

26:54.367 --> 26:57.494
I'm guessing it would take a long time
to set something like that up.

26:58.997 --> 27:01.665
It would.

27:01.791 --> 27:04.501
But I've already issued the subpoena.

27:04.628 --> 27:06.670
Galt'll be here tomorrow night.

27:06.796 --> 27:11.133
Only...he's gonna be a no-show
on the witness stand the next morning.

27:12.260 --> 27:16.889
Swing by the courthouse tomorrow,
I'll walk you through all the details.

27:19.392 --> 27:22.519
Coño, say thank you, Dexter.

27:22.646 --> 27:24.813
Miguel seems to have
way more aptitude

27:24.939 --> 27:28.734
and appetite for this
than I ever imagined.

27:36.826 --> 27:38.410
(Cellphone rings)

27:38.536 --> 27:40.454
(Dexter) Just calling to check in.

27:40.580 --> 27:42.665
Just having a look-see
in Ramon Prado's car.

27:42.791 --> 27:44.667
- Deb, you really need to...
- Relax.

27:44.793 --> 27:47.127
He's scarfing down his second plate
of arroz con pollo

27:47.253 --> 27:48.671
at a restaurant up the block.

27:48.797 --> 27:51.215
He's got a wife and kids at home,
got the night off,

27:51.341 --> 27:53.092
so why is he eating alone?

27:53.218 --> 27:58.013
Well, maybe the wife's arroz con pollo
isn't pollo enough.

27:58.139 --> 28:00.182
You find anything interesting?

28:00.308 --> 28:02.559
A set of German steel filet knives,
a couple of straight razors,

28:02.686 --> 28:04.645
and, like, 12 pounds of human skin.

28:04.771 --> 28:07.106
Just be careful out there, will you?

28:07.232 --> 28:09.024
Yes, sir.

28:11.236 --> 28:15.364
Deb's got her mission.
I've got mine.

28:35.552 --> 28:37.594
Hey, I can get out
and give you a great big hug

28:37.721 --> 28:39.680
so everyone can see
what good friends we are...

28:39.806 --> 28:41.765
or you can talk to me.

28:42.892 --> 28:45.227
You know, after 12 hours
on surveillance detail,

28:45.353 --> 28:47.438
how 'bout you blow me instead?

28:47.564 --> 28:51.608
I've been given the directive to either step up
my investigation of Quinn or close it.

28:51.735 --> 28:53.569
Because you haven't found dick.

28:53.695 --> 28:57.030
If you weren't such a fuckwad, I'd almost
feel sorry for you for working for IA.

28:57.157 --> 28:58.699
Where careers go to die.

28:58.825 --> 29:01.368
You need to get next to Quinn,
be his go-to girl.

29:01.494 --> 29:03.579
You'll be wearing a wire.

29:05.540 --> 29:08.459
Are you on crack? How many times
have I told you to eat shit?

29:08.585 --> 29:11.378
What the fuck makes you think
I'm suddenly willing to play now?

29:11.504 --> 29:13.589
Because if you don't,
I'll put the word out

29:13.715 --> 29:15.758
that you've been cooperating all along.

29:15.884 --> 29:18.677
Everyone'll think you're a rat anyway.

29:22.599 --> 29:25.434
Hard to believe
even you would sink that low.

29:33.026 --> 29:35.319
- So that door right over there?
- Hmm.

29:35.445 --> 29:39.782
Check this out. That's supposed
to be kept locked, and it never is.

29:40.575 --> 29:43.494
The smokers use it
as a short cut to get outside.

29:43.620 --> 29:45.913
Short cut to a shorter life.

29:46.039 --> 29:49.458
You know, statistically, most escapes
happen out of a courthouse.

29:49.584 --> 29:51.877
The security's a little bit more lax,

29:52.003 --> 29:54.004
the defendant is wearing
a suit and a tie.

29:54.130 --> 29:56.507
It makes it easy for him
to just walk away.

29:56.633 --> 29:58.967
Easier for us to cover our tracks.

29:59.093 --> 30:00.677
That too.

30:01.805 --> 30:03.597
Señor, ¿cuánto?

30:03.723 --> 30:05.599
- No, no, por favor.
- ¿Está seguro?

30:05.725 --> 30:07.142
- Sí, señor.
- Good, good!

30:07.268 --> 30:09.269
Must be good to be you.

30:09.395 --> 30:11.021
Sometimes.

30:11.147 --> 30:12.898
Coño.

30:13.024 --> 30:14.483
Thanks for helping out.

30:14.609 --> 30:16.777
(Indistinct conversation)

30:25.245 --> 30:27.329
Real reason she's blindfolded -

30:27.455 --> 30:29.414
so she doesn't have to watch
everything she stands for

30:29.541 --> 30:31.792
get pissed on
by someone like Ellen Wolf.

30:31.918 --> 30:34.044
You know, she had this client once

30:34.170 --> 30:37.548
who threw a five-year-old
into an industrial washer for talking dirty.

30:37.674 --> 30:40.342
She got him off with six months
in a mental hospital.

30:40.468 --> 30:42.511
Diminished fucking capacity.

30:42.637 --> 30:44.054
Hey.

30:44.180 --> 30:47.850
She probably got paid more on that
than you took home in a year.

30:47.976 --> 30:51.395
And I gotta tell you, I'm very disappointed
with your boss over there.

30:51.521 --> 30:54.398
I never thought that she, of all people,
would hurt me like this

30:54.524 --> 30:56.942
and throw in with these
fucking bottom feeders.

30:57.068 --> 31:00.320
My dad used to say be careful
what you think you know about someone.

31:00.446 --> 31:02.656
You're probably wrong.

31:04.617 --> 31:06.285
Smart man.

31:07.328 --> 31:09.621
Well, sometimes.

31:09.747 --> 31:10.789
Maria!

31:12.417 --> 31:16.253
I appreciate your, um, cooperation
in the deposition.

31:17.463 --> 31:20.048
I've never had a problem
telling the truth.

31:20.174 --> 31:24.511
We've got, uh, more than enough
to get the Hines conviction set aside.

31:24.637 --> 31:28.473
And you've set the stage for your
smear campaign against a stand-up guy.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.350
Nice.

31:30.476 --> 31:34.104
You know, you ever wanna hear
the unexpurgated version of your guy,

31:34.230 --> 31:36.231
come find me, OK?

31:46.659 --> 31:48.702
(Miguel) It's like a church.

31:48.828 --> 31:50.245
Yeah.

31:51.956 --> 31:55.208
The holding cell
is through that door.

31:55.335 --> 31:58.170
Connects to a hallway,
then goes out to a parking garage.

31:58.296 --> 32:01.548
On your right,
there's gonna be an emergency exit.

32:01.674 --> 32:03.717
And that deadbolt
is gonna be taped...

32:03.843 --> 32:06.094
open.

32:06.930 --> 32:08.847
Why risk it all?

32:08.973 --> 32:11.767
Your career, reputation, freedom.

32:11.893 --> 32:14.478
You could just walk away.

32:14.604 --> 32:17.481
You didn't walk away
from Ethan Turner.

32:17.607 --> 32:19.483
Because you understand, Dexter,

32:19.609 --> 32:22.319
that we're living in...

32:22.445 --> 32:23.946
we're living in crucial times,

32:24.072 --> 32:27.449
crucial times that demand
extraordinary measures.

32:28.785 --> 32:30.160
Miguel's convinced himself

32:30.286 --> 32:33.830
he wants this kill tonight
for lofty and noble reasons.

32:33.957 --> 32:35.624
I'm not quite as high-minded.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.834
You didn't answer my question.

32:37.961 --> 32:40.212
Asshole drunk dad...

32:40.338 --> 32:44.466
maybe I'm still trying to clean up the mess
that I couldn't when I was a kid, I don't know.

32:46.302 --> 32:48.136
Come on, I'll, uh,

32:48.262 --> 32:51.098
show you where you're gonna
be hooking up with Galt.

32:57.981 --> 32:59.982
Morgan, what's the hurry?

33:00.108 --> 33:03.318
- You meeting someone?
- More like avoiding someone.

33:03.444 --> 33:06.530
Hey, this is me not telling you
I'm tailing Ramon Prado again tonight.

33:06.656 --> 33:09.366
Well, this is me not hearing
a word you're saying.

33:09.492 --> 33:13.036
I'm also unofficially and off the record
telling you to be smart and watch your ass.

33:14.497 --> 33:16.623
Excuse me, Officer.

33:16.749 --> 33:18.750
Sergeant. How can I help you?

33:18.876 --> 33:20.836
I was just, uh...
(Clears throat)

33:20.962 --> 33:24.006
...released for this legal thing.

33:24.132 --> 33:28.301
- You were arrested.
- And released. Totally victimless.

33:28.428 --> 33:33.056
Only I live, like, a million miles
away from here, and I really need a ride.

33:34.684 --> 33:35.892
How 'bout the bus?

33:36.019 --> 33:38.979
How 'bout you take me home

33:39.105 --> 33:41.982
and I think of some victimless way
of saying thank you?

33:52.035 --> 33:54.411
I'll have Dispatch call you a cab.

33:54.537 --> 33:56.538
Just like that?

33:56.664 --> 33:58.165
Just like that.

34:08.342 --> 34:10.218
(Cellphone rings)

34:16.768 --> 34:17.768
Agent Batista.

34:17.894 --> 34:20.896
Sergeant, Barbara Gianna here.

34:21.022 --> 34:24.441
So happens, uh...

34:24.567 --> 34:25.942
I'm hungry.

34:26.069 --> 34:29.696
Hungry enough to...
to see if you are too.

34:29.822 --> 34:31.948
Are you asking me out
on a date, Detective?

34:32.075 --> 34:35.827
I don't date, Sergeant. Ever.

34:35.953 --> 34:38.246
Marino's Trattoria, 7:30?

34:38.372 --> 34:41.792
Aren't you gonna ask me
if I really turned over a new leaf?

34:41.918 --> 34:45.128
It could be I'm just not
partial to redheads.

34:45.254 --> 34:47.964
I have no idea what
you're talking about, Detective.

34:48.091 --> 34:50.217
I'll see you at 7:30.

34:54.430 --> 34:58.725
Delivered fresh daily
from a little bakery down in Key Largo.

35:00.228 --> 35:01.812
Supposed to be the best in the Keys.

35:01.938 --> 35:03.355
Well, it's not.

35:03.481 --> 35:05.649
Pardon my bluntness, but...

35:05.775 --> 35:07.359
this pie is green.

35:07.485 --> 35:09.820
Means they used food coloring.

35:09.946 --> 35:11.947
Something purists frown on?

35:12.073 --> 35:16.326
Which I'd be doing right now,
except even my face hurts.

35:16.452 --> 35:18.703
The other thing they fucked up -

35:18.830 --> 35:21.832
this wasn't made
with condensed milk.

35:21.958 --> 35:24.334
No, it's fresh and organic.

35:24.460 --> 35:27.671
Only they didn't have
fresh milk in the Keys

35:27.797 --> 35:30.006
back in the day.

35:30.133 --> 35:31.133
Oh.

35:32.802 --> 35:35.011
Here comes Miss Morphine.

35:36.347 --> 35:39.099
Bringer of bad dreams
and less pain.

35:39.851 --> 35:41.643
Dexter.

35:41.769 --> 35:46.815
(Whispering) If you're as serious
about Key lime pie as I am...

35:49.944 --> 35:52.612
you can do better.

35:55.908 --> 35:59.703
Tonight's the night.
But it feels different.

35:59.829 --> 36:05.750
I won't be alone. Uncharted territory
for me, not without risk.

36:05.877 --> 36:07.836
And strangely exhilarating.

36:07.962 --> 36:10.005
(Rita) So, what do you think?

36:11.924 --> 36:13.675
Best pizza night ever.

36:14.677 --> 36:17.095
No, I meant about Syl's job offer.

36:17.221 --> 36:21.141
If real estate's something you're
interested in, I think you should go for it.

36:21.267 --> 36:23.894
And Syl's great at what she does.

36:24.020 --> 36:26.521
In a market this bad,
she's still always closing.

36:26.647 --> 36:28.857
And I could learn a lot, I just...

36:29.901 --> 36:31.776
But?

36:34.197 --> 36:36.072
Well, what if I...

36:36.199 --> 36:38.074
see a side to her that I don't like?

36:38.201 --> 36:39.910
I guess that's the risk you run

36:40.036 --> 36:43.872
when you go into business
with somebody, especially a friend.

36:44.999 --> 36:47.500
Makes things more complicated,
no doubt about it.

36:47.627 --> 36:52.005
Still...without my friend Syl,
I wouldn't have this opportunity.

36:53.049 --> 36:57.427
So I think I'm gonna take the risk
and jump in with both feet

36:57.553 --> 37:01.139
and see if this new thing calls to me.

37:05.394 --> 37:08.230
- It's getting late.
- You don't wanna stay?

37:09.315 --> 37:12.442
Miguel and I have a...
early morning run.

37:12.568 --> 37:14.945
I can sleep in longer
if I stay at my place.

37:15.071 --> 37:18.156
Don't be surprised if he's a no-show.

37:18.282 --> 37:20.242
What makes you say that?

37:20.368 --> 37:23.328
He's been a complete wreck lately.

37:23.454 --> 37:24.829
Not sleeping, terrible mood.

37:24.956 --> 37:28.124
I mean, Syl thinks something's
really bothering him.

37:28.251 --> 37:29.834
I saw him today. He seemed fine.

37:29.961 --> 37:32.420
Well, you may be his buddy,
but you're not his wife.

37:32.546 --> 37:36.841
And besides, it's not like you can hide
anything from your partner.

37:36.968 --> 37:38.969
So true.

37:39.095 --> 37:41.846
Why would you want to?

37:44.308 --> 37:47.727
Looks like Miguel's
got a bad case of nerves about tonight.

37:47.853 --> 37:49.980
He isn't sleeping
like a baby any more.

37:50.106 --> 37:53.942
(Harry) If you're gonna bail out of this,
now would be a good time.

37:55.111 --> 37:58.363
What the hell are you
dressed like that for?

37:58.489 --> 38:01.324
I figured the more the merrier.

38:01.450 --> 38:04.494
Why don't we swing by
and pick up Rita and the kids?

38:06.163 --> 38:08.665
Bring them along too.

38:10.543 --> 38:13.169
What makes you think
you can count on Miguel?

38:13.296 --> 38:15.797
He's just a little jumpy.
He's new at this.

38:15.923 --> 38:19.592
Mark my words, Dex, he'll give you up
in a heartbeat to save his own ass.

38:20.386 --> 38:23.555
This is not a guy who wants to spend
the rest of his life in a cage.

38:23.681 --> 38:27.225
Just one more thing
Miguel and I have in common.

38:27.351 --> 38:29.519
You don't know
what you're getting into.

38:29.645 --> 38:33.023
You've never had to rely
on anyone else before, Dexter.

38:33.149 --> 38:36.359
Because you taught me
loneliness is an art form.

38:36.485 --> 38:40.739
But guess what, I finally have a life

38:40.865 --> 38:43.575
with a family and now a friend...

38:43.701 --> 38:46.202
who I trust.

38:46.329 --> 38:49.497
We only see two things in people...

38:49.623 --> 38:52.584
what we wanna see
and what they wanna show us.

38:52.710 --> 38:55.003
You don't know Miguel
any more than he knows you.

38:55.129 --> 38:57.547
You aren't seriously gonna
lecture me on relationships

38:57.673 --> 39:00.508
after the debris field you left behind.

39:03.179 --> 39:05.805
No matter how close
two people are,

39:05.931 --> 39:08.183
an infinite distance separates them.

39:10.144 --> 39:12.145
Look at you and me.

39:20.613 --> 39:23.073
Mind if I get a picture with you, jefe?

39:23.199 --> 39:25.867
- You got a cam... Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

39:27.995 --> 39:30.038
(Miguel) No hayproblema. Tíralo.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.379
Gracias.

39:38.547 --> 39:40.215
Any truth you're gonna run for DA?

39:40.341 --> 39:42.926
Uh...if I do,
I'm gonna need your support.

39:43.052 --> 39:45.303
You got it, jefe.

39:50.559 --> 39:52.477
Thanks, Officer.

40:02.363 --> 40:04.364
You listen to me, pulled pork.

40:04.490 --> 40:07.325
I got no clue why the fuck
you dragged me down here

40:07.451 --> 40:09.452
in all this humidity,
but you can suck my white dick,

40:09.578 --> 40:11.955
you think I'm helping
your spic ass with shit.

40:16.001 --> 40:19.379
This all ends right here,
right now, Clemson.

40:21.382 --> 40:22.966
This makes us even.

40:32.977 --> 40:34.727
When you walk out the door,

40:34.854 --> 40:38.314
one of your Nazi pals is waiting for you
in the parking garage.

40:38.441 --> 40:40.567
From now on,

40:40.693 --> 40:42.819
all of the threats to my family,

40:42.945 --> 40:44.904
they stop, understand?

40:55.708 --> 40:58.543
I knew my Aryan brothers
would come through, ese.

41:13.851 --> 41:15.435
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

41:15.561 --> 41:17.562
Hey, have any arrangements
been made

41:17.688 --> 41:20.940
in case this guy's testimony runs a little long
and he has to stay another day?

41:21.066 --> 41:23.776
We're holding a spot for him
in protective at Miami-Dade.

41:23.903 --> 41:25.737
Good man. Appreciate it.

41:29.909 --> 41:31.201
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:31.327 --> 41:34.037
I got a witness in there, man,
that's taking a nap.

41:34.163 --> 41:36.706
I'm gonna really need him fresh for court
in a couple of hours.

41:36.832 --> 41:39.626
I gotta put a county wristband on him.
Just take a second.

41:52.097 --> 41:53.806
Clem Galt.

41:54.642 --> 41:56.684
I'm your wheel man.

41:57.770 --> 41:59.896
Welcome home.

42:00.022 --> 42:01.606
Heil Hitler.

42:01.732 --> 42:04.067
- Let's get the fuck outta here.
- Ride's this way.

42:04.193 --> 42:06.236
Have you out of the country
by lunch time.

42:06.362 --> 42:07.570
- (Alarm blares)
- (Galt) Fuck!

42:07.696 --> 42:10.615
- Shit! What's going on here?
(Dexter) I don't know. Come on.

42:15.913 --> 42:18.414
I'll get you outta here.
We just gotta get to the car.

42:18.541 --> 42:20.083
Galt had to have an accomplice.

42:20.209 --> 42:23.878
Just set up a perimeter around this building
right away. No one should get in or out.

42:24.004 --> 42:27.507
- Fuckin' spic set us up.
- This guy cannot get away!

42:27.633 --> 42:30.301
(Galt) And I'm gonna return the favor.
(Dexter) That's mighty white of you.

42:30.427 --> 42:32.053
(Groans)

42:38.561 --> 42:41.354
(Harry) Galt's right.
He's selling you out.

42:41.480 --> 42:45.483
Never underestimate the capacity
of other people to let you down.

42:45.609 --> 42:47.485
It's not the time, Dad.

42:51.824 --> 42:53.449
(Harry) There he goes.

42:53.576 --> 42:55.743
Looking out for number one.

42:55.869 --> 42:58.663
Which is what you should have done.

43:04.670 --> 43:06.671
Like the man said,

43:06.797 --> 43:08.881
nobody gets in or out.

43:14.263 --> 43:15.722
Might as well give up.

43:15.848 --> 43:17.640
No sense risking death by cop.

43:17.766 --> 43:21.060
If you keep Miguel's involvement secret,
he might let you off with a few years.

43:21.186 --> 43:22.228
Stop.

43:22.354 --> 43:24.981
Unless they find those blood slides
when they toss your apartment.

43:25.107 --> 43:26.941
- Stop!
- (Brakes screech)

43:29.028 --> 43:30.528
Hola, amigo.

43:47.796 --> 43:50.256
I'm gonna drop you off at your car.

43:50.382 --> 43:54.385
Then I'll meet you at the stash house
as soon as I can get outta here.

43:55.804 --> 43:58.097
- Wait for me, huh?
- Thanks for this.

43:58.223 --> 44:00.350
That's what friends are for.

44:01.644 --> 44:04.187
Hey, I'm gonna do a loop
around the building

44:04.313 --> 44:06.147
until you get more backup here, OK?

44:06.273 --> 44:07.899
You got it, jefe.

44:20.329 --> 44:22.372
(Man) Gimme a fucking break, Ramon.

44:22.498 --> 44:24.457
(Men arguing)

44:24.583 --> 44:25.583
Don't fucking lie to me!

44:25.709 --> 44:26.834
(Man) Aah!

44:46.689 --> 44:49.065
You can make this stop right now...

44:49.191 --> 44:50.733
if you tell me where he is.

44:50.859 --> 44:52.985
(Man) I don't know.

44:56.407 --> 44:58.700
You're making this
very hard on yourself, Felipe.

45:04.289 --> 45:05.665
- (Creak)
- (Gasps)

45:05.791 --> 45:06.749
Whoa.

45:06.875 --> 45:08.668
You scared the fuckmother out of me.

45:08.794 --> 45:11.587
You're the one that called me.
What do we got?

45:12.548 --> 45:14.090
Kidnapping, for starters.

45:14.216 --> 45:17.802
- Who's the special guest?
- That's Felipe Cepeda.

45:17.928 --> 45:20.930
He's one of Freebo's hemp suppliers.
I questioned him a couple of weeks ago.

45:21.056 --> 45:23.850
Now Ramon's got a few
questions of his own for him.

45:23.976 --> 45:27.061
Well, so far, I've only heard one -
where's Freebo?

45:27.187 --> 45:29.397
I'm just waiting for the skinning to start.

45:30.607 --> 45:33.609
Oye. Tell me where he is.

45:33.736 --> 45:35.069
I don't know!

45:35.195 --> 45:39.574
OK.

45:42.911 --> 45:43.953
(Bottle opens)

45:44.079 --> 45:46.873
Nothing like a nice cold soda pop
before a good skinning.

45:51.044 --> 45:53.004
Aah!

45:53.130 --> 45:54.672
Fuck, that's gotta hurt.

45:54.798 --> 45:56.257
- Wait, wait.
- Wait?

45:56.383 --> 45:58.217
We need to be sure he's the Skinner.

45:58.343 --> 46:00.470
(Felipe screaming)

46:01.805 --> 46:04.682
(Coughing)

46:04.808 --> 46:06.267
Felipe...

46:07.811 --> 46:09.729
you have some answers for me now?

46:13.901 --> 46:15.902
- (Felipe screaming)
- I don't get it. I don't get it.

46:16.028 --> 46:19.030
- That's not the Skinner's MO.
- Maybe he's just warming up.

46:19.156 --> 46:21.324
(Coughing)

46:25.662 --> 46:27.205
Here he goes.

46:34.087 --> 46:35.546
(Slash)

46:36.673 --> 46:37.715
Vete.

46:42.971 --> 46:44.388
He's not the Skinner.

46:58.904 --> 47:00.613
(Cellphone rings)

47:06.954 --> 47:09.038
I gotta take this. Don't go anywhere.

47:09.873 --> 47:11.207
Hello.

47:11.333 --> 47:13.292
So Ramon Prado's a sick fuck,

47:13.418 --> 47:16.003
but he's not the sick fuck
we're looking for.

47:16.964 --> 47:19.632
I'll talk to you about it over breakfast.
I gotta go.

47:19.758 --> 47:21.217
What's up?

47:22.219 --> 47:24.929
So, why are you calling us in
at midnight?

47:27.015 --> 47:28.516
We've picked up Ramon Prado.

47:28.642 --> 47:31.018
He's, uh...outside.

47:31.144 --> 47:33.896
We got a Uni watching him
to keep his mouth shut.

47:36.233 --> 47:37.441
For what?

47:38.068 --> 47:40.444
Kidnapping. False imprisonment.

47:40.571 --> 47:43.030
And torture.

47:49.371 --> 47:52.248
- Are you sure?
- We witnessed it ourselves.

47:55.669 --> 47:58.337
- My God, I...
- We can't give him a pass on this.

47:58.463 --> 47:59.922
(LaGuerta) I...

48:00.048 --> 48:01.924
(Sighs) Shit.

48:02.050 --> 48:03.926
No, we can't.

48:08.307 --> 48:10.349
Thank you for being politic at least.

48:10.475 --> 48:13.811
I woulda perp-walked him
right through here.

48:13.937 --> 48:17.356
Morgan insisted we be discreet
out of respect for his family.

48:23.113 --> 48:25.323
Were you aware
of this investigation?

48:25.449 --> 48:28.576
- Yes, I was.
- And you didn't inform me?

48:28.702 --> 48:32.246
I wanted something solid
before involving you.

48:34.374 --> 48:36.667
Thank you for that.

48:36.793 --> 48:40.212
Morgan, you handled
a tough situation the smart way.

48:40.339 --> 48:42.632
How do you wanna do this?

48:42.758 --> 48:44.800
Book him.

48:45.844 --> 48:47.887
I'll notify the family.

48:55.395 --> 48:57.104
That went well.

49:04.279 --> 49:06.364
(Lift whirring)

49:06.490 --> 49:09.408
Internal Affairs
is investigating you.

49:10.661 --> 49:12.411
- (Clunk, whir)
- What?

49:12.537 --> 49:15.289
They've been giving me
a sandpaper enema to wear a fucking wire.

49:15.415 --> 49:17.208
- This has been going on for a while.
- Yes.

49:17.334 --> 49:19.502
- And you're finally telling me.
- I'm finally telling you.

49:19.628 --> 49:22.672
Do you wanna tell me why this IA chick
is so gung ho to bring you down?

49:24.216 --> 49:28.219
Wait. Does this IA chick
go by the name of Yuki Amado?

49:28.345 --> 49:30.846
As a matter of fact, yes.

49:31.598 --> 49:34.058
- You wanna tell me what's going on?
- (Click, whir)

49:34.184 --> 49:37.561
Yeah. Yuki and I have a...history.

49:37.688 --> 49:40.856
It's a totally personal vendetta on her part.

49:42.401 --> 49:44.151
- I'll handle it.
- (Bell dings)

49:44.277 --> 49:46.070
I appreciate the heads-up, though.

49:51.743 --> 49:53.285
(Groans)

50:00.335 --> 50:02.753
Even in prison, I'm sure
you heard about the big slump

50:02.879 --> 50:04.630
in the real-estate market.

50:08.051 --> 50:09.719
What the fuck?

50:11.888 --> 50:13.472
(Grunts)

50:13.598 --> 50:14.598
Shit!

50:14.725 --> 50:18.352
There is an upside
to the downturn, though.

50:18.478 --> 50:20.563
Plenty of empty houses.

50:24.109 --> 50:26.652
Do you recognize this one?

50:26.778 --> 50:29.155
It's where you killed Jenna Kendrick.

50:29.281 --> 50:31.741
I got no idea what the hell
you're talking about.

50:32.701 --> 50:35.411
I'm talking about hammer time, Clemson.

50:37.247 --> 50:38.748
No.

50:38.874 --> 50:41.542
You got me mixed up
with somebody else.

50:41.668 --> 50:44.045
(Gagging)

50:51.553 --> 50:54.764
You can't imagine how much
I've been looking forward to this.

50:57.059 --> 50:59.894
And none of it
would be happening

51:00.020 --> 51:04.065
if it weren't for my...friend...

51:04.191 --> 51:07.068
Miguel Prado. You remember him?

51:07.194 --> 51:09.070
He really came through tonight.

51:09.196 --> 51:11.906
In a big way.

51:15.285 --> 51:17.953
I never had a partner before.

51:18.080 --> 51:21.957
I had my doubts initially,
but everything worked out.

51:23.126 --> 51:25.586
But this part, the ritual...

51:26.421 --> 51:29.173
the connection and certainty...

51:29.299 --> 51:32.510
followed by that pristine silence...

51:34.346 --> 51:36.597
is for me.

51:40.435 --> 51:42.478
- And me alone.
- (Muffled scream)

51:58.954 --> 52:00.788
Miguel will be disappointed.

52:02.249 --> 52:05.292
I'll explain to him I took Galt
straight to the cemetery

52:05.418 --> 52:08.629
and dumped him in a grave
after the screw-up at the courthouse.

52:09.673 --> 52:12.091
Truth is, I'm not ready
to share this part of me

52:12.217 --> 52:14.343
with anyone else just yet.

52:16.304 --> 52:18.764
Present company excepted.

52:20.308 --> 52:22.726
I'm not sure I ever will be ready.

52:28.608 --> 52:30.568
Even if Miguel senses my deception,

52:30.694 --> 52:33.696
he'll forgive me this one small untruth.

52:34.823 --> 52:36.365
Dexter.

52:41.329 --> 52:43.330
How can I be so sure?

52:48.378 --> 52:52.089
Because after tonight,
I can honestly say

52:52.215 --> 52:55.050
I know who Miguel Prado really is...

52:56.428 --> 52:58.762
my first good friend.

53:00.599 --> 53:03.601
And those are in short supply
these days.
