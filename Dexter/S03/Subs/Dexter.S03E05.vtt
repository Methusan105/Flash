WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:03.424
Previously on Dexter...

00:03.550 --> 00:04.508
I'm pregnant.

00:04.634 --> 00:06.719
(Dexter) I just think I'm gonna be a lousy
father. I don't wanna screw the kid up.

00:06.845 --> 00:09.680
(Debra) Who are we kidding?
You're gonna be a great father.

00:09.806 --> 00:11.515
- What do you have on Freebo, Maria?
- Ramon.

00:11.641 --> 00:15.060
- We're working on some new angles.
- Which means you've got shit.

00:15.186 --> 00:17.855
(Miguel) He's obsessed.
He's drinking more than usual.

00:17.981 --> 00:22.026
He's not going to stop looking for Oscar's
killer until it takes him all the way down.

00:22.152 --> 00:24.194
I only have one person
I can trust any more.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.404
Yourself.

00:25.530 --> 00:26.613
I was thinking of you.

00:27.115 --> 00:29.616
- What you need?
- I need Freebo.

00:29.743 --> 00:31.785
Come on man, what,
you Google him or something?

00:31.911 --> 00:35.372
Why wouldn't they want to support
a colleague during his shining moment?

00:35.498 --> 00:37.958
You're like the foulest person I've ever met.

00:39.335 --> 00:41.503
I'm gonna do you a favor.
Call this guy.

00:41.629 --> 00:43.422
Tell him you wanna cash in
one of my coupons.

00:43.548 --> 00:45.924
He's an informant
from my days in Narcotics.

00:46.051 --> 00:49.303
You, uh, you looking for
anything special tonight?

00:49.429 --> 00:51.430
Might be more than an hour.

00:54.976 --> 00:57.603
Take a pass, Sergeant.

00:57.729 --> 00:59.688
I hate anyone
who disgraces the badge.

01:00.690 --> 01:01.607
Are we good?

01:01.733 --> 01:04.526
You keep your dick in your pants
and then we're good.

01:04.652 --> 01:07.404
Rita, we're connected. I feel you.

01:07.530 --> 01:08.989
You're what makes me real.

01:09.908 --> 01:11.658
And that's how I know I wanna marry you.

01:11.785 --> 01:15.037
Yes! Yes, we will marry you.

03:13.364 --> 03:15.908
(Dexter) There are many ways
to stop the heart.

03:16.034 --> 03:17.618
Electric shock.

03:17.744 --> 03:18.952
Bad diet.

03:19.078 --> 03:20.495
Sever the aorta -

03:20.622 --> 03:22.331
my personal favorite.

03:22.457 --> 03:26.543
But to start one beating, this is a first.

03:26.669 --> 03:29.213
(Woman) There. That's the heart.

03:29.339 --> 03:32.216
Oh, Dex, that's our baby.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.302
Our baby. It's incredible.

03:35.428 --> 03:38.805
Rita, gushing with the runaway emotion

03:38.932 --> 03:42.017
any parent would feel
seeing their unborn child for the first time.

03:42.936 --> 03:45.145
Any parent except me.

03:45.271 --> 03:48.023
I'd say you're at nine to ten weeks.

03:48.149 --> 03:50.692
All I feel is her hand clenching mine.

03:52.862 --> 03:55.030
She's stronger than she looks.

03:55.907 --> 03:58.575
Can we get a picture to show the kids?

03:59.994 --> 04:02.746
I can no longer deny
that I'm going to be a father.

04:02.872 --> 04:05.290
Up until now,
I've been avoiding its inevitability.

04:05.416 --> 04:08.919
It's like a lamp in a room
that's always been there.

04:09.045 --> 04:11.922
And now it's suddenly turned on.

04:12.048 --> 04:15.425
Don't worry.
Everything looks perfectly normal.

04:21.015 --> 04:22.182
Yes.

04:24.102 --> 04:25.894
Front or back pocket?

04:27.480 --> 04:29.731
- You lost me.
- The picture of the baby.

04:29.857 --> 04:31.233
Front or back pocket?

04:31.359 --> 04:35.153
- How'd you know I'd have it with me?
- You're a first-time dad, aren't you?

04:35.280 --> 04:37.531
Ah!

04:38.616 --> 04:40.450
Oh, this is amazing!

04:41.536 --> 04:44.037
This is a human life.

04:44.163 --> 04:46.999
It is...overwhelming.

04:47.125 --> 04:49.960
This picture right here makes it real.

04:50.962 --> 04:53.171
Your life is gonna change forever, man.

04:53.298 --> 04:54.381
(Chuckles)

04:56.551 --> 04:58.677
Hey! We're playing here!

04:58.803 --> 05:00.721
You could kill somebody!

05:03.558 --> 05:05.225
Sorry.

05:05.351 --> 05:07.936
I got half my mind
still in the office, you know?

05:09.480 --> 05:11.565
Oh, there's your ball.

05:12.483 --> 05:14.776
So I got this case, you know?

05:14.902 --> 05:18.572
South Beach guy
kills his wife on a cruise ship.

05:18.698 --> 05:22.701
And I got no jurisdiction because
she goes missing in international waters.

05:22.827 --> 05:24.536
My only hope right now is the Feds.

05:24.662 --> 05:27.039
- How do you know he's guilty?
- Oh, he's guilty.

05:29.625 --> 05:33.045
Five years ago, he kills his first wife.
Drug overdose.

05:33.171 --> 05:35.255
His pills. No alibi.

05:35.381 --> 05:40.010
Then he uses her money to hire this legal
dream team to confuse the jury and...

05:40.136 --> 05:41.678
They had to let him go.

05:41.804 --> 05:44.014
Dexter, my hands are tied by the law,

05:44.140 --> 05:46.391
and the defense attorneys
get to wipe their asses with it.

05:46.517 --> 05:48.727
And everything that I believe in
is compromised.

05:50.313 --> 05:52.147
That's you.

05:52.273 --> 05:54.649
(Dexter) It seems Miguel and I
understand each other

05:54.776 --> 05:56.902
better than either one of us knows.

05:57.028 --> 06:00.238
I could do us both a favor
and look into this wife killer.

06:00.365 --> 06:02.991
When it comes to my brand of justice,

06:03.117 --> 06:05.577
I don't have to compromise.

06:05.703 --> 06:08.205
Ooh.

06:09.082 --> 06:10.916
Sliced it.

06:11.042 --> 06:12.918
Yeah.

06:14.295 --> 06:16.755
(Rita) Thank you again for inviting us.

06:16.881 --> 06:19.674
That massage was amazing.

06:19.801 --> 06:21.843
We spend enough money
to be members here.

06:21.969 --> 06:23.762
At least now I have somebody
to go to the spa with.

06:23.888 --> 06:27.140
All of that stuff,
that's not for men, right, Dex?

06:27.266 --> 06:31.269
Lying naked on a table, helpless,
no thanks.

06:31.396 --> 06:35.941
So, Rita, why don't you tell Dexter
my great idea?

06:36.067 --> 06:37.442
Great idea?

06:37.568 --> 06:41.905
Well, Syl has offered to list
my house with her agency

06:42.031 --> 06:44.950
so we can buy something
bigger together.

06:45.076 --> 06:48.745
You're just throwing money away
on that apartment.

06:48.871 --> 06:51.540
And that way you can move in sooner.

06:51.666 --> 06:54.501
I was actually thinking
I might keep my place.

06:55.837 --> 06:57.462
You were?

06:57.588 --> 06:59.798
Well, I could always sublet it.

07:01.926 --> 07:03.927
At some point we're gonna need
a bigger home.

07:04.053 --> 07:07.389
You definitely need something
that you can grow into.

07:07.515 --> 07:12.727
This is how Custer must have felt,
surrounded on all sides, doomed.

07:12.854 --> 07:16.648
So why don't we talk about all this
after we eat?

07:20.653 --> 07:22.112
Oh, the line's thinning.

07:22.238 --> 07:26.199
Come on, Rita.
You have got to try these crÃªpes.

07:28.786 --> 07:32.247
(Syl) It's going to be OK. Trust me.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.126
I'm so sorry, man.

07:36.252 --> 07:39.546
Syl, she gets these ideas in her head,
and it's like you can't stop her.

07:39.672 --> 07:42.549
I guess I always knew at some point
I'd have to give up my place.

07:42.675 --> 07:45.677
I just didn't think it'd be so soon.

07:47.138 --> 07:50.515
Every man needs his privacy.
Some more than others.

07:50.641 --> 07:53.477
But that's why God created golf.

07:53.603 --> 07:56.146
(Chuckles)

07:59.358 --> 08:02.068
How many times have I walked
down this sidewalk?

08:02.195 --> 08:04.237
Sun in my face.

08:04.363 --> 08:06.823
Cool ocean breeze on my skin.

08:06.949 --> 08:09.367
Taken a dip in the pool to relax,

08:09.494 --> 08:12.913
appreciating the wisdom
of those three little words -

08:13.039 --> 08:14.873
no children allowed.

08:16.542 --> 08:19.002
Are those times gone forever?

08:23.049 --> 08:26.051
Before I even think about
following up on Miguel's lead,

08:26.177 --> 08:29.596
I need to make sure
Ethan Turner meets my code.

08:38.189 --> 08:41.608
How can Rita expect me
to just pick up and move?

08:41.734 --> 08:43.860
This is my home.

08:46.072 --> 08:47.656
My sanctuary.

08:57.416 --> 08:59.876
Careful.

09:00.002 --> 09:01.294
Leave it.

09:05.341 --> 09:06.925
Not really Rita's style.

09:07.051 --> 09:08.802
But it's mine.

09:08.928 --> 09:13.098
Not any more, son.
In marriage, everything's 50-50.

09:13.849 --> 09:17.394
What's yours...is Rita's.

09:27.154 --> 09:30.865
Better hope she doesn't insist
on a place with central air.

09:48.259 --> 09:52.178
Rita and Syl may be busy planning my life
and where I'll live.

09:52.305 --> 09:55.932
But there are some things
I still control.

09:59.395 --> 10:03.023
Right on time. You're getting pretty good
at this secret meeting stuff.

10:03.149 --> 10:06.985
Yeah, well, we've done it enough.
With bumpkus to show for it.

10:08.154 --> 10:11.072
It's "bupkus".
Not "bumpkus". It's Yiddish.

10:11.198 --> 10:12.616
No, it's not.

10:12.742 --> 10:15.493
- You wanna bet?
- How much?

10:15.620 --> 10:17.329
Make it a million.

10:17.455 --> 10:19.497
I'll take a check.

10:19.624 --> 10:21.458
(Chuckles)

10:21.584 --> 10:23.418
Where's your guy?

10:23.544 --> 10:25.754
In the alley behind you.

10:29.091 --> 10:30.425
(Debra) Wonderful.

10:30.551 --> 10:32.344
I love the smell of ass in the morning.

10:32.470 --> 10:35.013
Hey, you're the one that's been
all over mine for leads.

10:35.139 --> 10:36.973
Don't be hating where I find them.

10:37.099 --> 10:38.600
I know, I know.

10:41.896 --> 10:44.648
Well, you better split before we get made.

10:45.650 --> 10:47.567
Well, that's cute.

10:47.693 --> 10:50.362
- What?
- You. Trying to protect me like that.

10:50.488 --> 10:51.905
It's cute.

10:52.031 --> 10:54.741
I'm trying to protect my investigation.

10:54.867 --> 10:56.409
Uh-huh.

10:57.495 --> 10:59.162
And fuck you.

11:07.004 --> 11:09.839
- What the hell?
- He wasn't like this earlier.

11:09.965 --> 11:13.677
I'm trying to find whoever's skinning people,
not to stage an intervention.

11:13.803 --> 11:16.012
You think your murders
are somehow connected to Freebo?

11:16.138 --> 11:19.474
He used to score from Freebo.
It's worth a shot, right?

11:25.189 --> 11:26.856
Excuse me.

11:28.859 --> 11:31.111
Anyone in there?

11:31.237 --> 11:33.113
Anyone fucking in there at all?

11:33.239 --> 11:36.449
I'll bet you're real good with kids too.

11:40.538 --> 11:42.664
Hey, Tilly.

11:43.457 --> 11:45.875
Hey, I got that H for you, man.

11:47.712 --> 11:49.254
- Where?
- It's right here.

11:49.380 --> 11:53.133
But listen, I need you to think
real hard for me first, Tilly.

11:53.259 --> 11:55.468
Now, when was the last time
you saw Freebo?

11:58.514 --> 11:59.931
Fucker's gone, man.

12:01.475 --> 12:03.685
Wendell said he's not coming back.

12:06.188 --> 12:07.605
Who the fuck is Wendell?

12:07.732 --> 12:11.818
You wanna see Freebo,
you gotta go through Wendell.

12:14.822 --> 12:16.072
(Camera shutter snapping)

12:16.198 --> 12:20.660
(Man on radio) Sheriff 2-1 ,
this is dispatch. Wagon is on its way.

12:21.495 --> 12:23.413
Metro Homicide.

12:25.583 --> 12:27.292
What are we doing at a sheriff's
crime scene anyway?

12:27.418 --> 12:29.794
- Sheriff, you're blocking my light.
- Whoa, Jesus.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.463
- Excuse me.
- Sheriffs are responding

12:31.589 --> 12:35.049
to a bulletin I issued regarding
any victims with missing skin.

12:35.176 --> 12:36.259
Excuse me.

12:38.763 --> 12:40.346
Same MO as our torture murder?

12:40.473 --> 12:43.933
Remember, you two are just here
to observe. This is the sheriff's turf.

12:44.059 --> 12:47.854
They're gonna investigate the scene,
see what they can come up with.

12:47.980 --> 12:49.814
What's up with him?

12:49.940 --> 12:53.610
He doesn't joke around any more.
He dresses better. He's polite.

12:53.736 --> 12:56.279
Maybe someone pointed out
the error in his ways.

12:56.405 --> 12:58.323
- Who called this in?
- Neighbors.

13:04.121 --> 13:06.790
(LaGuerta) I just got off the phone
with the sheriff's department.

13:06.916 --> 13:09.667
They've confirmed their skinning victim
is related to ours.

13:09.794 --> 13:13.463
That gives us three victims. They're sending
someone over to look at our case files,

13:13.589 --> 13:16.132
and we'll be establishing
a joint investigation.

13:16.258 --> 13:20.345
- This is our investigation, Lieutenant.
- You can't expect us to give over our files.

13:20.471 --> 13:23.932
No one is giving over anything.
It's a matter of professional courtesy.

13:24.058 --> 13:25.683
We're still in charge.

13:25.810 --> 13:29.896
Now, I've had the sheriff's lab send over
all forensics. I want both your input.

13:30.022 --> 13:33.233
- My slate's clear.
- I'll talk with the medical examiner.

13:33.359 --> 13:35.693
Another four-hour erection?

13:35.820 --> 13:36.986
(Laughs)

13:38.072 --> 13:39.906
(Clears throat) Anything else?

13:40.032 --> 13:43.868
I've got Unis bringing in a 15-year-old kid
named Wendell Owens.

13:43.994 --> 13:46.746
He was Freebo's doorman, which means
he might be able to connect the dots

13:46.872 --> 13:49.541
between his boss and why people
who knew him keep winding up dead.

13:49.667 --> 13:51.793
I may be one of those dots.

13:51.919 --> 13:55.004
He's a minor.
Get consent from a parent to question him.

13:55.130 --> 13:57.215
I'll make sure everything's
done by the book.

13:57.341 --> 13:59.759
All right, I want updates on the hour.

14:01.428 --> 14:03.930
- Good work, partner.
- Yeah, right.

14:13.899 --> 14:15.650
Wendell.

14:17.486 --> 14:20.572
I doubt this boy would recognize me
from the day I met his dead boss.

14:20.698 --> 14:23.533
- (Cellphone vibrates)
- But why take the chance?

14:23.659 --> 14:24.742
Dexter Morgan.

14:24.869 --> 14:26.119
Hey, Dex.

14:26.245 --> 14:29.455
Listen, I'm gonna have to cancel our lunch.

14:29.582 --> 14:32.584
- Everything all right?
- Rough morning, man.

14:32.710 --> 14:37.130
Feds informed me that they're not gonna
move forward on this cruise ship case.

14:37.256 --> 14:38.673
Lack of evidence.

14:38.799 --> 14:42.260
Got a witness puts this son of a bitch
on the deck with his wife

14:42.386 --> 14:47.223
just before she went missing,
and he's still gonna walk. Again!

14:47.349 --> 14:50.518
Did I mention he left his first wife's
teenage daughters penniless?

14:50.644 --> 14:52.020
(Dexter) No need.

14:52.146 --> 14:54.272
A whole family destroyed.

14:54.398 --> 14:56.274
We could meet later if you want.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.027
No, no, I'm gonna be in court, man.
How 'bout tomorrow?

14:59.153 --> 15:00.820
I may have plans. I'll let you know.

15:00.946 --> 15:03.406
(Dexter) There's due diligence to be done.

15:10.414 --> 15:12.707
How long is this gonna take?

15:12.833 --> 15:16.377
The sooner you tell me where we can find
your mom, the sooner you're outta here.

15:19.715 --> 15:22.425
She wasn't at your house.
We can't reach her by phone.

15:22.551 --> 15:24.344
Does she have a job?

15:24.470 --> 15:27.597
She does what she has to do.
Same as me.

15:37.232 --> 15:39.943
You know, I was about your age
when my mom died.

15:40.069 --> 15:43.446
Suddenly, my father's
raising two teenagers by himself,

15:43.572 --> 15:47.075
so I get how hard it is
for a single parent to always be there.

15:47.201 --> 15:49.702
Yeah, I bet you had it real bad.

15:51.789 --> 15:54.207
No, I didn't.

15:54.333 --> 15:58.169
My dad worked really hard to get me
and my brother the things he didn't have.

15:58.295 --> 16:00.797
So I got why he wasn't always home.

16:00.923 --> 16:04.968
But after a while, I even stopped
looking for him at my softball games.

16:06.470 --> 16:08.596
Didn't mean he didn't love me,

16:08.722 --> 16:11.808
didn't mean it didn't hurt.

16:11.934 --> 16:14.018
You played softball for real?

16:14.144 --> 16:16.396
(Scoffs) First base.

16:17.648 --> 16:19.148
But you don't look gay.

16:22.653 --> 16:23.695
(Chuckles)

16:26.615 --> 16:27.907
You hungry?

16:28.033 --> 16:30.284
Yeah, but not for any
of that vending machine shit.

16:30.411 --> 16:35.790
Well, I'll tell you what, if you're brave
enough, there's a roach coach outside.

16:35.916 --> 16:37.000
I'm buying.

16:39.837 --> 16:45.341
OK, I'll take some burgers, fries
and onion rings.

16:47.052 --> 16:48.094
Deal.

16:49.263 --> 16:52.015
Partner, would you keep an eye
on our guest?

17:09.324 --> 17:11.451
- Getting anywhere with the kid?
- Sort of.

17:11.577 --> 17:13.953
- You and Rita set a date yet?
- Not yet.

17:14.079 --> 17:17.415
- Well, are you gonna move in with her first?
- Where's this going?

17:17.541 --> 17:20.460
I need to know, so I can break the lease
on my place and move into yours.

17:20.586 --> 17:23.755
What makes everybody think
I'm just gonna give up my apartment?

17:23.881 --> 17:25.923
Maybe cause you're getting married.

17:26.050 --> 17:28.593
Like there's room for Rita
and the kids at your place.

17:28.719 --> 17:32.096
No offence, but you're the last person
who needs a fuck pad.

17:35.684 --> 17:37.769
Dexter. Officer Morgan.

17:37.895 --> 17:40.521
Can you tell me
where I might find Lieutenant LaGuerta?

17:42.858 --> 17:44.067
Thank you so much.

17:44.610 --> 17:47.361
Guess we know who the sheriff's
department sent to look into our files.

17:47.488 --> 17:49.822
Big fucking mistake.
That guy's wound way too tight.

17:49.948 --> 17:52.158
And coming from me,
that's saying something.

17:52.284 --> 17:54.368
You gonna take the fridge?

17:57.164 --> 18:00.124
- Thank you.
- They keep getting younger, huh?

18:00.250 --> 18:02.210
- Who'd this one kill?
- The boy's not a suspect.

18:02.336 --> 18:05.254
We think he was working for Freebo.

18:05.380 --> 18:09.842
I have to say, I'm surprised the sheriff's
department chose you as their liaison.

18:09.968 --> 18:12.470
I'm not here to make friends.
I'm here to do my job.

18:12.596 --> 18:13.846
(Scoffs)

18:15.724 --> 18:19.977
I've known you your entire adult life, Ramon,
so let's cut the bullshit.

18:20.104 --> 18:21.646
You're using this case

18:21.772 --> 18:25.108
to insert yourself into Miami Metro's
investigation of your brother's death.

18:25.234 --> 18:29.445
If our victim can help track down
my brother's killer in the process,

18:29.571 --> 18:31.239
so be it.

18:31.365 --> 18:34.575
As one lieutenant to another,
you know I could go over your head

18:34.701 --> 18:36.786
and get you pulled off this assignment.

18:37.913 --> 18:39.705
But I'm not gonna do that.

18:39.832 --> 18:43.584
I know you and Oscar were close
and he meant a great deal to me as well.

18:45.045 --> 18:48.631
So you will have
this department's full cooperation

18:48.757 --> 18:50.383
to a point.

18:50.509 --> 18:54.470
If it turns out that these cases
are not connected, the cooperation ends.

18:54.596 --> 18:55.638
Â¿Entiendes?

18:57.516 --> 18:58.683
Claro.

19:05.232 --> 19:09.986
I need to thank Miguel for introducing me
to a new hobby.

19:10.112 --> 19:11.779
And for supporting an old one.

19:18.328 --> 19:20.454
After the first wife's money ran out,

19:20.581 --> 19:24.709
Ethan didn't take long to find the next
wealthy woman to woo, marry,

19:24.835 --> 19:27.378
and throw overboard.

19:27.504 --> 19:30.882
Maybe I can return the favor
on that last part.

19:32.968 --> 19:35.178
Have both tanks delivered to the ship.

19:35.304 --> 19:39.682
- I'll need a dive skin too.
- You got it.

19:40.350 --> 19:42.727
Heading out to sea?

19:42.853 --> 19:45.396
Caribbean cruise.
Leaving tomorrow.

19:45.522 --> 19:47.773
Do you know any good
dive schools around here?

19:49.109 --> 19:52.236
Yeah. But they all require hours
for certification.

19:52.362 --> 19:55.281
If I were you, I'd cut a few corners,
head over to Bimini.

19:55.407 --> 19:57.700
They'll have you under the water
in less than a day.

19:57.826 --> 20:01.329
Bimini. That's close.
I could be there and back in my boat.

20:01.455 --> 20:04.874
The water's beautiful there.
It's my first port of call.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.338
Maybe I could take the wife, get her off
my back for never doing anything with her.

20:12.049 --> 20:14.008
You'll have more fun if you don't.

20:20.349 --> 20:22.683
I'm sure I will.

20:23.393 --> 20:24.644
There you are.

20:24.770 --> 20:27.980
Good news. Wendell's mother
finally answered her phone.

20:28.106 --> 20:32.193
- Patrol's bringing her upstairs now.
- Yes. Thank the baby fucking Jesus.

20:32.319 --> 20:34.654
You do know I'm Catholic, right?

20:34.780 --> 20:37.281
I'm sorry, but I've had that kid
at my desk all afternoon.

20:37.407 --> 20:39.450
Hey, you ever hear the word
"bumpkus"?

20:39.576 --> 20:40.952
I think it's "bupkus".

20:41.078 --> 20:42.995
- Shit.
- Yeah, hold on now.

20:43.121 --> 20:47.375
There's this cold case
I'm looking at, a dead john.

20:47.501 --> 20:53.005
Now, when you were working vice, did you
bust the same places over and over again?

20:53.131 --> 20:55.132
Um, not really.

20:55.259 --> 20:58.594
Most guys are regulars,
so word gets out quick if a place is hot.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.346
So we'd move the decoys around.

21:00.472 --> 21:05.226
But if you really want to know about
paying for sex, you should talk to Masuka.

21:05.352 --> 21:07.144
Hey, Vince, hold up.

21:07.271 --> 21:12.233
Did you get a chance to look at the sheriff's
department forensics regarding their vic?

21:12.359 --> 21:15.778
I fucking would, if they'd fucking send them.
I've called four fucking times.

21:15.904 --> 21:18.489
Man! Somebody needs a hug.

21:18.615 --> 21:20.783
I'd offer, but I don't know what I'd catch.

21:22.452 --> 21:23.828
Can I go now?

21:23.954 --> 21:26.455
You know, I can take inappropriate Masuka.

21:26.581 --> 21:29.834
I can take porn-loving Masuka.
I can even take flatulent Masuka.

21:29.960 --> 21:33.087
But this dress-shoe-wearing,
"please and thank you" zombie Masuka

21:33.213 --> 21:34.547
is fucking creeping me out.

21:34.673 --> 21:36.507
What's going on?

21:36.633 --> 21:39.677
Maybe I'm realizing no one
around here is my friend.

21:39.803 --> 21:43.222
The only time you people even acknowledge
me is when you want something.

21:43.348 --> 21:46.726
That's not so.
We put you on our bowling team.

21:46.852 --> 21:50.313
Only to keep everyone's handicap higher
to sandbag the other teams.

21:51.481 --> 21:54.984
- OK, that's true, but...
- Not one person read my paper.

21:55.110 --> 21:58.738
Not one fucking person showed up
at the conference I spoke at.

21:58.864 --> 22:01.282
This is about your stupid paper?

22:03.035 --> 22:04.660
You guys just don't get it.

22:08.498 --> 22:10.416
You hurt my feelings.

22:25.515 --> 22:27.433
What the fuck?

22:28.852 --> 22:30.561
Where's the kid?

22:30.687 --> 22:35.024
The mother wouldn't give consent.
I had to cut him loose.

22:35.150 --> 22:37.568
Did you explain to her
how important it was that we talk to him?

22:37.694 --> 22:39.862
The moment I brought up Freebo's name,
she clammed up.

22:39.988 --> 22:43.783
Word is the last person who talked to
the cops about Freebo wound up dead.

22:43.909 --> 22:46.452
I spent all day getting through to that kid.

22:46.578 --> 22:49.789
He would have talked, or he would have
convinced his mother to let him talk.

22:49.915 --> 22:54.168
- She was never gonna cooperate.
- You coulda waited until I got back.

22:54.294 --> 22:56.921
Look, this is no reflection
on the work you did here.

22:57.047 --> 23:00.716
No, it's a reflection on how little
you think of me and my work.

23:00.842 --> 23:03.511
You think I cut this kid loose
to make you look bad?

23:05.555 --> 23:07.765
I'm not sure any more.

23:07.891 --> 23:09.558
Partner.

23:17.818 --> 23:21.404
Hey, baby. You want a date?

23:22.989 --> 23:25.324
Hey, sugar. What you look...

23:32.874 --> 23:35.709
You have got to be kidding me.

23:35.836 --> 23:38.337
I'm not here for that, honest.

23:39.423 --> 23:41.590
Your... You know, your...

23:44.177 --> 23:46.595
- You're blushing.
- I'm not.

23:46.721 --> 23:49.432
So what, uh, what are you doing
down here, Sergeant?

23:49.558 --> 23:51.934
Cause I gotta get back to work.

23:52.060 --> 23:54.478
I came here because I...

23:54.604 --> 23:56.981
I wanted to know if...

23:57.107 --> 24:00.776
if you'd like to grab
something to eat sometime.

24:01.611 --> 24:03.654
You know, to talk.

24:03.780 --> 24:05.614
And to eat.

24:09.369 --> 24:11.078
I'm not interested.

24:11.204 --> 24:13.664
I rarely date cops.

24:13.790 --> 24:16.041
"Rarely," does that mean "never"?

24:18.044 --> 24:20.921
If I meant "never",
I would have said "never".

24:26.803 --> 24:29.930
(Rita) Dex, is that you?
I'm in the kitchen.

24:30.056 --> 24:34.643
- What smells so good?
- It's a surprise.

24:37.772 --> 24:41.734
Look. Brochures of houses.

24:43.987 --> 24:47.531
I know it's fast. But Syl and I spent
the whole day doing drive-bys,

24:47.657 --> 24:50.034
and these are the ones
I fell in love with.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.619
All of them?

24:51.745 --> 24:55.456
Well, they're in great school districts,
big yards, plenty of bedrooms,

24:55.582 --> 24:56.957
central air.

24:57.542 --> 25:00.252
I thought we could go through these
after dinner and have Syl

25:00.378 --> 25:02.296
schedule some showings for tomorrow.

25:03.423 --> 25:05.049
I understand that, as man and wife,

25:05.175 --> 25:08.052
Rita and I will have to live
under the same roof.

25:08.178 --> 25:11.055
So why is it the only word
echoing in my head is...

25:11.181 --> 25:13.015
No.

25:15.602 --> 25:17.686
No?

25:18.647 --> 25:20.397
Um...

25:20.524 --> 25:23.901
OK, I guess we don't
have to look at all of them.

25:24.027 --> 25:25.236
No.

25:28.031 --> 25:31.033
"No" doesn't really work
in a relationship, Dexter.

25:31.159 --> 25:34.078
"Can we talk about it?"
is a little more productive.

25:34.204 --> 25:37.915
I'm sorry,
but I don't want to look at houses.

25:38.041 --> 25:40.042
Not now anyway.

25:44.714 --> 25:46.757
Fine, that's all you had to say.

25:48.051 --> 25:53.138
If Syl and I go out to look tomorrow in the
morning, can you watch Astor and Cody?

25:54.057 --> 25:55.975
No, I'm going fishing tomorrow.

25:57.435 --> 25:59.728
I'm gonna be gone all day.

25:59.854 --> 26:02.106
And you were gonna tell me this when?

26:02.232 --> 26:04.775
Rita, this is the first
I'm hearing about house hunting.

26:04.901 --> 26:08.404
I can't just drop everything at the last minute
because you want me to.

26:10.490 --> 26:12.283
Dinner will be ready in five minutes.

26:12.409 --> 26:13.993
It's a roast.

26:14.119 --> 26:15.744
Your favorite.

26:21.960 --> 26:24.169
I double-checked
Ethan's ship itinerary.

26:24.296 --> 26:26.255
He's in Bimini today only.

26:26.381 --> 26:29.466
Gives me one shot
to head him off at the pass.

26:29.593 --> 26:33.429
Sorry, Rita, but right now I need this
more than a big yard and a two-car garage.

26:33.555 --> 26:35.472
(Miguel) Hey!

26:36.600 --> 26:38.767
Ahoy.

26:39.853 --> 26:41.437
Let me guess - Syl?

26:41.563 --> 26:44.815
She might have mentioned
that Rita and she were going house hunting

26:44.941 --> 26:49.445
because a certain gilipollas
decided that he'd rather go fishing.

26:49.571 --> 26:52.865
- Gilipollas?
- You don't wanna know.

26:52.991 --> 26:56.285
So this is the boat you keep talking about,
huh? Wow, she's a beauty.

26:56.411 --> 26:59.705
- You gonna take me out on her sometime?
- Sure thing.

27:01.875 --> 27:03.500
So what brings you out here?

27:03.627 --> 27:06.045
Thought maybe we could grab some food
before you go out.

27:06.171 --> 27:08.422
Kind of like a rain check for yesterday.

27:08.548 --> 27:11.467
Ah, can't leave the boat.
Everything's onboard.

27:11.593 --> 27:13.135
OlvÃ­date. OK.

27:14.220 --> 27:17.514
Don't worry about it.
So where are they biting?

27:17.641 --> 27:21.268
Um, heading up north, Mercy Reef.
Always had good luck there.

27:21.394 --> 27:27.358
I got half a mind to postpone the
arraignment that I have and just go with you.

27:27.484 --> 27:28.984
Please don't.

27:32.489 --> 27:34.615
Nah. I gotta be in court.

27:34.741 --> 27:36.659
Ah!

27:38.119 --> 27:41.872
I'm gonna try to put out some fire
that your lieutenant started.

27:45.502 --> 27:48.587
But I'm glad I caught you, you know?

27:48.713 --> 27:52.591
Hey, how 'bout whatever you catch,
we put on the grill tonight?

27:52.717 --> 27:54.385
Wish me luck.

28:09.150 --> 28:11.110
Thanks for coming in early.

28:11.236 --> 28:15.406
Lieutenant Prado wanted to get us
all up to speed on the Skinner case.

28:15.532 --> 28:19.410
Thank you.
This is our vic's boyfriend.

28:19.536 --> 28:21.954
Now, no one's seen him
since the night in question.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.498
We could use your help
tracking him down.

28:24.624 --> 28:26.583
Soderquist, Ramos, you're on it.

28:26.710 --> 28:30.045
I was also hoping I could speak with
a couple of your previous witnesses.

28:30.714 --> 28:33.215
"Speak with" as in
we didn't do it right the first time?

28:33.925 --> 28:36.427
Cases evolve.
Witnesses change their story.

28:36.553 --> 28:39.888
Junior personnel, they make mistakes.
No disrespect.

28:40.014 --> 28:41.348
Actually, it's a lot of disrespect.

28:41.474 --> 28:42.975
You've come into our house twice.

28:43.101 --> 28:44.768
You not only insult our police work,

28:44.894 --> 28:48.814
now you're insulting one of the most
dedicated officers I've ever partnered with.

28:48.940 --> 28:50.107
Yes, you.

28:50.233 --> 28:51.483
It's bullshit, my man.

28:54.738 --> 28:57.990
Let's not lose sight of the fact
that we want the same thing here -

28:58.116 --> 29:01.410
to find whoever is responsible
for these murders.

29:01.536 --> 29:03.620
Uh, there is one slight problem.

29:03.747 --> 29:06.290
Your case has nothing to do with our case.

29:07.584 --> 29:10.586
- The vic wasn't skinned?
- Not like our previous victims.

29:10.712 --> 29:14.214
There were minute traces of ink
in the papillary and reticular...

29:15.258 --> 29:16.633
English.

29:16.760 --> 29:19.094
Someone dug out a tattoo
from the back of her neck.

29:19.220 --> 29:20.471
Postmortem.

29:20.597 --> 29:24.808
Which is another reason why
I don't think we're looking at the same killer.

29:24.934 --> 29:27.644
It's all right here
in the county medical examiner's report.

29:27.771 --> 29:29.897
That's your opinion.
My lab thinks differently.

29:30.023 --> 29:31.440
Let me see that.

29:31.566 --> 29:34.109
- You're not taking this seriously, are you?
- In a fucking heartbeat.

29:34.235 --> 29:36.320
Do you know how many times
Vince Masuka's been published?

29:36.446 --> 29:38.781
He's our lead forensic investigator.

29:38.907 --> 29:41.074
And there's no one better.

29:41.201 --> 29:43.994
Our victim was strangled,
the same as yours.

29:45.288 --> 29:50.083
Hemorrhaging in the eyes and bruising
would lead one to conclude strangulation.

29:50.210 --> 29:52.169
Unless you're me.

29:52.295 --> 29:55.881
You were so busy playing hide the sausage
with the ME's report,

29:56.007 --> 30:00.093
you were hoping I'd miss the cotton fibers
in the nose and airways.

30:00.220 --> 30:04.932
Your victim was smothered.
That's not opinion. That's science.

30:05.058 --> 30:09.686
And science is one cold-hearted bitch
with a 14-inch strap-on.

30:09.813 --> 30:14.650
- And he's back.
- Well, I think we're through here.

30:16.236 --> 30:19.822
I'm not so sure your lieutenant
would agree, Sergeant.

30:19.948 --> 30:23.283
Then you don't know her
as well as you thought, Lieutenant.

30:48.351 --> 30:51.687
(Girl giggling) Ethan.

30:51.813 --> 30:55.858
Apparently Ethan is looking for more
than adventure on the high seas.

30:55.984 --> 30:58.235
Both of his deceased wives had prenups.

30:58.361 --> 31:01.572
In a divorce, he would have
been Iucky to keep the Rolex.

31:01.698 --> 31:03.657
But he wanted it all.

31:03.783 --> 31:06.410
(Harry) Ethan made a choice.

31:06.536 --> 31:10.873
And pretty soon, you're gonna
have to make one too, Dex.

31:10.999 --> 31:13.792
Ethan chose to be rich
rather than married.

31:14.878 --> 31:18.630
I, on the other hand,
chose to stay with Doris, even after...

31:18.756 --> 31:19.965
You cheated on her?

31:22.051 --> 31:24.595
You think you and I
are so different, don't you?

31:25.221 --> 31:27.222
I'm nothing like you.

31:27.348 --> 31:29.057
Really?

31:29.183 --> 31:32.728
You're here and Rita's back home.

31:34.063 --> 31:36.273
You're cheating on her
and you don't even realize it.

31:36.399 --> 31:40.819
I'll make time for my dark passenger
and for Rita.

31:41.738 --> 31:43.906
It's about priorities, Dexter.

31:44.032 --> 31:47.242
You're gonna have to choose
which one is your mistress

31:47.368 --> 31:49.745
and which one is your wife.

31:49.871 --> 31:53.415
And more importantly,
which one comes first.

31:57.337 --> 32:00.088
Harry, you missed a spot.

32:00.548 --> 32:01.757
(Giggles)

32:04.093 --> 32:06.303
Oh, hi, baby.

32:08.222 --> 32:10.307
Hi, Mom.

32:14.771 --> 32:17.439
(Man on PA) Attention,
all Atlantic Sun Cruise passengers,

32:17.565 --> 32:19.566
this is Bebay, your cruise director.

32:19.692 --> 32:23.904
The next sea taxi is leaving Bimini
for our ship in 20 minutes.

32:28.952 --> 32:30.786
It looked much bigger from out here.

32:30.912 --> 32:34.164
You could always knock out a wall or two.
It's easier than you think.

32:34.290 --> 32:36.667
How about the kitchen?

32:36.793 --> 32:40.212
Well, the bay window was nice.
But those cabinets...

32:40.338 --> 32:43.048
Don't get bogged down in the cosmetic stuff.

32:43.174 --> 32:45.926
How did it feel when you were inside?

32:47.011 --> 32:48.053
Like a home.

32:50.765 --> 32:52.057
God, you're good.

32:52.183 --> 32:55.352
You're my friend, Rita. I wouldn't
put you in something I didn't believe in.

32:55.478 --> 32:57.688
And I believe that this home
can work for you.

32:57.814 --> 32:59.856
For your family.

32:59.983 --> 33:01.858
Oh...

33:01.985 --> 33:04.820
What are the rules about using the
bathroom in a house you're showing?

33:04.946 --> 33:07.489
- No rules. You gotta go, you gotta go.
- All right.

33:10.243 --> 33:11.702
(Chatter)

33:12.286 --> 33:14.746
(Man) Can I see your venture
passport, sir? Thank you.

33:14.872 --> 33:16.581
Keep coming.

33:16.708 --> 33:19.668
Excuse me, sir. Can I take a look
at your venture passport? Thank you.

33:20.712 --> 33:24.089
Ma'am, could I see your pass?
Thank you.

33:25.508 --> 33:27.551
(PA) Attention all
Atlantic Sun Cruise passengers,

33:27.677 --> 33:29.761
this is Bebay, your cruise director.

33:29.887 --> 33:33.724
The sea taxi is departing Bimini
for our ship in five minutes.

33:33.850 --> 33:38.395
Please remember that the last sea taxi of
the evening leaves the ship at 10:45 tonight.

33:38.521 --> 33:41.314
All visitors, guests,
anyone who doesn't belong on board

33:41.441 --> 33:43.150
must disembark at that time.

33:43.276 --> 33:44.568
(Dexter) It'll be tight.

33:44.694 --> 33:47.696
But I think both Ethan Turner and l
will be off the ship by that time.

33:47.822 --> 33:51.366
Of course, only one of us
will be doing so because he wants to.

33:54.370 --> 33:55.495
(Panting)

33:55.621 --> 33:56.747
Rita?

33:58.041 --> 33:59.666
I'm bleeding.

33:59.792 --> 34:02.002
Oh, my God.

34:02.128 --> 34:04.671
All right, there's a hospital five blocks away.

34:04.797 --> 34:07.132
Waiting for an ambulance
is only gonna take time.

34:07.258 --> 34:09.968
- What about Dexter?
- We'll call from the car.

34:14.057 --> 34:16.391
Those things will kill you, you know?

34:17.310 --> 34:19.269
I'll talk to you later.

34:20.688 --> 34:23.273
I've been by here four times
looking for you.

34:23.399 --> 34:26.318
What for?
The other cop said you couldn't talk to me.

34:26.903 --> 34:30.072
Well, he's right. I can't. Officially.

34:30.198 --> 34:33.867
But unofficially,
there's no reason you can't call me

34:33.993 --> 34:38.080
just in case there's something
you want to tell me about your ex-boss.

34:40.750 --> 34:43.418
Burgers, fries and onion rings.

34:56.099 --> 35:00.018
I know the situation with
your mom not being around really sucks.

35:00.144 --> 35:03.522
But if things get really bad,
you use that card and call me, OK?

35:05.858 --> 35:07.859
I kept my nose outta Freebo's business.

35:07.985 --> 35:10.070
It was safer that way.

35:11.447 --> 35:13.698
Do you have any idea where he is?

35:13.825 --> 35:15.325
No.

35:15.451 --> 35:17.828
I know he was into someone
for some major cash.

35:17.954 --> 35:19.079
He was pretty scared.

35:19.205 --> 35:21.915
That's probably why
he's hiding out somewhere.

35:23.042 --> 35:26.837
That explains why someone's trying so hard
to find him. They want their money back.

35:26.963 --> 35:29.339
- So are we done?
- We're done.

35:29.465 --> 35:32.509
- Oh, yeah, one other thing.
- Yeah?

35:32.635 --> 35:37.222
When you find that jerk-off, tell him
he still owes me three weeks' pay.

35:38.307 --> 35:39.683
Thanks.

35:39.809 --> 35:41.977
Watch yourself out here, OK?

35:42.103 --> 35:43.562
OK.

35:54.490 --> 35:56.074
(Horn sounds)

36:16.262 --> 36:17.804
(Ethan grunts)

36:47.877 --> 36:51.087
- Miguel, thank God you're here.
- How is she?

36:51.214 --> 36:54.758
They rushed her to prenatal ICU
but they won't tell me a thing. I'm not family.

36:54.884 --> 36:57.093
OK.

36:57.220 --> 37:00.931
Miss. Hi, my name is Miguel Prado.
I'm the Assistant District Attorney.

37:01.057 --> 37:04.017
I need you to find your chief of staff,
Dr. Reynolds, and have him call...

37:04.143 --> 37:08.104
- I'm just an admit nurse. You're...
- Hey, call him.

37:08.231 --> 37:10.565
Right now.

37:12.610 --> 37:14.527
I feel so bad for Rita. She's all alone.

37:14.654 --> 37:17.781
Baby, baby, Reynolds is gonna make sure
she gets the best care in Miami.

37:17.907 --> 37:21.284
Why isn't Dexter back?
I've been calling all day.

37:21.410 --> 37:24.537
Goddamn it,
the father should be here.

37:24.664 --> 37:26.081
(âª David Bowie: Changes)

37:26.207 --> 37:29.334
I enjoyed shuffling through your iPod
to make sure that no one hears us.

37:29.460 --> 37:32.295
Of course, most of your shipmates
are up on the blue deck.

37:32.421 --> 37:34.172
It's happy hour.
Just the two of us.

37:34.298 --> 37:36.049
âª Ch-ch-ch-changes

37:36.175 --> 37:39.052
âª Turn and face the strange

37:39.178 --> 37:41.805
âª Ch-ch-ch-changes... âª

37:41.931 --> 37:44.933
Oh, it's too bad
I have to make this quick.

37:45.059 --> 37:49.187
I'm usually all for a stimulating conversation
at times like this.

37:49.313 --> 37:51.106
But the last sea taxi leaves in an hour.

37:53.609 --> 37:57.195
âª Time may change me... âª

37:57.321 --> 37:59.739
I've been going through
some changes myself lately.

37:59.865 --> 38:01.491
(Grunts)

38:01.617 --> 38:04.828
I'm getting married.
I've got a baby on the way. Me.

38:04.954 --> 38:06.788
(Grunting)

38:06.914 --> 38:08.999
Even though my life
may never be the same,

38:09.125 --> 38:13.461
I want to thank you for reminding me
how important it is to take time for oneself.

38:15.464 --> 38:16.548
âª Ch-ch-ch-changes... âª

38:16.674 --> 38:19.301
Savor these moments alone.

38:19.969 --> 38:21.386
âª Changes

38:21.721 --> 38:23.638
âª Oh, look out you rock and rollers

38:23.764 --> 38:28.727
- (Pounding heartbeat)
- And here I am. Paradox personified.

38:29.603 --> 38:31.271
Taking life.

38:32.315 --> 38:34.649
Creating life.

38:46.245 --> 38:52.792
With the ship anchored away from shore,
the Gulf Stream will be Ethan's last cruise.

38:52.918 --> 38:54.836
Bon voyage.

39:04.638 --> 39:07.807
This isn't like Dexter.
Something's wrong.

39:07.933 --> 39:11.478
Sweetie, I know this is difficult,
but you need to stay calm.

39:11.604 --> 39:15.106
I sent the coast guard to look for him.
He wasn't at his fishing spot.

39:15.232 --> 39:17.150
Maybe he's back at the marina by now.

39:17.276 --> 39:19.611
Then why hasn't he called?

39:25.409 --> 39:27.911
Anton, open up. It's me.

39:28.037 --> 39:30.622
(âª Hip-hop playing inside)

39:30.748 --> 39:32.916
I tried calling. I got a lead.

39:33.042 --> 39:35.418
I know why someone's looking
for you-know-who.

39:42.009 --> 39:45.303
Hurry up if you want your money.

39:45.429 --> 39:48.223
Yes, I was wrong about...

39:51.394 --> 39:52.852
bupkus.

39:52.978 --> 39:54.562
Hi.

39:55.815 --> 39:57.899
Hi. Is Anton here?

39:58.025 --> 39:59.734
He's in the shower.

40:00.361 --> 40:04.072
Oh, he'll be out soon, cause I think
we used up all the hot water.

40:06.117 --> 40:07.283
I can get him.

40:07.410 --> 40:09.369
Oh, no, that's all right.

40:09.495 --> 40:13.331
Just, um, have him call Debra Morgan.

40:13.457 --> 40:14.958
It's important.

40:15.084 --> 40:17.627
- Are you sure you don't want me to...
- Thanks.

40:17.753 --> 40:19.754
(Cellphone rings)

40:24.468 --> 40:25.802
What?

40:26.595 --> 40:28.596
Hello, Debra.
This is Miguel Prado.

40:28.722 --> 40:31.474
Have you heard from Dexter?

40:31.600 --> 40:33.685
Uh, no. Why?

40:33.811 --> 40:36.604
Well, we're at the hospital
with Rita right now.

40:37.606 --> 40:42.610
- Hospital? Everything all right?
- Debra, we need to find your brother.

40:50.035 --> 40:53.037
Ethan Turner was incapable of compromise.

40:54.748 --> 40:58.543
He loved his wives' money
more than he loved them.

40:58.669 --> 41:01.129
And in the end, it cost him dearly.

41:02.465 --> 41:05.383
I don't wanna be like Ethan.

41:07.094 --> 41:11.514
Maybe my days of coming
and going as I please are over.

41:11.640 --> 41:14.684
But that doesn't mean my life is over.

41:21.442 --> 41:25.862
Not as long as I have my boat
and the open water.

41:25.988 --> 41:28.198
There are some things
I can keep to myself.

41:28.324 --> 41:31.117
(Beeping)

41:32.036 --> 41:35.538
(Recorded voice)
You have 12 unheard messages.

41:38.083 --> 41:39.375
(Rita) Dex, it's me.

41:39.502 --> 41:41.127
I'm on my way to the hospital.

41:41.253 --> 41:43.963
I think there's something
wrong with the baby.

41:54.517 --> 41:56.017
The baby?

41:57.770 --> 42:00.396
The baby's fine.

42:02.691 --> 42:06.736
They said if I stay on bed rest
the next few days that I can...

42:08.072 --> 42:11.533
we can go home tomorrow.

42:17.289 --> 42:21.376
I don't know what I would have done
if I'd lost the baby and you weren't here.

42:23.462 --> 42:26.589
- Hey.
- And nobody could find you.

42:26.715 --> 42:29.050
I'm here now.

42:31.929 --> 42:34.514
And I'm not going anywhere.

42:39.436 --> 42:46.359
I think maybe we should wait
to find a house until after we're married.

42:49.488 --> 42:51.447
Just name the date.

42:51.574 --> 42:53.825
I'm ready.

43:00.249 --> 43:04.544
I'd like to walk down the aisle
before I start to show.

43:05.713 --> 43:07.922
Whatever you want.

43:24.690 --> 43:29.402
I may never be able to feel
our baby's heartbeat emotionally.

43:29.528 --> 43:32.572
But I know now I can't ignore it either.

43:32.698 --> 43:35.617
And for some reason I can't explain,

43:35.743 --> 43:38.620
I'm relieved to know it's still here.

43:41.123 --> 43:43.249
Fishing?

43:46.795 --> 43:48.755
That's where you were all night?

43:48.881 --> 43:51.007
Deb...

43:51.133 --> 43:54.719
You can't make me feel any worse
than I already do.

43:57.806 --> 43:59.849
Well, I hope this was
a big wake-up call for you.

43:59.975 --> 44:03.186
Cause you're gonna be a father
before you know it.

44:04.813 --> 44:06.898
Yeah, I see that now.

44:08.317 --> 44:09.984
My life is changing.

44:10.110 --> 44:13.446
And if it'll make you happy,
my place is yours.

44:15.824 --> 44:19.535
What'll make me happy
is you being there for that kid.

44:20.746 --> 44:22.997
For homework and plays.

44:24.500 --> 44:26.793
And softball games.

44:28.504 --> 44:30.588
Don't you dare be like Dad.

44:32.424 --> 44:34.509
That's never gonna happen.

44:45.521 --> 44:47.689
Quite a night, huh?

44:51.610 --> 44:53.486
I should have been here.

44:53.612 --> 44:56.322
Well, Syl and I were.

44:56.448 --> 44:58.533
That's what friends are for.

45:03.914 --> 45:07.542
- I owe you one.
- I just may take you up on that someday.

45:09.044 --> 45:14.006
You know, my office got the strangest fax
tonight from Atlantic Sun Cruises.

45:14.133 --> 45:18.052
Remember that guy whose wife
disappeared on some cruise?

45:18.178 --> 45:22.515
Get this, he was reported missing
about an hour ago.

45:26.061 --> 45:28.271
Where was it that you say you went fishing?

45:31.150 --> 45:32.608
Mercy Reef.

45:32.735 --> 45:36.362
Yeah, Mercy Reef.
That's what I thought you said.

45:37.948 --> 45:42.744
Cause when I sent the coast guard
over there, they couldn't find you.

45:44.371 --> 45:46.289
The ocean's a big place.

45:47.916 --> 45:50.418
Or maybe you weren't at Mercy Reef.

45:53.130 --> 45:54.797
Where else would I have been?

45:57.342 --> 46:01.053
Bimini's... What, 40 miles away?

46:01.180 --> 46:05.558
- I went fishing. You watched me leave.
- You were on that cruise ship.

46:05.684 --> 46:07.351
(Chuckles)

46:07.478 --> 46:09.270
Do you know how crazy that sounds?

46:09.396 --> 46:12.982
You were on that cruise ship
finishing what I couldn't.

46:15.903 --> 46:18.362
Wasn't me.

46:18.489 --> 46:23.201
You were making sure that Ethan Turner
could never hurt another innocent soul.

46:23.327 --> 46:24.994
It's getting late. You should go.

46:25.120 --> 46:29.499
It's OK.
Dexter, you and I, we're the same.

46:30.375 --> 46:31.793
No one is like me.

46:31.919 --> 46:33.503
You're wrong.

46:35.714 --> 46:37.840
Hey, you... You're wrong.

46:38.717 --> 46:41.219
Don't you see what happened today?

46:41.345 --> 46:45.139
I gave you the chance to avenge two women
whom the system failed,

46:45.265 --> 46:50.019
and just like I hoped,
you seized that opportunity.

46:51.230 --> 46:52.855
It's not like that.

46:52.981 --> 46:54.649
Dexter...

46:55.692 --> 46:58.361
You don't have to lie to me.

46:58.487 --> 47:01.030
Don't you understand?

47:01.156 --> 47:02.782
Hey, I see who you are.

47:04.284 --> 47:06.077
No, you can't.

47:06.203 --> 47:07.578
No one can.

47:07.704 --> 47:09.413
You have nothing to explain to me.

47:09.540 --> 47:12.250
Nothing to apologize for.

47:12.376 --> 47:13.668
Ever.

47:15.712 --> 47:17.755
I'm with you.

47:17.881 --> 47:19.924
I'm behind you.

47:21.218 --> 47:23.845
And I respect you.

47:28.058 --> 47:31.894
I better get home.
Syl will be waiting up.

47:32.896 --> 47:34.772
Good night, Dexter.

47:34.898 --> 47:39.026
When Harry saw
what I truly was, he was repuIsed.

47:39.152 --> 47:40.736
It destroyed my brother,

47:40.863 --> 47:43.155
consumed Lila.

47:43.282 --> 47:45.741
But not Miguel Prado.

47:45.868 --> 47:49.287
Somehow he looks at me
and he's...

47:49.413 --> 47:51.080
proud.
