WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:03.298
Previously on Dexter.

00:03.425 --> 00:05.050
I loaned Freebo that money.

00:05.176 --> 00:07.094
This is about respect.

00:07.220 --> 00:08.929
(Tires screeching)

00:09.055 --> 00:10.597
Anton!

00:10.724 --> 00:13.225
(Quinn) Morgan, get out of the way!

00:14.144 --> 00:15.561
You found me.

00:15.687 --> 00:18.272
I never meant for any of this
to go down the way it did.

00:18.398 --> 00:19.857
I shoulda told you
you were free and clear.

00:19.983 --> 00:21.525
- So that was you?
- Yeah.

00:22.694 --> 00:24.945
- Debra, you lied to me!
- I am not the enemy here.

00:25.071 --> 00:28.073
I need for you to seriously think about us.

00:29.075 --> 00:30.534
Life vests?

00:30.660 --> 00:34.246
We can't exactly load up the cart
with axes and machetes now, can we?

00:34.372 --> 00:37.666
Last Thursday,
I was having drinks with her,

00:37.792 --> 00:41.462
and then the next day
I'm staring down at her dead body.

00:41.588 --> 00:43.547
(Miguel) She's lucky to have you
watching out for her.

00:43.673 --> 00:46.675
It's just like you watched out for me
with Oscar's case.

00:48.261 --> 00:49.803
Wait.

00:49.929 --> 00:51.847
I told Sylvia about Miguel
and LaGuerta.

00:51.973 --> 00:54.308
So she thinks Miguel
is at LaGuerta's?

00:54.434 --> 00:55.726
You fucker!

00:55.852 --> 00:57.519
You are too good a liar, Miguel.

00:57.645 --> 00:59.980
- Come on, baby, listen to me.
- Don't touch me! I'm done!

01:00.106 --> 01:01.648
Did you see anyone else on the street?

01:01.775 --> 01:05.527
There was some douchebag
with his high beams on, blinding me.

01:05.653 --> 01:09.740
- (LaGuerta) What kind of car?
- Dark, black, SUV.

01:09.866 --> 01:10.991
Think that's funny?

01:11.117 --> 01:12.951
Not at all.
They said that stain would come out.

01:13.078 --> 01:17.414
I am the last person you wanna fuck with,
because I will fuck you back!

01:17.540 --> 01:18.582
Count on it!

01:18.708 --> 01:19.792
I will.

01:19.918 --> 01:24.088
(Dexter) Even Harry would agree,
Miguel has left me no other choice.

01:24.214 --> 01:26.340
I kill him.

01:26.466 --> 01:28.258
- Get a good look at him?
- (Man) His name?

01:28.384 --> 01:29.676
Dexter Morgan.

01:29.803 --> 01:30.844
(Miguel) You want Freebo?

01:30.970 --> 01:34.181
Then you need to have
a long conversation with him.

01:34.307 --> 01:36.850
- (Cellphone rings)
- (Muffled screams)

01:36.976 --> 01:38.519
(Tires screeching)

03:36.137 --> 03:37.971
(Dexter) So this is how it ends.

03:38.097 --> 03:40.766
I've pictured it a thousand ways,
but never this.

03:40.892 --> 03:43.852
Me bound in the trunk of a car.

03:49.776 --> 03:51.151
(Grunts)

03:58.785 --> 04:00.744
I am so fucked.

04:00.870 --> 04:05.666
Must be what your victims feel like.
Trapped, hopeless.

04:05.792 --> 04:08.669
You got any more words of encouragement,
or are you just here to gloat?

04:08.795 --> 04:10.170
I'm here for moral support.

04:10.296 --> 04:11.880
You were right about Miguel.

04:13.466 --> 04:15.217
He must have sent Ramon after me.

04:15.343 --> 04:17.386
- Dexter...
- I know I only have myself to blame.

04:17.512 --> 04:21.473
I don't blame you for wanting a friend,
a normal life.

04:22.725 --> 04:25.686
- You don't?
- I'm actually proud of you for trying.

04:27.355 --> 04:29.022
It was brave.

04:29.148 --> 04:30.565
Yeah.

04:30.692 --> 04:31.775
Yay me.

04:31.901 --> 04:33.026
(Grunts)

04:33.152 --> 04:35.862
I should have fucking killed Miguel
when I had the chance.

04:35.989 --> 04:38.365
You still can, Dexter.

04:38.491 --> 04:39.700
Don't give up.

04:58.678 --> 05:00.554
Ow!

05:00.680 --> 05:01.638
What is this?

05:01.764 --> 05:03.181
Your bachelor party, hermano!

05:03.308 --> 05:07.060
Ow! Ah, watch the grill, George Foreman.

05:07.186 --> 05:08.186
(Bell rings)

05:08.313 --> 05:10.689
(Woman over PA)
All aboard the party boat!

05:10.815 --> 05:12.899
(♪ Dance music)

05:15.945 --> 05:18.322
(Quinn) Holy shit.
Your eye's already swollen.

05:18.448 --> 05:19.406
(Dexter) Here he comes.

05:19.532 --> 05:22.242
Ten minutes on.
Ten minutes off.

05:22.368 --> 05:23.410
I'm sorry, Vince.

05:23.536 --> 05:25.078
I just thought... I don't know.

05:25.204 --> 05:28.749
(Laughs) That's fucking hilarious!
You were freaked, right?

05:28.875 --> 05:30.000
Yeah.

05:30.126 --> 05:32.586
Premium alcohol,
all-you-can-eat buffet,

05:32.712 --> 05:34.838
plus high-class adult entertainment.

05:34.964 --> 05:37.090
(Dexter) Kill me now.

05:37.216 --> 05:39.926
You guys, this is...awesome.

05:40.053 --> 05:42.054
No, no, that's fucking awesome!

05:42.221 --> 05:44.097
(Woman) Hey.

05:45.350 --> 05:48.060
(Quinn) Hey, ladies, what's going on?
(Woman) Hi, sailor.

05:52.565 --> 05:55.650
(Dexter) The best man
arrives with his brother.

05:55.777 --> 05:58.653
Designated driver or bodyguard?

05:58.780 --> 06:00.238
I'll find out later.

06:00.365 --> 06:02.574
Right now, time to put on my party face.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.081
Bachelor parties.

06:09.207 --> 06:11.291
While I do understand
the need for ritual,

06:11.417 --> 06:14.086
I've heard these events
aren't really for the groom,

06:14.212 --> 06:16.380
they're for everyone else.

06:19.759 --> 06:22.636
I have plans to make for my own big day,

06:22.762 --> 06:25.430
the day I kill Miguel.

06:26.391 --> 06:30.060
OK, OK, let's get the music down.
Baja la música.

06:30.186 --> 06:33.397
OK, boys and girls!
Put those packages away, please.

06:33.523 --> 06:36.316
So as you all know,
we're here to, uh,

06:36.442 --> 06:39.694
celebrate the impending marriage
of our dear friend Dexter.

06:39.821 --> 06:42.322
(Cheering and applause)

06:42.448 --> 06:46.827
And while myjob as best man
is to offer a few remarks,

06:46.953 --> 06:49.454
you're gonna have to forgive me
for keeping them G-rated,

06:49.580 --> 06:51.957
because, uh, I'm running for office after all.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.667
(Dexter) Better run fast.

06:53.793 --> 06:55.919
Dexter's a hard guy to get to know.

06:56.045 --> 06:58.505
And for a smart guy,

06:58.631 --> 07:01.758
sometimes he doesn't have the good sense
that God gave little chickens.

07:01.884 --> 07:03.009
(Laughter)

07:03.136 --> 07:05.971
I mean, like this doughnut thing.
What's up with that?

07:06.097 --> 07:09.015
You bring doughnuts to work
so that people can like you?

07:09.142 --> 07:11.017
(Laughter)

07:11.144 --> 07:13.687
Thanks for the diabetes
and the clogged arteries, Dexter.

07:13.813 --> 07:14.938
(Laughter)

07:15.064 --> 07:18.233
I mean, why don't you just stab
a pal in the ventricle, huh?

07:18.359 --> 07:20.444
(Laughter)

07:22.405 --> 07:25.323
But in all seriousness, I, uh...

07:26.325 --> 07:28.618
I wanna say a few words
about friendship.

07:29.662 --> 07:32.414
Friends are always honest
with each other.

07:34.459 --> 07:36.793
They can see past their differences.

07:39.422 --> 07:43.216
When they have a conflict,
friends are there to forgive.

07:44.385 --> 07:48.138
A true friend knows
when to bury the hatchet,

07:48.264 --> 07:51.975
because friendship is a sacred bond...

07:52.602 --> 07:54.519
built on trust.

07:54.645 --> 07:56.271
And, Dex...

07:57.190 --> 07:59.816
I have learned so much
from you about, uh...

08:01.527 --> 08:03.069
trust.

08:06.532 --> 08:07.949
So, coño...

08:08.075 --> 08:09.743
Hey - to Dexter!

08:09.869 --> 08:12.662
- To Dexter.
- (Cheers and applause)

08:19.545 --> 08:21.755
(Dexter) I have to be at work in 45 minutes.

08:21.881 --> 08:25.550
Maybe I can squeeze in a power nap
and a quick shower.

08:25.676 --> 08:27.761
(Knock at door)

08:27.887 --> 08:29.429
Maybe not.

08:29.555 --> 08:31.556
(Knocking continues)

08:38.314 --> 08:40.398
Hey.

08:40.525 --> 08:42.108
Good morning.

08:42.235 --> 08:44.945
Look, bagels. Soak up the alcohol.

08:46.239 --> 08:48.240
Actually, I'm late for work.

08:50.493 --> 08:51.952
How was it?

08:52.078 --> 08:53.745
I...survived.

08:54.789 --> 08:57.958
If you're wondering
if I did anything stupid...

08:58.084 --> 08:59.167
I didn't.

08:59.293 --> 09:02.629
Mmm, well,
it must have been very tempting.

09:03.923 --> 09:05.340
Very.

09:09.262 --> 09:11.054
Syl told me she kicked out Miguel.

09:13.099 --> 09:14.516
How is he?

09:15.434 --> 09:18.979
- Uh, I think he feels betrayed.
- Why?

09:19.105 --> 09:22.107
He's the one who threw
his marriage vows out the window.

09:22.233 --> 09:25.485
- Who does that?
- A man without a code.

09:25.611 --> 09:26.570
Exactly.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.280
So...

09:29.824 --> 09:31.157
What?

09:31.284 --> 09:34.869
Well, I mean, do you really want him
standing beside you

09:34.996 --> 09:36.580
on the biggest day of our lives?

09:38.082 --> 09:39.749
Actually, no.

09:40.835 --> 09:44.337
But I thought I should play nice
till after the wedding.

09:44.463 --> 09:45.755
Just think about it, OK?

09:47.633 --> 09:48.758
- What is that?
- Oh.

09:48.884 --> 09:51.344
It's a, uh, hour-by-hour schedule
for the day of.

09:51.470 --> 09:54.097
There's hair and make-up for me.

09:54.223 --> 09:57.350
Transportation,
pictures, ceremony.

09:57.476 --> 10:01.521
Things are bound to go wrong.
The less left to chance the better.

10:01.647 --> 10:02.689
Wise words.

10:02.815 --> 10:04.733
- I'll make you a copy.
- Great.

10:04.859 --> 10:06.943
But can we talk wedding stuff later?

10:07.069 --> 10:10.238
- I really gotta get in the shower.
- You want some company?

10:11.824 --> 10:14.242
Yeah. But I'm too late.

10:14.368 --> 10:16.328
(Giggles)

10:20.249 --> 10:23.084
(Dexter) After last night,
they all think we share a secret,

10:23.210 --> 10:25.920
but Miguel's the only one
who knows mine.

10:26.047 --> 10:29.215
I could tell the rest of them,
but then I'd have to kill them.

10:29.342 --> 10:31.468
Just like I'm going to kill Miguel.

10:34.347 --> 10:36.348
(Exhales deeply)

10:37.308 --> 10:38.224
Ow!

10:38.351 --> 10:40.393
What am I,
the Morgan family punching bag?

10:40.519 --> 10:42.896
Thanks for not inviting me
to Dexter's party, you ass.

10:43.022 --> 10:46.900
It was a bachelor party.
Dongs and gongs required.

10:47.026 --> 10:48.443
Unless you wanna be talent.

10:48.569 --> 10:50.779
- In which case...
- Gross. He's my brother.

10:50.905 --> 10:52.113
Not by blood.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.324
Oh, thank God. My head.

10:54.450 --> 10:58.870
Your head should be in the Ellen Wolf case,
Detective. Let's review.

11:00.122 --> 11:04.250
Toby Edwards. Bartender slash booty-call.

11:04.377 --> 11:07.921
Saw a black SUV outside Ellen Wolf's place
the night she died.

11:08.047 --> 11:09.422
(Dexter) Miguel's black SUV.

11:09.548 --> 11:11.883
- The grid we set up, what did we get?
- Jack diddly.

11:12.009 --> 11:14.761
There's no traffic surveillance footage
of any black SUV

11:14.887 --> 11:17.764
between Ellen's house and the cemetery
where her body was found.

11:17.890 --> 11:21.017
(Dexter) Maybe I could kill him in his car.
It has that big back seat.

11:21.143 --> 11:24.479
Let's recanvass. Somebody saw something,
and we're gonna find them.

11:24.605 --> 11:26.898
Next order of business.
The Skinner.

11:27.024 --> 11:30.777
George King. The Nicaraguan embassy
is still giving me the run-around.

11:30.903 --> 11:33.113
Ramos. Go there in person.

11:33.239 --> 11:36.408
Until we know King's true identity,
there's not much to go on.

11:36.534 --> 11:40.620
And finally, Anton Briggs is coming in today
to go over his statement.

11:40.746 --> 11:42.122
Today?

11:42.248 --> 11:44.332
What's the matter,
you forget your lip gloss?

11:44.458 --> 11:47.293
Quinn. I want you to stay clear.

11:47.420 --> 11:48.962
No more sparring.

11:49.088 --> 11:51.881
And, Morgan, I know he's your informant,
but I wanna cover it.

11:52.007 --> 11:54.300
Get myself up to speed
with the case.

11:54.427 --> 11:55.677
All right, people.

11:55.803 --> 11:59.222
That's it. Go, catch bad guys.

11:59.348 --> 12:02.142
Fuck you, lip gloss.

12:02.268 --> 12:04.227
(LaGuerta) No unusual activity?

12:06.355 --> 12:11.568
There was some douchebag
with his high beams on, blinding me.

12:13.738 --> 12:16.239
Actually, it wasn't high beams.

12:16.365 --> 12:18.575
It was those big-ass halogens.

12:18.701 --> 12:21.119
- What kind of car?
- SUV.

12:22.121 --> 12:25.248
Dark, blue...black.

12:25.374 --> 12:27.500
Something like that.

12:56.071 --> 12:58.156
Hola, Miguel.

12:59.158 --> 13:01.326
Mmm, así, así.

13:01.452 --> 13:06.080
Yeah, listen, after that scene
with Syl the other night...

13:07.291 --> 13:09.334
I think we should talk.

13:14.298 --> 13:15.507
That's great.

13:15.633 --> 13:19.177
Get a 20 on Anton Briggs.
Have his Uni watchdogs bring him in.

13:20.471 --> 13:22.138
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:22.264 --> 13:23.223
Mwah.

13:23.349 --> 13:26.184
- You always look so happy to see me.
- It's cause I always am.

13:26.310 --> 13:28.186
I brought you these.

13:29.230 --> 13:30.980
Italian hangover remedies

13:31.106 --> 13:35.026
perfected by centuries of
overindulging ancestors.

13:35.152 --> 13:38.988
There's saffron lemon risotto,
white pizza, cayenne tea.

13:40.825 --> 13:44.118
Sounds great. But I'm not hung over.

13:45.454 --> 13:47.580
I behaved myself last night.

13:47.706 --> 13:49.624
I'm a plus one now, remember?

13:49.750 --> 13:53.002
Still, man has his needs.

13:53.754 --> 13:55.171
Trust me.

13:55.297 --> 13:57.382
My needs are covered.

14:02.763 --> 14:04.639
(Harry) Cold feet?

14:05.724 --> 14:07.809
What?

14:07.935 --> 14:10.103
No, Rita's great.

14:11.146 --> 14:12.730
Getting married's easy, Dex.

14:14.859 --> 14:16.651
All you have to do is show up.

14:16.777 --> 14:18.319
But killing Miguel Prado?

14:21.407 --> 14:23.074
That'll require some finesse.

14:24.994 --> 14:26.744
He's a public figure.

14:26.871 --> 14:28.872
- Well connected.
- Dad, I got it.

14:28.998 --> 14:31.124
Miguel dies, people notice.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.501
Which means you can't
just make him disappear.

14:33.627 --> 14:36.546
So I'll pin it on someone else.

14:37.423 --> 14:40.133
How about your timeline?

14:40.259 --> 14:43.219
Definitely after the wedding.
It'd be crazy to do it any sooner.

14:43.345 --> 14:44.596
And an alibi?

14:44.722 --> 14:46.431
The wedding night.

14:48.767 --> 14:50.602
Rita's pregnant, exhausted.

14:50.728 --> 14:54.314
After our wedding and a glass of
champagne, she'll be out like a light.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.649
Unless she wakes up
and you're not there.

14:56.775 --> 14:59.861
That is not the way you want her
to remember your wedding night.

15:04.950 --> 15:07.035
Are you hiding or something?

15:08.245 --> 15:10.830
Anton will be here in a minute.
I don't wanna see him.

15:10.956 --> 15:14.834
I know it's real immature,
but if I see him, I'll just miss him.

15:16.295 --> 15:18.171
So tell him.

15:18.297 --> 15:20.006
I can't.

15:20.132 --> 15:23.009
I need to be with somebody
who's got his shit together.

15:23.135 --> 15:26.179
Somebody with a real job,
somebody with strong morals.

15:27.264 --> 15:28.932
Somebody like Dad.

15:30.392 --> 15:32.352
Dad wasn't perfect, Deb.

15:33.395 --> 15:36.064
Yeah, well,
he wasn't a drug user or a CI.

15:36.190 --> 15:37.899
Well, Anton's not a CI.

15:39.318 --> 15:42.362
Dad still wouldn't approve.

15:42.488 --> 15:44.489
You'd be surprised.

15:46.825 --> 15:49.994
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.287
Something.

15:51.413 --> 15:54.832
You've had a bug up your ass
about Dad for months now.

15:54.959 --> 15:56.125
What did he do?

15:59.588 --> 16:01.965
You don't wanna know.

16:04.468 --> 16:05.760
Now I really do.

16:07.429 --> 16:08.846
(Sighs)

16:08.973 --> 16:11.099
He wasn't on the take.

16:11.225 --> 16:14.310
He didn't break any laws.
He didn't cheat on Mom.

16:29.994 --> 16:31.411
Bullshit.

16:32.913 --> 16:34.622
Yeah, you're right.

16:37.668 --> 16:39.544
Bullshit! Who?

16:47.344 --> 16:49.554
A CI.

16:55.644 --> 16:57.729
You always wanted to be like Dad.

17:01.525 --> 17:02.900
Seriously?

17:15.247 --> 17:18.458
Anton is here to go over his statement...
with you.

17:18.584 --> 17:21.544
- I thought you were covering this.
- I was.

17:23.005 --> 17:25.089
But you're the only one he trusts.

17:26.300 --> 17:29.135
Well, it's really hard to find people
that you trust these days.

17:29.261 --> 17:30.887
- Deb...
- Blow me.

17:33.766 --> 17:35.433
My sister never says that.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.318
(Whispers) Oops.

18:06.673 --> 18:10.259
Shit, this was a bad idea.
Send in the other guy.

18:11.386 --> 18:13.846
- What?
- (Exhales deeply)

18:13.972 --> 18:17.058
It's pretty clear
you don't wanna be here.

18:17.184 --> 18:20.770
I'm... Sorry, this is not about you. Um...

18:22.439 --> 18:26.734
I mean, it's about you. It's just...

18:28.570 --> 18:30.863
...something else just happened.

18:32.825 --> 18:34.909
Are you OK?

18:35.953 --> 18:37.161
No.

18:39.289 --> 18:40.414
Can I help?

18:40.541 --> 18:42.542
(Sniffs) Um...

18:44.711 --> 18:48.131
Take a look at this and see if there's
anything that you wanna change or add...

18:48.257 --> 18:50.800
You know that's not why I'm here.

18:51.844 --> 18:54.762
Right now I really need it to be.

19:04.648 --> 19:05.815
(Sighs)

19:13.323 --> 19:14.448
(Chuckles)

19:14.575 --> 19:16.617
What?

19:19.371 --> 19:21.622
Is there a mistake?

19:23.625 --> 19:25.084
No.

19:25.210 --> 19:27.086
It's just, um...

19:27.212 --> 19:31.966
these...words, they don't...really say it.

19:33.051 --> 19:36.387
You know, what...what happened to me.

19:37.806 --> 19:39.348
What do you mean?

19:42.269 --> 19:43.895
Debra, I could...

19:45.147 --> 19:47.231
hear it, you know?

19:49.902 --> 19:51.611
The sound...

19:52.738 --> 19:55.781
of the blade cutting into me.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.287
That and, uh...

20:01.413 --> 20:03.915
the sound of me screaming.

20:06.418 --> 20:08.502
Like it was somebody else.

20:11.715 --> 20:14.091
And I remember thinking,

20:14.218 --> 20:16.594
"That guy screaming...

20:22.100 --> 20:23.768
"he's gonna die."

20:31.109 --> 20:32.443
(Sighs)

20:34.655 --> 20:36.614
But, um...

20:36.740 --> 20:39.659
then he just stopped.

20:40.911 --> 20:42.119
Why?

20:44.289 --> 20:45.998
To go through my pockets.

20:46.124 --> 20:48.834
He took my wallet
and my cellphone.

20:48.961 --> 20:51.087
Cocksucker even took my change.

20:52.965 --> 20:54.465
Your change?

20:57.552 --> 20:59.178
How fucked up is that?

21:18.824 --> 21:20.533
He give you anything?

21:20.659 --> 21:22.201
Nothing we can use.

21:22.327 --> 21:25.204
We'll walk the crime scene,
see if there's anything we missed.

21:25.330 --> 21:27.999
Whatever it takes
to fucking catch this guy.

21:31.169 --> 21:33.504
Please tell me
you're not freezing sperm in there.

21:35.882 --> 21:38.634
This only gets down
to minus 40 degrees centigrade.

21:38.760 --> 21:42.096
Freezing sperm requires a vessel
to be at least minus 200.

21:43.515 --> 21:45.850
What? I'm a donor.

21:45.976 --> 21:47.810
It's my way of giving back.

21:47.936 --> 21:49.312
God help the children.

21:49.438 --> 21:53.399
Hey, um, is the, uh, server down?

21:53.525 --> 21:57.236
- Why, what do you need?
- Um, I wanted to run a background check.

21:57.362 --> 21:58.612
On who?

21:59.614 --> 22:00.698
Tammy Okama.

22:01.825 --> 22:03.909
You slept with her, didn't you?

22:04.036 --> 22:06.370
Vince Masuka does not kiss and tell.

22:07.873 --> 22:10.082
- OK, fine, I banged her.
- (They laugh)

22:10.917 --> 22:13.294
- And?
- And... (Sighs)

22:13.420 --> 22:16.797
Wow. We just stayed up all night just...

22:17.841 --> 22:19.300
just talking.

22:20.469 --> 22:22.053
So you like her?

22:22.721 --> 22:25.848
(Sighs) The problem is she likes me.

22:25.974 --> 22:28.476
I mean, there's gotta be
something wrong with her, right?

22:28.602 --> 22:31.520
Well, I'll let you know
when the server's up.

22:44.659 --> 22:46.285
If home is where the heart is,

22:46.411 --> 22:48.662
where do you go
when you don't have a heart?

22:49.915 --> 22:53.292
In Miguel's case, a five-star hotel.

22:54.669 --> 22:57.380
I used to know Miguel's schedule
inside and out.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.548
After all, we were best friends.

23:00.592 --> 23:02.301
But things change.

23:02.427 --> 23:04.345
Now that Syl kicked him
out of the house,

23:04.471 --> 23:06.555
he has a new routine I need to learn.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.240
Can I get my keys?
I forgot something.

23:24.366 --> 23:25.991
- There you are, Mr. Prado.
- Thank you.

23:26.118 --> 23:27.993
Thank you.

23:28.120 --> 23:31.705
(Dexter) Or I could wait for him
to do something stupid.

23:31.832 --> 23:33.249
Like ditching Ramon.

23:47.055 --> 23:48.472
You close to your father?

23:50.851 --> 23:53.894
No. He was, uh, deadbeat trailer trash.

23:54.020 --> 23:57.398
- It's why I became a cop.
- You got a rich mother or something?

23:57.524 --> 23:59.108
She died when I was five.

23:59.234 --> 24:00.234
Why?

24:00.360 --> 24:02.862
The car, the watch.

24:02.988 --> 24:05.030
Just wondering
if you had a trust fund,

24:05.157 --> 24:09.869
- or you were day trading, or something.
- (Laughs) No. I got an uncle in Boston.

24:09.995 --> 24:13.038
He died, left me a building. Total surprise.

24:13.165 --> 24:14.665
Huh.

24:14.791 --> 24:16.375
Families are full of 'em.

24:16.501 --> 24:19.795
Just wait till Dexter's wedding.
Brings out the best and the worst.

24:21.882 --> 24:24.675
Weddings kinda suck
when you're single.

24:24.801 --> 24:27.720
Single? I thought you and Anton were...

24:27.846 --> 24:29.430
- We're not. Not any more.
- Hmm.

24:31.099 --> 24:32.600
So, uh...

24:32.726 --> 24:34.894
you wanna, you know, carpool?

24:37.939 --> 24:38.939
(Laughs) What?

24:39.065 --> 24:41.317
High gas prices, you know?

24:41.443 --> 24:44.278
- Are you hitting on me?
- (Cellphone rings)

24:44.404 --> 24:45.446
I'm sorry.

24:49.242 --> 24:50.242
Hello?

24:50.368 --> 24:51.619
- (Batista) Morgan.
- Hello?

24:51.745 --> 24:53.704
- Hello?
- (Static)

24:53.830 --> 24:56.373
Goddamn it,
fucking cellphone reception.

24:58.335 --> 24:59.502
It's Batista.

24:59.628 --> 25:02.463
Probably wants a status update.
We should give it to him.

25:02.589 --> 25:04.965
Hey, you have any change?
I saw a payphone up the street.

25:05.091 --> 25:06.300
Think so.

25:12.015 --> 25:13.432
Motherfuck!

25:14.059 --> 25:15.267
Holy Jesus on a stick!

25:15.393 --> 25:17.186
- What?
- No cellphone reception.

25:17.312 --> 25:20.856
That's why George King took
Anton's change. To use that payphone.

25:20.982 --> 25:23.817
We gotta dump the phone records.

25:26.530 --> 25:27.780
Whoa.

25:29.115 --> 25:30.866
Oye.

25:30.992 --> 25:32.701
Sí.

25:32.827 --> 25:35.037
I'm glad you called today.

25:35.163 --> 25:38.290
I was surprised, but, uh, glad.

25:40.877 --> 25:44.922
(Sighs) The last thing I wanted to do
was put you in the middle of...

25:45.757 --> 25:48.384
Maria, you gotta know that...

25:48.510 --> 25:51.720
I've been thinking about us for a long time.

25:51.846 --> 25:55.808
Way before Ellen Wolf, rest in peace.

25:59.563 --> 26:02.982
- Cause, hey, what we had...
- We were different back then.

26:03.108 --> 26:04.650
Really different.

26:06.444 --> 26:08.279
So why is it every time I look at you,

26:08.405 --> 26:12.199
I still feel the same way I felt
when we first met? Hmm?

26:14.786 --> 26:17.496
- Water's boiling.
- Boiling, yes, ooh.

26:18.915 --> 26:20.833
It's mí sopa.

26:20.959 --> 26:24.003
And...I got you some Red Stripe.

26:24.129 --> 26:27.339
- Oh, wow, great.
- Somewhere. Shit, I left it in the car.

26:27.465 --> 26:28.924
Oh, I'll go get it.

26:29.050 --> 26:32.928
No, no, no, no. You stay
and make sure it doesn't boil over.

26:33.471 --> 26:35.347
(Chuckling) OK.

26:43.023 --> 26:44.148
(Car lock beeps)

27:05.670 --> 27:08.380
(Dexter) Miguel probably thinks
he's getting Iucky.

27:08.506 --> 27:10.883
Looks like he's getting screwed.

27:28.526 --> 27:30.611
(Car lock beeps)

27:31.946 --> 27:35.407
(Scanning radio stations)

27:37.452 --> 27:40.162
(♪ Marching music on radio)

27:41.748 --> 27:43.582
(Door closes)

27:45.877 --> 27:50.089
They make a cute couple. Too bad
they're both lying through their teeth.

27:55.220 --> 27:56.845
(Car lock beeps)

28:04.062 --> 28:07.064
(Beeping)

28:25.750 --> 28:29.336
Don't go there, Miguel.
You start thinking LaGuerta's onto you,

28:29.462 --> 28:33.298
you'll decide to do very bad things
to another innocent person,

28:33.425 --> 28:36.301
and I can't let that happen.

28:48.189 --> 28:50.232
Things to do today -

28:50.358 --> 28:53.610
find a non-blowback way
to dispose Miguel's body.

29:00.910 --> 29:05.289
I need you to run hair and fiber for me
against all victims for the last ten days.

29:06.833 --> 29:10.210
- But I'm the blood guy.
- Who also does forensics.

29:10.336 --> 29:13.672
Who I trust to keep a confidence
and the lab results off the record.

29:14.632 --> 29:17.009
Well, keeping secrets
is one of my strong suits,

29:17.135 --> 29:20.679
but I got my head handed to me the last time
I did some off-the-grid testing, by you.

29:20.805 --> 29:23.974
This is different.
That was bureaucratic bullshit.

29:24.100 --> 29:26.810
And this is,
"Do as I say, not as I do"?

29:28.438 --> 29:31.440
You ever get a voice inside
nagging at you?

29:32.400 --> 29:36.695
- I'm aware of the phenomenon.
- Well, I'm hoping I'm wrong about this,

29:36.821 --> 29:38.781
but if I am and anyone finds out,

29:38.907 --> 29:41.533
it'll bring a shit hurricane
down on the entire department.

29:41.659 --> 29:43.202
And if you're right?

29:43.328 --> 29:45.871
Same hurricane, different landfall.

29:45.997 --> 29:48.791
Got it. Either way, I need a raincoat.

29:48.917 --> 29:51.210
No, I don't want you getting
into any trouble over this.

29:51.336 --> 29:55.756
Use my authorization code to make it
happen. Procedure above board, results...

29:56.633 --> 29:59.009
under the table.

29:59.135 --> 30:01.887
- You good with that?
- Absolutely.

30:02.013 --> 30:04.348
If you need something
under the table, I'm your guy.

30:07.227 --> 30:08.560
That didn't come out right.

30:10.188 --> 30:12.481
How soon before you can get back to me
with this?

30:12.607 --> 30:14.608
ASAP.

30:19.030 --> 30:22.616
Accessing samples from homicides
in the last ten days.

30:24.828 --> 30:27.704
Fast-tracked and confidential.

30:27.831 --> 30:29.915
Authorisation code requested.

30:37.757 --> 30:39.007
Processing.

30:40.009 --> 30:41.468
Approved.

30:43.388 --> 30:44.972
You're the best.

30:48.685 --> 30:50.602
I have to be.

30:53.523 --> 30:56.316
(Computer beeping)

31:31.561 --> 31:35.898
MUDs and LUDs from that payphone.
George King was using it like an office line.

31:36.024 --> 31:39.109
He called clients, he called workers,
he ordered Nicaraguan takeout.

31:39.235 --> 31:41.820
- That doesn't help us.
- Well, maybe it does.

31:41.946 --> 31:44.865
I just got off the phone with some lady
that he called up in New Jersey.

31:44.991 --> 31:46.783
She winters down here
at Coconut Grove.

31:46.910 --> 31:49.578
She just rehired George King
to re-landscape their lawn.

31:50.204 --> 31:52.706
- So?
- So he knows the place is empty.

31:53.458 --> 31:57.127
- You think he'd be using it to lay low?
- We got fuck-all else.

31:59.464 --> 32:00.756
Vince.

32:01.883 --> 32:04.968
The server's back up,
so I ran your girl.

32:05.094 --> 32:07.804
Bad news. She's got a rap sheet.

32:09.891 --> 32:12.809
She rammed her car into someone else
over a parking space.

32:13.686 --> 32:16.813
- Yeah.
- Big fine, anger management.

32:16.940 --> 32:20.233
That means she's got issues.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.235
So she's not outta my league.

32:26.115 --> 32:28.200
Happy to help.

32:34.499 --> 32:38.502
(Dexter) Both Caucasoid, evenly distributed
pigment granules, same dye job.

32:38.628 --> 32:41.421
In other words, both Ellen Wolf.
No news there.

32:43.341 --> 32:45.968
Do I let LaGuerta in on this?

32:46.094 --> 32:48.178
But why stir up the hornet's nest?

32:48.304 --> 32:51.765
Miguel's going to get the justice
he deserves soon enough.

32:52.517 --> 32:54.559
- Hey, Dex.
- Hey.

32:55.520 --> 32:57.229
Too late to bring a date
to the wedding?

32:57.355 --> 33:00.691
- No, Rita's still collecting RSVPs.
- (Sighs)

33:01.734 --> 33:03.568
What you working on?

33:03.695 --> 33:07.739
I, uh, found a grey hair.
I was curious.

33:07.865 --> 33:09.950
Oh, dude, I've totally done that.

33:10.868 --> 33:12.202
You're bald.

33:14.956 --> 33:16.039
Oh.

33:45.153 --> 33:48.697
- Maybe we should call for backup?
- Let's see what we got first.

33:53.745 --> 33:56.663
Someone took the jungle cruise
at Magic Kingdom.

34:01.753 --> 34:02.836
(Parrot shrieks)

34:02.962 --> 34:04.337
Creeping mother of Mary!

34:06.174 --> 34:07.299
Hey.

34:07.842 --> 34:09.885
Door.

34:10.011 --> 34:11.553
Fuck, there he is!

34:11.679 --> 34:13.388
Go around front.

34:16.184 --> 34:18.101
Requesting all units, 931 Harbor Drive.

34:32.116 --> 34:33.241
(Slash)

34:33.367 --> 34:34.659
Fuck!

34:34.786 --> 34:36.161
(Grunting)

34:36.287 --> 34:37.788
Fuck!

34:39.165 --> 34:41.124
- Jesus, Quinn, are you OK?
- Ow!

34:43.127 --> 34:45.670
Officer down.
931 Harbor Drive.

34:45.797 --> 34:49.257
Requesting an ambulance,
Also air surveillance of our 20.

34:53.638 --> 34:55.722
What's this?

34:55.848 --> 34:58.517
Dexter, I need to see you for a minute.

35:08.152 --> 35:11.905
- You found the hair analysis results?
- Sorry, it...

35:12.824 --> 35:14.950
You were out, and they were
just sitting there,

35:15.076 --> 35:17.702
and I really needed to know
what came back.

35:21.666 --> 35:24.042
So...now you know.

35:24.168 --> 35:26.253
Question is,
what are you gonna do?

35:28.506 --> 35:30.507
It's complicated.

35:31.884 --> 35:34.427
I understand complicated.
Maybe I can help.

35:38.641 --> 35:40.058
(LaGuerta) OK.

35:41.102 --> 35:43.937
You're close with Miguel Prado,
and so am I,

35:44.063 --> 35:46.398
which is what makes this very difficult.

35:46.524 --> 35:49.192
What's this gotta do with Miguel?

35:50.736 --> 35:53.488
Ellen Wolf was threatening
to wreck his career.

35:53.614 --> 35:58.160
Well, he has a black SUV
and no alibi for the night she died.

36:00.163 --> 36:02.414
You think Miguel had something
to do with her murder?

36:02.540 --> 36:07.127
I found this sample in the back of his car.

36:10.798 --> 36:14.050
I... I told you this was complicated.

36:14.886 --> 36:16.303
Dexter.

36:16.429 --> 36:19.556
I need your word this stays between us.

36:20.391 --> 36:21.558
Yeah, you have it.

36:24.562 --> 36:26.313
No wonder all the secrecy.

36:27.690 --> 36:29.858
I'm assuming there's no chain of custody
on this?

36:29.984 --> 36:33.570
I'll go to a judge for a warrant,
get evidence through proper channels.

36:33.696 --> 36:37.782
Which will tip off Miguel
and put LaGuerta in his crosshairs.

36:37.909 --> 36:40.035
You really think a judge
is gonna issue a warrant

36:40.161 --> 36:43.914
against a well-respected officer of the court
without probable cause?

36:44.040 --> 36:45.832
I don't know, Dexter.

36:45.958 --> 36:48.084
I... I can't do nothing.

36:48.211 --> 36:49.961
Not after these results.

36:51.589 --> 36:53.590
Maybe you could sit on it.

36:54.675 --> 36:57.552
For a while. Let Miguel think...

36:57.678 --> 36:59.554
he got away with murder.

37:02.892 --> 37:04.935
It'd give you time to build a solid case.

37:09.190 --> 37:12.192
I've got some serious
soul-searching to do.

37:12.944 --> 37:15.028
Take as long as you need.

37:15.154 --> 37:16.988
Thanks for your help, Dexter.

37:17.114 --> 37:18.615
Yeah.

37:22.453 --> 37:25.705
(Dexter) While LaGuerta's deciding,
I'll be eliminating her problem.

37:25.831 --> 37:29.626
And George King's going to help me.
I'll copy his MO.

37:29.752 --> 37:31.544
They won't even look for another suspect.

37:31.671 --> 37:33.129
What happened?

37:33.256 --> 37:34.381
(Quinn) King.

37:34.507 --> 37:38.802
I told him to go home, but he's hellbent
on proving he has cojones of steel.

37:39.845 --> 37:42.389
- You good?
- Superficial cut. Let's keep moving.

37:42.515 --> 37:45.642
All right, get me your report
as soon as you can.

37:45.768 --> 37:48.478
The brass is gonna be asking questions.

37:48.604 --> 37:52.607
We had aerial surveillance,
a security perimeter, at least 50 officers.

37:52.733 --> 37:54.734
It's like George King is a ghost.

37:54.860 --> 37:56.820
Sorry, Sarge.

37:56.946 --> 38:01.908
I'm not. I need King out there long enough
to peg Miguel's murder on him.

38:02.034 --> 38:03.868
How long have you known?

38:03.995 --> 38:05.370
Huh?

38:05.496 --> 38:07.872
About Dad and his CI.

38:10.835 --> 38:14.170
Uh...couple of weeks.

38:15.381 --> 38:18.300
Camilla told me right before she died.

38:19.385 --> 38:21.386
- I didn't know if I should...
- Tell me?

38:21.512 --> 38:23.888
Yes, whenever you have
an earth-shattering, ball-crushing,

38:24.015 --> 38:27.017
mind-fuck of a secret,
you should tell your fucking sister.

38:29.353 --> 38:30.687
Sorry.

38:31.689 --> 38:34.024
(Cellphone vibrates)

38:34.150 --> 38:36.234
You can get that now.

38:38.779 --> 38:42.198
Rita wants to know
if you're bringing Anton to the wedding.

38:44.910 --> 38:46.161
Bad timing.

38:48.748 --> 38:51.082
No, I'm not bringing him.

38:52.835 --> 38:56.504
Quinn sort of asked
if I would go as his date, but...

38:57.548 --> 39:00.717
as much as I'll hate going stag
to my own brother's wedding...

39:01.761 --> 39:04.512
being Quinn's date
depresses me even more.

39:04.638 --> 39:06.890
He seems OK.

39:08.267 --> 39:10.435
Yeah, he's fine.

39:10.561 --> 39:12.604
On paper he's a cop.

39:13.481 --> 39:15.565
Good career.

39:15.691 --> 39:16.858
Like Dad.

39:16.984 --> 39:18.360
Yeah.

39:18.486 --> 39:22.906
Well, it seems I don't know Dad
as well as I thought I did.

39:23.032 --> 39:24.991
Turns out I'm just as big
a fuck-up as he was.

39:25.117 --> 39:27.702
You're not a fuck-up!

39:27.828 --> 39:32.040
You're the hardest-working person I know,
you're loyal to a fault.

39:32.166 --> 39:35.794
In all the years I've known you,
you've never let me down.

39:39.882 --> 39:42.133
You should be my best man.

39:44.220 --> 39:45.261
What?

39:46.263 --> 39:48.139
Miguel is your best man.

39:48.265 --> 39:51.935
He's not even a good man.
I shoulda asked you in the first place.

39:52.061 --> 39:53.812
So why didn't you?

39:53.938 --> 39:55.605
I don't know. I...

39:55.731 --> 39:58.024
thought the best man
was supposed to be a man.

39:58.943 --> 40:01.861
But I trust you...

40:01.987 --> 40:03.738
more than anyone.

40:05.783 --> 40:07.325
That's way more important.

40:07.451 --> 40:11.413
You better not be doing this
because you feel guilty.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.289
Would you just...

40:13.416 --> 40:15.375
stand up for me?

40:19.088 --> 40:21.214
Abso-fucking-lutely.

40:26.303 --> 40:27.262
Hey!

40:27.388 --> 40:29.597
Long time.

40:29.723 --> 40:33.309
Too busy with that new boyfriend of yours
to come down and talk shit with me?

40:33.436 --> 40:34.769
What? Word travels.

40:34.895 --> 40:36.980
Well, not fast enough.
We broke up.

40:37.106 --> 40:39.023
Hey, fuck him. His loss.

40:39.150 --> 40:41.234
Yeah, well...

40:42.319 --> 40:43.820
I kinda need a favor.

40:43.946 --> 40:45.613
That's what I'm here for.
What you need?

40:45.739 --> 40:48.867
All the records you have
on my dad's confidential informants.

40:48.993 --> 40:50.034
Your dad?

40:50.161 --> 40:51.494
I know it's a big dig,

40:51.620 --> 40:56.499
but I just need the female CIs,
and probablyjust the attractive ones.

40:57.543 --> 40:59.502
Someone said something to you...

40:59.628 --> 41:02.172
about Harry and one of his CIs?

41:02.298 --> 41:04.591
His attractive female CIs?

41:04.717 --> 41:06.301
Why, you know something?

41:06.427 --> 41:11.306
What I know is, your dad wouldn't be
the first cop to fuck around on his wife.

41:11.432 --> 41:13.683
Look, I know you have
a lot of requests, but...

41:13.809 --> 41:17.145
But nothing.
My dad stepped out on my mom.

41:17.271 --> 41:18.980
Woulda cut off his dick if I coulda.

41:20.691 --> 41:23.568
- I'll put a rush on it.
- Thank you.

41:24.403 --> 41:25.695
(Chuckling)

41:33.412 --> 41:36.164
Miguel's a night owl
and a newly minted bachelor,

41:36.290 --> 41:38.374
no way he's in bed this early.

41:40.544 --> 41:43.087
(Miguel) Are you kidding me?
I'm not going to sleep.

41:43.214 --> 41:45.215
(Laughter)

41:47.176 --> 41:49.427
The way the Prados
are knocking them back,

41:49.553 --> 41:53.932
they're not going anywhere soon.
Just as well, I have some stalking to do.

41:54.058 --> 41:55.683
(Woman over phone)
Hotel Belvedere.

41:55.809 --> 41:58.770
- Miguel Prado, please.
- Yes, sir. I'll connect you right away.

42:02.608 --> 42:04.234
(Phone ringing)

42:08.197 --> 42:10.240
(Ringing gets louder)

42:10.950 --> 42:12.492
(Dexter) Got it.

42:12.618 --> 42:14.661
(Cellphone beeps, ringing stops)

42:18.832 --> 42:20.458
Excuse me.

42:20.584 --> 42:23.294
- Sí?
- Could I get a turndown service?

42:23.420 --> 42:25.004
- Room 138.
- Mm-hm.

42:26.799 --> 42:28.216
Thanks.

42:35.558 --> 42:37.141
Hello?

42:37.268 --> 42:39.310
Yeah.

42:39.436 --> 42:41.604
I-I'm sorry,
you're breaking up.

42:41.730 --> 42:43.856
Can I call you back on a landline?

42:43.983 --> 42:45.400
OK, bye.

42:45.526 --> 42:47.402
I'm sorry, that's my boss.

42:47.528 --> 42:49.070
Can you come back later?

42:49.196 --> 42:50.196
Oh, sí.

42:50.322 --> 42:52.657
- Gracias.
- De nada, señor.

43:00.791 --> 43:04.711
(Dexter) I can park right there, use this
as my point of entry and make the grab.

43:04.837 --> 43:06.796
I'm in and out undetected.

43:12.428 --> 43:14.429
A life vest? Shit.

43:14.555 --> 43:18.516
He's been back to that hardware store.
He's planning to kill again.

43:26.483 --> 43:30.570
Fucking Miguel and his innocent victims.
That's why he's at the bar.

43:30.696 --> 43:34.866
Get Ramon blackout drunk so Miguel
can claim he was here the whole time.

43:35.951 --> 43:37.619
Tonight's the night.

44:13.030 --> 44:14.614
Maria?

44:39.723 --> 44:41.808
(Answer machine beeping)

44:52.695 --> 44:56.531
Lieutenant, Dexter here. Hey, I came across
something you'll be interested in.

44:56.657 --> 44:59.742
Kinda has to do with the whole
Miguel Prado, Ellen Wolf thing

44:59.868 --> 45:02.245
you wanted me to look at.
You there?

45:02.371 --> 45:03.788
We should meet.

45:03.914 --> 45:07.458
I'll be at the Rising Moon Café
at 91st and Channel at 8pm.

45:07.584 --> 45:09.335
Uh...I'll try your cell.

45:29.273 --> 45:31.315
(Grunts)

45:32.067 --> 45:33.651
Jesus!

45:33.777 --> 45:35.278
(Dexter) Finally.

45:46.498 --> 45:48.666
No, no, no, no, man.

45:50.461 --> 45:52.462
Oh, God.

45:57.009 --> 45:58.676
Maria.

45:58.802 --> 46:00.678
Oh.

46:05.225 --> 46:07.226
OK.

46:07.352 --> 46:09.145
OK, OK, I know...

46:09.271 --> 46:11.022
I know I...

46:11.148 --> 46:14.692
I crossed the line here.
I know that now.

46:16.278 --> 46:18.571
It doesn't have to come to this.

46:18.697 --> 46:20.907
But it always does.

46:21.992 --> 46:24.660
I had higher hopes for you, for us.

46:27.623 --> 46:31.083
But I finallyjust have to accept it,
I'll always be alone.

46:31.210 --> 46:32.543
That's not true.

46:33.420 --> 46:35.254
You talking truth? That's good.

46:37.049 --> 46:40.551
You actually had me believing
I could have a friend...

46:41.553 --> 46:44.430
cause I swallowed your bullshit.

46:44.556 --> 46:46.098
It wasn't bullshit!

46:46.225 --> 46:47.475
- (Gags)
- Shh.

46:51.522 --> 46:53.272
I tried.

46:54.358 --> 46:57.860
I tried to crack that damn armor of yours.

46:59.655 --> 47:02.031
Because I saw the possibility.

47:02.157 --> 47:04.116
I still see the possibilities.

47:04.243 --> 47:06.702
So this is my fault
for being a shutdown?

47:06.829 --> 47:08.913
No, I just want you to let me in!

47:10.374 --> 47:12.458
Why the fuck would I do that now?

47:15.045 --> 47:16.712
Because I know you.

47:16.839 --> 47:19.257
Dexter, I know you better than anyone else.

47:19.383 --> 47:23.052
No, there've been quite a few
who've seen the real me as they...

47:24.429 --> 47:26.264
laid on that table.

47:26.390 --> 47:28.224
You're all just...

47:28.350 --> 47:30.893
unchecked versions of myself...

47:32.104 --> 47:34.605
what I would have become
without my father's code.

47:34.731 --> 47:36.649
They deserved it!

47:36.775 --> 47:38.818
I'm not like them!

47:38.944 --> 47:40.194
You are.

47:40.320 --> 47:41.362
Admit it.

47:42.698 --> 47:45.741
- I'm like you.
- No. No. No, no, no, no.

47:45.868 --> 47:48.411
I know I'm a monster.

47:49.746 --> 47:50.913
I accept you.

47:54.459 --> 47:57.712
I accept you, Dexter, like a brother.

47:58.463 --> 48:00.298
I killed my brother.

48:05.387 --> 48:07.471
I killed yours too.

48:12.561 --> 48:14.645
Oscar?

48:16.773 --> 48:17.857
You?

48:17.983 --> 48:21.485
I didn't plan to,
but it was kill or be killed.

48:22.321 --> 48:23.696
You!

48:24.990 --> 48:27.241
You killed Oscar!

48:27.367 --> 48:29.410
What did you say...

48:30.245 --> 48:32.330
in your bachelor party speech?

48:33.498 --> 48:36.083
Friends are always honest.

48:38.712 --> 48:45.217
Friends forgive.

48:46.970 --> 48:49.013
But I don't forgive you.

48:58.482 --> 49:00.733
And I don't get to have friends.

49:06.239 --> 49:07.406
You little freak!

49:07.532 --> 49:09.283
You think I'm done with you?

49:09.409 --> 49:11.369
You think this ends here?

49:11.495 --> 49:12.745
It doesn't!

49:12.871 --> 49:14.789
It does for you.

49:15.540 --> 49:17.291
(Gagging)

49:18.877 --> 49:20.252
(Squelch)

49:39.606 --> 49:42.233
(Dexter) Adiós, amigo.
