WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:03.424
Previously on Dexter.

00:03.550 --> 00:06.802
(Dexter) I can honestly say I know
who Miguel Prado really is.

00:06.928 --> 00:08.137
My first good friend.

00:08.263 --> 00:09.972
(Miguel) We need to go after
the root cause.

00:10.098 --> 00:13.308
Blood-sucking, soulless
defense attorney Ellen Wolf!

00:13.435 --> 00:15.436
Walk in the park
to discredit you, Counselor.

00:15.562 --> 00:16.812
- Try it.
- Oh, I'm not the one on trial.

00:16.938 --> 00:18.647
- Oh, you should be.
- You should be!

00:18.773 --> 00:20.941
(Dexter) This is personal.
(Miguel) Fuck yes, this is personal.

00:21.067 --> 00:22.484
And it should be personal for you too.

00:22.610 --> 00:24.653
As my friend.
I'm asking you to do this for me.

00:24.779 --> 00:26.321
- Sorry, no.
- Well, then fuck you!

00:26.448 --> 00:29.158
(Harry) Miguel went missing last night.
Ellen's missing this morning.

00:29.284 --> 00:31.618
I hope she didn't get
in an accident or something.

00:31.745 --> 00:34.163
(Dexter) He did it. Miguel really did it.

00:34.289 --> 00:35.664
Wow. I didn't get it before, Miguel,

00:35.790 --> 00:38.917
but you can't be reasoned with,
guilted, controlled.

00:39.044 --> 00:41.920
This whole back-and-forth game
for leverage is pointless.

00:42.047 --> 00:45.132
That's right! I'll do what I want,
when I want,

00:45.258 --> 00:48.385
to whomever I want! Count on it!

00:49.471 --> 00:50.554
Yes, we will marry you.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.139
(Dexter) You should be my best man.

00:52.265 --> 00:55.059
- What?
- I trust you more than anyone.

00:55.185 --> 00:58.312
Why are you running your mouth about
family business to a goddamn stranger?

00:58.438 --> 01:00.064
Dexter is not the problem here.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.857
Better keep your fucking
hands off of me, pendejo.

01:01.983 --> 01:03.108
(Dexter) Ellen Wolf's ring.

01:03.234 --> 01:05.486
(LaGuerta) Ellen Wolf was threatening
to wreck his career.

01:05.612 --> 01:08.822
He has a black SUV and no alibi
for the night she died.

01:08.948 --> 01:10.908
You think Miguel had something
to do with her murder?

01:11.034 --> 01:13.827
(LaGuerta) I found this sample
in the back of his car.

01:13.953 --> 01:16.705
(Dexter) While LaGuerta's deciding,
I'll be eliminating her problem.

01:16.831 --> 01:18.582
And George King's going to help me.

01:18.708 --> 01:21.877
I'll copy his MO. They won't even look
for another suspect.

01:22.003 --> 01:24.963
I am this close to getting my shield,
and I'm putting it all at risk to be with you!

01:25.090 --> 01:26.048
Then, Debra, why are you?!

01:26.174 --> 01:29.009
I need for you
to seriously think about us.

01:29.135 --> 01:31.887
You've had a bug up your ass
about Dad for months now.

01:32.013 --> 01:34.098
He didn't cheat on Mom.

01:34.849 --> 01:37.601
- Bullshit. Who?
- A CI.

01:38.770 --> 01:41.897
Laura Moser. My mother.

01:42.023 --> 01:42.981
I kinda need a favor.

01:43.108 --> 01:44.691
That's what I'm here for.
What do you need?

01:44.818 --> 01:47.069
All the records you have on my
dad's confidential informants.

01:47.195 --> 01:48.946
The Skinner. George King.

01:49.072 --> 01:51.657
The Nicaraguan embassy
is still giving me the run-around.

01:51.783 --> 01:54.576
Until we know King's true identity,
there's not much to go on.

01:54.702 --> 01:58.330
You need to have a long conversation
with Dexter Morgan.

01:59.499 --> 02:01.708
You think I'm done with you?
You think this ends here?

02:01.835 --> 02:03.752
It doesn't!

02:03.878 --> 02:05.003
It does for you.

04:13.258 --> 04:15.217
(Dexter) There are few milestones in life

04:15.343 --> 04:19.096
that evoke a stronger response
than our final act.

04:19.222 --> 04:20.722
Death.

05:02.432 --> 05:06.935
What was once moving, speaking,
killing and threatening

05:07.061 --> 05:10.564
becomes nothing
but an empty vessel,

05:10.690 --> 05:13.400
which is not so different
from how I've always felt.

05:13.526 --> 05:17.571
Several patches of skin
removed from the, uh, shoulder area.

05:17.697 --> 05:19.489
Ligature marks on the neck.

05:19.615 --> 05:22.743
Why the fuck would the Skinner
wanna kill Miguel Prado?

05:22.869 --> 05:24.453
Miguel was after Freebo.

05:24.579 --> 05:26.788
King had to figure
he knew something.

05:28.875 --> 05:32.544
We all react
in different ways to death.

05:32.670 --> 05:35.672
Some, like Ramon, choose anger.

05:35.798 --> 05:38.258
Others cling to ritual.

05:40.178 --> 05:43.764
Dex, I know he was your friend,

05:43.890 --> 05:47.476
so if you wanna
take a pass on this...

05:47.602 --> 05:49.269
Nah, that's all right. I got it.

05:49.395 --> 05:53.774
Me, I'll play the grieving friend
who buries himself in his work.

06:08.456 --> 06:11.750
You can tell a lot about a person
by the friends he keeps.

06:14.587 --> 06:18.507
And this is my best friend.

06:26.766 --> 06:29.017
Goodbye, Miguel.

06:29.143 --> 06:33.188
Don't fucking
touch my brother.

06:33.314 --> 06:35.315
Let go of my arm.

06:37.985 --> 06:39.569
Now.

06:39.695 --> 06:41.321
Come here.

06:42.990 --> 06:46.743
I am going to find out
why this happened.

06:46.869 --> 06:48.829
We all want the same thing, Ramon.

07:06.097 --> 07:07.931
(Sighs)

07:08.057 --> 07:09.516
That was awkward.

07:09.642 --> 07:13.186
I don't think I've ever been
asked to leave a funeral before.

07:13.312 --> 07:16.523
Ramon didn't ask you to leave.
He pushed you out the door.

07:16.649 --> 07:18.275
Yeah, he was drunk.

07:18.401 --> 07:20.527
I could smell the fumes.

07:20.653 --> 07:22.737
He's just so angry.

07:22.864 --> 07:24.906
He's lost two brothers.

07:25.032 --> 07:27.075
He doesn't know who to blame.

07:27.201 --> 07:28.785
Well, certainly not you.

07:28.911 --> 07:31.538
(Dexter) No, certainly not me.

07:31.664 --> 07:33.748
Hey.

07:33.875 --> 07:36.126
How you handling this?

07:37.336 --> 07:41.047
Oh, you know,
a lot of different emotions.

07:41.174 --> 07:44.593
I know Miguel wasn't
the man you thought he was.

07:44.719 --> 07:46.178
But you lost a friend.

07:47.221 --> 07:49.389
You don't have to be so strong.

07:49.515 --> 07:51.516
Can't help it.

07:53.394 --> 07:55.562
Oh, poor Syl.

07:55.688 --> 07:59.774
- She has so much to deal with.
- I can only imagine.

07:59.901 --> 08:02.486
She insists we go through
with the wedding. She still wants to come

08:02.612 --> 08:04.613
- to the rehearsal dinner tomorrow night.
- Yeah...

08:04.739 --> 08:07.073
life goes on.

08:10.703 --> 08:12.954
From your mother?

08:13.080 --> 08:15.165
Mm. She's not coming down.

08:15.291 --> 08:18.502
She started teaching again
and can't miss class.

08:19.587 --> 08:22.214
- Too bad.
- That's my loving mother.

08:24.217 --> 08:27.928
"Let's hope the third one's the charm."
What's that mean?

08:29.222 --> 08:31.306
Mm.

08:31.432 --> 08:33.099
The kid.

08:33.226 --> 08:35.352
The third kid is the charm.

08:36.854 --> 08:38.813
Cody and Astor are charms too.

08:38.940 --> 08:41.775
Like I said, that's my loving mother.

08:43.236 --> 08:44.611
Did Rita just lie to me?

08:44.737 --> 08:47.614
So have you written your vows yet?

08:48.866 --> 08:50.617
Not completely.

08:51.786 --> 08:54.287
What should I say?

08:54.413 --> 08:58.041
Well, you can talk
about togetherness,

08:58.167 --> 09:01.294
loyalty, attraction, honesty.

09:02.338 --> 09:04.798
Honesty. Right.

09:08.511 --> 09:10.512
You know, I should get home
and keep working on them.

09:10.638 --> 09:13.515
Mm. You should keep that.

09:18.729 --> 09:20.814
He gave me so much.

09:22.108 --> 09:25.694
Darling Rita,
once you were a dream and a prayer.

09:25.820 --> 09:30.073
Now our future is as bright as the sun
glinting off the morning dew.

09:30.199 --> 09:32.242
And I vow that I will...

09:33.202 --> 09:35.287
Sounds like I'm marrying a unicorn.

09:35.413 --> 09:37.998
(Cellphone rings)

10:03.941 --> 10:06.318
Excuse me, sir. You the occupant?

10:06.444 --> 10:08.445
- Yeah.
- Detective Pratt.

10:08.571 --> 10:11.448
Property manager called us.
They found your door open.

10:11.574 --> 10:12.866
Yeah, he called me too.

10:12.992 --> 10:16.119
We're gonna need you to take a good
look around and see what's missing.

10:16.245 --> 10:18.038
(Chuckles)

10:19.707 --> 10:21.124
It's kinda hard to tell.

10:21.250 --> 10:22.751
(Pratt) Your neighbor, a Ms. Levin,

10:22.877 --> 10:24.878
saw someone hanging
around the mailboxes.

10:25.004 --> 10:27.881
Latin, kinda burly, goatee.
Ring any bells?

10:28.007 --> 10:30.592
Ramon Prado.

10:30.718 --> 10:32.302
No.

10:48.027 --> 10:50.028
Thanks. Let me know
if you find out anything.

10:50.154 --> 10:52.072
You got it. Thank you.

11:02.375 --> 11:04.000
(Sighs)

11:11.592 --> 11:14.886
Miguel warned you that his death
wasn't gonna be the end of things.

11:15.971 --> 11:19.391
So his plan was to make me
hire a housekeeper?

11:21.602 --> 11:25.438
Your suit for the wedding.
That's personal.

11:29.443 --> 11:32.362
Ramon Prado's
like a gut-shot animal.

11:32.488 --> 11:34.572
You know what to do
with a wounded animal.

11:35.616 --> 11:38.118
You put it out of its misery.

11:41.414 --> 11:43.665
I can't kill him.
He doesn't meet the code.

11:43.791 --> 11:46.501
Can't kill him.

11:46.627 --> 11:48.044
Can't ignore him.

11:57.221 --> 11:59.806
I have no intention of ignoring him.

12:05.604 --> 12:08.648
I can use the ring
to tie Miguel to Ellen Wolf's murder,

12:08.774 --> 12:12.902
threaten to destroy Ramon's
sainted brother's reputation forever.

12:13.028 --> 12:16.197
That's enough
to get Ramon to back down.

12:17.450 --> 12:19.117
Sara.

12:19.994 --> 12:21.119
Dexter?

12:22.413 --> 12:24.414
How are you?

12:24.540 --> 12:26.082
Honestly, not so great.

12:26.208 --> 12:29.210
I'm sorry, is...is Ramon in?

12:29.336 --> 12:32.589
No. He didn't come home with us
from the funeral.

12:32.715 --> 12:34.716
Doesn't answer his cell.

12:34.842 --> 12:37.677
He's been on a bender, Dexter.
I have no idea where he is.

12:37.803 --> 12:39.721
Oh.

12:39.847 --> 12:42.098
I'm really worried about him.

12:42.224 --> 12:45.393
If you hear from him,
will you let him know I stopped by?

12:52.943 --> 12:56.279
Ramon's blood family
doesn't know where he is.

12:58.491 --> 13:00.241
Maybe his bIue family does.

13:04.205 --> 13:06.080
(Ringing tone)

13:06.207 --> 13:07.916
(Woman) Morning. Sheriff's Department.

13:08.042 --> 13:11.085
Yeah, could you put me through
to Sergeant Jessie Whitaker, please?

13:11.212 --> 13:12.378
One moment, please.

13:12.505 --> 13:14.798
(♪ Hold music)

13:18.219 --> 13:21.596
(Dexter) Gail Brandon.
Future mother-in-law.

13:21.722 --> 13:26.059
While I'm waiting, I may as well
check into my new partner.

13:27.603 --> 13:31.105
(Woman) Sergeant Whitaker's in the field.
Would you like to leave a message?

13:31.232 --> 13:34.150
Uh, this is sort of important.
I'm with Miami Metro Homicide.

13:34.276 --> 13:37.278
- You think you can track him down?
- Please hold.

13:37.404 --> 13:39.030
(♪ Hold music)

13:39.156 --> 13:42.617
(Dexter) Before she left Michigan,
Rita Bennett would have been

13:42.743 --> 13:46.704
Rita...Brandon.

13:49.416 --> 13:51.209
Ackerman.

13:51.335 --> 13:53.586
PauI Bennett
wasn't her first husband.

13:53.712 --> 13:57.048
She was married before, at 16.

13:58.717 --> 14:03.471
Ending in a divorce six months later.
An impetuous teen marriage.

14:03.597 --> 14:06.808
Which makes me her third husband.

14:06.934 --> 14:09.143
The charm.

14:09.270 --> 14:12.647
The brass is giving us a blank check
as far as overtime is concerned

14:12.773 --> 14:14.607
until this man is in custody.

14:14.733 --> 14:16.359
Jorge Orozco.

14:16.485 --> 14:18.695
AKA George King.

14:18.821 --> 14:22.782
Affectionately known back home
as el Fierro, the Blade.

14:22.908 --> 14:25.827
Orozco was a captain
in the Resistencia Nicaragüense.

14:25.953 --> 14:29.080
The Contras.
He headed an interrogation unit.

14:29.206 --> 14:31.207
He tortured people for a living.

14:34.211 --> 14:35.670
And killed them.

14:35.796 --> 14:38.256
Now this already was a big case.

14:39.717 --> 14:44.679
With Miguel Prado's murder,
it's officially huge.

14:44.805 --> 14:46.347
(♪ Hold music)

14:46.473 --> 14:48.182
- (Click)
- This is Whitaker.

14:48.309 --> 14:53.605
Hi, my name is Dexter Morgan. I'm trying to
track down your old partner Ramon Prado.

14:53.731 --> 14:55.356
Why?

14:55.482 --> 14:57.692
I'm a family friend.

14:57.818 --> 15:00.278
Sara told me he's been missing
since his brother's funeral.

15:00.404 --> 15:03.114
I figured with his problem and all...

15:03.240 --> 15:05.450
Gotcha.

15:05.576 --> 15:08.036
Actually, I haven't seen him
since he left.

15:08.162 --> 15:10.705
I know a few places
he used to hang out at.

15:10.831 --> 15:13.166
I mean, basically any bar
within a ten-mile radius.

15:13.292 --> 15:15.627
I can give you a few
of his favorites, if you like.

15:15.753 --> 15:17.545
I'm sure Sara would appreciate that.

15:17.671 --> 15:19.839
Yeah, I'm sure.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.426
(Dexter) I'd love to help them
with George King,

15:23.552 --> 15:27.305
but I've got a more pressing
situation to deal with -

15:27.431 --> 15:29.557
Miguel's wounded messenger.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.061
Morgan...a minute?

15:33.187 --> 15:35.438
Sure, Sarge.

15:40.861 --> 15:43.738
So it took a couple of months
and a lot of wrangling,

15:43.864 --> 15:45.865
but my budget request
finally came through.

15:45.991 --> 15:48.826
Homicide is gonna get
a little extra money.

15:48.953 --> 15:51.996
Oh, that's great. We should get
one of those crime-sight imagers.

15:52.122 --> 15:54.082
Have you seen 'em?
Their pictures are amazing.

15:54.208 --> 15:55.667
Really?

15:55.793 --> 15:57.919
I mean, that's what you'd spend it on?

15:58.045 --> 16:01.297
Cause I was thinking maybe we'd spend it
on adding another detective to our squad.

16:01.423 --> 16:03.091
Oh.

16:03.884 --> 16:08.388
Maybe somebody
who saved the life of a CI

16:08.514 --> 16:10.682
who ID'd our Skinner.

16:12.393 --> 16:14.185
Ohh.

16:14.311 --> 16:16.270
Uh...

16:17.439 --> 16:20.274
I don't know what to say,
I mean, wow.

16:20.401 --> 16:21.609
Thank you.

16:21.735 --> 16:24.612
I put in the recommendation
to Lieutenant LaGuerta.

16:24.738 --> 16:26.322
She's just gotta sign the paperwork.

16:26.448 --> 16:29.075
Oh, fuck.
Thank you, thank you.

16:29.201 --> 16:32.286
We could use a little joy around here.
Good work.

16:32.413 --> 16:34.247
Thank you.

16:41.839 --> 16:43.631
I got it.

16:43.757 --> 16:45.550
I'm guessing "it"
is something good?

16:45.676 --> 16:47.176
My detective shield.

16:47.302 --> 16:49.303
Oh, big news.

16:49.430 --> 16:52.682
It's gigantic news. All LaGuerta has to do
is sign the papers and I'm golden.

16:52.808 --> 16:54.267
Well, I'm silver.

16:54.393 --> 16:56.853
- We should celebrate.
- Yeah, come on.

16:56.979 --> 16:59.772
I mean later. I gotta pick up the kids,
go to the tailor's...

16:59.898 --> 17:01.315
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

17:02.359 --> 17:04.444
You know, Dad would be proud.

17:07.156 --> 17:10.199
That still means something,
no matter how flawed he was.

17:10.784 --> 17:12.827
Yeah, look at us.

17:12.953 --> 17:14.829
You're getting married.

17:14.955 --> 17:17.707
I'm making detective.

17:17.833 --> 17:21.836
The Morgans
are gonna be all right.

17:21.962 --> 17:25.131
- I'll see you at the rehearsal dinner.
- OK.

17:29.887 --> 17:31.637
Yo, Francis.

17:33.223 --> 17:35.600
Any progress
on my dad's CI files?

17:35.726 --> 17:38.102
Ooh, he knew a lot of folks,
I'll give him that.

17:38.228 --> 17:39.312
Anyone of interest?

17:39.438 --> 17:41.898
I haven't culled through everything yet.

17:42.024 --> 17:46.319
Are you sure you want me to?
Some things are better left in a box.

17:46.445 --> 17:48.112
I just...

17:49.239 --> 17:51.491
I need to put a face on her.

17:51.617 --> 17:54.702
Knowing all the details
isn't gonna change the fact

17:54.828 --> 17:57.538
that he was messing around on the sly.

17:57.664 --> 18:00.208
I know.

18:00.334 --> 18:02.460
I'll send 'em up as soon as I can.

18:02.586 --> 18:04.337
Thank you, Francis.

18:08.634 --> 18:11.511
Dexter. I need a word.

18:18.060 --> 18:20.895
The city council has voted
to name the freeway interchange

18:21.021 --> 18:22.980
near my house after Miguel Prado.

18:23.107 --> 18:26.442
I drive that way every single day.

18:26.568 --> 18:29.320
He was a hero.

18:29.446 --> 18:30.613
To some.

18:30.739 --> 18:32.406
He was a cold-blooded killer.

18:32.533 --> 18:35.034
He murdered my friend,
and now he's got an interchange?

18:36.829 --> 18:39.247
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:39.373 --> 18:43.459
But you're the only other person
who knows the truth.

18:45.379 --> 18:48.923
Maybe it's time
we let others in on the secret.

18:49.049 --> 18:52.552
There is nothing to link Miguel
to Ellen Wolf's murder

18:52.678 --> 18:55.513
except evidence that was obtained
illegally, and therefore inadmissible.

18:55.639 --> 18:58.766
I'll find something.
I'll tear his life apart if I have to.

18:58.892 --> 19:02.520
He doesn't have a life any more.
It's his family you'd have to tear apart.

19:02.646 --> 19:04.897
The community.
The Cuban community.

19:05.023 --> 19:08.901
And you still might not be able
to prove anything.

19:11.029 --> 19:13.823
So I just keep it a secret.

19:16.910 --> 19:19.662
I hate secrets.

19:19.788 --> 19:21.038
We all have them.

19:23.167 --> 19:25.209
Well, then tell me, Dexter.

19:26.420 --> 19:28.921
How am I supposed
to live with this?

19:31.884 --> 19:34.635
You just do.

19:34.761 --> 19:38.431
Can I get an everything burrito
and a side of beans,

19:38.557 --> 19:40.391
maybe a little bit of...

19:40.517 --> 19:42.727
Anton.

19:42.853 --> 19:44.228
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:44.354 --> 19:45.771
- You're here.
- Yeah.

19:45.898 --> 19:47.899
Yeah, I was just, um, picking up
some things from evidence.

19:48.025 --> 19:49.442
My wallet, watch, chapstick.

19:49.568 --> 19:52.486
- I could've brought that to you.
- No, it's cool. It's cool, I got it.

19:54.072 --> 19:56.616
- So how you doing?
- I'm all right.

19:56.742 --> 19:58.826
- Good.
- Oh, but...

19:58.952 --> 20:00.828
Looks like I'm gonna get
my detective shield.

20:01.955 --> 20:04.582
- Debra, wow, that's great. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

20:04.708 --> 20:06.334
That's good. That's good.

20:06.460 --> 20:07.627
- You wanna get some co...
- I should probably go.

20:07.753 --> 20:09.170
OK.

20:09.296 --> 20:12.590
- I'll see ya.
- I'll see you.

20:22.517 --> 20:25.269
I stopped at four bars,
got a new appreciation

20:25.395 --> 20:28.147
for how many alcoholics
there are in Miami.

20:28.273 --> 20:30.274
But still no Ramon.

20:40.911 --> 20:42.453
Morgan.

20:42.579 --> 20:44.205
What's up?

20:48.752 --> 20:53.047
I just found out from the ADA's office
that they're requesting logs

20:53.173 --> 20:55.174
from the Anton Briggs
surveillance detail.

20:55.300 --> 20:58.636
Now, I didn't know why
until I read 'em.

21:00.013 --> 21:02.515
You slept with our key witness?

21:03.642 --> 21:07.270
- The ADA's looking into it?
- Miguel Prado was.

21:07.396 --> 21:11.899
I don't know what the status
of it is now, but it's a conflict,

21:12.025 --> 21:14.360
and you should have
given me the heads up.

21:15.821 --> 21:19.740
Especially before I sent my recommendation
to LaGuerta for your shield.

21:19.866 --> 21:23.035
- You're gonna spike it now?
- LaGuerta has final say.

21:23.954 --> 21:25.746
But she deserves full disclosure.

21:27.749 --> 21:29.500
Disclosure? Really, Sarge?

21:29.626 --> 21:33.796
Did you disclose that you met Gianna
because you were out strolling for a hooker?

21:35.382 --> 21:38.592
- Where did you hear that?
- I...

21:39.636 --> 21:43.097
- Where'd you hear that?
- I know someone in Vice.

21:43.223 --> 21:46.600
I'm the only one that knows, I think.
It's not even that big of a deal.

21:46.727 --> 21:50.062
Fuck, fuck! I am sorry. I'm sorry.

21:54.401 --> 21:56.819
It's just my chickens
coming home to roost.

21:59.573 --> 22:02.742
Oh, fuck, fuck.

22:12.419 --> 22:15.963
I met Detective Gianna
while seeking the comfort of prostitutes.

22:16.089 --> 22:17.340
Excuse me?

22:17.466 --> 22:19.467
I propositioned her.

22:19.593 --> 22:21.969
She revealed to me to be police.

22:22.095 --> 22:24.388
She had mercy on me.
She let me off with a warning.

22:24.514 --> 22:26.640
It was a dark time for me.

22:26.767 --> 22:29.769
I completely understand
if you wanna pursue a case against me.

22:30.645 --> 22:32.605
As cases go,

22:32.731 --> 22:35.941
laying you out for thinking with your dick
is pretty low on my list of priorities.

22:36.068 --> 22:38.694
Actually, I was looking
for simple human connection.

22:39.946 --> 22:41.781
No. Right.

22:41.907 --> 22:43.449
You're right.

22:44.493 --> 22:47.328
We all have secrets
we prefer not to share, Angel.

22:47.454 --> 22:49.038
Skeletons.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.585
Feel free to keep yours in the closet.
Deep in the closet.

22:54.711 --> 22:56.545
- Thanks, Maria.
- Mm-hm.

22:57.714 --> 23:01.509
There's something else you should hear
from me instead of the grapevine.

23:01.635 --> 23:04.011
Angel, how dark of a time was this?

23:04.137 --> 23:07.681
It's regarding my recommendation
of Debra Morgan for detective.

23:27.411 --> 23:30.955
(Astor) So, when you and mom
get married, what should we call you?

23:31.081 --> 23:33.958
Um, I think Mr. Handsome
would be a good name.

23:34.084 --> 23:35.668
(Both giggle)

23:40.006 --> 23:41.465
Is that you, Ramon?

23:41.591 --> 23:43.592
Uh, you can call me whatever you want.

23:44.553 --> 23:46.387
I think we'll just call you Dexter.

23:46.513 --> 23:48.597
That sounds good.

23:53.145 --> 23:55.938
Following me with kids in my car?

23:56.064 --> 23:58.023
Now you're just pissing me off.

24:02.737 --> 24:03.904
Moment of truth.

24:04.030 --> 24:07.074
- Stop or get a ticket, asshole.
- (Engine roars)

24:08.368 --> 24:09.660
(Horn honks)

24:13.206 --> 24:14.915
Did you see that, Dexter?

24:15.041 --> 24:18.377
Yeah, that's what happens
when drivers do stupid things.

24:29.139 --> 24:32.141
Looks like he's OK enough
to walk away.

24:34.144 --> 24:36.770
Until I get a hold of him.

24:36.897 --> 24:39.690
(Rita) This is gonna be a nice dinner.

24:39.816 --> 24:41.775
Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

24:41.902 --> 24:44.945
Just doing what grooms
are supposed to do.

24:45.071 --> 24:47.781
So how are you coming along
with your vows?

24:47.908 --> 24:49.825
Still working on 'em.

24:49.951 --> 24:51.952
I'm going to lob this in nice and easy.

24:52.078 --> 24:54.330
What kind of vows did you do
the first time around?

24:54.456 --> 24:56.665
The first time?

24:56.791 --> 25:00.044
Well, Paul and I just recited
whatever the pastor said.

25:00.170 --> 25:02.796
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

25:02.923 --> 25:05.216
Maitre d' said we'd be seated
in 15 minutes.

25:12.766 --> 25:15.392
Un-fucking-believable.

25:16.436 --> 25:18.604
Ramon, why don't we go outside
and talk about this?

25:18.730 --> 25:20.731
Fuck you. You don't tell me what to do.

25:20.857 --> 25:22.858
Look, these people
have nothing to do with this.

25:22.984 --> 25:25.069
This is between you and me, right?

25:25.195 --> 25:28.906
I should put a bullet in your head.
In front of everybody.

25:29.032 --> 25:32.201
So they can see
what it's like to lose someone.

25:35.872 --> 25:39.500
Ramon. Come on, you need to put
the gun down before anyone gets hurt.

25:39.626 --> 25:40.876
(Debra) Freeze, asshole.

25:41.002 --> 25:43.003
Ohh! Aah!

25:43.129 --> 25:46.298
Ohh! Uhh! Get your hands off of me!

25:46.424 --> 25:50.261
I will, as soon as I get
some of your sheriff buddies down here!

25:56.685 --> 25:57.935
Thank you.

25:59.813 --> 26:01.105
They all say the same thing.

26:01.231 --> 26:04.400
"King was a very polite gardener.
I can't believe he's the Skinner."

26:04.526 --> 26:06.527
I hate polite killers.

26:06.653 --> 26:09.238
I heard you took down
Ramon Prado last night. Again.

26:09.364 --> 26:11.740
- Yeah, the Prados must love me.
- (Phone rings)

26:11.866 --> 26:13.576
Morgan.

26:13.702 --> 26:15.160
You gonna eat that?

26:15.287 --> 26:16.745
Not any more, thanks.

26:16.871 --> 26:18.622
That was Robbery.

26:18.748 --> 26:21.542
There was a hit-and-run
fender bender involving a stolen car.

26:21.668 --> 26:24.336
Traffic enforcement caught
the guy's face. Guess who.

26:25.839 --> 26:27.881
They're sending a photo over right now.

26:32.053 --> 26:35.764
(Quinn) George fucking King.
(Debra) God, that's definitely him.

26:35.890 --> 26:37.600
Robbery's sending the car in right now.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.768
I'll grab my kit.
We'll tear that car apart.

27:01.166 --> 27:03.459
By the book, Mr. Morgan.

27:03.585 --> 27:06.670
If you need us,
we're right outside, Lieutenant.

27:06.796 --> 27:08.589
Thanks.

27:12.093 --> 27:14.303
- How's it feel, Ramon?
- How the fuck does what feel?

27:14.429 --> 27:16.889
Wake up sober
for the first time in a week.

27:17.015 --> 27:19.141
- Like shit.
- Yeah, that shit's called reality.

27:19.267 --> 27:21.310
It's gonna be life
as you know it for a long time.

27:21.436 --> 27:24.271
I'm gonna be outta here
in a couple of days.

27:29.444 --> 27:31.987
One last coupon from your
famous brother's reputation.

27:32.113 --> 27:33.280
Something like that.

27:33.406 --> 27:35.824
So you don't really have to bother
with reality. That must be nice.

27:35.950 --> 27:38.452
You know what
my fucking reality is?

27:38.578 --> 27:41.080
Miguel takes me on as a bodyguard,
and I ask him why.

27:41.206 --> 27:43.290
You know what he says?

27:43.416 --> 27:46.752
To protect him from you.

27:48.922 --> 27:50.589
Did he say why?

27:50.715 --> 27:52.299
No.

27:53.885 --> 27:57.054
The only one Miguel needed
protection from was himself.

27:57.180 --> 27:58.972
- Hmm.
- The man was paranoid.

27:59.099 --> 28:00.974
- That's not true.
- That's true.

28:01.101 --> 28:03.936
You know it as well as I do.

28:04.062 --> 28:06.689
Look, I spent a lot of time
with your brother, but it wasn't 24/7.

28:06.815 --> 28:11.318
I don't know what he was up to
when I wasn't around.

28:11.444 --> 28:13.112
Neither does Syl, neither do you.

28:17.033 --> 28:19.576
What I do know is this.

28:23.081 --> 28:25.040
You got a really ugly history.

28:25.166 --> 28:27.793
Kidnapping, brutality, abuse.

28:27.919 --> 28:30.546
You trashed my apartment.
You followed me.

28:30.672 --> 28:32.923
You put a gun in my face
in front of my friends,

28:33.049 --> 28:35.926
in front of my pregnant fiancée.

28:36.052 --> 28:39.638
- Why, Ramon? What's your endgame?
- To hurt you.

28:40.515 --> 28:44.852
Until you came into our life,
everything was fine.

28:44.978 --> 28:48.105
Fine like what?
Like Oscar's drug problem?

28:48.231 --> 28:50.691
Like Miguel's...darkness?

28:54.946 --> 28:56.697
What do you know about that?

28:56.823 --> 28:59.950
We were close, Miguel and I.
He told me things.

29:02.078 --> 29:04.288
He told me how he pushed
your father down the stairs

29:04.414 --> 29:06.248
to protect Oscar and you.

29:08.668 --> 29:10.002
And that he enjoyed it.

29:12.255 --> 29:14.047
He fucking told you that?

29:15.467 --> 29:17.968
It was me that did that to our father.

29:19.095 --> 29:23.348
Miguel took it from me,
made it his story.

29:23.475 --> 29:26.393
Part of his goddamn legend.

29:29.439 --> 29:31.482
Miguel always had to be the star.

29:31.608 --> 29:34.526
He got the looks,
the charm, maybe even the brains,

29:34.652 --> 29:37.112
but I got the strength.

29:37.238 --> 29:39.907
I spent my whole life
trying to hold it together,

29:40.033 --> 29:42.284
and now it's all gone to shit.

29:44.329 --> 29:46.580
- It doesn't have to.
- Bullshit.

29:47.415 --> 29:51.585
Those cases you're talking about,
the kidnapping, the brutality...

29:51.711 --> 29:54.213
that was me sweeping up
after Miguel's fuck-ups.

29:56.216 --> 30:02.137
He wasn't making my problems go away.
I was risking my ass to cover his.

30:02.263 --> 30:05.766
Hey, I know the frustration,
the disappointment

30:05.892 --> 30:08.811
of wanting to help your brother
and not being able to.

30:15.652 --> 30:17.945
Where's your son right now?

30:19.072 --> 30:20.781
Soccer practice.

30:20.907 --> 30:22.574
Your daughter?

30:26.246 --> 30:27.955
Preschool.

30:28.081 --> 30:29.957
Where do they think their father is?

30:31.584 --> 30:33.627
Sara told them something.

30:33.753 --> 30:35.420
I...I don't know.

30:36.881 --> 30:40.592
Someday your kids will be old enough
to see the truth for themselves,

30:40.718 --> 30:43.554
just like you did with your father.

30:43.680 --> 30:46.515
I know. I've been there.

30:48.434 --> 30:50.769
The sins of the father
go on and on,

30:50.895 --> 30:52.938
from kid to kid to kid,

30:53.064 --> 30:55.858
unless someone - you -

30:58.570 --> 31:00.487
...chooses to end them.

31:06.911 --> 31:08.579
(Sighs)

31:09.831 --> 31:11.707
I've been there too.

31:15.044 --> 31:18.672
You don't always have to destroy
a wounded animal.

31:18.798 --> 31:22.634
Sometimes you just
remove the thorn.

31:24.721 --> 31:26.847
Those dark lines...

31:26.973 --> 31:28.307
reticulated veins.

31:28.433 --> 31:30.350
Oh, holy shit, it is skin.

31:30.476 --> 31:32.936
No, more like...

31:33.062 --> 31:35.647
- more like leaf.
- So the only evidence we got

31:35.773 --> 31:38.150
from the car that Skinner stole
is a friggin' leaf?

31:38.276 --> 31:39.902
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

31:41.029 --> 31:43.322
Yep. Tobacco leaf.

31:45.366 --> 31:47.284
Tobacco?

31:49.287 --> 31:50.245
Fucking A, wasn't there a...

31:50.371 --> 31:52.956
King's, uh, former employer,
what was the name?

31:53.082 --> 31:55.083
Thank you, Vince.
You're welcome.

31:55.209 --> 31:57.419
Cigar company.
What was it called?

31:57.545 --> 31:58.712
Uh...

32:01.049 --> 32:02.591
El Royale Cigar Company.

32:02.717 --> 32:06.845
It's listed on the first tax form filled out
by King in 1992. Come on, let's go.

32:14.479 --> 32:16.605
- What do you think?
- It's great.

32:16.731 --> 32:18.106
Thanks for doing this so fast, Bruno.

32:18.232 --> 32:21.068
Happy to help. Now, you do that.

32:21.194 --> 32:23.028
- OK.
- And I'll get your shoes.

32:32.705 --> 32:34.873
(Harry) Remember what I taught you?

32:34.999 --> 32:36.875
How could I forget?

32:37.001 --> 32:39.044
Mom's funeral.

32:40.421 --> 32:43.465
The rabbit hops over the log.

32:45.843 --> 32:47.970
Your mother would be so proud.

32:48.096 --> 32:50.138
Both of them.

32:50.264 --> 32:54.142
The rabbit crawls under the log.

32:54.268 --> 32:57.771
The rabbit runs
around the log.

32:57.897 --> 33:01.817
One more time, because he's trying
to outsmart the fox.

33:03.111 --> 33:04.945
The rabbit...

33:05.071 --> 33:08.907
dives through his rabbit hole.

33:09.033 --> 33:20.919
Safe and sound.

33:27.301 --> 33:29.761
- What's this?
- All we got out of the cigar factory.

33:29.887 --> 33:32.431
- It was a total waste of time.
- No sign of King?

33:32.557 --> 33:36.226
The security guard's there round the clock.
No way King gets in or out.

33:41.315 --> 33:44.234
Tomorrow is my wedding day.

33:45.278 --> 33:47.362
Some men would be excited.

33:48.531 --> 33:50.657
Others panicky.

33:51.451 --> 33:53.660
Me?

33:53.786 --> 33:56.830
I feel...calm.

34:06.883 --> 34:10.343
- What are you doing here on a Saturday?
- Oh, hey.

34:10.470 --> 34:14.723
I'm just, uh, reanalyzing some
of the evidence from King's stolen car.

34:21.731 --> 34:24.357
Francis, you came through.

34:25.985 --> 34:28.111
- (Door opens)
- (LaGuerta) Morgan.

34:28.237 --> 34:30.739
Glad you're here.
I wanna talk to you.

34:30.865 --> 34:33.825
Oh, shit. I didn't know she was here.

34:34.702 --> 34:36.411
Did I say anything bad about her?

34:37.330 --> 34:39.915
You're not the one
she's gonna ream.

34:52.887 --> 34:55.263
- Sit.
- Um...

34:57.558 --> 34:59.684
that's OK.

35:01.771 --> 35:03.313
It seems the ADA has noticed

35:03.439 --> 35:06.233
that your personal
and professional lives are colliding.

35:07.693 --> 35:08.693
All right.

35:08.820 --> 35:12.864
Listen, Anton wasn't officially a CI
when that happened.

35:14.242 --> 35:17.202
So it was a one-time thing?

35:18.496 --> 35:21.123
- No.
- Still going on?

35:23.292 --> 35:25.085
I'm not sure.

35:25.211 --> 35:27.170
Do you want it to?

35:31.217 --> 35:34.344
I don't know. He could be
a key witness in my case.

35:36.430 --> 35:38.390
Doesn't have to be your case.

35:41.227 --> 35:43.603
You know what?

35:43.729 --> 35:45.605
You go ahead.

35:46.732 --> 35:50.026
You take away my case. You take away
my shield. I don't care any more.

35:52.113 --> 35:54.656
Because it wasn't the wrong decision.

35:54.782 --> 35:57.325
I wanted to be with Anton.

35:57.451 --> 36:00.453
I still want to be with Anton.

36:00.580 --> 36:04.499
And there is no possible way
that us being together is a mistake.

36:06.002 --> 36:09.087
Which means you're not sacrificing
your personal life to work.

36:13.342 --> 36:14.384
Good for you.

36:21.434 --> 36:24.519
Congratulations, Detective Morgan.

36:27.273 --> 36:28.315
What?

36:28.441 --> 36:31.318
You're one of the smartest,
hardest-working,

36:31.444 --> 36:35.572
most annoying pain-in-the-ass cops
in my department,

36:36.908 --> 36:39.201
and you've earned this.

36:47.835 --> 36:50.212
What about the ADA's ethics probe?

36:55.676 --> 36:58.303
The ADA is dead.

37:03.851 --> 37:07.145
- Try one of these.
- Oh!

37:07.271 --> 37:09.439
Ganache frosting.

37:10.983 --> 37:14.027
You hold on to that personal life.

37:14.153 --> 37:15.237
Yeah.

37:15.363 --> 37:18.240
Reminds us what's important.

37:18.366 --> 37:20.784
- Cupcakes.
- (Laughs)

37:20.910 --> 37:23.745
Abso-fucking-lutely.

37:37.677 --> 37:39.844
Such a familiar situation.

37:43.182 --> 37:45.433
Such an unfamiliar perspective.

37:45.559 --> 37:49.396
(Whistling)

37:52.400 --> 37:54.276
George King.

37:54.402 --> 37:56.444
So Ramon wasn't
the only one following me.

37:56.570 --> 37:59.364
I underestimated Miguel after all.

38:00.574 --> 38:03.994
This is the part where my fear
is supposed to build.

38:04.120 --> 38:06.162
I know his MO by heart.

38:08.874 --> 38:10.917
But you're not afraid.

38:12.920 --> 38:15.672
No. I'm not.

38:16.882 --> 38:18.383
I am.

38:19.427 --> 38:23.096
I've been scared of it coming to this
your whole life,

38:23.222 --> 38:24.723
a violent end.

38:27.727 --> 38:30.687
- I tried to protect you.
- And you did.

38:30.813 --> 38:33.106
This is my fault for not trusting you.

38:33.232 --> 38:36.359
Instead I trusted
Miguel fucking Prado.

38:36.986 --> 38:39.070
You did the best you could.

38:41.407 --> 38:44.242
I need you to understand
something, Dexter.

38:45.745 --> 38:47.787
So did I.

38:47.913 --> 38:50.415
The very best I could.

38:51.584 --> 38:54.836
I hope to be half as good a father
to my son.

38:54.962 --> 38:56.963
Your son.

38:59.050 --> 39:00.467
Dad.

39:02.762 --> 39:04.262
I forgive you.

39:09.060 --> 39:10.810
I've never seen you cry before.

39:10.936 --> 39:15.148
They're not my tears, Dex.
They're yours.

39:15.274 --> 39:17.400
I know, but I've never...

39:19.612 --> 39:21.780
I've never felt this.

39:21.906 --> 39:24.157
You've never had a son before.

39:25.284 --> 39:27.327
You want to see him
come into the world?

39:27.453 --> 39:28.953
Yes.

39:30.623 --> 39:32.999
To raise him with Rita.

39:33.125 --> 39:35.168
To watch him grow up.

39:36.670 --> 39:39.464
- To protect him.
- I know.

39:39.590 --> 39:40.965
I didn't,

39:41.092 --> 39:45.011
until now, when it's all
gonna be taken away.

39:45.137 --> 39:47.180
I wanna be there for him.

39:49.809 --> 39:52.977
I've never wanted anything
so much in my life.

40:00.820 --> 40:02.862
(Knocking)

40:08.327 --> 40:09.661
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:09.787 --> 40:11.204
Come in.

40:16.043 --> 40:18.878
You're completely
different from me.

40:19.004 --> 40:23.007
You're laid-back and...musiciany and...

40:23.134 --> 40:24.426
unambitious.

40:27.096 --> 40:28.555
You're like Valium.

40:29.640 --> 40:31.683
And you're like Red Bull.

40:33.310 --> 40:35.520
You are the best thing
that has happened to me.

40:35.646 --> 40:37.564
I'm still a witness in your case.

40:37.690 --> 40:41.025
It's not my case. I recused myself.

40:41.152 --> 40:43.111
You gave up a case? This case?

40:43.237 --> 40:45.196
I had a choice.

40:45.322 --> 40:46.781
I chose you.

40:49.368 --> 40:51.494
Your turn.

40:55.082 --> 40:56.749
I've already chosen.

40:58.127 --> 41:00.295
- (Both laugh)
- OK.

41:00.421 --> 41:04.549
- (Cellphone rings)
- Hold on. Hold on, I'll turn it off.

41:04.675 --> 41:07.260
Wait, just, uh...

41:07.386 --> 41:08.344
What?

41:08.471 --> 41:10.847
George King wasn't
at that cigar factory.

41:10.973 --> 41:14.517
Fucking duh, but that's
not my case any more.

41:14.643 --> 41:15.643
Why?

41:15.769 --> 41:18.688
(Masuka) Well, I re-ran the tobacco
that we got from George King's stolen car.

41:18.814 --> 41:21.357
It turns out it's at least
a dozen years old.

41:21.484 --> 41:24.694
I called the cigar factory.
They only moved in there three years ago.

41:24.820 --> 41:27.489
Where'd they move it?

41:27.615 --> 41:29.782
(Whistling)

41:29.909 --> 41:32.702
I know that look.

41:32.828 --> 41:34.746
I've had that look.

41:34.872 --> 41:36.998
He likes control.

41:37.124 --> 41:38.708
Needs it.

41:40.753 --> 41:42.837
So I'll take it away from him.

41:45.424 --> 41:46.799
I killed Freebo.

41:46.926 --> 41:48.718
(Whistling fades)

41:48.844 --> 41:50.303
Sorry about that.

41:51.722 --> 41:55.642
I tied him up. Not unlike this.

41:55.768 --> 41:58.645
Stabbed him
in the left carotid artery.

42:00.147 --> 42:04.442
Used a 16-inch, carbon steel bone saw
to separate his limbs.

42:04.568 --> 42:06.402
I don't believe you.

42:06.529 --> 42:11.491
Divided them equally
amongst six biodegradable trash bags.

42:11.617 --> 42:14.994
Which are long gone now,
carried north on the Gulf Stream.

42:21.335 --> 42:23.419
You're lying.

42:23.546 --> 42:25.171
Usually.

42:25.297 --> 42:27.131
Not now.

42:27.258 --> 42:28.383
No point.

42:28.509 --> 42:31.678
Why would you have done
such a thing?

42:31.804 --> 42:34.889
Oh, I have my excuses
and justifications,

42:35.015 --> 42:37.934
but, really, I just...

42:38.060 --> 42:39.352
need to.

42:39.478 --> 42:41.062
Like you.

42:41.188 --> 42:42.939
You have your flimsy excuses -

42:43.065 --> 42:45.316
finding Freebo,
getting your money.

42:45.442 --> 42:48.236
But you know he's dead.

42:48.362 --> 42:51.114
You know there's no money.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.241
So really, you're just...

42:53.367 --> 42:55.285
a killer,

42:55.411 --> 42:56.744
a monster.

42:56.870 --> 42:59.372
The stuff of nightmares.

43:01.250 --> 43:03.376
I could kill you now.

43:03.502 --> 43:05.503
If you can convince
yourself I'm lying,

43:05.629 --> 43:09.340
that you need to skin me
to get information out of me.

43:12.094 --> 43:14.012
You are lying.

43:14.138 --> 43:16.472
You do know where he is.

43:16.599 --> 43:19.058
Miguel Prado tell you that?

43:19.184 --> 43:22.729
He wanted me dead,
so he used you.

43:23.689 --> 43:25.773
He played on your obsession.

43:25.899 --> 43:29.611
It probably wasn't too hard.
I mean, you're a little single-minded.

43:29.737 --> 43:31.571
(Bangs table)

43:31.697 --> 43:35.033
Let's hope you're this talkative
once I get my tools.

43:35.159 --> 43:36.909
(Creak)

43:44.335 --> 43:48.713
A wolf would chew off its own paw,
its survival instinct is that fierce.

43:49.548 --> 43:51.132
So is mine.

43:51.258 --> 43:53.384
- (Bone cracking)
- Aah!

43:55.888 --> 43:57.722
Ahh.

44:13.447 --> 44:15.657
(Siren)

44:18.077 --> 44:20.036
- (Slash)
- (Yells)

44:22.247 --> 44:24.248
(Neck cracks)

44:25.834 --> 44:27.126
Fuck!

44:32.800 --> 44:34.509
King's truck, 1 1 o'clock.

44:40.099 --> 44:41.974
Shit!

44:46.397 --> 44:48.398
(Grunting)

44:52.569 --> 44:56.322
No way I could stop in time, ma'am.
He fucking came out of nowhere.

44:58.200 --> 45:00.243
(Police radio chatter)

45:07.334 --> 45:10.336
Jesus, Officer.
Scraped his fucking skin off.

45:10.462 --> 45:14.507
Yeah, well, what goes around
comes around.

45:14.633 --> 45:17.051
And it's "Detective".

45:23.934 --> 45:25.143
Dexter's here.

45:25.269 --> 45:27.478
- Just pulled up.
- Oh, finally.

45:27.604 --> 45:31.441
Nothing to be concerned about,
but he kind of had a little accident.

45:32.484 --> 45:35.069
- What happened?
- He took a tumble down some stairs.

45:35.195 --> 45:36.654
- Broke his hand.
- Oh, my God.

45:36.780 --> 45:40.366
Rita, he's fine.
He can't wait to get married.

45:42.035 --> 45:43.494
- Hi.
- Dexter!

45:43.620 --> 45:46.080
Dexter, your room is down the hall.
You cannot be in here.

45:46.206 --> 45:47.999
Wow. You look...

45:48.125 --> 45:49.208
Wow.

45:49.334 --> 45:52.253
You can't see her till the wedding.
It's bad luck.

45:52.379 --> 45:54.922
I think I got
that one covered, sweetie.

45:55.048 --> 45:57.091
Oh, baby, are you OK?

45:57.217 --> 46:00.011
Just embarrassed,
more than anything.

46:00.137 --> 46:02.680
Sweetheart, why don't we go
and do your make-up?

46:08.228 --> 46:10.271
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

46:10.397 --> 46:13.149
- You're not angry?
- Why would I be?

46:13.275 --> 46:16.235
It's not like you broke your hand
on purpose.

46:16.361 --> 46:19.447
I'm just glad you're here. Safe.

46:19.573 --> 46:21.324
Me too.

46:21.450 --> 46:22.742
All right, now go, go.

46:22.868 --> 46:25.536
OK. Be ready in a jiffy.

46:30.417 --> 46:32.960
You really do look beautiful.

46:33.086 --> 46:37.340
She wants to hold on to her secret
and I'm going to respect that.

46:37.466 --> 46:41.928
It seems only fair,
given the secrets I keep from her.

46:42.054 --> 46:46.349
We all have secrets. In that way,
I'm just like everyone else.

46:46.475 --> 46:48.142
Sorta.

46:52.773 --> 46:55.149
Heard about your little fall.
Are you OK?

46:55.275 --> 46:58.486
Yeah, I'm fine. I heard
you nabbed George King.

46:58.612 --> 46:59.529
Yeah.

46:59.655 --> 47:01.489
Great, big, scary Contra boogeyman

47:01.615 --> 47:03.991
gets surrounded and takes
the chickenshit way out.

47:04.117 --> 47:05.993
Death by cop.

47:06.119 --> 47:08.496
I'm glad he's the only one
who got hurt.

47:08.622 --> 47:10.039
Yeah, me too.

47:10.165 --> 47:13.668
Ugh. Me in a dress.
I feel like a transvestite.

47:13.794 --> 47:15.628
(Both laugh)

47:17.631 --> 47:19.340
Come here.

47:21.051 --> 47:23.845
Rabbit goes under the log...

47:23.971 --> 47:26.097
hops over the log...

47:28.600 --> 47:31.644
then...through his hole.

47:37.651 --> 47:39.652
Safe and sound.

47:41.905 --> 47:44.991
- Thanks.
- Just remember, Cody has your rings.

47:45.117 --> 47:47.201
And don't lock your knees
when you're standing up up there.

47:47.327 --> 47:49.996
You'll drop like a goddamn stone.

47:50.122 --> 47:51.205
Where are your vows?

47:51.331 --> 47:53.124
Right here.

47:53.250 --> 47:54.876
I'm so happy for you.

47:57.004 --> 47:59.171
Just wish Dad could be here.

48:01.300 --> 48:03.009
I have a feeling he is.

48:07.639 --> 48:11.350
Enough of this sappy shit.
Let's get you fucking hitched.

48:13.395 --> 48:15.146
I honor you.

48:15.272 --> 48:17.106
I love you.

48:17.232 --> 48:19.025
I marry you.

48:36.752 --> 48:38.878
I promise...

48:41.423 --> 48:43.966
to be the very best husband

48:44.092 --> 48:46.385
and father

48:47.387 --> 48:49.722
that I can be.

48:53.393 --> 48:56.854
A completely, utterly honest vow.

48:58.273 --> 49:00.608
(Applause)

49:16.541 --> 49:19.502
Dexter Morgan, family man.

49:20.796 --> 49:23.297
All my previous attempts
at human connection

49:23.423 --> 49:25.967
have ended in...well, death.

49:26.093 --> 49:29.011
And now I have a partner for life.

49:29.137 --> 49:31.263
How did that happen?

49:32.015 --> 49:34.016
Am I drawn to the safety
of belonging

49:34.142 --> 49:37.269
or being part of something
bigger than me?

49:38.563 --> 49:41.273
Either way, I'm a married man.

49:41.400 --> 49:43.442
Soon to be a father.

49:44.695 --> 49:47.071
But what do I have to offer a child?

49:48.448 --> 49:51.200
Just...me.

49:52.202 --> 49:54.495
Demented daddy Dexter.

49:56.164 --> 49:58.332
Maybe I'm making
the biggest mistake of my life.

49:58.458 --> 50:01.377
But who's perfect? Certainly not me.

50:02.629 --> 50:04.922
Certainly not Harry.

50:06.216 --> 50:09.010
Sure, I'm still who I was, who I am.

50:09.136 --> 50:11.762
Question is, what do I become?

50:11.888 --> 50:14.724
There are so many blanks
left to fill in.

50:14.850 --> 50:18.519
But right now, at this moment,
I'm content.

50:18.645 --> 50:20.938
Maybe even...

50:21.064 --> 50:22.773
happy.

50:22.899 --> 50:26.027
And I have to admit,
when all is said and done...

50:27.779 --> 50:29.947
life is good.
