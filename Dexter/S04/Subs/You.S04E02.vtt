-<i>Previously on </i>You:
-Jonathan.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.646
-Jonathan Moore.
-Jonathan!

00:21.730 --> 00:22.856
The American.

00:22.939 --> 00:25.233
<i>I don't think Malcolm knew about the view.</i>

00:25.316 --> 00:26.735
<i>Kate Galvin.</i>

00:26.818 --> 00:30.030
<i>Gallerist, art lover, never married.</i>
<i>Focused, ambitious.</i>

00:30.113 --> 00:32.574
-I should probably report it.
-Don't mention me.

00:32.657 --> 00:34.492
You saved Kate's life.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.785
I am repaying Dexter.

00:35.869 --> 00:39.748
My dear friend Adam Pratt recently
opened Sundry House.

00:39.831 --> 00:42.000
-Come along with us.
-<i>Fuck, I'm in hell.</i>

00:42.083 --> 00:43.418
Time to get this one home.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.837
<i>Malcolm. Wait, did I...?</i>

00:45.920 --> 00:49.132
<i>"Here I thought when I left him on</i>
<i>your table, you'dgodownformysins."</i>

00:49.215 --> 00:53.094
-<i>I didn't do it. One of them...</i>
-Fuck off and die, Malcolm.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.012
<i>...killed Malcolm.</i>

00:54.721 --> 00:57.766
<i>-Planned to put it on me.</i>
-Pleasure to meet you, brother in arms.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.018
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:16.451 --> 01:18.036
<i>One of Dexter.</i>

01:22.957 --> 01:25.293
<i>One of you fuckers sent me those texts.</i>

01:27.253 --> 01:28.546
<i>One of you is watching me.</i>

01:31.382 --> 01:34.552
<i>One of you killed Malcolm,</i>
<i>left him on my table,</i>

01:34.636 --> 01:36.930
<i>and are now trying to frame me for it.</i>

01:41.017 --> 01:42.602
<i>You know I cleaned up his body.</i>

01:44.437 --> 01:47.816
<i>Maybe not like someone</i>
<i>who'snever, ever done that before.</i>

01:48.817 --> 01:51.903
<i>Unfortunately, that made me</i>
<i>very interesting to Dexter.</i>

01:52.946 --> 01:55.824
<i>So which one are you?</i>

01:58.076 --> 02:01.037
You all right, Jonathan? You look sick.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.747
Oh, I'm fine.

02:03.957 --> 02:04.791
What was that?

02:06.960 --> 02:11.131
Jonathan was saying your story is
riveting, but it's time for a toast.

02:18.179 --> 02:19.430
If you don't, I will.

02:21.015 --> 02:22.517
You steal my spotlight...

02:23.935 --> 02:24.936
and I murder Dexter.

02:27.021 --> 02:31.025
To Simon, to the greatest
art opening ever. This night's for Dexter.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.694
-To Simon.
-To Simon!

02:32.777 --> 02:34.195
-Hear, hear!
-Cheers.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.405
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.251
<i>I just want</i>
<i>my little European holiday back.</i>

02:59.470 --> 03:00.471
<i>What is this?</i>

03:09.981 --> 03:12.942
<i>"Your presence is requested</i>
<i>at a night to die for."</i>

03:13.943 --> 03:16.446
<i>A circle of privileged suspects,</i>

03:16.529 --> 03:20.658
<i>a frame job, and now a cryptic invite</i>
<i>evoking a British murder mystery.</i>

03:22.327 --> 03:23.161
<i>Shit.</i>

03:23.661 --> 03:27.624
<i>I'm in a whodunit,</i>
<i>the lowest form of literature.</i>

03:37.091 --> 03:39.928
<i>Call me paranoid, but you managed</i>
<i>to stash a corpse in my flat.</i>

03:40.887 --> 03:42.680
<i>Maybe that's not all you planted.</i>

03:44.057 --> 03:45.558
<i>Anything new to say?</i>

03:46.893 --> 03:48.811
<i>Of course you're using Evanesce.</i>

03:48.895 --> 03:51.814
<i>No reverse lookup, messagesdisappear</i>
<i>after they've been read.</i>

03:51.898 --> 03:54.442
<i>A favorite of the elite and the paranoid.</i>

03:55.568 --> 03:58.488
<i>When did you put this</i>
<i>on my phone? Sometime...</i>

03:58.571 --> 03:59.864
Drinks!

03:59.948 --> 04:02.992
<i>...in the black hole of the night</i>
<i>in question, you were there.</i>

04:03.576 --> 04:05.245
Steady there, Johnboy.

04:05.995 --> 04:07.330
<i>This is why I don't drink.</i>

04:14.712 --> 04:17.048
<i>Huh? What is this, Simon's art show?</i>

04:20.176 --> 04:22.053
<i>Must I Google everything?</i>

04:22.971 --> 04:24.764
<i>"The Clotho Gallery."</i>

04:24.847 --> 04:27.809
<i>Yep. Simon Soo's art show opening night.</i>

04:27.892 --> 04:32.397
<i>Elitist, upper-crust setting, check.</i>
<i>Gallerist, Kate Galvin.</i>

04:32.480 --> 04:35.233
<i>Ah. Did you murder your shitty boyfriend,</i>

04:35.316 --> 04:38.194
<i>leave him on my table,</i>
<i>and now you're taunting me?</i>

04:45.243 --> 04:47.620
I checked your office,
you're not here.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.623
I'm slammed with prep, Mal.
Can you text me back?

04:50.707 --> 04:52.917
I could use some actual help here.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.877
<i>Sounds earnestly pissed at the dead guy,</i>

04:54.961 --> 04:57.672
<i>which would suggest</i>
<i>she doesn't know he's dead.</i>

04:58.881 --> 05:02.427
<i>She could be recording that for show</i>
<i>because she's smart.</i>

05:03.011 --> 05:06.264
<i>Oh, great. I get to reacquaint myself</i>
<i>with my least favorite genre.</i>

05:07.724 --> 05:11.394
<i>Mooney loved whodunits. I always thought</i>
<i>they were word search puzzles for adults.</i>

05:11.477 --> 05:13.980
<i>Circle the clues, win a game.</i>
<i>Not exactly art.</i>

05:14.063 --> 05:17.150
<i>The Body in the Library</i>
and <i>Murder at the Vicarage</i>.

05:17.233 --> 05:21.529
-Oh, are we gonna study these?
-No, no, no, this is a personal project.

05:21.612 --> 05:24.365
Oh, too bad. I fucking love whodunits.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.826
You don't think
the style's just a bit formulaic?

05:26.909 --> 05:29.454
Oh, my God, you're one of them. Sad.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.831
<i>Ouch. But I need her.</i>

05:31.914 --> 05:32.999
What am I missing?

05:34.083 --> 05:36.753
Well, it is a formula,
but the formula is fun.

05:37.378 --> 05:40.340
It draws you in,
it hides a social commentary.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.843
Honestly, your problem is
that mysteries are entertaining.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.720
Why would that be a problem for me?

05:45.803 --> 05:47.722
Who doesn't have to be entertaining?

05:49.057 --> 05:51.517
White, male geniuses. Yeah?

05:52.393 --> 05:57.231
Honestly, being a snooze has now morphed
into some indicator of high art while--

05:57.857 --> 06:00.068
If you wanna be published,
you better be riveting

06:00.151 --> 06:03.905
and that is why Agatha Christie is
the best-selling novelist of all time.

06:03.988 --> 06:06.783
And 99% of people never
finish <i>Infinite Jest.</i>

06:06.866 --> 06:08.034
-I did.
-A month

06:08.117 --> 06:11.287
-of my life that I'll not be getting back.
-<i>Brutally Gen Z.</i>

06:12.205 --> 06:13.664
So I'm being a snob?

06:14.582 --> 06:15.541
Um...

06:16.501 --> 06:18.544
A tad patriarchal.

06:19.504 --> 06:23.257
-So what is the project?
-Oh, I'm still zeroing in.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.719
And I need to understand how these work.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.137
What, like the tropes?

06:28.930 --> 06:29.931
I can tell Dexter.

06:30.014 --> 06:32.725
<i>This arrogant 19-year-old is</i>
<i>an angel sent to help me.</i>

06:32.809 --> 06:34.352
-Please.
-Okay, well,

06:34.435 --> 06:39.315
I have to go and tutor someone really bad
at conversational Russian in six minutes.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.401
-Russian?
-Yeah, you can also find me

06:41.484 --> 06:44.195
walking a pack of spoiled dogs
around Hyde Park weekdays.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.780
Nadia, when do you sleep?

06:45.863 --> 06:49.492
Sleep's for the rich.
Okay, so here's the whole Dame Agatha.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.870
Number one, there are no coincidences.

06:53.413 --> 06:58.292
And two, all motives always boil down
to sex, money or revenge.

06:58.376 --> 07:02.004
And three, the first suspect is usually
the second victim.

07:02.088 --> 07:06.968
Oh, no, no, I'm envisioning
a single violent murder and a frame job.

07:07.885 --> 07:08.845
Oh, um...

07:10.179 --> 07:12.974
Then it's all about
why the victim was murdered.

07:13.057 --> 07:16.769
Someone wanted them dead enough
to plan it, then enact it with passion--

07:16.853 --> 07:20.690
I think framing can be a bit
of an arch conceit. But done well?

07:20.773 --> 07:21.858
Chef's kiss.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.734
So that's the brass.

07:24.318 --> 07:27.029
If your book becomes a best seller,
I get 10%.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.114
That's a deal.

07:28.197 --> 07:30.408
-Great. See Dexter.
-Thank you, Nadia.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.202
<i>"There are no coincidences."</i>

07:34.162 --> 07:35.455
Joe Quinn-Goldberg.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.665
<i>Elliot, you son of a bitch.</i>

07:38.875 --> 07:41.461
<i>Convenient that a Quinn family fixer</i>
<i>happened to drop me</i>

07:41.544 --> 07:43.212
<i>in the middle of a murder mystery.</i>

07:44.046 --> 07:46.090
You look like a Jonathan.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.345
<i>We agreed you'd never call this number.</i>

07:51.429 --> 07:53.806
-That was before you set me up.
<i>-Comeagain?</i>

07:53.890 --> 07:55.099
The texts.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.809
Malcolm Harding.

07:58.352 --> 08:01.314
-Well?
<i>-I can't tell you what a relief it is</i>

08:01.397 --> 08:03.774

08:03.858 --> 08:07.278
<i>You should try meditation.</i>
<i>It is working wonders for me.</i>

08:07.361 --> 08:08.362
Listen to me.

08:08.988 --> 08:12.825
-Elliot, I am not an idiot.
<i>-Well, it kind of sounds like you are.</i>

08:12.909 --> 08:16.996
<i>Sorry to hear you fucked up your new life,</i>
<i>but I am now officially...</i>

08:17.872 --> 08:20.124
<i>and literally above all that shit.</i>

08:21.042 --> 08:23.794
<i>I wish you an end to suffering</i>
<i>and the roots of suffering.</i>

08:23.878 --> 08:27.423
<i>And fuck you for making medestroy</i>
<i>this perfectly good phone.</i>

08:30.593 --> 08:32.512
<i>Of course it can't be that easy.</i>

08:37.391 --> 08:40.061
<i>"Hello again." Oh, shit, it's Dexter.</i>

08:42.396 --> 08:44.565
<i>"Nice jacket. Brown's your color."</i>

08:44.649 --> 08:46.901
<i>Motherfucker, where are you?</i>

08:46.984 --> 08:49.278

09:07.213 --> 09:09.090
<i>Think. Think.</i>

09:13.010 --> 09:15.346
<i>"Why did you kill Malcolm?"</i>

09:15.846 --> 09:18.641
<i>Even a sarcastic response</i>
<i>could help me crack motive</i>

09:18.724 --> 09:21.269

<i>stop this,</i>

09:21.561 --> 09:23.729
<i>-and get back to some shred of my--</i>

09:23.813 --> 09:26.440
<i>"Your name isn't Jonathan Moore." Fuck.</i>

09:27.775 --> 09:31.612
<i>"I'll figure you out soon enough."</i>
<i>I can't let you do that.</i>

09:32.196 --> 09:34.240
<i>So I have to figure you out first.</i>

09:47.086 --> 09:48.713
<i>Lady Phoebe.</i>

09:48.796 --> 09:52.300
<i>She was adamant I visit, no idea</i>
<i>what I said to her in the black hole,</i>

09:52.383 --> 09:54.135
<i>but she is a fan of Jonathan.</i>

09:55.595 --> 09:57.263
<i>Am I supposed to wait here?</i>

09:57.763 --> 09:58.598
Hello?

09:59.098 --> 10:03.144
<i>Not eager to spend the day with a woman</i>
<i>best known for fainting on Barack Obama.</i>

10:03.227 --> 10:07.898
<i>But Lady Talks-a-Lotmightbe exactly</i>
<i>who I need to find Dexter.</i>

10:09.567 --> 10:11.068
<i>Did I get here in time?</i>

10:13.404 --> 10:15.072
Fuck, that hurts!

10:15.156 --> 10:18.367
-Don't! Don't, Vicky, he's harmless.
-I heard a scream.

10:19.201 --> 10:22.413
Laser hair removal is like a tongue bath
from a volcano, darling.

10:23.623 --> 10:27.627
-You can put Rupert down.
-All I'm saying is, every club is

10:27.710 --> 10:31.714
a bespoke destination created by people
who know for people who know.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.924
I'm sorry, it's a big investor call.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.886
<i>This guy's having a drink at 10 a.m.</i>
<i>Perfect.</i>

10:36.969 --> 10:39.555
-I can come back.
-No, no, no, ciggy break.

10:41.265 --> 10:44.226
Anyway, like I was
saying, I agree. Absolutely. Absolutely.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.813
<i>Could the Lady be a killer?</i>

10:50.608 --> 10:52.735
What you said to me the other night,

10:53.486 --> 10:56.864
I don't know
that I've ever been seen so completely.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.616
<i>What did I say?</i>

10:58.699 --> 11:02.662
It's clear something brought us together
to be friends.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.498
<i>Something that impaledMalcolm</i>
<i>on my table.</i>

11:05.581 --> 11:07.583
It was a pleasure to meet Dexter.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.752
<i>Oh, here we go.</i>

11:09.835 --> 11:12.046
And Adam. Both of Dexter.

11:12.129 --> 11:17.093
Listen, listen. It's a nightclub,
it's not Theranos, buddy. Relax, come on.

11:18.552 --> 11:21.430
Tea? Bella, tea!

11:21.514 --> 11:24.392
-<i>Some tension there.</i>
-Did you get the invitation?

11:24.475 --> 11:26.727
<i>Ah. She sent me the invite.</i>

11:26.811 --> 11:30.564
It's the event. Too exclusive.
All our friends will be there.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.108
<i>Then I have to.</i>

11:32.191 --> 11:33.025
It sounds amazing.

11:33.109 --> 11:36.570
<i>What does a detective say next?</i>
<i>"Who wanted Malcolm dead?" feels blunt.</i>

11:36.654 --> 11:38.739
It's so kind of you to include me.

11:38.823 --> 11:42.284
I still don't have many friends here yet.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.995
I'm grateful to Malcolm
for insisting I come.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.998
-Well, Malcolm...
-<i>A bite.</i>

11:48.499 --> 11:51.377
-What do you mean?
-Kate likes him. Good enough.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.337
Not everyone agrees.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.756
Would you pay a ₤10,000 membership

11:55.840 --> 11:58.259
to a club ironically affiliated
with the Church of Satan?

11:58.342 --> 11:59.885
-Don't interrupt.
-Sorry.

11:59.969 --> 12:03.848
I was confiding to Jonathan
that Malcolm's a bit controversial.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.267
-Mm.
-<i>What was that?</i>

12:06.350 --> 12:09.145
Oh, crucial! Who are you wearing?

12:10.938 --> 12:12.189
To Simon's opening?

12:14.066 --> 12:17.111
-Um...
-Oh, John, you fresh, little newborn.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.656
-Malcolm's ice queen, sex-friend Kate--
-Ah.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.535
Loving, warm partner.

12:24.618 --> 12:27.371
Kate is Phoebe's friend.
It's her big night.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.791
We can't have any random beard-o
showing up in some diffusion line.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.752
-<i>Ouch.</i>
-Hey, Vic?

12:33.627 --> 12:37.298
Vic? Would you take Phoebe's
Dickensian orphan to the gallery?

12:37.381 --> 12:39.675
-Tom sent the suits there, right?
-He did.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.012
<i>I can't go. I'm nowhere on Malcolm.</i>

12:43.095 --> 12:45.055
Now, don't argue.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.975
It's Phoebe's world.
We're all just living in it.

12:51.353 --> 12:52.354
All right.

13:00.321 --> 13:03.073
So how much does a Tom suit tend to cost?

13:03.157 --> 13:07.286
<i>-Because I definitely don't have it.</i>
-It's a gifting suite. You don't--

13:07.912 --> 13:11.749
You don't actually pay.
They want you to be seen in their clubber.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.668
Not you, obviously.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.921
<i>Freebies for those</i>
<i>who need it least.</i>

13:17.004 --> 13:18.714
<i>Capitalism's going swimmingly.</i>

13:18.798 --> 13:21.425
Not there, no, stop, stop. We're overhung.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.761
So move it to the south wall,
let it breathe.

13:23.844 --> 13:26.972
<i>Watching Kate seems like she's</i>
<i>the only one in her circle that works.</i>

13:27.056 --> 13:30.851
Straight down there on the right.
See you back at the car.

13:35.773 --> 13:39.735
<i>Here are several suspects</i>
<i>who've never worked a day in their lives.</i>

13:39.819 --> 13:41.946
If it isn't the penniless professor.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.156
<i>Like Connie, the horse guy.</i>

13:44.240 --> 13:45.449
Diplomatic Connie.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.409
<i>Sophie and her ponytail.</i>

13:48.536 --> 13:50.913
<i>And the artist</i>
<i>who lets his work do the talking.</i>

13:50.996 --> 13:53.999
I must know
where you got that sporting coat.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.920
<i>Great. I'm in a West End revival</i>
<i>of </i>Mean Girls<i>.</i>

13:58.003 --> 13:59.255
Phoebe sent me.

14:02.967 --> 14:06.512
<i>Interesting.Phoebe carries</i>
<i>a lot of weight with this crowd.</i>

14:06.595 --> 14:08.430
Well, tell him what you want.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.015
<i>Um...</i>

14:10.099 --> 14:13.435
Oh. Tom or Ralph, nothing Euro.

14:19.275 --> 14:22.069
<i>I guess that stare is as close</i>
<i>toan opening as I'm getting.</i>

14:22.152 --> 14:24.029
-Nervous about your show?
-No.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.660
I was talking to Malcolm--

14:29.743 --> 14:32.913
That brain-free fuck-boy wouldn't know art
if it shit in his mouth.

14:34.582 --> 14:38.210
<i>How would Hercule Poirot phrase</i>
<i>a follow-up on a fuck-boy?</i>

14:38.294 --> 14:39.545
Not a fan of Malcolm?

14:40.045 --> 14:43.757
-We don't think about him.
-Twatty big-dick owes me 60 quid.

14:44.508 --> 14:47.386
-You into betting horses?
-Enough about Malcolm.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.597
-<i>Did they all hate him?</i>
-Jacket, sir?

14:50.598 --> 14:53.183
-Are you being dressed?
-I'm reading Neruda.

14:55.603 --> 14:58.731
Um, Phoebe invited Jonathan.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.150
I see.

15:05.112 --> 15:09.366
Well, Jonathan, if Phoebe has adopted you,
all I can say is lucky Dexter.

15:10.034 --> 15:14.246
If you hurt her in any way, I'll cremate
your dick. But congratulations.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.207
That jacket makes you look like a waiter.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.585
<i>If I was writing,</i>
<i>I could never make her the murderer.</i>

15:19.668 --> 15:21.086
<i>People would see it coming.</i>

15:21.587 --> 15:23.589
Thanks. Good talk.

15:27.968 --> 15:31.889
-Simon? Would you pick something, please?
-Who cares what I wear?

15:31.972 --> 15:33.140
<i>She's stressed.</i>

15:33.223 --> 15:34.975
Press, patrons, the world.

15:35.059 --> 15:38.479
<i>It's hard to impart urgency</i>
<i>to aristo-brats who can't fail.</i>

15:38.979 --> 15:40.940
The show will be a triumph.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.734
It's the best work I've ever done.
I'm not dancing for them.

15:45.527 --> 15:46.654
You wouldn't want me to.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.658
<i>If I want more,</i>
<i>I need better questions.</i>

15:50.741 --> 15:53.535
<i>I need to know more about Malcolm.</i>

15:56.413 --> 15:59.375
<i>Kate seems the type</i>
<i>to have backups of everything.</i>

15:59.458 --> 16:02.044
<i>Let's hope she's got a copy</i>
<i>of Malcolm's office key.</i>

16:04.463 --> 16:05.297
<i>Bingo.</i>

16:14.181 --> 16:15.349
<i>Malcolm's office.</i>

16:16.141 --> 16:18.018
<i>Books, all by men.</i>

16:18.102 --> 16:21.814
<i>Syllabus he's too lazy to update.</i>
<i>Booze, nothing new there.</i>

16:22.982 --> 16:25.609
<i>You killed him for a reason.</i>

16:27.027 --> 16:27.861
<i>Sex.</i>

16:28.612 --> 16:29.488
<i>Money.</i>

16:29.571 --> 16:31.073
<i>Or revenge.</i>

16:39.915 --> 16:40.833
<i>Hmm.</i>

16:44.920 --> 16:45.921
<i>My detective fee.</i>

16:51.760 --> 16:53.095
<i>"Silver Wand."</i>

16:53.178 --> 16:54.596
<i>"Surrey Hope."</i>

16:54.680 --> 16:56.140
<i>Okay, I'm stumped.</i>

16:57.057 --> 16:57.933
<i>Wait.</i>

16:58.017 --> 17:00.477
-You into betting horses?
-<i>Horses.</i>

17:00.561 --> 17:03.689
<i>These are bets, making these IOUs.</i>

17:03.772 --> 17:06.150
<i>Malcolm had family money,</i>
<i>but if he gambled enough,</i>

17:06.233 --> 17:07.651
<i>maybe not anymore.</i>

17:08.444 --> 17:11.071
<i>"Louis the Sun King with Dagger.</i>

17:11.155 --> 17:13.741
<i>Thursdays, 3 p.m., stocks?"</i>

17:13.824 --> 17:16.160
<i>I did mention I'm not a fan of puzzles.</i>

17:19.329 --> 17:21.081
Oh, professor, what--?

17:21.165 --> 17:22.583
What are you doing?

17:22.666 --> 17:23.500
<i>Shit.</i>

17:23.584 --> 17:26.462
I was leaving him a note,
he missed office hours.

17:26.545 --> 17:30.758
Malcolm's girlfriend asked me to check
if she left her wallet. We're neighbors...

17:30.841 --> 17:32.009
Oh, that's boring.

17:32.509 --> 17:36.180
-I thought you were breaking in.
-Nope, sorry to disappoint.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.348
So how's mystery land?

17:40.684 --> 17:44.897
It's not my thing, but I am--
I am still trying not to lose hope.

17:44.980 --> 17:48.609
Well, there's you making
the most elementary possible mistake.

17:49.234 --> 17:52.529
-And that is?
-You're letting it not be your thing.

17:52.613 --> 17:56.241
Tell me you're not having your detective
generically muck about for a motive.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.744
-<i>Oops.</i>
-I thought that's how you--

17:58.827 --> 18:03.457
Look, that's "what," not "how."
So "how" is what makes the story cool.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.043
Your detective's gotta be special
in some way.

18:06.126 --> 18:09.630
A superpower, deduction,
or knowing science, or whatever.

18:10.881 --> 18:14.093
Oh, my God, your face.
I've really just helped you, haven't I?

18:15.135 --> 18:16.428
<i>Nadia's right.</i>

18:16.512 --> 18:20.140
<i>I've been doing this wrong, tryingtoget</i>
<i>them to spill their guts to a stranger.</i>

18:20.224 --> 18:22.810
<i>I have strengths</i>
<i>I have not been leaning on.</i>

18:24.186 --> 18:25.729
<i>I'm observant.</i>

18:26.230 --> 18:29.233
<i>Gemma takes Adderall,</i>
<i>never pays for anything,</i>

18:29.316 --> 18:34.071
<i>collects tiaras, barely seems to know</i>
<i>Malcolm exists, so she's low on the list.</i>

18:35.114 --> 18:38.367
<i>Princess Blessing,</i>
<i>quote-unquote "works in tech."</i>

18:38.450 --> 18:41.453
<i>Thinks we're in a simulation.</i>
<i>If nothing's real, murder's nothing.</i>

18:41.537 --> 18:43.580
<i>Constructed her life</i>
<i>toavoidbreakinganail,</i>

18:43.664 --> 18:48.585
<i>so hard to imagine her stabbing anyone.</i>
<i>Not definitive but also low on the list.</i>

18:52.422 --> 18:55.884
<i>When Adam opened Sundry House,</i>
<i>it became his first project</i>

18:55.968 --> 18:57.803
<i>not to die before it started.</i>

18:58.762 --> 19:02.432
<i>He's not the black sheep of his family,</i>
<i>more the embarrassment.</i>

19:04.268 --> 19:07.229
<i>By American standards,</i>
<i>the Pratts are old money.</i>

19:07.312 --> 19:09.815
<i>The father's a real estate type</i>
<i>and philanthropist.</i>

19:09.898 --> 19:10.983
<i>His brother's a senator.</i>

19:11.066 --> 19:13.986
<i>Familygoldenboy,</i>
<i>possibly our first gay president.</i>

19:14.069 --> 19:17.197
<i>Meanwhile, Adam was best known</i>
<i>for getting a DUI in a tuxedo</i>

19:17.281 --> 19:19.408
<i>with Timothée Chalamet</i>
<i>in the passenger seat.</i>

19:19.491 --> 19:22.244
<i>Since dating Phoebe,</i>
<i>he's cleaned up his act.</i>

19:22.327 --> 19:24.371
<i>Well, doesn't drive anyway.</i>

19:24.454 --> 19:25.789
<i>Sundry House is a hit.</i>

19:27.291 --> 19:30.210
-Sorry.
-It's fine. It's fine. It's fine!

19:30.294 --> 19:33.505
<i>A charming bully</i>
<i>working hard to impress adad</i>

19:33.589 --> 19:34.715
<i>that wrote him off years ago.</i>

19:34.798 --> 19:37.718
-I am sorry about him.
-<i>He wants to open six more.</i>

19:37.801 --> 19:39.469
<i>I don't know if he's capable of murder,</i>

19:39.553 --> 19:42.222
<i>but I bet he could</i>
<i>frame someone competently.</i>

19:42.306 --> 19:43.599
<i>But why kill Malcolm?</i>

19:44.850 --> 19:47.352
<i>Adam Pratt as Louis Quatorze,</i>
<i>the Sun King.</i>

19:49.313 --> 19:50.147
<i>Wait a second.</i>

19:56.445 --> 19:59.781
<i>"Louis the Sun King."</i>
<i>Malcolm was talking about Adam.</i>

20:00.324 --> 20:02.451
-Thank Dexter.
-<i>Yes. It's Thursday.</i>

20:02.534 --> 20:03.619
Thank you for coming out.

20:03.702 --> 20:04.703
Thank Dexter.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.455
Thank you for coming.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.540
-Claire, always a pleasure.
-Thank Dexter.

20:19.134 --> 20:21.094
<i>Well, let's crack Malcolm's code.</i>

20:52.834 --> 20:54.544
-Okay.
-<i>Uh, what?</i>

20:55.921 --> 20:56.755
Do it.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.425
-<i>Louis the Sun King and dagger?</i>
-Beg me.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.178
Please.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.263
Piss on me.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.517
-<i>Not the secret I was expecting.</i>
-Yeah!

21:08.600 --> 21:09.643
Oh, thank you!

21:09.726 --> 21:12.104
Oh, more! Give it to me!

21:12.187 --> 21:14.439
-Give it to me!
-<i>I've seen enough.</i>

21:15.857 --> 21:17.234
<i>So Malcolm knew about--</i>

21:20.320 --> 21:23.240
Hello, you nosy, little fucker.

21:23.782 --> 21:24.783
I can explain.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.661
Go on then.

21:27.744 --> 21:29.204
<i>Shit. What do I say?</i>

21:29.288 --> 21:31.665
I'm a writer.
I'm doing research, I'm writing a book.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.626
About the rich.

21:34.710 --> 21:35.877
Well, that's nice.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.505
What kind of book?

21:39.506 --> 21:40.507
It's a mystery.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.552
Really, it's about inequality.

21:43.635 --> 21:45.637
About how they think
they're better than us.

21:46.847 --> 21:51.893
Yeah. Well, that's gonna take
about ten fucking volumes, innit?

21:52.436 --> 21:54.271
-If I'm lucky, yeah.
-Yeah.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.899
Let's have a look in here, shall we?

21:59.151 --> 22:00.152
Come here Dexter.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.198
Like I said, writer. My thoughts.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.451
Hmm.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.119
Well, hello.

22:11.204 --> 22:12.956
I put it all on Silver Wand.

22:14.875 --> 22:15.709
Payment.

22:16.835 --> 22:22.341
Needless to say you're about to suffer
an extremely nasty bout of Alzheimer's.

22:22.424 --> 22:23.258
Happily.

22:24.009 --> 22:28.513
Good. I suppose I'll see you
at that stupid, fucking, little art show.

22:29.306 --> 22:30.390
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

22:32.642 --> 22:33.977
Go ahead, off you pop.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.277
<i>Simon Soo's big opening.</i>

22:42.361 --> 22:47.074
<i>Kill me. But the suspects gather</i>
<i>inoneplace, so here I am.</i>

22:51.453 --> 22:54.122
<i>Adam's kink would barely make</i>
<i>theMadre Linda mommy mafia blink.</i>

22:54.206 --> 22:58.085
<i>If Malcolm knew and was blackmailingAdam</i>
<i>to cover gambling debts,</i>

22:58.168 --> 23:01.213
<i>well, I may have found Dexter.</i>

23:09.137 --> 23:10.222
<i>No photos, please.</i>

23:14.768 --> 23:16.520
Hold the door. Hold the door.

23:16.603 --> 23:17.938
<i>Smile, project wealth.</i>

23:18.021 --> 23:20.148
I'm trying to avoid the whole scene.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.025
Do you mind? Be a doll?

23:22.109 --> 23:24.945
<i>-"Be a doll." I fucking hate myself.</i>
-Yeah, sure.

23:50.053 --> 23:52.931
<i>As suspects go,</i>
<i>Adam needs a good hard look.</i>

23:53.014 --> 23:56.518
<i>Unlike these NFTs, sorry. It's not art.</i>

23:57.102 --> 23:59.187
-A pleasure as always.
-<i>Thereheis.</i>

23:59.688 --> 24:03.525
<i>Per Nadia, Adam killing Malcolm</i>
<i>to stop blackmail about a secret tryst</i>

24:03.608 --> 24:06.069
<i>fits all three motives in one.</i>

24:09.322 --> 24:10.157
<i>Here we go.</i>

24:16.371 --> 24:19.082
Red dot the mirrored mural
in the experiential room.

24:19.875 --> 24:23.336
There you are. This is--
This is really impressive.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.382
Thank you for that insightful
and specific compliment.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.427
<i>Still on the list</i>
<i>and aggressively reaching higher.</i>

24:30.510 --> 24:31.970
-Roald.
-Kate, darling.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.931
-Back in time.
-I wouldn't miss it.

24:35.682 --> 24:38.059
-This is a triumph, Kate.
-You flatterer.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.437
<i>What? That's insightful and specific?</i>

24:41.354 --> 24:42.355
Have we met?

24:42.439 --> 24:45.567
Probably at Sundry House.
Malcolm brought him the other night.

24:45.942 --> 24:47.277
Ah.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.863
-Any friend of Malcolm and Kate's.
-Just Malcolm.

24:50.697 --> 24:52.574
-Jonathan, nice to meet Dexter.
-Roald.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.451
So American, eh?

24:55.202 --> 24:56.203
Which coast?

24:56.286 --> 24:57.454
Both, kind of.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.999
Yes, you look like a California boy.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.125
<i>I hate this guy.</i>

25:02.209 --> 25:04.878
Let me give you both a private tour.
Shall we?

25:10.509 --> 25:12.344
<i>And prime suspect, here we go.</i>

25:19.017 --> 25:20.477
Jonathan. Hey, man.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.313
-<i>Oh, okay. If this gets him talking.</i>
-Oh, God.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.273
You smell good.

25:26.233 --> 25:30.820
Oh, I'm on Molly. What do you think?
Used to make a man of taste.

25:30.904 --> 25:31.905
Should I invest in it?

25:33.114 --> 25:36.368
-In this egg?
-Yeah.

25:36.451 --> 25:39.371
For £70,000, you get to crack the egg
and see what's inside.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.414
-That's intriguing.
-<i>Criminal.</i>

25:42.541 --> 25:44.251
I'm thinking of buying it for Phoebe.

25:44.334 --> 25:47.087
-Do you think she'd like it?
-<i>Is this a test?</i>

25:48.630 --> 25:52.634
-I don't know her as well as you do.
-True. But your guess is as good as mine.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.929
You two seem very happy.

25:56.012 --> 25:58.473
<i>When you're not getting golden showers</i>
<i>from busboys.</i>

25:58.557 --> 26:00.267
Hmm. I adore her.

26:01.101 --> 26:01.935
I do.

26:02.477 --> 26:03.478
It's like...

26:04.354 --> 26:06.481
cookies for breakfast...

26:07.190 --> 26:09.025
and every other meal...

26:10.193 --> 26:11.027
every day.

26:11.611 --> 26:12.445
Always.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.656
<i>Please confess,</i>
<i>so I can get back to my life.</i>

26:14.739 --> 26:15.865
Sounds amazing.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.076
Not like...

26:19.494 --> 26:21.079
you know, cone of silence.

26:22.539 --> 26:23.582
Malcolm and Kate.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.127
Naughty John.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.004
I never took you for a gossip.

26:30.171 --> 26:32.632
You're right, Malcolm is trash.
Let me tell something.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.927
Don't let that nosy cum rag
near your private business.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.262
What do you mean?

26:37.345 --> 26:40.515
He'll be British about it,
but he will shake you down.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.475
<i>If you killed Malcolm over blackmail,</i>

26:42.559 --> 26:45.228
<i>why are you warning me</i>
<i>he might blackmail me?</i>

26:45.312 --> 26:47.939
You know what? You convinced me.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.650
I'm gonna buy my girlfriend
this fucking egg.

26:50.734 --> 26:51.901
You, Jonathan!

26:52.569 --> 26:53.403
Sir.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.448
<i>Maybe it's not Adam.</i>

26:57.866 --> 26:59.618
<i>And I'm back to nowhere.</i>

27:06.499 --> 27:10.670
<i>Simon's main event is called "meta-cat,"</i>
<i>a collection of cat paintings.</i>

27:12.589 --> 27:13.715
<i>It's kind of lame.</i>

27:29.230 --> 27:31.775
<i>Okay. I'm the asshole.</i>

27:32.609 --> 27:34.194
<i>Simon is a genius.</i>

27:36.071 --> 27:37.906
Those eyes, right?

27:39.741 --> 27:42.327
<i>Rhys. Raised poor,</i>
<i>a man of the people,</i>

27:42.410 --> 27:44.829
<i>yet he's here looking perfectly at home.</i>

27:45.497 --> 27:47.332
<i>Something about him doesn't add up.</i>

27:47.415 --> 27:50.794
-What do you think?
-I think I fell in love with a cat.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.590
Shame it will probably end up
in some collector's warehouse.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.929
You weren't thinking
they buy art to look at?

28:01.971 --> 28:04.891
Adam calls his collection a "portfolio."

28:06.601 --> 28:08.228
Why are you friends with these people?

28:10.021 --> 28:12.023
I'm sorry, I-- I--

28:13.108 --> 28:16.319
I know that none of this is exactly
what you stand for.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.322
No, I think that all the time.

28:21.741 --> 28:23.660
-You have friends from college?
-<i>Didn't go.</i>

28:23.743 --> 28:26.705
-Yeah, a few.
-They were kind to me when I needed it.

28:27.414 --> 28:28.623
Are they still?

28:30.291 --> 28:31.126
Kind?

28:31.209 --> 28:33.253
<i>And do any of them have</i>
<i>a penchant for murder?</i>

28:34.838 --> 28:36.840
I think it'd be hypocritical of me

28:36.923 --> 28:39.384
to disavow old friends
for going on being who they are.

28:40.468 --> 28:43.972
But, really, I think
that the longer you know somebody,

28:44.055 --> 28:46.766
the more cursed you are
to see them as human.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.480
Even people like Roald.

28:52.981 --> 28:55.316
<i>Roald? Do say more.</i>

28:56.443 --> 28:58.153
Oi! Simon.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.156
-Fuck Dexter. Fuck Dexter.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.949
<i>What just happened?</i>

29:03.950 --> 29:06.536
You gaslighting piece of shit.

29:06.619 --> 29:08.288
-<i>Whoa.</i>
-Tell them. Go on.

29:08.371 --> 29:10.165
Tell them you're a fake. Tell them.

29:10.915 --> 29:14.085
Tell them! Get the fuck off me.
You piece of shit!

29:16.629 --> 29:18.798
-Get your hand--
-What did she mean?

29:30.226 --> 29:31.060
An honor.

29:31.561 --> 29:34.314
After birth, meta-cat had been destroyed.

29:35.356 --> 29:36.816
Or perfected.

29:36.900 --> 29:40.653
Born in a moment of passion
we witnessed together.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.491
You decide.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.910
Oh, it was part of the show!

29:46.993 --> 29:48.870
Oh, how wonderfully brilliant.

29:48.953 --> 29:51.331
<i>No way in hell</i>
<i>that was part of the show.</i>

29:53.374 --> 29:55.210
<i>That girl had a vendetta.</i>

29:57.712 --> 30:00.340
<i>Simon did something to her. What?</i>

30:01.174 --> 30:04.761
-What a bloody shit-show.
-They loved it. They bought it.

30:04.844 --> 30:07.222
Find her. Arrest her. Shut her mouth.

30:09.432 --> 30:13.269
Only if you ever again want an artist
to set foot in this gallery

30:14.020 --> 30:15.271
who wants to work with Dexter.

30:16.272 --> 30:18.483
And it's a fucking party.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.195
<i>What has he done? What is he capable of?</i>

30:22.278 --> 30:24.072
<i>-I need find out.</i>
-Fuck's sake.

30:24.989 --> 30:25.990
Oh, God.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.493
-Kate.
-Go away.

30:28.576 --> 30:29.702
That woman...

30:31.579 --> 30:32.622
-...I saw her.
-Really?

30:32.705 --> 30:34.624
Just now when she was ruining my life?

30:34.707 --> 30:36.668
I know where you can find her.

30:52.475 --> 30:56.312
<i>Clearly not a part of town</i>
<i>that sees a lot of patrons of the arts.</i>

30:58.523 --> 31:00.191
We just go door-to-door?

31:00.275 --> 31:02.777
<i>She's out of her element.</i>
<i>Not that she'll let it show.</i>

31:04.946 --> 31:05.780
No.

31:07.448 --> 31:08.283
There.

31:20.753 --> 31:22.046
Hi.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.466
-Can we talk?
-No point running.

31:25.550 --> 31:29.095
-We'll ask the manager for your ID.
-We don't wanna bust Dexter.

31:29.846 --> 31:31.764
I wanna know why you threw the paint.

31:32.974 --> 31:34.058
What's it worth to you?

31:40.940 --> 31:41.941
I was...

31:43.067 --> 31:44.527
Simon's assistant...

31:45.153 --> 31:47.655
and I did more than wash brushes.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.991
I painted those canvases.

31:50.074 --> 31:50.909
Bullshit.

31:51.910 --> 31:52.911
Prove it.

31:52.994 --> 31:56.915
If I could, I wouldn't be here, would I?
Simon made sure of that.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.459
You did the work, Simon got the credit.

31:59.542 --> 32:00.376
Mm-hm.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.295
And the money. And the...

32:09.093 --> 32:12.805
He said that every artist apprentices...

32:14.349 --> 32:15.642
they pay their dues.

32:16.184 --> 32:19.270
I'm not the only one.
There are other assistants.

32:19.354 --> 32:23.274
Only they're too doped up or scared
to say anything.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.153
He used to just leave it lying around

32:27.236 --> 32:29.030
for when we got stressed.

32:30.323 --> 32:31.324
Really casual.

32:31.991 --> 32:35.328
Like it wasn't some calculated move

32:35.954 --> 32:38.915
to turn me into a junkie
that no one would believe.

32:42.251 --> 32:43.962
It's my aunt's cat, Isis.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.964
<i>Isis. Malcolm was writing about her.</i>

32:46.047 --> 32:47.382
And we used Sennelier oils.

32:47.465 --> 32:50.301
-If you don't believe me, fuck Dexter.
-I believe Dexter.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.224
What's your name?

32:57.517 --> 32:58.768
Blue, like the color.

32:59.686 --> 33:00.812
Cahill.

33:00.895 --> 33:02.438
Three thousand enough?

33:18.287 --> 33:19.956
How much was Malcolm gonna give you?

33:21.624 --> 33:23.960
He did come to you, right, about Simon?

33:27.797 --> 33:28.798
Yeah.

33:29.757 --> 33:31.259
But it wasn't about that.

33:32.885 --> 33:36.139
He said he was going to expose Simon.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.559
That's all I ever wanted.

33:40.727 --> 33:43.312
And then he didn't, fucked off, vanished.

33:43.396 --> 33:45.690
<i>Because he blackmailed Simon instead.</i>

33:45.773 --> 33:50.194
<i>And, Simon, yes,</i>
<i>you, Simon, you killed him for it.</i>

33:50.278 --> 33:52.739
I have too many friends.
Come back when one is dead.

33:54.407 --> 33:56.200
I just can't take it anymore.

33:57.952 --> 33:59.328
It is stupid, I know.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.582
I think it was brave.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.086
Take care of yourself.

34:14.927 --> 34:17.847
Kate. Kate, we need to talk about Simon.

34:17.930 --> 34:18.931
No, we don't.

34:19.015 --> 34:21.100
-Listen.
-Can't fathom why you care.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.061
Because he's dangerous.

34:24.520 --> 34:29.275
You listen once, you sanctimonious fu--
I cannot understand why you are here.

34:29.358 --> 34:31.277
-I'm just trying--
-This isn't your world.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.779
This isn't your city.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.823
Saving me from a mugging
doesn't mean you get in my life.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.326
-I am not trying to do that.
-I know a grift when I see it.

34:38.409 --> 34:42.288
You are a hollow nobody
with no life of his own.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.873
So know what? Good night.

34:45.917 --> 34:46.918
<i>That went great.</i>

35:01.974 --> 35:05.686
<i>You'll leave at some point, Simon,</i>
<i>and I'll be right behind Dexter.</i>

35:07.980 --> 35:10.900
<i>Maybe you were brilliant once</i>
<i>and the pressure to keep producing</i>

35:10.983 --> 35:13.361
<i>is why you exploited Blue</i>
<i>or the artists before her,</i>

35:13.444 --> 35:16.531
<i>or you were always a shell</i>
<i>who bought everything,</i>

35:16.614 --> 35:18.574
<i>including the illusion of genius.</i>

35:18.658 --> 35:23.246
<i>Sad, Blue's too damaged to expose Dexter.</i>
<i>It's even sad Malcolm never can.</i>

35:23.329 --> 35:27.625
<i>He was awful, but you,</i>
<i>you are a monster and a killer.</i>

35:27.708 --> 35:29.627
<i>I can't wait to be done with you</i>

35:29.710 --> 35:35.007
<i>and back to life with people</i>
<i>who don't know or care what an NFT is.</i>

35:37.301 --> 35:38.928
<i>Nope. No, I got Dexter.</i>

35:39.011 --> 35:40.138
<i>Come on out.</i>

35:40.221 --> 35:41.764
<i>Come on out, Simon.</i>

35:56.237 --> 35:57.363
What do you want?

36:08.040 --> 36:10.751
<i>"I'm getting closer</i>
<i>to finding out who you are.</i>

36:10.835 --> 36:14.338
<i>On a related note,</i>
<i>you missed the best part of the night."</i>

36:15.006 --> 36:16.007
Do hurry.

36:17.049 --> 36:17.884
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

36:19.135 --> 36:22.054
<i>I've got 45 seconds</i>
<i>before the cops come inside.</i>

36:23.347 --> 36:24.765
<i>Nadia was right.</i>

36:24.849 --> 36:28.102
<i>The first suspect is usually</i>
<i>the second victim.</i>

36:31.564 --> 36:34.734
<i>So much</i>
<i>for my one-off murder theory. Fuck.</i>

36:46.204 --> 36:48.706
<i>You killed Simon,</i>
<i>texted me to gloat,</i>

36:48.789 --> 36:50.208
<i>and now you won't text me back.</i>

36:52.251 --> 36:54.503
Oh, Jonathan. Oh, thank goodness.

36:54.587 --> 36:57.590
<i>She can't possibly be you, right?</i>
<i>Can't be.</i>

36:57.673 --> 37:00.801
I was terrified you'd hear the awful news
before you saw my text.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.971
-I wanted you to hear it from a friend.
-Yes, thank goodness,

37:04.055 --> 37:05.806
our friend Jonathan is here.

37:05.890 --> 37:09.435
<i>Roald, however. And they don't seem</i>
<i>to be grieving that hard.</i>

37:09.518 --> 37:11.938
Ignore them. They're all bitches.

37:12.939 --> 37:13.773
Here.

37:14.482 --> 37:15.483
Glad you're here.

37:15.566 --> 37:18.611
Being around British people trying
to feel feelings is creepy.

37:18.694 --> 37:22.698
-I'm sorry for your loss.
-Oh, it's more Phoebe's friend.

37:23.991 --> 37:25.243
School, you know?

37:25.326 --> 37:27.620
Who cares what you turn into
if they knew you at school.

37:27.703 --> 37:31.290
-<i>Hmm. That's what Rhys said.</i>
-Death is bullshit.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.168
Hey.

37:34.961 --> 37:38.506
Has Jonathan said just the thing
to you yet? It's his power.

37:40.591 --> 37:41.926
Where is Kate?

37:42.009 --> 37:43.135
The police station.

37:43.844 --> 37:46.138
Sophie's home, of course, sedated.

37:47.682 --> 37:48.683
Can you imagine?

37:49.392 --> 37:51.018
Maybe Simon killed himself.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.397
His ear was missing.
Some kind of van Gogh homage.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.899
Wait. Someone cut off his ear?

37:56.983 --> 37:58.985
He was practically impaled.

37:59.068 --> 38:01.946
-Hardly screams suicide.
-That hideous earring

38:02.029 --> 38:05.032
must have been worth a few thousand.
Good luck fencing that thing.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.284
Oh, come on, guys.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.286
<i>No, this isn't about money.</i>

38:08.369 --> 38:10.788
<i>Malcolm's finger, Simon's ear,</i>
<i>I don't understand yet,</i>

38:10.871 --> 38:13.374
-<i>but you've got pattern.</i>
-Simon never did care to listen

38:13.457 --> 38:14.959
to people though, did he?

38:17.503 --> 38:20.172
<i>It's like a gallery</i>
<i>of sociopathic behavior.</i>

38:20.256 --> 38:22.091
<i>My suspect list is all of them.</i>

38:22.174 --> 38:25.511
Well, it's a silver lining for Kate.

38:25.594 --> 38:28.139
You know
how much Simon's shit is worth now?

38:28.222 --> 38:31.434
That stupid cat is gonna be
the biggest commission she's ever seen.

38:31.517 --> 38:33.144
I need some air.

38:34.228 --> 38:35.313
<i>I'm with Rhys.</i>

38:35.396 --> 38:37.898
<i>Aren't these supposed</i>
<i>to be Simon's closest friends?</i>

38:37.982 --> 38:39.233
So fucking rich.

38:41.068 --> 38:42.820
<i>Rhys is different from them.</i>

38:44.280 --> 38:47.116
<i>I can't tell if he's better</i>
<i>or secretly worse.</i>

38:55.082 --> 38:57.918
What was your first thought
when you heard Simon was murdered?

38:58.002 --> 38:59.003
-<i>Good.</i>
-Shock.

39:00.212 --> 39:01.630
I guess. You?

39:03.049 --> 39:03.883
The opposite.

39:08.054 --> 39:10.973
Simon tore through people
like Christmas presents.

39:11.724 --> 39:12.808
They love enemies.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.062
Nothing I could prove, but...

39:17.521 --> 39:19.231
Maybe karma caught up to him.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.400
I knew he was a bad person, but I--

39:24.320 --> 39:26.489
I sincerely hoped he might change.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.116
Or at least become honest.

39:30.451 --> 39:32.661
Whatever that girl
with the paint was on about...

39:34.789 --> 39:36.082
Simon was a liar.

39:37.416 --> 39:41.462
I keep thinking if Simon had lived to,
you know, one day come clean,

39:41.545 --> 39:46.175
not so much with the world
but with himself, then he could've been...

39:48.260 --> 39:49.804
So I'm gutted he's dead.

39:49.887 --> 39:51.305
-<i>He sounds genuine.</i>
-Yeah.

39:51.680 --> 39:54.350
<i>-Is he?</i>
-Don't look like that. I'm fine.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.602
I just need a break.

39:58.437 --> 39:59.563
I know the feeling.

40:08.447 --> 40:11.575
<i>I need to regroup</i>
<i>before you hurt anyone else</i>

40:11.659 --> 40:14.161
<i>or succeed in finding out more about me.</i>

40:17.331 --> 40:19.083
Where are you, Malcolm?

40:19.166 --> 40:21.168
Just let me know you're breathing.

40:21.252 --> 40:24.797
You can carry on fucking
whoever she is. I truly don't care.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.966
Please, call.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.343
<i>Toxic but earnest.</i>

40:30.094 --> 40:32.638
<i>Scared. I still don't think she's Dexter.</i>

40:33.472 --> 40:35.891
Blue, have you left the police station?

40:36.976 --> 40:40.521
No, it's good you gave a statement.
You have nothing to hide.

40:41.063 --> 40:42.523
Yes, I meant it.

40:42.606 --> 40:43.899
Wiltshire, 28 days.

40:43.983 --> 40:47.319
They're expecting your call,
which you'll do today if you're serious.

40:47.403 --> 40:48.946
<i>Is Kate helping her?</i>

40:49.029 --> 40:52.575
No, don't thank me,
but just don't fuck it up.

40:52.658 --> 40:56.954
And once you're cleaned up, let me know
and we can discuss your future.

40:57.037 --> 40:59.748
<i>Her friends are narcissists</i>
<i>who telegraph philanthropy</i>

40:59.832 --> 41:01.125
<i>all over the papers.</i>

41:01.208 --> 41:03.711
<i>Even Rhys's brand is screw-up gone good.</i>

41:03.794 --> 41:07.756
<i>Kate is horrible to Blue in public,</i>
<i>then secretly pays for rehab.</i>

41:07.840 --> 41:08.841
<i>I don't get it.</i>

41:09.592 --> 41:12.803
<i>Why would she hide</i>
<i>that she's not a terrible person?</i>

41:19.018 --> 41:19.852
<i>I did it.</i>

41:19.935 --> 41:23.439
<i>Fell in with the most insane,</i>
<i>damaged people on earth.</i>

41:23.939 --> 41:25.608
<i>No way out but through.</i>

41:26.358 --> 41:29.403
<i>I never thought I'd be so desperate</i>
<i>to read another Agatha Christie.</i>

41:33.991 --> 41:37.453
You all right, Professor Moore?
More Agatha? Couldn't be.

41:37.536 --> 41:39.163
You can't put that down.

41:40.080 --> 41:40.915
So come clean.

41:41.415 --> 41:44.627
-Really writing a book?
-<i>Must she always be this smart?</i>

41:44.710 --> 41:47.338
Only because sometimes
I find that people say

41:47.421 --> 41:49.757
that they're writing a book for vanity.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.467
Like Malcolm, because he...

41:52.468 --> 41:54.929
He made us call him that. I--

41:55.012 --> 41:56.847
-He was writing a book?
-Was he?

41:57.556 --> 42:00.518
Oh. I swore he knew my pain when he...

42:02.603 --> 42:05.439
He volunteered
to read my pages and then just...

42:06.232 --> 42:07.441
left me hanging.

42:08.567 --> 42:09.568
I think he's out sick.

42:09.652 --> 42:12.780
Mm. If he's not dead,
he could reply to a text.

42:12.863 --> 42:16.367
It just makes me feel like...

42:18.452 --> 42:19.787
This sounds stupid,

42:19.870 --> 42:22.790
but it's really hard for me
to show him them pages

42:22.873 --> 42:25.876
and now it's just like
I never existed to him, so...

42:25.960 --> 42:28.712
-<i>Was she just a student?</i>
-Yeah.

42:28.796 --> 42:31.715
<i>Wow. Malcolm really was</i>
<i>full-spectrum asshole.</i>

42:31.799 --> 42:33.467
I'm sure it's not like that.

42:34.343 --> 42:35.636
I'm sure he'll be back.

42:37.513 --> 42:42.142
My entire identity as an aspiring writer
can just pause. It's fine.

42:42.768 --> 42:44.645
Look, I'm no Malcolm,

42:45.312 --> 42:47.815
but I would be happy to read your pages.

42:48.399 --> 42:49.400
Really?

42:49.483 --> 42:52.570
Now that you're a writer,
Malcolm can't bestow that or take it away,

42:52.653 --> 42:53.654
and neither can I.

42:54.655 --> 42:57.866
God, no. In fact,
your taste is a little bit suspect.

42:57.950 --> 42:58.784
Yeah.

42:59.785 --> 43:02.371
Well, you should know that it's a, um...

43:03.122 --> 43:05.708
It's a mystery
with mythological creatures,

43:05.791 --> 43:08.210
so can you handle being that entertained?

43:08.294 --> 43:11.255
I've been told that I'm a snob,
but I'm working on that.

43:11.338 --> 43:12.590
Bring me unicorns.

43:14.133 --> 43:14.967
Okay.

43:15.634 --> 43:17.177
Um, I've gotta go.

43:18.512 --> 43:21.098
I knew you were cool. For a millennial.

43:23.726 --> 43:27.104
<i>You know the worst part</i>
<i>about you showing up in my life?</i>

43:28.355 --> 43:30.941
<i>How good it was just starting to be.</i>

43:31.609 --> 43:33.986
<i>I'm gonna get it back from Dexter.</i>

43:38.032 --> 43:40.659
<i>To do that is to figure you out first.</i>

44:02.806 --> 44:04.475
<i>"It was tough, but I did it.</i>

44:05.267 --> 44:07.436
-<i>Hello, Joe."</i>
