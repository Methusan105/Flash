WEBVTT

00:02.049 --> 00:03.424
PreviousIy on Dexter...

00:03.550 --> 00:05.718
(Lundy) It's always the same
three kills with Trinity.

00:05.844 --> 00:08.721
- Young woman in a bathtub...
- (Moans)

00:08.847 --> 00:11.599
..followed by a mother falling to her death...

00:11.725 --> 00:13.267
(Screams)

00:13.394 --> 00:15.436
..and ending with a man getting bludgeoned.

00:15.562 --> 00:20.066
Trinity's likely someone
who's gone his own solitary way through life,

00:20.192 --> 00:23.319
foregone all but the most rudimentary
of human connections.

00:23.445 --> 00:24.779
(Dexter) A lone wolf.

00:24.905 --> 00:27.198
If we can find where
he bludgeoned back then...

00:27.324 --> 00:31.619
Lobby's open 24 hours, guard on duty.
Too much foot traffic.

00:31.745 --> 00:35.373
- Trinity'd have to choose another floor...
- Ooh! So sorry.

00:35.499 --> 00:37.625
Wasn't watching where I was going.

00:37.751 --> 00:41.629
White male, eyes blue.
Something in them.

00:41.755 --> 00:44.132
(Quinn) Super-agent Lundy has a hunch

00:44.258 --> 00:47.260
that the dead woman is connected
to this big serial-killer case.

00:47.386 --> 00:49.262
(Debra) You still dating
that she-bag reporter?

00:49.388 --> 00:51.180
After she put Lundy's name in the paper?

00:51.306 --> 00:53.433
(Quinn) Is this conversation
gonna end up in the paper too?

00:53.559 --> 00:55.643
You have no idea the shitstorm
you've gotten me into.

00:55.769 --> 00:57.687
Find yourself another source.

00:57.813 --> 01:00.648
Just unsealed the juvie records
of Johnny Rose,

01:00.774 --> 01:02.316
our Vacation Murder suspect.

01:02.443 --> 01:04.569
Shoplifting with his high-school girlfriend,
Nikki Wald.

01:04.695 --> 01:06.279
- Get down!
- (Gunshots)

01:06.405 --> 01:09.157
I think we should inform the brass
about our relationship.

01:09.283 --> 01:11.033
It's none of their business.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.286
I get a gig in town
to spend more time with you,

01:13.412 --> 01:16.497
and you spend all your time with your ex.

01:20.002 --> 01:22.962
- Don't go disappearing on me again.
- Not a...

01:24.047 --> 01:25.131
(Gunshot)

01:29.553 --> 01:31.304
(Two gunshots)

03:31.425 --> 03:33.092
- (Radio chatter)
- (Honking)

03:44.771 --> 03:46.814
- Deb.
- Hey, you. Back behind the line.

03:46.940 --> 03:49.650
No, I was called here. I'm Dexter Morgan.
That might be my sister.

03:49.776 --> 03:52.445
I understand, sir, but I need you to step back
and let our people do theirjob.

03:52.571 --> 03:56.282
No, I'm with Miami Metro. Forensics.
My laminate and my wallet are in the car.

03:56.408 --> 03:58.159
Until I see some ID,
I need you to step back.

03:58.285 --> 04:00.661
And I need you to fucking listen.
My sister was shot.

04:00.787 --> 04:03.623
No one can tell me what her condition is,
and that's a dead body.

04:03.749 --> 04:07.376
- Sir...
- You want to let me go.

04:07.502 --> 04:10.630
Hansen!
Hands off. He's one of us.

04:12.799 --> 04:16.052
Deb's alive. OK?
They're taking her to the hospital.

04:17.095 --> 04:19.138
I have to see her.

04:19.264 --> 04:21.974
- How bad is it?
- She's lost a lot of blood.

04:26.104 --> 04:28.981
lf Deb dies, l'll be...

04:30.692 --> 04:31.776
..lost.

04:31.902 --> 04:34.528
Paramedics think the bullets
are through and through.

04:34.655 --> 04:36.864
- She's gonna be OK?
- It's looking good.

04:36.990 --> 04:38.658
(Siren wails)

04:41.161 --> 04:43.663
- Who did this?
- We got here just before you did.

04:43.789 --> 04:45.706
Quinn was first on scene.

04:45.832 --> 04:50.044
He says it's smelling
like a Vacation Murders MO.

04:50.170 --> 04:52.630
- Then that's...
- Lundy.

04:59.179 --> 05:01.430
What was Deb doing with Lundy
at five in the morning?

05:04.476 --> 05:05.893
- Oh.
- Dexter, I swear to you,

05:06.019 --> 05:08.020
we will find who did this.

05:09.356 --> 05:11.565
- My kit's in my car.
- Hey, hey, hey.

05:11.692 --> 05:14.360
You got better places to be.
Like with your sister.

05:15.070 --> 05:17.780
- Go. That's an order.
- You'll know the minute we know anything.

05:23.370 --> 05:25.413
Lundy was a worthy adversary.

05:25.539 --> 05:29.125
He deserves better than to be face down
in a hoteI parking Iot.

05:31.044 --> 05:33.546
A random victim of a senseless crime.

05:33.672 --> 05:37.675
- I'm sorry about Deb, man.
- Did she say anything?

05:37.801 --> 05:40.011
She was in shock.
Didn't see who pulled the trigger.

05:40.137 --> 05:42.680
Batista said you think
this looks like the Vacation Murders.

05:42.806 --> 05:45.891
Deb's cash and credit cards are gone.
So's Lundy's watch and wallet.

05:54.317 --> 05:55.443
Anything, Vince?

05:55.569 --> 05:58.612
Surgeon General wouldn't have been
able to save him.

05:58.739 --> 06:02.241
GSWs to the neck and chest.
He bled out in seconds.

06:02.367 --> 06:04.076
Lundy was shot twice?

06:05.245 --> 06:08.539
Deb was vulnerable
and a potentiaI witness.

06:08.665 --> 06:12.585
The shooter couId have easiIy
finished her off Iike Lundy.

06:12.711 --> 06:14.545
I should get to the hospital.

06:14.671 --> 06:18.758
Deb, she knows,
even though we go at it all the time...

06:19.843 --> 06:22.720
- We're still...
- Yeah, she knows.

06:24.765 --> 06:26.307
We're gonna get these fuckers.

06:26.433 --> 06:29.727
Not if you're Iooking in the wrong direction.

06:32.314 --> 06:33.814
Detective Quinn.

06:34.858 --> 06:36.192
Not now. Really.

06:36.318 --> 06:37.943
I didn't come here for a quote.

06:38.987 --> 06:41.322
- You all right?
- My partner's been shot.

06:41.448 --> 06:42.782
The last thing I am is all right.

06:42.908 --> 06:45.618
Yeah. I know this can't be easy,

06:45.744 --> 06:49.080
but...if you need anything...

06:50.040 --> 06:54.126
- I'm here for you.
- Thanks, Christine. That means a lot.

06:55.087 --> 06:56.045
I gotta...

06:56.171 --> 06:57.838
- It's OK.
- All right.

07:00.967 --> 07:02.718
- Sergeant Batista...
- No comment.

07:02.844 --> 07:04.887
Ah! Come on, Sergeant.

07:05.013 --> 07:07.223
Is this the work
of the Vacation Murderers?

07:07.349 --> 07:09.016
I said, no...

07:13.939 --> 07:15.648
On the record.

07:17.150 --> 07:20.402
It's too early to tell,
but one of 'em, Johnny Rose,

07:20.529 --> 07:22.655
we found out has syphilis.

07:22.781 --> 07:24.740
And it's real bad. Untreatable.

07:24.866 --> 07:26.450
Multiple partners.

07:27.327 --> 07:28.619
Print that.

07:28.745 --> 07:30.287
With pictures.

07:31.414 --> 07:36.544
I call it in now, it'll be online this morning
and on the stands this afternoon.

07:36.670 --> 07:38.212
With pictures.

07:46.429 --> 07:49.515
WhiIe my coIIeagues
are working the Vacation Murder theory,

07:49.641 --> 07:52.935
I'm gonna foIIow Lundy's theory
and check his hotel room for clues.

07:53.061 --> 07:56.480
Lundy devoted his life to hunting Trinity.

07:56.606 --> 08:00.818
He left word for me, he'd had
an interesting encounter two days ago.

08:02.529 --> 08:03.946
You think it was Trinity?

08:04.865 --> 08:08.742
Every crime scene is a jigsaw puzzle.
So many pieces.

08:08.869 --> 08:11.745
Assemble them right,
a picture forms.

08:12.539 --> 08:16.417
If it was Trinity, it'd explain
why Deb is alive and Lundy isn't.

08:16.543 --> 08:18.043
Trinity's a monster.

08:19.254 --> 08:22.047
If he was the one that hurt your sister,
you need to kill him.

08:23.466 --> 08:25.551
That was my blood down there too.

08:26.553 --> 08:28.929
You can't let these be logged into evidence.

08:31.766 --> 08:34.143
Not until I have a complete picture.

08:44.196 --> 08:48.782
Police so far are refusing to comment
on the murder of a former FBI agent

08:48.909 --> 08:51.035
and the shooting
of a Miami Metro Homicide detective.

08:51.161 --> 08:52.286
But Channel 9 has learned

08:52.412 --> 08:55.623
there may be a connection
to the so-called Vacation Murders.

08:55.749 --> 08:56.790
Sources tell us that...

08:56.917 --> 08:59.960
All right. Denver omelet, side of rye toast.

09:00.086 --> 09:02.129
Can I top that off for you?

09:02.255 --> 09:05.799
Coffee's fine, but there are
no diced tomatoes in my omelet.

09:05.926 --> 09:09.220
I'm sorry about that.
Cook is slammed today.

09:09.346 --> 09:12.640
I'll bring you a side of tomatoes.
How's that coffee?

09:12.766 --> 09:14.183
My coffee's not the issue.

09:14.309 --> 09:17.645
My breakfast, on the other hand, is.

09:17.771 --> 09:19.271
You need to start over.

09:19.397 --> 09:23.609
Denver omelet.
With tomatoes. Diced.

09:24.778 --> 09:26.111
Coming right up.

09:28.657 --> 09:30.532
You're a dear. Thanks.

09:31.326 --> 09:33.077
(Phone rings)

09:34.454 --> 09:36.830
- Astor, will you get that?
- But it's Dexter's.

09:36.957 --> 09:39.708
Oh, it's OK. He was in such a hurry
he probably forgot it.

09:39.834 --> 09:42.628
- Could be the hospital.
- Is Aunt Deb gonna die?

09:42.754 --> 09:44.964
Oh, no, honey.
No, she's gonna be OK.

09:45.966 --> 09:48.676
Some man,
he says he's Dexter's landlord.

09:48.802 --> 09:51.178
There's something wrong
with Dexter's apartment.

09:51.304 --> 09:53.722
There's got to be a misunderstanding.
All right, go.

09:53.848 --> 09:56.350
Uh, yes, hi.
This is Rita Morgan.

10:10.073 --> 10:12.157
How long have you been there?

10:12.284 --> 10:13.534
Not long.

10:15.829 --> 10:17.663
You're sitting up. It's a good sign.

10:18.415 --> 10:19.748
I'm fine.

10:21.334 --> 10:23.002
I didn't even need surgery.

10:26.006 --> 10:27.965
Couple stitches.

10:29.884 --> 10:31.677
Looks like more than a couple.

10:33.305 --> 10:34.972
You have any pain?

10:37.350 --> 10:39.601
No. Just tired.

10:42.355 --> 10:44.398
Whatever they gave me has some kick.

10:44.524 --> 10:47.359
- You want me to come back?
- It's OK. I'm fine.

10:50.488 --> 10:53.073
You remember anything...at all?

10:53.199 --> 10:54.992
You see anything unusual?

10:57.996 --> 10:59.371
It's all still a blur.

10:59.497 --> 11:01.415
Who was hit first? You, or...

11:01.541 --> 11:03.876
(Sighs) Jesus, Dex.

11:04.002 --> 11:05.419
Am I squeezing too tight?

11:05.545 --> 11:09.882
I expect those kind of questions
from Batista or Quinn, but not my brother.

11:10.008 --> 11:13.177
You said you were fine. Twice.

11:14.387 --> 11:18.474
- Doesn't matter, anyway.
- Just tell me what you want me to do.

11:20.393 --> 11:21.810
That's just it.

11:24.064 --> 11:25.898
You can't do anything.

11:27.067 --> 11:28.734
No one can.

11:29.694 --> 11:31.403
I didn't feel anything.

11:35.909 --> 11:39.036
I didn't even know I'd been hit
till I was on the ground.

11:41.039 --> 11:43.290
And then two more shots.

11:48.588 --> 11:49.922
So much blood.

11:52.884 --> 11:54.551
You're safe.

11:55.428 --> 11:57.096
I'm here.

11:57.764 --> 11:59.932
Lundy had this look in his eyes.

12:02.352 --> 12:04.770
Like he was apologizing.

12:07.399 --> 12:09.400
I couldn't do anything.

12:12.195 --> 12:13.695
I was helpless.

12:17.283 --> 12:20.411
Fuck, I can't even walk three feet
to the bathroom.

12:20.537 --> 12:22.079
Do you need to...

12:22.205 --> 12:24.998
Yeah! Bad.

12:25.125 --> 12:26.875
Come on.

12:35.718 --> 12:37.302
- OK?
- Mm-hm.

12:41.474 --> 12:44.143
I may not know who shot my sister

12:44.269 --> 12:46.228
or why her Iife was spared,

12:47.730 --> 12:50.023
but l do know
I won't be returning the favor.

12:50.150 --> 12:51.692
(Door thuds)

12:57.449 --> 12:59.032
Oh, God. Deb, is she...

12:59.159 --> 13:00.200
Peeing.

13:00.326 --> 13:01.743
(Sighs)

13:04.247 --> 13:05.456
I'll just...

13:05.582 --> 13:09.418
uh...be outside.

13:12.839 --> 13:14.798
- Hey.
- How's Deb?

13:15.800 --> 13:17.718
She's lucky to be alive.

13:17.844 --> 13:19.386
I was so worried.

13:20.638 --> 13:23.891
- Can I see her?
- Uh, she's peeing.

13:24.017 --> 13:25.476
With Anton.

13:28.104 --> 13:31.023
I would have been here sooner,
but I got hung up on the phone.

13:31.149 --> 13:32.483
Your landlord called.

13:33.318 --> 13:37.112
A pipe burst in your kitchen...
at your apartment.

13:37.238 --> 13:38.530
Oh.

13:41.201 --> 13:45.037
I was just hanging on to the place
until the lease ran out.

13:45.163 --> 13:49.583
- So I could get the security deposit back.
- Why'd you tell me you got rid of it?

13:49.709 --> 13:51.543
- I said that?
- (Baby cries)

13:53.505 --> 13:54.838
We'll talk about this later.

13:54.964 --> 13:57.382
This isn't the time or the place,
not with Deb here.

13:58.384 --> 14:00.469
Family comes first.

14:02.805 --> 14:04.556
I'm just so sorry I wasn't here.

14:05.683 --> 14:07.768
You don't have to keep saying that.

14:09.062 --> 14:10.979
I'm so glad you're all right.

14:12.148 --> 14:13.482
I'm not.

14:14.359 --> 14:15.984
Babe, what is it?

14:20.823 --> 14:22.866
I slept with Lundy.

14:32.043 --> 14:34.044
I thought you were happy.

14:35.588 --> 14:37.923
I thought I was too.

14:41.678 --> 14:43.136
I can move out.

14:43.263 --> 14:44.721
No. No. No.

14:46.349 --> 14:48.976
Listen, I'll see you through this, OK?
You did the same for me.

14:49.102 --> 14:50.727
Anton, stop.

14:53.940 --> 14:55.899
You deserve so much better.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.945
Is that what you want?

15:05.201 --> 15:06.702
Sorry I hurt you.

15:23.344 --> 15:24.720
Anton?

15:29.475 --> 15:33.270
- Toma, chula.
- Gracias.

15:34.981 --> 15:36.857
Just hung up from notifying
Lundy's daughter.

15:36.983 --> 15:40.319
Then you could really use
a shot of whiskey in there.

15:41.904 --> 15:45.490
I get that the guy's
personally invested in this,

15:45.617 --> 15:49.411
but Matthews hovering around like a vulture
isn't gonna help us catch bad guys.

15:49.537 --> 15:51.163
Angel...

15:53.666 --> 15:56.627
I made official disclosure yesterday
that we're seeing each other.

15:59.839 --> 16:02.174
- We talked about this.
- I know.

16:04.510 --> 16:06.094
But it was the right thing to do.

16:06.220 --> 16:09.598
I said I was uncomfortable
with the disclosure stuff,

16:09.724 --> 16:13.101
- and you go ahead and do it anyway?
- I made a judgment call.

16:14.479 --> 16:16.271
The problem, Maria...

16:17.148 --> 16:19.358
is that you made it for the both of us.

16:22.070 --> 16:24.613
You shouldn't keep
the Deputy Chief waiting.

16:27.408 --> 16:28.617
(Sighs)

16:37.418 --> 16:39.419
- What do we got?
- Not much.

16:39.545 --> 16:42.339
No witnesses, no security cameras.
Took a statement from Deb,

16:42.465 --> 16:44.633
- she can't remember seeing anything.
- Forensics.

16:44.759 --> 16:46.510
Waiting on trace and ballistics from the lab.

16:46.636 --> 16:48.178
APBs out on Rose and Wald.

16:48.304 --> 16:51.598
County's increased patrols at the airport,
and the higher-profile tourist hotels.

16:51.724 --> 16:55.560
If my face was all over the media
for shooting a cop and a Fed,

16:55.687 --> 16:58.397
I'd be digging a fucking hole
all the way to China.

16:59.273 --> 17:00.482
No one fuckin' go there.

17:00.608 --> 17:04.152
Or you'd be watching the press
to try and stay one step ahead of us.

17:04.278 --> 17:07.114
It's a Hail Mary, but I planted a story
with Quinn's girlfriend.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.490
She's not... We're not...

17:08.616 --> 17:11.827
You're the paper's unnamed online source
about Johnny boy's drip?

17:11.953 --> 17:14.496
I figure if Johnny has syphilis...

17:14.622 --> 17:17.708
and Nikki wasn't listed by the county
as one of his sexual partners...

17:17.834 --> 17:19.584
- She may not know.
- Exactly.

17:22.922 --> 17:25.549
Maybe we turn these two
against each other.

17:28.803 --> 17:32.222
Rita was right - famiIy does come first.

17:32.348 --> 17:35.267
Finding who did this to my sister
comes first.

17:35.977 --> 17:38.145
Is this a new page of the code?

17:38.271 --> 17:39.813
Revenge?

17:44.360 --> 17:45.652
My sanctuary.

17:45.778 --> 17:47.738
It's private and...

17:47.864 --> 17:49.281
sacred no more.

17:59.625 --> 18:03.003
If I have to give up this pIace,
what wiII I do about my roommate...

18:03.129 --> 18:05.422
the dark passenger?

18:06.674 --> 18:11.011
This apartment is the onIy thing
that's heIped me keep the mask in pIace.

18:11.137 --> 18:13.013
And without it...

18:13.139 --> 18:15.307
- l'll burst.
- (Phone rings)

18:19.520 --> 18:21.563
(Debra) They're Ietting me out tomorrow.

18:21.689 --> 18:23.690
(Sighs) That's great.

18:23.816 --> 18:27.027
- Any chance you can give me a ride?
- Of course.

18:27.153 --> 18:31.531
I'm aIso kind of gonna need a pIace to stay.
I broke up with Anton.

18:31.657 --> 18:35.577
- And, no, I don't wanna talk about it.
- We can make room for you.

18:35.703 --> 18:37.204
Rita won't mind?

18:37.330 --> 18:39.831
Don't worry, Deb, I'll take care of everything.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.048
(Lundy on tape) Trinity's a Ione woIf.

18:48.174 --> 18:51.051
Unable to connect,
except with his victims.

18:52.178 --> 18:54.054
He never deviates.

18:54.180 --> 18:56.348
BIeeds out a young femaIe in a bathtub...

18:58.017 --> 19:00.519
forces a woman to jump to her death...

19:01.354 --> 19:03.021
and five days Iater...

19:03.773 --> 19:05.440
bIudgeons an oIder maIe.

19:06.484 --> 19:08.568
I'II Iook at potentiaI sites.

19:08.694 --> 19:11.863
This may be the cIosest to Trinity
l've ever been.

19:12.907 --> 19:14.950
Lundy got closer than he thought.

19:15.868 --> 19:20.664
He just couldn't see how
all the pieces interlock, what they form.

19:26.879 --> 19:28.380
A sacred ritual.

19:30.174 --> 19:33.844
If there's anyone who knows
the importance of ritual...

19:33.970 --> 19:35.095
it's you.

19:35.221 --> 19:38.056
Lundy underestimated
how far Trinity would go

19:38.182 --> 19:40.851
to make sure his ritual wasn't interrupted.

19:40.977 --> 19:42.894
Lundy was an obstacle.

19:43.896 --> 19:45.355
And Trinity killed him.

19:46.732 --> 19:52.612
If anyone has ever deserved to be
on your table, it's this son of a bitch.

20:06.002 --> 20:08.128
Can I help you?

20:08.254 --> 20:09.880
I'm taking on a project.

20:10.006 --> 20:11.298
How big?

20:11.424 --> 20:13.133
Almost more than I can handle.

20:14.176 --> 20:16.136
And I don't have a lot of time.

20:16.262 --> 20:17.762
Maybe you need another hand or two.

20:17.889 --> 20:20.807
- There's plenty of laborers out there...
- No, no.

20:20.933 --> 20:22.809
I work alone.

20:22.935 --> 20:25.353
Sounds like you need
the right tool for the job.

20:25.479 --> 20:26.938
So much work.

20:28.524 --> 20:30.984
But I have to finish what I started, right?

20:31.110 --> 20:33.236
Yeah, I...I guess.

20:36.991 --> 20:38.491
What would you do?

20:38.618 --> 20:39.701
Me?

20:39.827 --> 20:42.662
Oh, I'd go with the framing hammer.

20:42.788 --> 20:44.998
Got a lot of heft.
It's versatile.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.209
You can't go wrong.

20:50.463 --> 20:52.255
Yeah, I see what you mean.

20:56.302 --> 20:58.136
You've been very helpful.

21:24.997 --> 21:26.665
(Lundy on tape) Lobby's open 24 hours.

21:26.791 --> 21:29.334
- (Fast-forwards)
- 12-story buiIding, hundreds of rooms.

21:29.460 --> 21:31.378
- Trinity couId strike anywhere.
- (Fast-forwards)

21:31.504 --> 21:33.713
He'II have to set up shop
in the surveillance room.

21:33.839 --> 21:36.091
- (Fast-forwards)
- Trinity's the perfect predator.

21:36.217 --> 21:39.219
Camouflaged,
waiting for his victim to be aIone,

21:39.345 --> 21:41.096
and then he strikes.

21:41.222 --> 21:44.057
(Dexter) Trinity struck here 30 years ago.

21:44.183 --> 21:48.895
A bartender...father of two,
was found bIudgeoned to death

21:49.021 --> 21:52.107
in the men's room of a tavern
at this same address.

21:52.233 --> 21:54.526
If history is going to repeat itseIf,

21:55.569 --> 21:57.529
this is where Trinity wiII be.

21:58.698 --> 22:01.658
Problem is, you have no idea
who you're looking for.

22:02.618 --> 22:04.035
Lundy was so methodical,

22:04.161 --> 22:06.746
he would have commented
on Trinity's physical appearance

22:06.872 --> 22:08.581
if their paths had ever crossed,

22:08.708 --> 22:11.042
but there's nothing in his tapes.

22:11.168 --> 22:13.211
I've listened to them all.

22:13.337 --> 22:17.215
You sure about that? That's your recorder.
Where's Lundy's?

22:19.885 --> 22:23.179
It wasn't in the hotel,
because Lundy had it on him.

22:24.306 --> 22:27.225
Then it's been logged into evidence. Shit.

22:27.351 --> 22:31.146
Dexter, you need that tape. You need
to be certain it's Trinity on your table.

22:31.272 --> 22:34.357
There's still time. He won't complete
the cycle until tomorrow night,

22:34.483 --> 22:36.067
and I'll be here...

22:36.902 --> 22:38.194
waiting.

22:39.405 --> 22:40.739
Oh, God!

22:41.741 --> 22:42.907
Oh!

22:45.202 --> 22:46.411
(Moans, gasps)

22:47.496 --> 22:48.705
(Laughs)

22:49.415 --> 22:50.832
(Sighs)

23:00.509 --> 23:03.053
- That was, uh...
- Unexpected.

23:04.346 --> 23:06.264
That's not an adjective I usually hear.

23:07.183 --> 23:08.683
I'm not complaining.

23:10.603 --> 23:11.936
I'm just...

23:13.606 --> 23:15.315
I'm just wondering why you're really here.

23:15.441 --> 23:18.651
My way of saying I appreciate you
running that story for my boss.

23:18.778 --> 23:20.111
OK.

23:20.237 --> 23:21.321
Hmm.

23:21.447 --> 23:22.822
You fucked me to thank me?

23:22.948 --> 23:24.657
Technically,
I went down on you to thank you.

23:24.784 --> 23:26.326
(Both chuckle)

23:30.748 --> 23:34.751
I thought you said
this was too complicated,

23:34.877 --> 23:36.878
you being a cop and me being a reporter.

23:38.881 --> 23:40.673
I guess I like complicated.

23:44.845 --> 23:46.471
(Dexter) Look who's here.

23:47.473 --> 23:51.017
Sorry, Astor.
I promise it won't be for long.

23:51.143 --> 23:54.479
- It's OK. I get Cody's room.
- Sorry, Cody.

23:54.605 --> 23:56.606
Come on, guys.
It's time to go to school.

23:58.359 --> 24:00.193
Check in later.

24:05.616 --> 24:06.825
(Door closes)

24:08.744 --> 24:10.870
Everything all right
between you and my brother?

24:10.996 --> 24:12.956
We just need to have a talk.

24:13.791 --> 24:15.917
It isn't about me staying here, is it?

24:16.043 --> 24:18.586
No, you're family.
You're always welcome here.

24:18.712 --> 24:20.672
I'm gonna let you get settled in,

24:20.798 --> 24:24.342
and I'm gonna get you some water
for these pain pills, OK?

24:28.681 --> 24:30.056
Rita...

24:32.476 --> 24:33.852
Thank you.

25:17.271 --> 25:22.317
- Thanks for letting Deb stay with us.
- It was either here...or your apartment.

25:22.443 --> 25:24.485
Look, we can't keep putting this off.

25:24.612 --> 25:26.863
It's still not a good time.
I need to get to the station.

25:26.989 --> 25:31.951
So when do you suppose it'll be
a good time to discuss why you lied to me?

25:32.077 --> 25:34.162
I'm really trying here, Dexter.

25:34.288 --> 25:36.122
- (Car horn)
- Dexter!

25:36.248 --> 25:39.876
I'm just asking for a little patience, all right?
Not for me, but for Deb.

25:40.002 --> 25:42.420
Right now I need to focus
on finding who did this.

25:46.592 --> 25:47.842
OK.

25:57.937 --> 25:59.312
You didn't come over last night.

25:59.438 --> 26:03.524
So little time to sleep lately.
I thought I'd get more rest in my own bed.

26:04.693 --> 26:07.904
I'm sorry I went behind your back
to Matthews.

26:08.030 --> 26:10.448
It was wrong, and I apologize.

26:13.953 --> 26:17.330
If you haven't noticed,
I'm a bit of a control freak.

26:17.456 --> 26:20.041
You mean like how like to guard
the remote control with your life?

26:20.167 --> 26:24.003
Or how you need to be the first one
in the shower, or how you like to...

26:24.129 --> 26:27.382
Look, the reason...I went to the brass

26:27.508 --> 26:30.718
was because it'd be one less thing
to worry about ruining what we have.

26:30.844 --> 26:33.596
The only thing
that would ruin what we have...

26:33.722 --> 26:35.640
is if we're not honest with each other.

26:36.308 --> 26:37.725
No more secrets.

26:39.019 --> 26:41.813
- No more secrets.
- (Timer chimes)

26:44.900 --> 26:46.859
Then I'm not going anywhere.

26:48.737 --> 26:51.572
That's everything collected
from the parking lot and the hotel rooms

26:51.699 --> 26:55.201
- back there on the right.
- (Sighs) Thanks for doing this.

26:55.327 --> 26:58.746
My father gave Deb the ring,
and it means the world to her.

26:58.872 --> 27:01.332
I checked the inventories.
Masuka never logged it in.

27:01.458 --> 27:04.752
Yeah, Deb doesn't remember
if she was wearing it or not.

27:04.878 --> 27:07.130
The shooting has her pretty messed up.

27:08.007 --> 27:11.551
If my coming down here to double-check
helps ease her mind, so be it, right?

27:11.677 --> 27:12.844
Yep.

27:16.348 --> 27:18.808
Ah! Fuck. Damn it.

27:18.934 --> 27:22.478
- (Chuckles) You Morgans and that mouth.
- Do you mind?

27:22.604 --> 27:25.732
Oh, yeah. Don't sweat it. There's plenty
more where those come from.

27:25.858 --> 27:27.025
Thanks.

27:48.339 --> 27:49.839
Here you go.

27:50.883 --> 27:52.425
Guess who just found her ring?

27:53.635 --> 27:55.970
Sorry for the trouble.
Thanks a lot, though.

27:56.096 --> 27:57.263
No problem.

27:59.433 --> 28:02.226
- I appreciate the personal tour.
- Any time I can do rounds

28:02.353 --> 28:04.812
with a fellow human being is a win.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.523
You're alone every night?

28:07.649 --> 28:10.610
Yeah, economy's a bitch.
There used to be two of us on every shift,

28:10.736 --> 28:12.570
- but now...
- Oh, say no more.

28:12.696 --> 28:14.530
I'm recently laid off myself.

28:15.407 --> 28:18.242
From here on out
I'm gonna be my own boss.

28:18.369 --> 28:22.663
Well, there's plenty of office space here.
More tenants means more money,

28:22.790 --> 28:26.376
then maybe I won't have to do double shifts
and I can see my kids once in a while.

28:26.502 --> 28:28.211
Oh, you end up setting up shop here,

28:28.337 --> 28:32.632
I guarantee this'll be your favorite
destination come lunch time.

28:32.758 --> 28:34.884
Right on schedule.
And you brought me a customer.

28:35.010 --> 28:38.596
- It's a future renter.
- Well, possible future renter.

28:39.431 --> 28:41.641
- Can I get you any?
- No, no.

28:42.434 --> 28:46.270
Caffeine makes me a different person.
Appreciate the offer, though.

28:48.732 --> 28:51.734
So you say you walk this whole place
every two hours?

28:51.860 --> 28:53.653
That's quite a workout.

28:53.779 --> 28:57.073
My wife calls it low-impact aerobics
or some shit like that.

28:57.199 --> 28:58.741
(Both chuckle)

28:58.867 --> 29:02.829
It takes about 45 minutes,
give or take a smoke break.

29:02.955 --> 29:04.956
Well, we all have our vices.

29:07.668 --> 29:09.585
So...how'd you like the building?

29:11.046 --> 29:13.047
- (Elevator chimes)
- It's perfect.

29:13.173 --> 29:14.882
Great.

29:15.008 --> 29:16.592
- Thanks a lot.
- Mm-hm.

29:23.684 --> 29:25.184
(Crying)

29:25.310 --> 29:27.478
Rita, I think something's
wrong with Harrison.

29:29.273 --> 29:31.232
I know that cry.

29:33.026 --> 29:35.278
Someone's wet, isn't he?

29:35.404 --> 29:37.363
Good. I thought it was me.

29:37.489 --> 29:39.282
(Chuckles) Oh, no.

29:39.408 --> 29:41.826
No, Harrison loves his Aunt Deb.

29:53.672 --> 29:56.382
- Can I ask you something?
- I don't do diapers.

29:56.508 --> 29:58.801
Did Dexter tell you he kept his apartment?

30:00.679 --> 30:02.430
What the fuck?

30:03.515 --> 30:05.183
Are you kidding?

30:07.519 --> 30:10.146
- He told me he got rid of it.
- Me too.

30:11.648 --> 30:14.400
Just thought he might have...
said something

30:14.526 --> 30:16.194
since you two are so close.

30:17.738 --> 30:19.155
Not a word.

30:24.328 --> 30:27.788
God, it's like a Morgan family curse
or something.

30:27.915 --> 30:30.291
Make the worst choice possible.

30:35.797 --> 30:38.674
At least Dexter's don't get people killed.

30:40.052 --> 30:42.220
You think you're responsible
for Lundy's death?

30:42.346 --> 30:46.724
He never would have been anywhere
near that parking lot if it weren't for me.

30:47.684 --> 30:50.394
Is that why your pain pills are in the trash?

30:51.188 --> 30:52.688
To punish yourself?

30:53.982 --> 30:58.194
What happened to Lundy isn't your fault.
You had no control over it.

30:59.863 --> 31:03.324
This isn't about...choices
or even about you.

31:04.910 --> 31:07.245
Sometimes bad things just happen.

31:12.709 --> 31:14.752
That's the answer to this?

31:18.257 --> 31:20.383
Bad things happen?

31:20.509 --> 31:22.385
Life happens.

31:25.472 --> 31:29.809
(Lundy on tape) I've yet to find Trinity's
signature at any of his crime scenes.

31:29.935 --> 31:31.227
(Fast-forwards)

31:31.937 --> 31:34.313
Trinity moves from state to state.

31:34.439 --> 31:38.234
Law enforcement never Iinks his kiII cycIes
to one another.

31:38.360 --> 31:41.988
- (Fast-forwards)
- Over 30 years of kiIIing.

31:42.114 --> 31:44.490
(Dexter) The cycIe, the rituaI -

31:44.616 --> 31:48.661
they teII me where Trinity wiII be,
but I have to know who I'm Iooking for.

31:48.787 --> 31:50.329
l have to be sure.

31:51.582 --> 31:53.416
(Lundy on tape) Lobby's open 24 hours.

31:53.542 --> 31:55.668
Guard on duty.
Too much foot traffic.

31:55.794 --> 31:59.338
- Trinity'd have to choose another floor...
- Ooh! Sorry.

31:59.464 --> 32:03.301
- (Fast-forwards)
- Bus number 432.

32:04.428 --> 32:09.181
MaIe. Maybe 6'4". 190 to 200 pounds.

32:09.308 --> 32:10.850
Age - around 60.

32:10.976 --> 32:12.393
Hair - gray.

32:12.519 --> 32:14.353
Eyes - bIue.

32:15.731 --> 32:17.523
Something in them.

32:18.275 --> 32:20.526
(Dexter) Lundy saw a ghost.

32:24.406 --> 32:26.198
(LaGuerta) OK, listen up, everyone.

32:26.325 --> 32:28.284
I just got word
there was a shooting at a motel.

32:28.410 --> 32:30.745
You all need to get there
as soon as possible, guys.

32:30.871 --> 32:33.497
Quinn's already en route.
Angel, you're with me.

32:33.624 --> 32:35.416
Masuka, grab your stuff.

32:36.835 --> 32:38.419
- What's going on?
- Motel shooting.

32:38.545 --> 32:40.212
Body's a match for Johnny Rose.

32:40.339 --> 32:43.758
- I'm going with you.
- You can't work this. You're next of kin.

32:43.884 --> 32:45.384
I've got it.

32:45.510 --> 32:48.387
Let's just hope Deb
is finally gonna get some justice.

32:48.513 --> 32:50.222
That's the pIan.

32:56.021 --> 32:58.814
Karma - what a fuckin' concept.

33:01.860 --> 33:04.737
Uno, dos, tres.

33:04.863 --> 33:06.947
The first bullet didn't quite make her point.

33:07.074 --> 33:09.408
(Man on radio)
We've got Nikki WaId cornered

33:09.534 --> 33:11.077
in the aIIey behind AI's Liquor Store.

33:11.203 --> 33:12.411
Let's go.

33:14.665 --> 33:17.875
Prick! (Growls)
Son of a bitch!

33:23.799 --> 33:25.800
(Sobbing, muttering)

33:27.719 --> 33:28.886
What do we got?

33:29.012 --> 33:31.389
Found her in the alley.
Altered, agitated.

33:31.515 --> 33:33.891
Every time we get near,
the gun goes up.

33:34.017 --> 33:35.393
- We good?
- Yeah.

33:35.519 --> 33:38.312
Why? Why? (Sobbing)

33:39.272 --> 33:40.481
(Muttering)

33:41.733 --> 33:43.484
- Nikki!
- Damn it!

33:44.569 --> 33:47.613
He fuckin'...
He fuckin' cheated on me!

33:47.739 --> 33:49.407
We need you to put the gun down!

33:49.533 --> 33:52.535
(Sobs) He ruined everything!

33:52.661 --> 33:55.454
You fuckin' ruined everything!

33:55.580 --> 33:58.624
She's wasted.
She doesn't even know where she is.

33:58.750 --> 34:00.042
Cover us.

34:02.921 --> 34:06.590
(LaGuerta) Nikki! No one's gonna hurt you.
We just want to talk.

34:06.717 --> 34:09.593
The alley's sealed off.
You can't go anywhere.

34:09.720 --> 34:12.471
Did you hear that, Johnny?
What about the boat?

34:12.597 --> 34:14.849
What about Bermuda, Johnny?
Wasn't that the plan?

34:14.975 --> 34:16.934
You piece of shit!

34:17.060 --> 34:18.978
- (Electricity crackles)
- Aargh!

34:19.104 --> 34:20.771
(Phone rings)

34:22.274 --> 34:23.315
We got 'em, Morgan.

34:23.442 --> 34:25.317
- Got who?
- Nikki Wald and Johnny Rose.

34:25.444 --> 34:27.319
Well, we got Nikki.
Johnny's on his way to the morgue.

34:27.446 --> 34:30.823
- What happened?
- She fuckin' shot him. Long story. Look...

34:30.949 --> 34:34.160
I know this doesn't change what happened,
but hopefully you'll find some peace of mind

34:34.286 --> 34:38.831
- knowing this thing's over.
- Yeah. Peace of mind.

34:38.957 --> 34:42.585
I gotta take this skank down to Booking.
Congratulations, partner.

34:48.425 --> 34:50.009
Such a waste.

34:50.135 --> 34:54.054
Lundy, those other tourists.
For what? A boat to Bermuda?

34:54.181 --> 34:57.057
Hell hath no fury
like a meth addict scorned.

34:57.184 --> 34:58.684
Your office, Lieutenant.

34:59.811 --> 35:03.189
- Was... Was that a smile?
- I don't know.

35:09.321 --> 35:12.656
Congratulations, Maria. That was
really good police work out there today.

35:12.783 --> 35:13.949
Thanks.

35:14.826 --> 35:18.370
But it was Sergeant Batista's
good police work.

35:18.497 --> 35:20.206
Yes.

35:20.332 --> 35:23.793
Well... (Coughs)
I know he's an asset to your team,

35:23.919 --> 35:26.420
but this department can't risk
a defense attorney

35:26.546 --> 35:29.089
turning your romantic involvement
into a courtroom sideshow

35:29.216 --> 35:31.217
- every time you work a case together.
- What are you saying?

35:31.343 --> 35:36.013
I am saying I need you to transfer
Sergeant Batista out of Homicide.

35:36.139 --> 35:39.016
Tom...this is bullshit!

35:40.310 --> 35:43.687
We followed protocol.
Christ, he made this bust.

35:43.814 --> 35:47.274
Which is why I'm going to make sure
that Sergeant Batista gets a promotion

35:47.400 --> 35:48.984
along with his transfer.

35:51.446 --> 35:53.739
Have the papers on my desk by Monday.

35:54.950 --> 35:56.283
Sergeant.

36:01.998 --> 36:04.083
Fuck. What is it?

36:06.628 --> 36:09.046
WhiIe everyone's chasing their taiIs
over Nikki Wald,

36:09.172 --> 36:11.423
I'm going after the man
who reaIIy shot my sister.

36:11.550 --> 36:15.719
In a few hours, the enigma that is Trinity
wiII be on my tabIe.

36:15.846 --> 36:17.680
A riddIe wrapped in pIastic.

36:17.806 --> 36:19.056
(Phone rings)

36:20.851 --> 36:23.227
- Morgan.
- I need to see you.

36:23.353 --> 36:25.604
I'm kinda in the middle of something.

36:25.730 --> 36:27.314
- Can it wait?
- No.

36:27.440 --> 36:30.150
Well, I'm way over
on the other side of town.

36:30.277 --> 36:33.904
- It'll take me at least an hour to get there.
- l'm not home.

36:35.073 --> 36:37.032
l'm where Frank was shot.

36:47.961 --> 36:49.753
You can't even see our blood.

36:51.131 --> 36:52.590
It's like it never happened.

36:55.594 --> 36:59.013
- Deb?
- What the fuck's your problem?

36:59.764 --> 37:01.473
I got here as fast as I could.

37:01.600 --> 37:05.686
You have everything, and you're doing
your goddamn best to throw it all away.

37:07.105 --> 37:08.397
(Sighs)

37:10.650 --> 37:15.237
- Rita told you about the apartment.
- What the fuck were you thinking?

37:15.363 --> 37:17.114
You have to make this right.

37:21.953 --> 37:24.496
- I'm not sure I know how.
- Then figure it out.

37:26.416 --> 37:30.044
- I'm the fuck-up in the family, not you.
- Don't say that.

37:30.170 --> 37:32.129
You have a choice.

37:32.255 --> 37:35.883
To be a good husband,
to be a good father.

37:36.009 --> 37:37.217
I know.

37:38.428 --> 37:39.970
It's just, uh...

37:44.142 --> 37:45.893
Sometimes I feel trapped.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.730
By what?

37:51.483 --> 37:53.442
Great kids?

37:53.568 --> 37:55.402
A wife who adores you?

37:56.404 --> 38:00.616
Yesterday...I had Lundy and Anton.

38:04.663 --> 38:06.705
And now they're gone because of me.

38:06.831 --> 38:08.916
You didn't do anything wrong.

38:10.043 --> 38:11.251
(Sighs)

38:13.505 --> 38:15.547
It doesn't matter what I do...

38:16.841 --> 38:18.592
or what I choose.

38:20.178 --> 38:22.137
I'm what's wrong.

38:23.932 --> 38:26.141
There's nothing I can do about it.

38:28.103 --> 38:31.897
(Sobs) If I'm not hurting myself,
I'm hurting everyone around me.

38:32.023 --> 38:33.691
There's nothing I can do about it.

38:34.693 --> 38:35.776
I'm...

38:35.902 --> 38:37.653
I'm broken!

38:37.779 --> 38:38.904
I'm... (Sobbing)

38:39.030 --> 38:40.447
No, you're not.

38:44.869 --> 38:46.161
I am.

38:57.632 --> 39:00.801
- Why don't we go back to the house?
- Don't! Don't.

39:02.887 --> 39:05.055
I need to be here.

39:06.850 --> 39:09.643
Where Lundy died! (Sobbing)

39:11.104 --> 39:14.064
I can't do a fucking thing about it!

39:28.246 --> 39:31.874
My sister doesn't deserve
to be in this kind of pain.

39:32.876 --> 39:34.960
But l know who does.

39:37.589 --> 39:40.632
Trinity hurt my sister
and I'm going to hurt him back,

39:40.759 --> 39:42.259
and it's going to feeI...

39:43.386 --> 39:44.762
Uh-oh.

39:46.765 --> 39:48.140
Your manager let me in.

39:48.266 --> 39:51.018
He had no idea we were married.

39:51.144 --> 39:52.352
(Sighs)

39:53.229 --> 39:56.565
Funny thing is,
I'm beginning to wonder myself.

39:57.442 --> 39:58.984
Rita, you're upset.

39:59.110 --> 40:04.573
I actually convinced myself that
by coming here this would all make sense.

40:04.699 --> 40:08.535
Why it was so important
that you keep this place a secret.

40:12.082 --> 40:13.624
(Baby whines)

40:14.375 --> 40:17.169
As I was coming over here,
all I could think about...

40:17.295 --> 40:19.505
that you were using drugs again...

40:20.298 --> 40:24.343
- that you were having an affair again.
- That will never happen.

40:24.469 --> 40:28.097
I went through your cabinets,
rifled through your desk...

40:30.433 --> 40:33.811
looking for anything that would explain

40:33.937 --> 40:36.313
what would be so horrible

40:36.439 --> 40:39.983
that my husband would have
to keep a place to hide it from me

40:40.110 --> 40:41.610
or his own sister.

40:41.736 --> 40:42.945
And?

40:43.071 --> 40:47.157
I was gonna break the lock,
but I was too scared of what I might find.

40:48.201 --> 40:49.618
And you know why?

40:50.829 --> 40:52.996
'Cause you put me in this position, Dexter.

40:53.998 --> 40:57.334
This is not the type of person or wife
that I want to be.

40:59.546 --> 41:00.838
(Sighs)

41:06.010 --> 41:07.970
You really want to know what's inside?

41:08.555 --> 41:09.888
Yes.

41:30.201 --> 41:31.785
It was Harry's.

41:37.041 --> 41:40.669
I wasn't comfortable having it in the house
with the kids, so I kept it here.

41:45.383 --> 41:48.844
See? I have nothing to hide.

41:50.013 --> 41:52.389
Except for the syringes,
scaIpeIs, and bone saw

41:52.515 --> 41:54.766
hidden in that secret drawer underneath.

41:54.893 --> 41:56.560
(Rita) Nothing to hide?

41:57.353 --> 42:00.397
Like your car accident
and your concussion and this apartment?

42:01.983 --> 42:05.569
The most disturbing thing
about your lying is that...

42:07.989 --> 42:10.908
I'm beginning to see
just how good you really are at it.

42:12.577 --> 42:14.620
You should sleep here tonight.

42:14.746 --> 42:16.246
When you're ready to come home,

42:16.372 --> 42:19.499
we have a lot of work to do
if this marriage has any hope.

42:36.517 --> 42:39.603
- Hey. Pulling an all-nighter?
- Yep. No rest for the wicked.

42:39.729 --> 42:41.730
- Have a good one.
- Always do.

42:56.329 --> 43:01.166
It's aImost poetic - one seriaI kiIIer
ending the 30-year reign of another.

43:01.292 --> 43:03.335
Trinity couId be anywhere in this buiIding.

43:03.461 --> 43:06.630
I've gotta get to the
security surveiIIance room.

43:08.299 --> 43:10.884
Hm. Where's that security guard?

43:11.886 --> 43:13.011
He was here last night.

43:13.137 --> 43:14.805
(Man whimpering)

43:23.648 --> 43:27.526
I've been so focused on Trinity,
I've negIected who his victim might be.

43:27.652 --> 43:31.280
The bludgeoning victim 30 years ago,
didn't he have two kids?

43:32.740 --> 43:34.199
It's the security guard.

43:34.325 --> 43:36.576
(Man screams, sobs)

43:41.541 --> 43:42.874
(Elevator chimes)

43:50.508 --> 43:51.883
If he's here...

43:52.802 --> 43:54.219
Then where's Trinity?

43:54.846 --> 43:56.096
Aargh!

44:03.187 --> 44:05.147
(Chiming)

44:15.074 --> 44:17.242
Take the bait. Take the bait.

44:17.368 --> 44:18.660
(Chiming)

44:24.375 --> 44:27.878
(Whimpering) Oh, no! Please!

44:28.796 --> 44:30.172
I'm a father!

44:32.550 --> 44:35.761
- You were no father.
- Aargh!

44:37.221 --> 44:39.973
- Aargh!
- (Sobs) You made me...

44:42.435 --> 44:43.727
- You made me...
- (Thud)

44:46.773 --> 44:48.648
(Harry) The recording disc is gone.

44:50.735 --> 44:52.736
Where are you, Trinity?

44:56.991 --> 45:00.327
- (Grunting)
- (Thud)

45:00.453 --> 45:01.995
Oh, my God.

45:04.248 --> 45:06.625
You made me do this! (Grunts)

45:13.591 --> 45:14.758
(Dexter) Trinity.

45:32.193 --> 45:33.318
Shit.

45:41.202 --> 45:44.830
(Harry) The elevators aren't moving.
He's using the stairs.

45:46.874 --> 45:47.999
(Dexter) Which one?

45:48.126 --> 45:51.294
I can't risk picking the wrong exit
and miss Trinity.

45:51.421 --> 45:53.213
His car has to be here.

46:08.312 --> 46:09.980
(Metallic clunking)

46:30.501 --> 46:32.711
No way I Iose you again, Trinity.

46:32.837 --> 46:34.880
(Overlapping chatter)

46:38.676 --> 46:40.135
The Miami nobody sees.

46:40.261 --> 46:43.763
He's scurrying back
to whatever hole he crawled out of.

46:45.308 --> 46:47.184
The lone wolf thinks this is over.

46:47.310 --> 46:55.901
(Tires screech)

46:56.027 --> 46:57.736
- (Horn sounds)
- (Man) Asshole!

46:57.862 --> 46:59.988
What the heII's he doing?

47:03.659 --> 47:05.660
Where are you going, Trinity?

47:10.958 --> 47:12.250
Stay with him.

47:12.376 --> 47:14.169
He's not getting away.

47:22.303 --> 47:24.346
He doesn't belong here.
It doesn't make sense.

47:40.112 --> 47:41.446
Hi, honey.

47:43.032 --> 47:44.616
Mmm. Missed you.

47:47.954 --> 47:49.287
Hey, kids!

47:50.164 --> 47:51.498
Daddy!

Hey, Dad!

47:53.668 --> 47:55.085
Lundy was wrong.

47:55.211 --> 47:56.962
I was wrong.

47:57.088 --> 47:59.714
Neither of us knew pieces of the puzzle
were missing.

48:00.424 --> 48:02.008
Trinity's a husband...

48:02.843 --> 48:04.344
a father.

48:06.931 --> 48:08.181
He's...

48:09.058 --> 48:10.684
like me.
