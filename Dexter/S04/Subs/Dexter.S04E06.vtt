WEBVTT

00:02.049 --> 00:03.675
PreviousIy on Dexter.

00:03.801 --> 00:04.801
Deb's alive.

00:04.927 --> 00:07.053
- They're taking her to the hospital.
- Who did this?

00:07.179 --> 00:09.263
He says it's smelling like
the Vacation Murderer's MO.

00:09.390 --> 00:10.723
- Then that's...
- Lundy.

00:10.849 --> 00:13.059
(Harry) Lundy devoted his life
to hunting Trinity.

00:13.185 --> 00:16.896
If it was Trinity, it would explain
why Deb is alive and Lundy isn't.

00:17.022 --> 00:20.274
I'm gonna follow Lundy's theory
and check his hotel room for clues.

00:20.401 --> 00:22.360
You can't let these be logged
into evidence.

00:25.072 --> 00:26.948
I just unsealed the juvy records

00:27.074 --> 00:29.450
of Johnny Rose,
our Vacation Murder suspect.

00:29.576 --> 00:31.786
Shoplifting with his high-school
girlfriend Nikki Wald.

00:31.912 --> 00:33.538
(Gunshots)

00:33.664 --> 00:35.957
Nikki! Put the gun down.

00:36.083 --> 00:37.834
- (Taser shot)
- (Screams)

00:37.960 --> 00:39.961
- We got 'em, Morgan.
- Got who?

00:40.087 --> 00:42.755
Nikki Wald and Johnny Rose. Well, we got
Nikki. Johnny's on his way to the morgue.

00:42.881 --> 00:45.049
This department can't risk
a defense attorney

00:45.175 --> 00:46.801
turning your romantic involvement

00:46.927 --> 00:48.970
into a courtroom sideshow
every time you work a case together.

00:49.096 --> 00:50.263
What are you saying?

00:50.389 --> 00:53.141
I am saying I need you to transfer
Sergeant Batista out of Homicide.

00:53.267 --> 00:54.559
This is bullshit.

00:54.685 --> 00:57.520
I would have been here sooner,
but I got hung up on the phone.

00:57.646 --> 00:59.814
- Your landlord called.
- Oh.

00:59.940 --> 01:03.025
I was just hanging on to the place
until the lease ran out.

01:03.152 --> 01:04.652
Why'd you tell me you got rid of it?

01:06.280 --> 01:08.406
So you didn't have an affair
with my father?

01:08.532 --> 01:11.659
I don't know who you're looking for,
honey, but it ain't me.

01:11.785 --> 01:14.245
I'm halfway through
the CI files you gave me.

01:14.371 --> 01:16.664
Maybe then I'll finally get
some answers.

01:16.790 --> 01:19.459
- Can I help you?
- I'm taking on a project.

01:19.585 --> 01:22.170
I'd go with the framing hammer.

01:22.296 --> 01:24.255
(Screams)

01:24.381 --> 01:26.299
You made me do this.

01:30.846 --> 01:32.680
(Dexter) What are you doing?

01:33.682 --> 01:36.309
He doesn't beIong here.
lt doesn't make sense.

01:37.811 --> 01:41.230
Trinity's a husband, a father.

01:42.191 --> 01:43.691
He's...

01:43.817 --> 01:45.234
like me.

03:33.093 --> 03:35.177
(Man accompanied by piano)
Have you been to Jesus

03:35.304 --> 03:37.638
For the cleansing power?

03:37.764 --> 03:39.765
Are you washed in the blood

03:39.892 --> 03:42.143
Of the lamb?

03:42.269 --> 03:44.395
(All)    Are you fully trusting

03:44.521 --> 03:46.314
In his grace this hour?

03:46.440 --> 03:47.982
Are you washed

03:48.108 --> 03:51.444
In the blood of the lamb?

03:51.570 --> 03:53.738
Lay aside the garments

03:53.864 --> 03:55.239
That are stained with sin...

03:55.365 --> 03:57.658
A woIf in sheep's cIothing.

03:57.784 --> 04:01.078
Hour by hour, the spitting image
of a normal man.

04:02.122 --> 04:03.915
Up at 6 a.m.

04:05.417 --> 04:07.752
Breakfast, 7 a.m.

04:08.795 --> 04:10.463
Work, 8:30.

04:10.589 --> 04:13.466
Study session.
Shaping young minds.

04:13.592 --> 04:15.217
Even on a Saturday.

04:15.344 --> 04:17.511
Noon Iunch with facuIty.

04:17.638 --> 04:20.556
Out at 3:00. Dinner at 6:00.

04:20.682 --> 04:24.435
Father, husband, teacher, deacon.

04:24.561 --> 04:27.688
AII in the name of bIending in.

04:27.814 --> 04:30.858
Camouflage is nature's craftiest trick.

04:35.656 --> 04:37.782
This is what makes a home -

04:37.908 --> 04:39.992
the noise of happy chiIdren,

04:40.118 --> 04:42.703
the warmth of a full house,

04:42.829 --> 04:45.915
the chiII of an angry wife.

04:47.459 --> 04:48.834
That the last of it?

04:50.545 --> 04:53.839
- Just a few more things to pack up.
- Not like you're dragging it out.

04:53.966 --> 04:55.466
Uh, that's for the kids.

04:55.592 --> 04:58.344
If you're hungry,
there's food in the fridge.

04:58.470 --> 05:02.515
- Oh, I could go for a sandwich.
- We're out of bread.

05:02.641 --> 05:06.394
She has to forgive me for my apartment
eventuaIIy. Doesn't she?

05:06.520 --> 05:08.020
(Sighs)

05:09.356 --> 05:12.733
Maybe I should hang on to it
just in case, huh?

05:12.859 --> 05:16.404
- (   Pop music playing)
- (Girls chatter and laugh)

05:16.530 --> 05:19.156
(Girl) This is so awesome.

05:19.282 --> 05:20.908
- Hello?
- Dexter.

05:21.034 --> 05:22.451
(All shouting)

05:22.577 --> 05:24.495
- Out of the way.
- (Dexter) Sheesh.

05:36.383 --> 05:38.259
I made an appointment

05:38.385 --> 05:40.720
with the new therapist
for tomorrow at noon.

05:40.846 --> 05:43.556
- New therapist?
- It's an emergency, Dexter.

05:43.682 --> 05:45.766
Or don't you think so?

05:45.892 --> 05:48.978
No, of course.
I mean, whatever you need.

05:50.355 --> 05:53.149
This isn't for me. This is for us.

05:53.275 --> 05:56.944
This doesn't belong here.

06:06.413 --> 06:08.831
Hey, can you give me
a ride to the station?

06:08.957 --> 06:11.250
Batista's taking another run
at Nikki Wald today.

06:11.376 --> 06:14.712
She confessed to everything except for
the part where she shot me and Lundy.

06:14.838 --> 06:17.715
Because she didn't. Trinity did.
But l can't tell Deb.

06:17.841 --> 06:20.259
- l need a head start.
- (Cell phone rings)

06:22.179 --> 06:24.889
Morgan.
Yes, I know where that is.

06:25.015 --> 06:26.974
Thanks.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.477
Got to go. Bludgeoning downtown.

06:29.603 --> 06:32.146
Trinity's Iatest victim. About time.

06:32.272 --> 06:34.565
100 Ocean Gate?

06:36.985 --> 06:38.986
Yeah. How'd you know that?

06:39.112 --> 06:42.364
Because that's where Lundy
thought it would be.

06:42.491 --> 06:43.824
We could have stopped it

06:43.950 --> 06:47.578
if fucking Nikki Wald and her
shitstain boyfriend didn't shoot us.

06:48.622 --> 06:49.997
Deb, it's gonna be OK.

06:50.123 --> 06:51.957
I'm going to kiII Trinity for you.

06:53.043 --> 06:56.462
Can you just give me a ride
to the station, please?

06:56.588 --> 06:59.298
Yeah, I'll drop you off
on my way downtown. Come on.

07:10.519 --> 07:13.145
The last victim
in the cycIe of three.

07:13.271 --> 07:15.689
Trinity's done...

07:15.816 --> 07:17.817
for now.

07:18.860 --> 07:21.987
He's retreated
to the safety of his camouflage.

07:22.114 --> 07:25.491
His defenses will be down.
Perfect time to strike.

07:25.617 --> 07:27.993
Oh. Jesus.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.246
I just have to stay ahead
of my coIIeagues.

07:30.372 --> 07:33.290
Two days' worth of decay.
The body's been here since Friday.

07:33.416 --> 07:35.751
Building was closed
over the weekend. No a/c.

07:35.877 --> 07:37.962
What's the spatter say?

07:38.088 --> 07:39.713
Blunt force trauma to the head.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.423
Duh.

07:41.550 --> 07:45.052
Judging from the spray, we're looking
at somebody tall, over six feet.

07:45.178 --> 07:46.804
That all you got?

07:48.431 --> 07:49.682
That's all I can tell ya.

08:05.532 --> 08:09.118
He moved the arm for a reason.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.376
Can't leave this behind.

08:17.502 --> 08:19.670
It might get them cIoser.

08:23.049 --> 08:25.551
- (Masuka) Give me.
- That's OK. I got it.

08:25.677 --> 08:27.887
Evidence hog. You got buckets
of blood to worry about.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.476
See the oval grid pattern there?

08:34.603 --> 08:36.437
Comes from a framing hammer.

08:36.563 --> 08:38.272
Duh.

08:38.398 --> 08:42.526
I'll check some out in the spatter room.
See if I can narrow it down.

08:42.652 --> 08:45.279
How do you know
so much about hammers?

08:45.405 --> 08:48.741
Not a tool I haven't
played with, my friend.

08:50.410 --> 08:52.620
(Giggles)

08:52.746 --> 08:55.706
(   Whistles Are You
Washed ln The Blood)

09:12.933 --> 09:15.517
OK, the FBI agent,
he was shot at a business hotel.

09:15.644 --> 09:17.269
But you were so high,
you don't even remember, do you?

09:17.395 --> 09:19.855
No, no, no. No.
I never blacked out. Never.

09:19.981 --> 09:22.524
Bullshit, you fucking junkie whore.

09:22.651 --> 09:24.652
(Batista) Do you remember shooting at...

09:25.695 --> 09:27.821
- Quinn.
- You shouldn't be here, Morgan.

09:27.948 --> 09:30.699
- Watching this is only gonna fuck you up.
- I'm already fucked up.

09:30.825 --> 09:32.701
Look, Nikki's going away
for a long time.

09:32.827 --> 09:34.745
She confessed to the Vacation Murders
and to killing Johnny Rose.

09:34.871 --> 09:36.330
But not to Lundy.

09:36.456 --> 09:38.666
The whole department
knows she's lying, but we got nothing.

09:38.792 --> 09:42.044
No evidence, no eyewitnesses,
so it is what it is.

09:50.470 --> 09:53.722
Fuck.

09:56.434 --> 09:58.852
I came at Nikki Wald
from every which way,

09:58.979 --> 10:00.354
but she's still holding out on us.

10:00.480 --> 10:04.066
Brass wants her transferred to County,
so it's out of our hands.

10:04.192 --> 10:05.359
(Batista) Shit.

10:05.485 --> 10:09.071
I didn't want to leave Homicide
with Deb and Lundy unsolved.

10:09.197 --> 10:10.948
That's out of our hands too.

10:12.033 --> 10:15.035
I haven't told anyone yet
about me transferring.

10:15.161 --> 10:17.288
There's no need until it's official.

10:17.414 --> 10:19.164
I haven't even turned in the paperwork.

10:19.291 --> 10:20.708
Is that it?

10:20.834 --> 10:23.377
No, that's a homicide.

10:23.503 --> 10:24.878
Just come in today?

10:25.005 --> 10:26.505
This morning.

10:32.470 --> 10:35.097
Didn't make sense to call you in
on something new.

10:35.223 --> 10:37.349
Bludgeoning. Nasty.

10:38.143 --> 10:40.144
You got any leads?

10:44.024 --> 10:46.066
Hey, if I'd known
you'd be transferred...

10:46.192 --> 10:48.193
Maria, don't.

10:49.362 --> 10:51.905
Telling Matthews about us
was the right thing to do.

10:52.032 --> 10:53.699
Working fraud
will be good for me.

10:53.825 --> 10:56.910
15% pay bump,
promotion to lieutenant, better hours,

10:57.037 --> 10:59.580
and chances are
I'm not gonna be getting shot at

10:59.706 --> 11:01.707
sitting behind a desk all day.

11:01.833 --> 11:04.543
You hate sitting behind a desk.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.964
But I love being with you.

11:23.104 --> 11:25.773
I'm perfectIy comfortabIe
with bodiIy fluids -

11:25.899 --> 11:28.067
blood, snot, tears.

11:28.193 --> 11:31.070
But the emotions
that go aIong with them,

11:31.196 --> 11:33.197
not so much.

11:33.865 --> 11:37.618
Dexter, are you hearing
what Rita is saying?

11:41.748 --> 11:42.915
She's upset.

11:47.754 --> 11:49.963
About the apartment.

11:50.090 --> 11:52.925
The apartment isn't really
the issue right now.

11:53.051 --> 11:54.760
It's not?

11:55.929 --> 11:58.430
You see? It's like he doesn't even listen.

11:58.556 --> 12:01.183
He's always in his head,
and when he does talk to me,

12:01.309 --> 12:02.976
it's all lies, all the time.

12:03.103 --> 12:05.145
Not...

12:05.271 --> 12:07.481
all the time.

12:07.607 --> 12:09.358
I thought we were past this.

12:09.484 --> 12:10.984
With the drugs and Lila...

12:11.111 --> 12:13.153
- Who's Lila?
- My sponsor.

12:13.279 --> 12:14.613
Homicidal bitch he slept with.

12:14.739 --> 12:16.198
OK.

12:16.324 --> 12:18.700
Now we're married.

12:19.619 --> 12:22.996
You know, we have a child together.

12:23.123 --> 12:24.790
And you're still keeping secrets.

12:24.916 --> 12:27.501
Rita, I can see that you're upset.

12:27.627 --> 12:30.754
But, as you describe it,

12:30.880 --> 12:33.257
this isn't new behavior for Dexter.

12:34.634 --> 12:35.843
What do you mean?

12:35.969 --> 12:38.846
It sounds like you knew about him

12:38.972 --> 12:40.389
when you married him.

12:42.183 --> 12:44.059
But I hoped he would change.

12:44.185 --> 12:48.772
When you married your ex-husband,
did you think he would change too?

12:53.319 --> 12:56.780
OK. OK, so I have
some responsibility here too.

13:04.998 --> 13:06.915
I don't want to keep making
the same mistakes.

13:07.041 --> 13:08.584
Me neither.

13:09.586 --> 13:11.837
We'll work it out.
We always work it out.

13:12.839 --> 13:14.798
I need a partner, Dexter.

13:15.633 --> 13:17.593
Someone I can trust.

13:17.719 --> 13:20.846
Unless you can be
completely honest with me...

13:22.348 --> 13:24.850
I don't want to do this anymore.

13:33.067 --> 13:36.403
I'm doing everything I can
to save my famiIy,

13:36.529 --> 13:38.405
and I'm stiII faiIing.

13:38.531 --> 13:40.782
Rita's picturing her Iife
without me,

13:40.909 --> 13:45.078
and I can't picture mine without her...

13:45.205 --> 13:47.039
or the kids.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.249
Harrison.

13:49.375 --> 13:51.668
Is that the hammer?

13:51.794 --> 13:54.755
The depth is too shallow.
Murder weapon was heavier.

13:54.881 --> 13:57.299
Well, narrow it down, Dex.
We need a model number.

13:57.425 --> 13:59.968
Maybe we can track it
to a hardware store or an internet site.

14:00.094 --> 14:01.553
I'll try the 22-ouncer.

14:06.601 --> 14:08.435
What's going on?

14:08.561 --> 14:09.895
DNA.

14:13.483 --> 14:15.025
Whose DNA? The victim's?

14:15.151 --> 14:16.735
- The killer's?
- Wait for it.

14:18.279 --> 14:21.490
OK, that smudge you found
at the crime scene?

14:23.910 --> 14:25.994
Cremated human remains.

14:26.120 --> 14:29.164
That fragment
was a little piece of bone.

14:29.290 --> 14:31.750
And thanks to the wonders
of technology

14:31.876 --> 14:33.585
and to my own scientific prowess...

14:33.711 --> 14:36.755
- You rehydrated it, and?
- Dude, I told you to wait for it.

14:37.715 --> 14:40.300
And I found two strains of DNA.

14:40.426 --> 14:41.802
One from the fragment

14:41.928 --> 14:44.304
and one from saliva.

14:45.139 --> 14:47.474
- Whose saliva?
- The killer's.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.935
Come on, buddy. Try to keep up.

14:50.061 --> 14:53.647
How do you think he got
the ashes to stick to the wall?

14:53.773 --> 14:55.941
We got the killer's goddamn DNA?

14:56.067 --> 14:57.484
You effin' know it.

14:57.610 --> 14:59.570
- I rock, right?
- (LaGuerta) Yeah, you do today.

14:59.696 --> 15:01.613
Run it through every database
you can think of.

15:01.739 --> 15:03.865
- OK.
- We're gonna find this guy.

15:04.367 --> 15:05.450
No, you won't.

15:05.577 --> 15:08.036
Arthur MitcheII isn't in any
of our police databases.

15:08.162 --> 15:11.665
I aIready ran him.
He's squeaky cIean.

15:11.791 --> 15:13.500
He hides the real him,

15:13.626 --> 15:16.169
except from those ashes.

15:16.296 --> 15:18.422
He can onIy be honest
with the dead.

15:21.467 --> 15:23.302
(Phone rings)

15:26.389 --> 15:29.766
Morgan. I need those
Vacation Murder files back.

15:29.892 --> 15:32.185
- Got to finish my report.
- Just give me another hour.

15:32.312 --> 15:34.813
There's got to be something
that puts Nikki at Lundy's hotel.

15:34.939 --> 15:36.648
Morgan, we got it covered.

15:36.774 --> 15:38.692
And you shouldn't
be working anyway.

15:38.818 --> 15:41.361
You're on sick leave. Go home.

15:41.487 --> 15:43.697
I'll keep you posted. OK?

15:48.703 --> 15:50.287
(Beep)

15:53.750 --> 15:55.500
(FemaIe voice) One unheard message.

15:55.627 --> 15:59.212
(Woman) Hi, I'm caIIing for Debra Morgan.
This is VaIerie Hodges returning your caII

15:59.339 --> 16:01.131
from a few weeks ago.

16:01.257 --> 16:03.216
Sorry it took me so Iong to caII you back,

16:03.343 --> 16:05.719
but when you said you were
Harry Morgan's daughter,

16:05.845 --> 16:07.429
l wasn't sure what to do.

16:07.555 --> 16:11.475
I figured I'd just caII, be direct,
so if you want to know the truth...

16:11.601 --> 16:13.685
I told you to stop working.

16:15.355 --> 16:16.980
That wasn't work.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.441
- That was way personal.
- Come on.

16:19.567 --> 16:21.777
For you? Same difference.

16:36.501 --> 16:37.542
(Water running)

16:37.669 --> 16:39.252
She wants a partner.

16:39.379 --> 16:41.963
One who can open up.

16:42.090 --> 16:44.174
OK, l'll share.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.385
- About what?
- (Clears throat)

16:46.511 --> 16:48.095
Work.

16:48.221 --> 16:50.263
Spatter anaIysis?

16:50.390 --> 16:52.599
No. Something personaI.

16:52.725 --> 16:54.768
Trinity? Mm, too personaI.

16:54.894 --> 16:58.605
Food? I'm hungry.
l could tell her that.

16:58.731 --> 17:00.774
We're out of bread again.

17:01.526 --> 17:03.860
I'll go get some.

17:18.793 --> 17:21.795
Arthur's kept this up
for, what, 28 years?

17:21.921 --> 17:23.922
My famiIy may not Iast 20 minutes.

17:25.550 --> 17:27.426
Warmth, intimacy.

17:27.552 --> 17:29.302
He's convincing.

17:29.429 --> 17:31.847
But why the show?
I'm the onIy one watching.

17:31.973 --> 17:35.183
Unless it's more
than just camouflage.

17:38.354 --> 17:40.021
That's honest affection

17:40.148 --> 17:41.940
sustained for years.

17:43.067 --> 17:45.569
But he's like me.
How does he do it?

17:49.449 --> 17:51.825
l will kill him. l need to.

17:51.951 --> 17:55.287
But right now
I need to save my famiIy more.

17:56.414 --> 17:59.624
His cycIe is over. It'II be a whiIe
before he kiIIs again,

17:59.751 --> 18:01.960
so he's not an immediate threat.

18:02.795 --> 18:05.630
And l have so much to learn.

18:06.674 --> 18:08.258
Arthur Mitchell.

18:12.930 --> 18:14.723
Kyle Butler.

18:15.683 --> 18:18.518
Four Walls, One Heart.
We build homes for the homeless.

18:18.644 --> 18:21.521
We meet at my house,
then head to the site together.

18:21.647 --> 18:23.940
- My address is right on the flyer.
- Thanks.

18:24.066 --> 18:27.360
I've been looking for a way
to get more involved.

18:27.487 --> 18:30.030
What brings you
to sacred fellowship, Kyle?

18:30.156 --> 18:32.115
Um...

18:33.701 --> 18:35.744
Looking for...something.

18:35.870 --> 18:37.537
Answers.

18:40.958 --> 18:43.168
My wife and I, we separated.

18:43.294 --> 18:45.295
She kicked me out

18:46.047 --> 18:48.048
and took the kids.

18:50.218 --> 18:52.135
I didn't know where else to go.

18:54.013 --> 18:56.348
You came to the right place, son.

19:08.152 --> 19:10.445
I just got an email from my editor.

19:10.571 --> 19:12.656
Yeah? Anything good?

19:12.782 --> 19:15.534
Well, he wants more from me
on the Vacation Murders.

19:17.912 --> 19:18.912
(Laughs)

19:19.038 --> 19:21.498
I'm not asking
for any inside scoop.

19:21.624 --> 19:24.292
Yeah, 'cause we know how well
that worked out last time.

19:26.546 --> 19:27.712
What?

19:27.839 --> 19:32.717
If you could just help me
get an interview with Debra Morgan...

19:33.845 --> 19:37.055
- You got to be kidding me.
- It'd be a hero piece, about the shooting.

19:37.181 --> 19:38.598
No. No way.

19:38.724 --> 19:40.141
She's your partner.

19:40.268 --> 19:43.895
Yeah, add to that the fact that her brother
has a bug up his ass about me.

19:46.232 --> 19:49.025
Let's just say I'd rather
you left it alone.

19:49.151 --> 19:50.360
Oh.

19:50.486 --> 19:55.073
Since when did that ever stop me
from getting what I want?

19:56.117 --> 19:57.701
(Cell phone rings)

19:57.827 --> 20:00.370
Oh, hold on.
It might be the station.

20:03.040 --> 20:03.957
Quinn.

20:04.083 --> 20:06.084
(Debra) Look out your window.

20:12.550 --> 20:14.926
Be back in a sec, OK?

20:17.930 --> 20:19.514
Hey.

20:20.558 --> 20:23.268
I want to be an eyewitness
for the shooting.

20:25.396 --> 20:28.148
I thought you said
you didn't see anything.

20:28.274 --> 20:30.442
I was in shock.

20:30.568 --> 20:32.444
My memory was fuzzy.

20:32.570 --> 20:34.654
Now it's clear.

20:34.780 --> 20:37.866
There's no doubt in my mind
that Nikki shot me and Frank.

20:37.992 --> 20:40.827
Mine either. Are you talking
about going on the record?

20:40.953 --> 20:44.289
And what happens later
if you decide you're still confused?

20:46.000 --> 20:48.710
- I won't.
- You sure?

20:48.836 --> 20:51.588
Because if this comes back
to bite you in the ass, you're screwed.

20:57.303 --> 21:01.264
My dad used to say a good cop
does whatever it takes to close a case.

21:02.308 --> 21:04.559
Other cops. Not you.

21:05.728 --> 21:07.520
Just think about it, OK?

21:07.647 --> 21:10.649
I'd hate to have you make a decision
when your head's not on straight.

21:23.996 --> 21:26.206
They're on a wiId goose chase.

21:26.332 --> 21:29.334
No way they'II find a match
to Trinity's DNA.

21:29.460 --> 21:31.169
He's too well hidden.

21:33.965 --> 21:37.509
I couId be heIping,
finding the hammer he used.

21:37.635 --> 21:40.637
Or l could help someone
in need - me.

21:51.273 --> 21:53.233
Preliminary spatter report
on the bludgeoning.

21:53.359 --> 21:55.652
We land on the specific hammer
for the murder weapon?

21:55.778 --> 21:57.737
Narrowing it down.
I'll keep you posted.

21:57.863 --> 22:00.073
I'm actually heading out now
to do some field research.

22:00.199 --> 22:01.700
Well, how about you, Vince?

22:01.826 --> 22:03.576
You got anything for me
on that DNA?

22:03.703 --> 22:05.662
No matches
in the criminal database.

22:05.788 --> 22:07.288
Duh.

22:07.415 --> 22:08.873
Wait.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.667
You're gonna miss the big reveal.

22:13.045 --> 22:16.297
Because I'm me, and I happen
to think outside the box,

22:16.424 --> 22:18.258
and I happen to be
an awesome forensic tech...

22:18.384 --> 22:22.095
- Masuka.
- I ran the human remains against the saliva

22:22.221 --> 22:23.972
and guess what I found.

22:24.098 --> 22:26.266
Matching mitochondrial DNA.

22:26.392 --> 22:27.642
English, porfavor.

22:27.768 --> 22:32.731
The killer is related
to the human remains. Same family.

22:33.941 --> 22:37.277
He keeps his family with him
all the time.

22:37.403 --> 22:41.114
Well, are they gonna go visit him in prison?
'Cause this is going to get him caught.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.450
- Maybe he wants to get caught.
- Or he's sending a message.

22:43.576 --> 22:47.037
Or he's trying to leave
some kind of legacy.

22:47.163 --> 22:50.623
Hey. How come you're
not working this case?

22:51.917 --> 22:53.793
I'm busy.

22:54.754 --> 22:56.087
Got a report to finish.

22:58.591 --> 23:02.343
His famiIy keeps him safe,
but these ashes Ieave him exposed.

23:02.470 --> 23:04.429
Maybe this is
how I get to the truth.

23:08.100 --> 23:09.768
The murder weapon.

23:09.894 --> 23:13.104
He's using it out in the open
for all the world to see.

23:13.230 --> 23:15.231
Not something I wouId do.

23:16.317 --> 23:18.902
But Arthur has tools that l don't.

23:24.408 --> 23:27.327
Hey! Glad to see you made it.

23:27.453 --> 23:28.453
Kyle Butler.

23:29.330 --> 23:31.623
- You remember my name.
- Oh, I'm like an elephant.

23:31.749 --> 23:33.666
I never forget.

23:33.793 --> 23:36.544
- You didn't have any tools to bring?
- Lost 'em in the move.

23:36.670 --> 23:39.464
Well, here. Take my hammer.

23:40.925 --> 23:43.635
Hey, take good care of her, though.

23:43.761 --> 23:45.512
We've been through a lot together.

23:45.638 --> 23:47.138
So l saw.

23:47.264 --> 23:51.101
- Very kind of you, Arthur.
- Well, generosity of spirit, Kyle.

23:51.227 --> 23:52.519
It's the reason we're all here.

23:52.645 --> 23:53.895
Not all of us.

23:54.021 --> 23:56.314
Come on. I'll get you set up.

23:56.440 --> 23:57.857
OK.

23:57.983 --> 24:01.861
Grant 24-ounce steeI framing hammer,
model number 514.

24:01.987 --> 24:03.404
LaGuerta will be pleased.

24:03.531 --> 24:06.366
Just bang in these three.
They're already marked.

24:06.492 --> 24:08.159
Uh-huh.

24:11.664 --> 24:13.748
But I have more important questions.

24:13.874 --> 24:15.875
So, Arthur, you and your family
been doing this a long time?

24:16.001 --> 24:17.001
For years.

24:17.128 --> 24:20.171
I took Sally on a build
for our very first date.

24:22.383 --> 24:25.176
And the kids have been coming
ever since they could hold a hammer.

24:28.681 --> 24:31.558
You all seem really close. Happy.

24:31.684 --> 24:33.977
Yeah. We are.

24:34.895 --> 24:36.980
Envious.

24:58.460 --> 25:01.129
You're Arthur's son, right? I'm Kyle.

25:01.255 --> 25:03.298
Oh. Jonah. Nice to meet you.

25:03.424 --> 25:06.259
Seems poIite. WeII adjusted.

25:06.385 --> 25:09.429
- How's it going?
- It's hot. Ha!

25:09.555 --> 25:10.597
It's nice that you're here, though.

25:10.723 --> 25:12.765
There's got to be other ways
you'd rather spend your afternoon.

25:12.892 --> 25:14.267
Well, no, it's OK.

25:14.393 --> 25:16.603
You know, Mom and Dad
are big on the family time.

25:16.729 --> 25:18.438
Yeah, that's nice.

25:18.564 --> 25:21.774
For too many kids,
family time means fighting time.

25:21.901 --> 25:24.611
- Not mine.
- Never?

25:24.737 --> 25:28.239
Not much to fight about, really.
My parents are cool.

25:29.408 --> 25:31.326
Yeah, your dad seems
like a special guy.

25:31.452 --> 25:34.704
He is. I-I really lucked out. Ha!

25:35.706 --> 25:37.290
- How so?
- A lot of ways.

25:37.416 --> 25:39.459
Like, you see that?

25:39.585 --> 25:41.127
It's been my dad's baby for years.

25:41.253 --> 25:43.254
A few days ago,
he hands me the keys.

25:43.964 --> 25:45.506
Generosity of spirit.

25:45.633 --> 25:47.800
Foundation of love, man.

25:47.927 --> 25:49.260
Best dad ever.

25:49.386 --> 25:51.679
Father of the frickin' year.

25:54.099 --> 25:55.725
Oh, I got to get back to work.

25:55.851 --> 25:58.311
Dad's not a big fan of idle hands.

26:09.823 --> 26:11.074
Hey, Nikki.

26:13.452 --> 26:15.161
You remember me?

26:15.287 --> 26:17.622
Yeah. That cop.

26:17.748 --> 26:19.374
Detective.

26:20.793 --> 26:23.962
- The one you shot.
- Jesus Christ.

26:24.088 --> 26:25.713
Here we go again.

26:27.633 --> 26:29.676
I told your boss
everything already.

26:29.802 --> 26:31.886
Well, now you're gonna tell me.

26:34.139 --> 26:35.848
Only this time
you're gonna tell the truth.

26:35.975 --> 26:38.601
I told you. I've been telling
the truth the whole time.

26:38.727 --> 26:41.354
Well, then come here
and tell it to my face.

26:41.480 --> 26:43.815
This is so fucking stupid.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.322
A bit closer
so I can see your eyes.

27:00.332 --> 27:02.834
The night that you got shot,

27:02.960 --> 27:04.877
I was in a hotel room with Johnny.

27:05.004 --> 27:06.254
Bullshit.

27:06.380 --> 27:08.673
We did meth,

27:08.799 --> 27:10.383
we watched porn, we fucked.

27:10.509 --> 27:12.385
I mean, we were watching
cartoons all night.

27:12.511 --> 27:15.054
- What do you want? What do you want?
- You fucking liar.

27:15.180 --> 27:18.933
No matter how many times you ask me,
it's not going to change.

27:19.059 --> 27:21.394
I didn't shoot you, OK?

27:21.520 --> 27:23.479
I didn't kill that old man.

27:23.605 --> 27:25.690
Ow! Fuck!
Jesus Christ!

27:30.779 --> 27:32.739
I'm gonna say I saw you.

27:32.865 --> 27:35.742
People get mugged every day.

27:35.868 --> 27:38.411
Maybe... Maybe somebody else
wanted you dead, huh?

27:38.537 --> 27:39.829
Like who? Like who?

27:39.955 --> 27:43.499
Oh, fuck. You're a fucking cop
for Christ's sakes.

27:43.625 --> 27:45.543
You piss people off for a living.

27:45.669 --> 27:46.794
Fuck you.

27:46.920 --> 27:50.048
Fuck you! Fucking hurting me!

27:50.174 --> 27:51.632
(Whimpers)

27:51.759 --> 27:54.052
You think that hurts?

27:54.178 --> 27:56.554
Try watching the man you love
die right in front of you

27:56.680 --> 27:58.890
with nothing you can do.

28:02.269 --> 28:03.770
Oh, right.

28:05.105 --> 28:07.648
You shot your own boyfriend.

28:09.026 --> 28:12.070
You nasty piece of shit.

28:13.906 --> 28:17.617
(Sobbing) I killed Johnny. I know. I killed...

28:19.578 --> 28:22.663
I do miss Johnny. I know.

28:24.750 --> 28:27.293
If you... If you say

28:27.419 --> 28:29.629
that you saw me kill Frank Lundy,

28:29.755 --> 28:32.924
then you're the liar.
You are the liar!

28:33.050 --> 28:35.051
(Sobbing)

28:41.308 --> 28:43.851
I'd like to be transferred out of Homicide.

28:43.977 --> 28:46.270
Always looking for the next best thing,
eh, Lieutenant?

28:46.397 --> 28:48.981
- Aren't we all?
- Mm.

28:49.108 --> 28:50.775
I could use a change of scenery.

28:50.901 --> 28:54.028
I'm thinking press liaison.

28:54.154 --> 28:57.115
Well, PR could certainly use
your political skills.

28:57.241 --> 29:00.118
And Sergeant Batista
could stay in Homicide.

29:01.578 --> 29:03.788
Well, let me think about it.

29:03.914 --> 29:06.082
We both know
you're not easily replaced.

29:08.127 --> 29:10.253
That didn't seem to be
a problem before.

29:11.672 --> 29:13.631
I'll let you know what I decide.

29:18.345 --> 29:20.304
Hello.

29:20.431 --> 29:22.723
Tell me that's the last of it.
The last bag from your apartment.

29:22.850 --> 29:25.643
It's not from my apartment.
But, Rita, wait, wait.

29:25.769 --> 29:27.687
Surprise for you, for all of you.

29:27.813 --> 29:30.982
No way! A Nintendo DS?

29:31.108 --> 29:33.651
- I know it's not an iPod, but...
- A mini DVD player?

29:33.777 --> 29:35.987
This is awesome.

29:38.115 --> 29:39.991
For Harrison.

29:45.998 --> 29:48.332
And for my lovely wife.

29:51.003 --> 29:52.336
A bread maker?

29:52.463 --> 29:54.046
We're always running out of bread.

29:54.173 --> 29:56.048
We're always running out of milk.

29:56.175 --> 29:57.675
Did you get me a cow too?

29:57.801 --> 30:01.512
- (Cody) Thank you so much!
- This is so awesome. Thank you, Dexter.

30:01.638 --> 30:03.431
You're welcome.

30:13.066 --> 30:16.861
- What's the matter? You don't like your gift?
- I appreciate you trying.

30:16.987 --> 30:18.738
I really do.

30:18.864 --> 30:21.199
But we don't need gifts.

30:21.325 --> 30:23.242
We need you.

30:28.457 --> 30:29.874
Need me to do what?

30:33.337 --> 30:34.712
Just talk to me.

30:36.340 --> 30:38.174
(Babbles)

30:40.052 --> 30:41.302
I'm, uh...

30:41.428 --> 30:43.554
PeopIe just do this?

30:43.680 --> 30:45.806
Say what they're thinking?

30:45.933 --> 30:48.100
Out loud?

30:48.227 --> 30:50.144
(Sighs)

30:51.980 --> 30:55.399
- How hard can it be?
- I'm trying. I'm trying.

30:56.902 --> 30:59.237
(Sniffs) You know what?

30:59.363 --> 31:01.948
You can try harder in therapy.

31:02.074 --> 31:04.408
I'm moving up our next session.

31:09.748 --> 31:11.749
(She chuckles)

31:12.584 --> 31:15.419
Wow. What's the occasion?

31:15.546 --> 31:17.171
I have good news.

31:17.297 --> 31:18.798
You want to guess?

31:18.924 --> 31:21.300
Um, you're naked under there,

31:21.426 --> 31:24.136
- and I get to see?
- (Chuckles)

31:24.263 --> 31:26.639
Guess what else you get to do?

31:26.765 --> 31:29.934
OK, now I'm really having
impure thoughts.

31:30.060 --> 31:32.103
You get to stay in Homicide.

31:36.316 --> 31:37.775
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

31:37.901 --> 31:40.403
- Wow. How did you...
- I had a little talk with the deputy chief,

31:40.529 --> 31:43.781
and I told him Homicide
couldn't afford to lose you.

31:43.907 --> 31:45.533
And neither could I.

31:47.119 --> 31:48.953
You...

31:49.079 --> 31:50.705
are...

31:55.168 --> 31:57.461
So he's OK with both of us staying?

31:58.964 --> 32:02.300
Well, we can talk about
logistics later.

32:02.426 --> 32:03.551
Right?

32:08.098 --> 32:10.516
You told him you'd leave instead.

32:10.642 --> 32:12.351
Angel.

32:12.477 --> 32:14.437
It just makes more sense.

32:14.563 --> 32:16.522
You're full of it.

32:16.648 --> 32:19.066
You're sweet, and you're beautiful,

32:19.192 --> 32:21.819
but you're full of it,
and I can't let you do that.

32:23.322 --> 32:27.325
Well, I'm not gonna
let you leave Homicide.

32:28.493 --> 32:29.869
You love it.

32:29.995 --> 32:31.871
And if you leave, you won't be you.

32:31.997 --> 32:33.914
At least not the you
that I want to be with.

32:35.709 --> 32:36.834
What do we do?

32:41.340 --> 32:43.215
I don't know.

32:44.301 --> 32:46.177
(Sighs)

32:49.848 --> 32:52.850
How are we supposed to decide
what's more important?

32:54.269 --> 32:56.020
Ourjobs or each other?

33:03.695 --> 33:05.404
Shit.

33:07.449 --> 33:09.283
Shit is right.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.166
This is Arthur Mitchell

33:17.292 --> 33:18.709
at his core.

33:18.835 --> 33:22.088
Is there something in his DNA
that Iets him keep a famiIy?

33:22.214 --> 33:24.799
Some magic gene I'm missing?

33:26.677 --> 33:28.761
Looking for something?

33:28.887 --> 33:31.681
- You're surfing on my turf, blood guy.
- I'm just curious.

33:31.807 --> 33:35.476
Then you'll be interested to know
that the mitochondrial DNA...

33:36.520 --> 33:38.354
female.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.107
So mother, daughter, sister...

33:41.233 --> 33:43.776
Ah, could even be his granny
he smudged on that wall.

33:43.902 --> 33:46.612
Probably whacks off
with her ashes.

33:46.738 --> 33:48.739
Why would he do that?

33:49.533 --> 33:50.866
Why wouldn't he?

33:50.992 --> 33:52.785
Because she's important to him.

33:52.911 --> 33:54.704
Dude. Joke.

33:55.914 --> 33:57.998
His history with her shapes who he is.

33:58.125 --> 34:00.543
Like how my mother
breast-fed me till I was six

34:00.669 --> 34:02.670
and now no one will ever match up.

34:07.342 --> 34:08.884
Lieutenant.

34:09.970 --> 34:13.097
It's a Grant 24-ounce
steel framing hammer.

34:13.223 --> 34:14.640
Sorry?

34:14.766 --> 34:16.642
It's the murder weapon
in the bludgeoning case.

34:16.768 --> 34:18.644
I did some independent research.

34:18.770 --> 34:20.312
Updated my report.

34:20.439 --> 34:22.148
Right. Right. Thanks.

34:22.274 --> 34:24.859
Actually, I'm done
with my work for the day.

34:24.985 --> 34:27.987
If it's OK with you, I have some
personal stuff to take care of.

34:28.113 --> 34:31.615
Oh. Take care of the personal stuff, Dexter.

34:32.451 --> 34:35.786
Take very good care.

34:38.457 --> 34:40.291
Sure as hell trying to.

34:49.468 --> 34:51.677
You know those things never go bad.

34:51.803 --> 34:54.180
Oh. Yeah, tell me about it.

34:54.306 --> 34:56.557
I've had these
since I was a rookie.

34:57.601 --> 35:01.437
So I never heard back from you
about being an eyewitness.

35:01.563 --> 35:03.898
That mean you changed your mind?

35:04.024 --> 35:05.524
Yeah.

35:06.610 --> 35:09.445
Just 'cause Nikki's a piece of shit
and my dad was a lying sack

35:09.571 --> 35:11.030
doesn't mean I have to be.

35:13.867 --> 35:15.367
Thanks for talking some sense into me.

35:15.494 --> 35:18.329
Just looking out for my partner.

35:18.455 --> 35:19.497
What's all this?

35:21.833 --> 35:24.251
I'm thinking maybe Nikki Wald
was telling the truth.

35:25.253 --> 35:26.962
Since when?

35:27.088 --> 35:28.672
Since I talked to her myself.

35:28.799 --> 35:30.758
Wait, you what?

35:30.884 --> 35:34.970
I've been going over everything you collected
from Lundy's hotel and...

35:35.096 --> 35:37.097
all his personal effects.

35:38.266 --> 35:41.185
Here's the thing - some of it's missing.

35:41.311 --> 35:44.021
No way. It was all logged in. By me.

35:44.147 --> 35:47.191
Lundy had research books
on that serial killer he was hunting.

35:47.317 --> 35:49.026
And audio tapes.

35:49.152 --> 35:50.736
I saw them in his room.

35:50.862 --> 35:53.239
You still wrapped up in that, Deb?

35:53.365 --> 35:55.407
I don't mean to speak ill,

35:55.534 --> 35:57.618
but the guy was chasing a ghost.

35:59.371 --> 36:02.164
I think that ghost stole his books.

36:03.416 --> 36:06.252
You got to stop.
You're making yourself crazy.

36:06.378 --> 36:09.088
I'm telling you,
someone took Lundy's stuff.

36:09.214 --> 36:12.716
And I'm telling you,
you got to let this go.

36:12.843 --> 36:15.135
Look, I'm sure you're tired.
Why don't you go home...

36:15.262 --> 36:16.804
And what?

36:17.848 --> 36:19.723
Paint my fucking nails?

36:23.061 --> 36:25.187
I'm kind of sick of hearing it, Quinn.

36:26.398 --> 36:28.732
Then I guess I won't say it anymore.

36:35.740 --> 36:38.492
I am no longer seeing
Lieutenant LaGuerta.

36:39.786 --> 36:43.247
I mean, I see her every day, but...

36:43.373 --> 36:44.999
We broke up.

36:45.876 --> 36:48.377
- Officially.
- And permanently.

36:49.170 --> 36:51.338
Are you sure?

36:51.464 --> 36:54.300
Because, frankly, I'm getting
a little sick of the back and forth.

36:55.260 --> 36:56.760
I apologize for the inconvenience.

36:56.887 --> 36:58.929
Well, it's middle-school bullshit,
Lieutenant.

36:59.055 --> 37:01.223
I really don't want
to have this conversation again.

37:01.349 --> 37:04.476
You won't have to. We've both signed
affidavits to make it official.

37:04.603 --> 37:07.771
Our relationship didn't interfere
with any ongoing investigations,

37:07.898 --> 37:10.983
and the department will not be
held liable for any fallout.

37:11.109 --> 37:12.943
Well, that's something at least.

37:13.069 --> 37:15.654
For the record, neither one of us
was sexually harassed.

37:15.780 --> 37:18.949
Yeah, all advances
were very welcomed.

37:19.075 --> 37:22.494
And there was not nor will there be
a hostile work environment.

37:22.621 --> 37:24.997
So it's done.

37:25.123 --> 37:27.041
We're both staying in Homicide.

37:29.794 --> 37:31.962
Let me be clear.

37:32.088 --> 37:34.298
The paperwork you're filing is serious.

37:36.760 --> 37:40.012
If I find out this is bullshit,
there will be consequences.

37:40.722 --> 37:44.391
Severe, career-ending
consequences.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.687
(Elevator bell dings)

37:48.813 --> 37:50.314
Don't, Angel.

37:51.650 --> 37:52.942
It's over.

37:53.068 --> 37:55.402
Right. Sorry.

38:08.041 --> 38:10.751
I should get back to work.

38:16.549 --> 38:21.303
This is the last of it.
My dark passenger's...stuff

38:21.429 --> 38:24.348
and the reason I can't Iet go
of my apartment.

38:24.474 --> 38:26.600
If I don't figure out how to hide this,

38:27.727 --> 38:29.395
I'm gonna Iose my famiIy.

38:30.730 --> 38:32.106
Trinity has the answer.

38:32.232 --> 38:36.193
He's kept his famiIy cIose.
Even after death.

38:48.206 --> 38:49.957
Who did you lose, Arthur?

39:09.310 --> 39:12.312
1959. Sixteen.

39:12.439 --> 39:14.148
Vera Mitchell.

39:14.274 --> 39:16.400
Sister of Arthur Mitchell.

39:17.193 --> 39:18.444
Found dead in a...

39:18.570 --> 39:20.571
Bathtub.

39:24.075 --> 39:26.118
Marsha Mitchell.

39:26.244 --> 39:29.913
1961 . Forty.

39:30.040 --> 39:33.250
Jumped to her death
off the CoIIins CanaI bridge.

39:36.838 --> 39:38.464
Henry Mitchell.

39:38.590 --> 39:41.467
1964. Forty-five.

39:41.593 --> 39:44.595
Died in an aIIey
of a fatal head wound.

39:54.439 --> 39:56.482
Sister, mother, father.

39:56.608 --> 39:59.693
He's recreating their deaths.
Decade after decade.

39:59.819 --> 40:01.945
Cycles of three.

40:06.534 --> 40:09.411
I watched my mother
get sawed into pieces.

40:09.537 --> 40:11.538
Now I cut peopIe up.

40:14.793 --> 40:16.376
We both have skeletons,

40:16.503 --> 40:19.505
which means we both get a cIoset
to keep them in.

40:23.760 --> 40:26.303
Arthur has a closet.

40:27.514 --> 40:30.182
I know aImost everything
about you, Arthur,

40:30.308 --> 40:32.017
except where you hide.

40:32.143 --> 40:34.520
Ready or not, here I come.

40:34.646 --> 40:37.147
(Saw buzzing)

41:20.024 --> 41:22.401
Oh, my goodness.
Kyle, you all right?

41:22.527 --> 41:24.361
Yeah, I cut myself at the build.

41:24.487 --> 41:26.530
I didn't think it was a big deal,
but it won't stop bleeding.

41:27.699 --> 41:29.074
Here.

41:31.870 --> 41:35.205
Right out in the open.
There must be more he's hiding inside.

41:36.457 --> 41:39.459
Come on in.
We got a first-aid kit in the house.

41:42.088 --> 41:44.131
(Grunts) Sorry.

41:44.257 --> 41:47.551
No boots in the house. (Chuckles)

41:47.677 --> 41:50.304
Here, I'll get the kit.
You make yourself at home.

41:50.430 --> 41:52.723
Thanks. I will.

42:02.192 --> 42:04.484
Tacky, but normaI.

42:04.611 --> 42:07.487
His secrets must be
under Iock and key.

42:16.748 --> 42:19.249
Not the dirty Iaundry I'm Iooking for.

42:26.257 --> 42:28.383
- (Rattles)
- Shit.

42:29.761 --> 42:32.512
Arthur has a pIace to put his Iamp.

42:41.147 --> 42:43.815
The dates and locations
from Lundy's books.

42:43.942 --> 42:46.818
Arthur's been using Four WaIIs buiIds
around the country

42:46.945 --> 42:48.946
as a cover to kill.

42:50.156 --> 42:52.157
And these are his trophies.

42:53.284 --> 42:57.162
Hanging right up here on the waII
just Iike his hammer in the garage.

42:58.456 --> 43:00.791
His blood slides.

43:00.917 --> 43:04.002
He doesn't need a secret apartment.
He's hiding in pIain sight,

43:04.128 --> 43:06.922
right in the center of his famiIy.

43:07.048 --> 43:10.050
I'm the one who's Iurking
in the shadows.

43:12.220 --> 43:16.640
And here she is,
Arthur's own dark passenger -

43:18.309 --> 43:20.310
his sister Vera.

43:23.147 --> 43:26.441
The tank is low, but then,
she's been on the road for 30 years.

43:26.567 --> 43:27.567
Kyle!

43:27.694 --> 43:29.319
Hiding in pIain sight is one thing,

43:29.445 --> 43:30.988
but this is your weak spot.

43:31.114 --> 43:33.782
What happens
when it's exposed?

43:35.243 --> 43:37.452
Come out, come out, whoever you are.

43:40.498 --> 43:41.915
OK.

43:42.041 --> 43:44.251
Let's have a look at that hand.

44:02.854 --> 44:05.856
Don't...touch...

44:07.025 --> 44:08.650
my sister.

44:09.360 --> 44:11.361
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

44:12.697 --> 44:14.114
I can't breathe.

44:20.955 --> 44:22.539
I'm... I'm sorry.

44:22.665 --> 44:24.833
(Coughs)

44:25.877 --> 44:27.252
Forgive me. I'm so sorry.

44:27.378 --> 44:29.254
Jesus, Arthur,
what the hell was that?

44:29.380 --> 44:31.048
It's just...

44:32.884 --> 44:34.468
My sister...

44:37.388 --> 44:39.181
She died when I was young.

44:41.351 --> 44:43.060
It was very painful for me.

44:46.064 --> 44:47.564
I understand.

44:49.108 --> 44:51.401
I've lost people too.

44:53.946 --> 44:55.238
Yeah. Have a seat.

45:07.502 --> 45:12.714
If the ashes bother you so much,
why do you keep them out?

45:13.508 --> 45:16.468
Because she's a part of me, Kyle.

45:16.594 --> 45:18.428
Helped make me who I am.

45:23.893 --> 45:26.978
But if your family
ever saw you so upset...

45:27.105 --> 45:29.523
They'd understand.

45:29.649 --> 45:31.525
This is my home.

45:31.651 --> 45:33.068
I can be myself here.

45:36.364 --> 45:39.616
- You make it sound easy.
- (Chuckles)

45:39.742 --> 45:43.161
I used to push people away

45:43.287 --> 45:45.330
because of my past.

45:45.456 --> 45:48.125
Even lost a relationship over it.

45:49.001 --> 45:50.502
Like you.

45:50.628 --> 45:52.337
(Unpeeling bandage)

45:52.463 --> 45:55.882
- But you changed.
- Yeah, I met Sally,

45:56.008 --> 45:57.884
had my kids,

45:58.010 --> 46:00.512
and I realized...

46:00.638 --> 46:04.558
the only way it was gonna work
is if I jumped in with both feet.

46:08.604 --> 46:11.189
Jump in with both feet, huh?

46:13.943 --> 46:16.278
And that saved your family?

46:18.906 --> 46:20.574
Kyle...

46:21.826 --> 46:24.619
my family saved me.

46:33.504 --> 46:35.255
Wait.

46:35.381 --> 46:36.923
I want to give you something.

46:46.976 --> 46:48.894
For the next build.

46:50.229 --> 46:52.689
I thought you should have
your own tools.

46:54.859 --> 46:56.568
It's the least I can do.

46:56.694 --> 46:57.611
Thanks.

46:57.737 --> 46:59.863
For giving me
your murder weapon.

47:00.865 --> 47:02.866
See you at the next build, then.

47:02.992 --> 47:05.202
Wouldn't miss it.

47:05.328 --> 47:07.662
(Dexter) I want to be a part of this family.

47:10.458 --> 47:12.459
And I know I need
to jump in with both feet.

47:12.585 --> 47:13.835
I'm glad, but...

47:13.961 --> 47:15.962
(Dexter) I want to let you in.

47:20.384 --> 47:22.427
Honestly, I don't know...

47:25.223 --> 47:26.723
how.

47:29.769 --> 47:32.812
I never learned.

47:35.775 --> 47:37.567
(Rita) No, of course you didn't.

47:39.403 --> 47:40.820
God, I...

47:40.947 --> 47:42.447
I mean, with your mother and...

47:42.573 --> 47:44.282
What about his mother?

47:44.408 --> 47:46.493
She was murdered
right in front of him.

47:46.619 --> 47:48.328
Wow, that's...

47:48.454 --> 47:50.747
that's quite a history.

47:54.544 --> 47:56.753
And it shaped who I am.

47:58.089 --> 48:00.757
But I want to change.

48:02.593 --> 48:06.263
(Therapist) Let me ask you a question,
Dexter. And I'd like you to be honest.

48:07.265 --> 48:08.598
I'll try.

48:08.724 --> 48:12.435
Would you say that you're afraid
to let Rita get close to you?

48:14.647 --> 48:16.648
- Yes.
- Why?

48:19.944 --> 48:21.987
Because of my past.

48:22.113 --> 48:24.322
Are you afraid she'll abandon you?

48:24.448 --> 48:26.324
Yes.

48:26.450 --> 48:28.118
But Rita is not your mother.

48:30.079 --> 48:33.081
No, definitely not, but if she...

48:34.625 --> 48:37.627
ever sees me
for who I really am...

48:38.963 --> 48:40.547
(Rita) Then what?

48:40.673 --> 48:42.841
You think I would leave?

48:42.967 --> 48:45.010
Yes, absolutely.

48:45.136 --> 48:46.511
(Rita) Oh.

48:46.637 --> 48:49.806
Well, then you've got something
to learn about me.

48:49.932 --> 48:53.935
I married you because
I want to get to know the real you.

48:55.104 --> 48:57.188
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

48:58.065 --> 48:59.482
Dexter.

49:00.318 --> 49:02.193
Tell Rita the truth.

49:02.320 --> 49:04.321
Why did you keep
your apartment?

49:10.953 --> 49:12.662
Because...

49:14.165 --> 49:17.167
I need space...

49:19.670 --> 49:21.921
to keep...

49:22.048 --> 49:23.840
my stuff.

49:25.217 --> 49:27.719
We have a house.
There's plenty of room.

49:27.845 --> 49:30.221
I think what Dexter is trying to say

49:30.348 --> 49:33.350
is that he needs space for himself
in the marriage.

49:33.476 --> 49:37.479
OK, yeah, but I really do need a place

49:37.605 --> 49:40.190
- to put my stuff.
- (Rita) Of course.

49:40.733 --> 49:43.985
Of course.
I'll... I'll give you space.

49:45.446 --> 49:47.530
You will?

49:47.657 --> 49:49.032
Yes.

49:51.243 --> 49:53.620
See what happens
when you're honest?

49:53.746 --> 49:55.872
You get what you need.

49:55.998 --> 49:58.708
(Rita chuckles)

50:18.312 --> 50:20.063
I know you're here.

50:26.696 --> 50:28.363
You always catch me.

50:37.915 --> 50:39.916
Mind if I join you?

51:06.652 --> 51:08.987
Look how beautiful you are.

51:09.113 --> 51:10.655
Mm.

51:10.781 --> 51:13.783
I'll never get tired of hearing that.

51:39.268 --> 51:40.935
You look better.

51:41.061 --> 51:43.021
I feel better.

51:44.106 --> 51:46.024
You know why?

51:46.150 --> 51:47.776
Nikki Wald didn't kill Lundy.

51:49.612 --> 51:50.862
How do you know?

51:50.988 --> 51:52.906
'Cause somebody stole
Lundy's Trinity research.

51:53.032 --> 51:53.948
Me.

51:54.074 --> 51:55.992
And there's only one person
who'd have a reason to do that.

51:56.118 --> 51:57.368
Me?

51:57.495 --> 52:00.371
- Trinity.
- You're kidding.

52:00.498 --> 52:03.708
He must have realized
Lundy was getting close.

52:03.834 --> 52:06.044
Think about it.
That newspaper article.

52:06.170 --> 52:08.755
Maybe he even saw Lundy
staking out that office building.

52:10.007 --> 52:12.842
- I guess.
- He killed Lundy, he shot me,

52:12.968 --> 52:15.220
he stole Lundy's books
to cover his ass.

52:15.346 --> 52:18.264
Not exactIy, but you were
on a roll there for a while.

52:18.390 --> 52:20.016
Do you know how awesome this is?

52:20.142 --> 52:22.060
It means that cocksucker
is still out there,

52:22.186 --> 52:24.395
and I don't have to sit around and wait
for someone else to take care of it.

52:24.522 --> 52:26.105
I can get him.

52:26.232 --> 52:29.400
Great, now I've got to worry
about you getting on Trinity's radar.

52:29.527 --> 52:32.237
- Have you told LaGuerta your theory?
- Not yet.

52:32.363 --> 52:35.532
I need to make sure I have a case first.
I don't want to step on my dick.

52:35.658 --> 52:38.076
No, definitely not.

52:38.202 --> 52:41.287
I got to get to the station.
Lots of work to do.

52:41.413 --> 52:43.540
By the way...

52:43.666 --> 52:45.458
I think I know who dad was fucking.

52:47.169 --> 52:49.254
What? Wait, who?

52:49.380 --> 52:51.047
I'll tell you when I know more.

52:51.173 --> 52:53.842
I don't want to step on my dick
with that either.

53:02.393 --> 53:04.394
So you ready?

53:10.401 --> 53:12.777
l was born of primordial ooze.

53:12.903 --> 53:15.405
l crawled out
of my own mother's bIood.

53:17.616 --> 53:20.535
I hid among the humans,
hoping not to be seen.

53:20.661 --> 53:23.121
But somewhere aIong the way,
I grew Iegs,

53:23.247 --> 53:24.998
stood upright.

53:28.419 --> 53:31.588
- Would you give me a hand?
- Absolutely.

53:32.131 --> 53:34.090
(Grunts)

53:39.805 --> 53:42.599
So what do you think? Is it too stuffy?

53:44.226 --> 53:45.768
Nope.

53:48.522 --> 53:50.690
(Air blowing)

53:53.903 --> 53:55.820
It's perfect.

53:55.946 --> 53:57.238
Thank you.

53:57.364 --> 53:59.908
l became a husband, a father.

54:00.784 --> 54:04.078
l had to evolve.
It was the onIy way to survive.

54:04.538 --> 54:07.206
Wait. I have something else
I want to give you.

54:08.626 --> 54:11.753
Being myseIf in front of my famiIy
wiII take some getting used to,

54:11.879 --> 54:13.630
but Arthur was right.

54:13.756 --> 54:16.758
It does feeI...good.

54:20.137 --> 54:21.888
Got it.

54:22.598 --> 54:23.848
A padlock?

54:23.974 --> 54:26.100
For the door. To keep it locked.

54:27.227 --> 54:29.103
Shouldn't I leave it open?

54:29.229 --> 54:31.314
Please, we have three young children.

54:32.566 --> 54:34.317
There's dangerous stuff in there.
