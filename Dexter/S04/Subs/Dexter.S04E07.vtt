00:02.007 --> 00:03.216
PreviousIy on Dexter...

00:03.342 --> 00:04.884
(Gunshot)

00:05.010 --> 00:07.595
(Batista) Deb's alive.
They're taking her to the hospital.

00:07.721 --> 00:10.765
Trinity's a monster. If he was the one
who hurt your sister, you need to kill him.

00:10.891 --> 00:14.060
(Dexter) I'm gonna foIIow Lundy's theory
and check his hotel room for clues.

00:14.186 --> 00:16.062
You can't let these
be logged into evidence.

00:16.188 --> 00:20.233
I've been going over everything collected
from Lundy's hotel and some of it's missing.

00:20.359 --> 00:24.570
If you say that you saw me kill Frank Lundy,
then you're the liar.

00:24.697 --> 00:26.781
- Nikki Wald didn't kill Lundy.
- How do you know?

00:26.907 --> 00:28.616
Somebody stole
Lundy's Trinity research.

00:28.742 --> 00:31.244
And there's only one person
who would have a reason to do that.

00:31.370 --> 00:32.286
Me?

00:32.413 --> 00:34.205
Trinity.

00:34.331 --> 00:38.209
If you could just help me get an interview
with Debra Morgan.

00:38.335 --> 00:40.878
- You gotta be kidding me.
- It'd be a hero piece about the shooting.

00:41.004 --> 00:44.382
No, add to that the fact that her brother
has a bug up his ass about me.

00:44.508 --> 00:47.844
- I don't care if you're a dirty cop.
- Don't fucking call me dirty.

00:47.970 --> 00:49.804
Last thing I need is a cop mad at me.

00:49.930 --> 00:52.306
How are we supposed to decide
what's more important?

00:52.433 --> 00:53.766
Ourjobs or each other?

00:53.892 --> 00:56.269
- It's over.
- Right.

00:56.395 --> 00:57.562
Sorry.

00:57.688 --> 00:59.897
I'm halfway through
the C.I. files you gave me.

01:00.023 --> 01:01.482
Maybe then I'll finally get some answers.

01:01.608 --> 01:02.984
I think I know who Dad was fucking.

01:03.110 --> 01:05.278
What? Wait. Who?

01:05.404 --> 01:07.113
I'll tell you when I know more.

01:07.239 --> 01:09.282
I know aImost everything about you, Arthur.

01:09.408 --> 01:11.075
Except where you hide.

01:11.201 --> 01:13.411
The dates and locations
from Lundy's books.

01:13.537 --> 01:17.832
Arthur's been using Four WaIIs buiIds
around the country as a cover to kiII.

01:17.958 --> 01:19.792
And these are his trophies

01:19.918 --> 01:21.794
hanging right up here on the waII.

01:21.920 --> 01:25.965
He's hiding in pIain sight
right in the center of his famiIy.

01:26.091 --> 01:27.467
How does he do it?

01:27.593 --> 01:31.179
Only way it was gonna work
is if I jumped in with both feet.

01:31.305 --> 01:33.848
Jump in with both feet.

03:30.090 --> 03:33.175
There's a moment sailors call slack tide:

03:33.302 --> 03:35.928
when the tide is neither
coming in nor going out,

03:36.054 --> 03:37.722
but perfectIy stiII.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.601
lt's a moment frozen in time,

03:41.727 --> 03:44.228
when all is calm and peaceful.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.107
(Phone rings)

03:51.570 --> 03:54.697
The onIy downside to it
is that it passes so quickIy.

03:54.823 --> 03:56.032
Morgan.

03:57.826 --> 03:59.577
Yeah, text me the address.

04:00.412 --> 04:02.204
Gotta go home. Dead body.

04:02.331 --> 04:04.206
We should get back anyway,
I got a lot to do.

04:04.333 --> 04:05.625
I start work again tomorrow.

04:05.751 --> 04:07.627
And you move
into your new apartment.

04:07.753 --> 04:10.004
Yeah, taking over Dexter's old bachelor pad.

04:10.130 --> 04:12.590
You can take me there
on the way home.

04:12.716 --> 04:16.719
As much as we might Iike some things
to remain suspended in time,

04:16.845 --> 04:18.512
they never do.

04:32.277 --> 04:34.278
OK, not what I was expecting.

04:34.780 --> 04:38.491
Well, here's the real surprise.

04:40.619 --> 04:43.829
Mr. Nix found the alligator
on his driveway.

04:43.956 --> 04:45.331
Come up here all the time.

04:45.457 --> 04:47.333
Try to eat my dogs.

04:47.459 --> 04:49.168
This one I was gonna eat.

04:49.294 --> 04:51.462
He shot the animal in the head.

04:51.588 --> 04:53.923
He started to gut him
and he found the arm.

05:00.639 --> 05:02.348
Adult female.

05:02.474 --> 05:04.725
No blood flow from
the ruptured blood vessels.

05:04.851 --> 05:06.852
The bite was postmortem.

05:06.979 --> 05:08.854
What's this?

05:08.981 --> 05:10.189
Ligature marks.

05:10.315 --> 05:13.901
- Her wrists were tied.
- I'm guessing the 'gator didn't do that.

05:14.027 --> 05:16.153
Well, we got a homicide, guys.

05:16.905 --> 05:19.657
Alligator Alley -
a perfect spot to dump a body,

05:19.783 --> 05:23.160
- knowing that it won't last.
- (Dexter) I'll test for fingerprints.

05:24.329 --> 05:27.581
Let's get a search team here.
Maybe we could find some more body parts.

05:27.708 --> 05:29.250
A head would be nice.

05:29.376 --> 05:31.502
(Laughs)

05:35.465 --> 05:36.507
(Sighs)

05:37.509 --> 05:41.637
Dexter, finally. You have to help me
finish my report on African animals.

05:41.763 --> 05:43.889
No, I need him to put up
the shelves in my room.

05:44.016 --> 05:46.142
Actually, guys,
it's been a long day and I'm kinda...

05:46.268 --> 05:47.935
Go easy on him.
He's only one person.

05:48.061 --> 05:49.437
That you know of.

05:49.563 --> 05:51.856
First, you'll help Cody, then Astor,

05:51.982 --> 05:55.568
and then you're gonna help me put
Harrison's baby bouncer together.

05:56.319 --> 06:00.031
- That's a lot of helping.
- Well, that's what daddies are for.

06:06.496 --> 06:09.457
"Debra, call me.
I'd love to speak to you."

06:09.583 --> 06:11.000
She called the other day too.

06:11.126 --> 06:14.086
She wants to do a hero piece on Deb
for the paper.

06:14.212 --> 06:17.339
The Iast thing I need is a reporter
snooping around my house,

06:17.466 --> 06:19.258
my famiIy, me.

06:19.384 --> 06:22.553
(Man) I'm sick of explaining it to you.
It's like you don't even listen to me.

06:22.679 --> 06:24.597
(Woman) Maybe I would listen more...

06:24.723 --> 06:26.515
I've been hearing them a lot lately.

06:26.641 --> 06:28.100
(Harrison chattering)

06:28.226 --> 06:30.227
They don't sound very happy, do they?

06:31.646 --> 06:34.565
Better to find out now
before they get married.

06:36.735 --> 06:38.903
You and I are doing better, right?

06:39.029 --> 06:40.154
Much better.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.947
I'm happy we're in therapy.

06:42.074 --> 06:45.576
You've really opened up to me a lot lately,
Dexter. Don't you think?

06:46.411 --> 06:47.536
Absolutely.

06:48.747 --> 06:50.414
(Cody) Dexter, I'm waiting.

06:51.249 --> 06:52.249
(Sighs)

06:53.877 --> 06:54.877
Dear Abby,

06:55.003 --> 06:57.838
l'm a serial killer and need advice
on how to keep my kids

06:57.964 --> 06:59.632
from taking over my Iife.

07:01.426 --> 07:02.635
No.

07:02.761 --> 07:05.596
There's onIy one person
who can heIp me.

07:12.604 --> 07:14.480
Arthur?

07:14.606 --> 07:15.648
Hey.

07:15.774 --> 07:18.317
- Hey, Kyle!
- Morning.

07:18.443 --> 07:22.363
- Doing a little shopping?
- Yeah, just a few things. You?

07:22.489 --> 07:25.658
Yeah, we needed some supplies
for the next build.

07:25.784 --> 07:27.993
- Let me give you a hand.
- Oh, thank you.

07:28.995 --> 07:30.371
I'll help you load it up.

07:30.497 --> 07:31.997
Oh, good.

07:32.124 --> 07:35.000
So Jonah's not around
to help you this morning?

07:35.127 --> 07:38.254
No, he's got ROTC in the morning,

07:38.964 --> 07:41.757
football practice in the afternoon.

07:41.883 --> 07:43.509
Yeah, no time to help out his dad.

07:43.635 --> 07:44.844
That's too bad.

07:44.970 --> 07:46.762
No, no. It's a good thing.

07:47.764 --> 07:50.599
- Is it?
- Kyle, you're a father.

07:50.725 --> 07:54.186
You know we're responsible
to push our children out into the world,

07:54.312 --> 07:57.481
to make them prepared, self-sufficient.

07:58.483 --> 07:59.859
Right.

07:59.985 --> 08:01.527
(Straining) Yeah, of course.

08:01.653 --> 08:03.154
Push them out. Right.

08:04.114 --> 08:05.656
How do you do that?

08:05.782 --> 08:09.368
You have to encourage
their outside interests.

08:09.494 --> 08:11.203
Jonah's got all his activities

08:11.329 --> 08:13.998
and Rebecca's got her ballet,

08:14.124 --> 08:17.835
and she has college-level science classes.

08:18.753 --> 08:20.212
That sounds very busy.

08:20.338 --> 08:23.007
Well, so busy that I hardly get to see them.

08:23.133 --> 08:25.134
And they hardIy get to see you,

08:25.260 --> 08:27.386
aIIowing you to do
whatever you want.

08:27.512 --> 08:29.722
Simple advice,
but there's got to be more.

08:29.848 --> 08:33.017
So, hey, if you ever need any extra help,
just let me know.

08:33.143 --> 08:35.186
- Oh, thank you.
- Really, I mean it.

08:35.312 --> 08:37.229
- Absolutely.
- It's just that...

08:39.816 --> 08:41.984
- (Sighs)
- Just what?

08:42.736 --> 08:44.445
Well...

08:45.864 --> 08:48.741
Honestly, I'm new here and without
my family, I don't know anybody.

08:48.867 --> 08:50.284
So...

08:54.164 --> 08:55.873
What are you doing tomorrow morning?

08:55.999 --> 08:57.666
Nothing.

08:59.211 --> 09:01.378
Meet me at my house.

09:01.504 --> 09:02.713
6:30.

09:03.715 --> 09:04.715
OK.

09:09.721 --> 09:11.680
(Woman) Hey, Deb, great to see you.

09:13.600 --> 09:14.934
Welcome back, Detective.

09:15.060 --> 09:16.727
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

09:17.270 --> 09:18.979
Hey.

09:19.105 --> 09:20.773
You're getting a hero's welcome, I see.

09:20.899 --> 09:21.941
Hey, welcome back.

09:22.067 --> 09:23.943
Not like they haven't seen me,
I've been around.

09:24.069 --> 09:25.903
Yeah, but now you're officially back.

09:26.029 --> 09:27.696
So glad you're OK.

09:29.991 --> 09:32.618
- Who was that?
- I have no fucking clue.

09:32.744 --> 09:35.746
Take a bullet and suddenly
you're everybody's best friend.

09:35.872 --> 09:38.749
Uh. On the house.

09:38.875 --> 09:39.917
Welcome back.

09:42.295 --> 09:45.297
Fat Jesus on a bike,
get me outta here.

09:45.423 --> 09:47.841
Cover me, bro.

09:47.968 --> 09:50.427
Hi. Dexter Morgan.

09:50.553 --> 09:53.013
Of course. We met before.

09:54.432 --> 09:55.933
Uh, excuse me, I have to talk...

09:56.059 --> 09:57.977
Yeah, that's why I'm stopping you.

09:58.103 --> 10:01.438
As a favor to me, I'd really like you
to not write about my sister.

10:03.483 --> 10:04.984
I think she'll make a great story.

10:05.110 --> 10:07.528
I should interview you as well.
You can give me some background...

10:07.654 --> 10:10.322
No, Debra's recovering
from a serious injury.

10:10.448 --> 10:11.865
She needs to be left alone.

10:12.951 --> 10:14.493
Stay away.

10:14.619 --> 10:16.870
Why don't you, uh,
get us a couple coffees?

10:20.458 --> 10:23.127
What's with the attitude?
She's just trying to do herjob.

10:23.253 --> 10:26.171
Everybody's trying to get a piece of Debra
right now. She's been through a lot.

10:26.298 --> 10:28.424
Your sister's a big girl.

10:28.550 --> 10:30.676
And she can take care of herself.

10:30.802 --> 10:33.012
I don't see why this is any of your business.

10:33.138 --> 10:36.140
Look, I know you and I
have had our little differences.

10:36.266 --> 10:38.976
You might want to keep in mind
how all that started.

10:39.102 --> 10:41.186
So what are you saying?

10:41.313 --> 10:43.355
I'm saying the guy
who saw the other guy

10:43.481 --> 10:48.152
steal the money from the crime scene
wants Christine kept away.

10:50.822 --> 10:52.614
Sorry.

10:52.741 --> 10:54.074
Sorry I'm late.

10:55.201 --> 10:58.037
Actually, that's bullshit.
I'm not late.

10:58.163 --> 11:01.915
I was hiding at the end of the hall so I could
tell you all at once and get it over with.

11:02.042 --> 11:04.877
Um... Thank you, I'm great.

11:05.003 --> 11:06.211
No, I don't need your help.

11:06.338 --> 11:08.589
And, no, I'm not gonna
show you the scar.

11:08.715 --> 11:11.258
So, please,
can we just fucking move on?

11:11.384 --> 11:15.220
And, uh, why is there
a picture of a fucking arm up there?

11:15.347 --> 11:18.557
Well, let's all welcome back
Detective fuckin' Morgan.

11:18.683 --> 11:19.975
(Quinn cheers)

11:21.519 --> 11:24.063
I was just about to ask Sergeant Batista

11:24.189 --> 11:26.065
to update us on his case.

11:26.191 --> 11:27.941
Based on the fingerprints,

11:28.068 --> 11:29.860
we've ID'd the victim

11:29.986 --> 11:33.530
as Estrella Carazo,
19 years old.

11:33.656 --> 11:37.284
She is a citizen of Nicaragua,
here on an expired visa.

11:37.410 --> 11:39.536
Uh, the M.E. estimates that the arm

11:39.662 --> 11:42.081
was ingested less than 72 hours ago,

11:42.207 --> 11:45.626
and the time of death
less than 24 hours prior to that.

11:45.752 --> 11:49.588
She worked as a cocktail waitress
at the Bayside Club,

11:49.714 --> 11:51.465
but she also did some modeling.

11:51.591 --> 11:53.926
She had a job scheduled four days ago
with a photographer

11:54.052 --> 11:55.469
named Jonathan Farrow.

11:55.595 --> 11:57.638
(Batista) He's a big fashion photographer.

11:57.764 --> 11:59.348
(Groaning)

11:59.974 --> 12:02.684
(Man) That's disgusting.
(Woman) What the fuck?

12:02.811 --> 12:04.728
(Man) That is sick.

12:06.106 --> 12:08.273
Even I'm disturbed by this.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.735
Ms. Carazo didn't report for work the night
after she was scheduled to see Farrow.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.987
The kicker is, seven years ago
Farrow was arrested

12:14.114 --> 12:15.489
in New York on suspicion of rape.

12:15.615 --> 12:18.200
- The charges were ultimately dropped.
- So he's clean?

12:18.326 --> 12:20.869
Well, I spoke with the lead detective
of that case,

12:20.995 --> 12:22.663
he thinks the victim was paid off.

12:22.789 --> 12:24.623
OK, so he's dirty.

12:24.749 --> 12:26.792
The guy's surrounded
by a firewall of lawyers.

12:26.918 --> 12:28.460
He's well-protected and playing hardball.

12:28.586 --> 12:29.962
Maybe I'II get a turn at bat.

12:30.088 --> 12:32.631
He's agreed to come in
for questioning this morning,

12:32.757 --> 12:34.842
but I doubt if we'll get
anything out of him.

12:34.968 --> 12:36.510
- I'd like to be there.
- OK.

12:36.636 --> 12:38.762
Well, thank you, Ang... Sergeant Batista.

12:38.888 --> 12:40.931
You're welcome, Lieutenant.

12:46.980 --> 12:48.522
What's with Batista and LaGuerta?

12:48.648 --> 12:50.023
What are you talking about?

12:50.150 --> 12:51.817
They're afraid to look at each other.

12:51.943 --> 12:53.444
Why would that be?

12:54.279 --> 12:56.488
- Because they're doing it?
- Makes sense.

12:56.614 --> 12:59.700
You put two people
in a room together long enough,

12:59.826 --> 13:02.494
- eventually they're gonna fuck.
- Oh, wow.

13:02.620 --> 13:04.079
That's so romantic.

13:04.205 --> 13:06.623
You should have that tattooed
across your fat head.

13:06.749 --> 13:08.208
What?

13:09.878 --> 13:13.172
I'II need to find the right activity for Astor.

13:13.298 --> 13:17.092
What did l like to do when l was 12?

13:17.218 --> 13:19.928
OK, then, moving on.

13:33.276 --> 13:36.069
Hi, this is Mr. Farrow's assistant,
hold please.

13:36.196 --> 13:40.657
Uh, no, I'm sorry. Mr. Farrow is not available
for any bookings right now.

13:45.663 --> 13:49.458
- You have nothing better to do?
- I wouldn't say Farrow's nothing.

13:49.584 --> 13:51.793
Compared to Trinity he is.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.546
Trinity's not going anywhere.

13:54.672 --> 13:57.883
With his kill cycle over he's not a threat
to anyone for the time being.

13:58.009 --> 14:00.802
Not sure I could say the same
about this guy.

14:00.929 --> 14:04.598
(English accent) I haven't the faintest idea
who Estrella Carazo is.

14:08.353 --> 14:09.853
Oh, yes.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.855
She had a nice arse.

14:11.981 --> 14:15.567
I shot her in my studio last Thursday
for a Jamaican rum campaign.

14:15.693 --> 14:18.403
Nothing sells rum like a nice booty.

14:18.530 --> 14:20.447
- What time was that?
- Uh...

14:20.573 --> 14:22.824
Nine a.m. till noon.

14:22.951 --> 14:24.284
Yeah, then I drove down to the Keys

14:24.410 --> 14:27.037
for another commercial shoot
that lasted well into the night.

14:27.163 --> 14:28.580
That can be verified?

14:28.706 --> 14:31.667
By my assistant
and about a dozen other people.

14:32.502 --> 14:33.919
Tell me, Dexter,

14:34.045 --> 14:37.464
what's the real reason
you're stalling on killing Trinity?

14:37.590 --> 14:39.258
I still have things to learn from him.

14:39.384 --> 14:43.178
I spent my entire life trying to teach you
not to be like him.

14:43.304 --> 14:47.432
You also taught me I couldn't
be with people, couldn't get married.

14:47.559 --> 14:50.060
You taught me a lot of things
I learned were wrong.

14:50.186 --> 14:51.728
You're taking a risk here.

14:52.689 --> 14:54.356
Isn't that what life is?

14:55.733 --> 14:56.733
A risk?

14:56.859 --> 15:00.320
(Batista) Any ideas who might have
wanted to harm Miss Carazo?

15:00.446 --> 15:01.572
(Laughs)

15:01.698 --> 15:04.658
Look, the girl was gorgeous
but she was F.O.J.J.

15:04.784 --> 15:06.952
F.O.J.J.?

15:07.078 --> 15:10.789
Fresh off the jumbo jet. Yeah.

15:10.915 --> 15:13.292
Very rural, you might say.

15:13.418 --> 15:14.960
Sensitive guy.

15:15.086 --> 15:18.422
Not like you.
I could make you a star.

15:18.548 --> 15:21.008
I just need to get you in my studio,

15:21.134 --> 15:23.719
whip your clothes off
and rough you up a little bit.

15:25.763 --> 15:29.099
I think you justjumped to the top of my Iist.

15:33.271 --> 15:36.773
It's gonna be so nice
to finally have my own place again.

15:44.574 --> 15:45.490
Nice apartment.

15:45.617 --> 15:47.034
Yeah, right?

15:47.160 --> 15:49.161
I've wanted it for years.

15:49.287 --> 15:50.495
Whose was it?

15:50.622 --> 15:51.747
Dexter's.

15:53.583 --> 15:57.002
No shit?
How come you're just now getting it?

15:57.128 --> 15:59.338
I mean, he got married like,
what, eight months ago?

15:59.464 --> 16:01.548
Well, he kind of held on to it
for a while.

16:01.674 --> 16:03.050
For what, like a secret fuckpad?

16:03.176 --> 16:06.553
No, I think he just
has a problem with change.

16:06.679 --> 16:08.472
He's very slow to evolve.

16:08.598 --> 16:12.434
- Anyway, I should be going.
- Yeah, thanks for the help.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.479
I'm not suppose to lift anything for a while.

16:17.649 --> 16:19.524
(Dexter sighs)

16:19.651 --> 16:22.694
You kept your apartment
after you got married?

16:22.820 --> 16:24.488
What kind of guy does that?

16:25.865 --> 16:27.866
What are you hiding, Dexter?

16:27.992 --> 16:29.660
Stay out of my life.

16:35.833 --> 16:39.252
I know this is, like, your place now
but are you always gonna, like...

16:40.296 --> 16:42.089
have people here?

16:42.215 --> 16:44.424
Yes, Dex, sometimes
I'm gonna have people over.

16:46.469 --> 16:47.803
(Dexter sighs)

16:51.683 --> 16:53.642
This is the rest of your stuff from the house.

16:53.768 --> 16:55.352
Thanks.

16:58.147 --> 17:01.024
I'm picking up right where
Lundy left off with Trinity.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.859
I owe him that much, right?

17:03.569 --> 17:04.778
So look...

17:06.114 --> 17:08.532
There are over 60 deaths
linked to Trinity.

17:09.534 --> 17:13.745
Twelve different cities,
cases leading back to 1979.

17:13.871 --> 17:16.748
I have every little iota
of evidence Frank collected

17:16.874 --> 17:18.542
except what was stolen by Trinity.

17:19.585 --> 17:23.130
And I'm gonna run it all by LaGuerta
tomorrow with the kicker...

17:23.631 --> 17:26.717
that Trinity shot me and Lundy too.

17:28.720 --> 17:30.053
Wow, that's a lot.

17:31.848 --> 17:33.557
Fuck, yeah, it's a lot.

17:34.308 --> 17:37.310
Deb's right, but it sounds
Iike some mad conspiracy theory,

17:37.437 --> 17:40.313
which is exactIy what LaGuerta wiII think
when she hears it.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.065
I'm gonna fuckin' blow her away.

17:45.903 --> 17:49.239
- Are these...
- Dad's old C.I. files.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.578
Didn't know you had 'em.

17:58.374 --> 18:00.917
So you haven't told me how it's going,
your search.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.755
I finally got some real info on
who Dad might have been seeing.

18:04.881 --> 18:06.131
My mother, you mean?

18:06.257 --> 18:09.009
- I'm having coffee with her tomorrow.
- OK, now l'm confused.

18:09.135 --> 18:11.428
- Coffee?
- Her name's Valerie Hodges.

18:11.554 --> 18:13.305
I left a message for her,
like, a month ago,

18:13.431 --> 18:15.265
and she finally called me back.

18:15.391 --> 18:19.227
Not my mother.
Debra's headed in the wrong direction.

18:19.353 --> 18:21.980
But when she realizes that
and gets headed the right way,

18:22.106 --> 18:23.857
Laura Moser leads to Brian Moser,

18:23.983 --> 18:27.444
leads to the lce Truck Killer,
Ieads to Harry Morgan.

18:27.570 --> 18:31.990
So many IittIe stepping stones
that Iay a path directIy to the reaI me.

18:32.116 --> 18:33.408
Let me know how it goes.

18:34.952 --> 18:36.119
I will.

18:41.459 --> 18:42.834
Hi, Dexter.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.044
- Hi, Dexter.
- Hey.

18:44.170 --> 18:46.338
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, buddy.

18:46.464 --> 18:47.798
Tough day?

18:49.967 --> 18:52.803
(Whispers) Elliot's girlfriend
moved out this afternoon.

18:52.929 --> 18:55.305
- Oh, that's too bad.
- What's too bad?

18:56.140 --> 18:58.099
What's too bad is...

18:58.768 --> 19:00.852
that I found all this fun stuff
for kids to do today

19:00.978 --> 19:03.855
and I can't do any of it
'cause I'm too big.

19:03.981 --> 19:04.898
Like what?

19:05.024 --> 19:06.691
Well, for Cody,

19:06.818 --> 19:09.861
I thought he might like
to join the Young Sailors Club.

19:09.987 --> 19:12.697
- Yeah!
- Wow, that's great.

19:12.824 --> 19:15.867
Elliot's son Danny's in that.
I think they have an outing this weekend.

19:15.993 --> 19:17.160
I wanna sail.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.663
Then sail you shall.

19:19.789 --> 19:21.540
What about me?

19:21.666 --> 19:23.625
How does soccer grab you?

19:23.751 --> 19:26.336
- You get to kick things.
- No, thanks.

19:27.338 --> 19:29.756
Well, OK, how about ballet?

19:29.882 --> 19:30.882
Yuck.

19:31.008 --> 19:32.342
OK.

19:33.094 --> 19:35.554
How about the Little Scientists Association?

19:35.680 --> 19:38.181
Why do you hate me so much?

19:41.018 --> 19:42.727
We'll keep working on Astor.

19:42.854 --> 19:45.480
But this is a good idea.
How did you decide to do all this?

19:47.024 --> 19:49.442
Well, I feel it's my responsibility
as their father

19:49.569 --> 19:52.737
to help push the kids
out into the world.

19:52.864 --> 19:55.699
Make them prepared and self-sufficient.

19:55.825 --> 19:58.535
I'm impressed.
Dinner's almost ready.

19:59.036 --> 20:01.538
Good, I've got an early morning meeting.

20:17.263 --> 20:20.056
OK, two seriaI kiIIers go for a ride...

20:20.725 --> 20:25.061
Why do I get the feeIing this joke ends
with onIy one of them coming back?

20:31.694 --> 20:34.696
I've bareIy skimmed the surface
of Arthur Mitchell.

20:36.198 --> 20:39.701
Still so much to learn
about handIing the kids and the wife.

20:43.706 --> 20:45.540
Choose your weapon.

20:46.292 --> 20:47.751
Or maybe not.

20:48.753 --> 20:52.213
I have pIenty of experience
with the chainsaw.

20:52.340 --> 20:55.467
But it's heavy, difficuIt to wieId,
has a short reach.

20:55.593 --> 20:57.594
Um, axe.

21:16.989 --> 21:20.533
This is a little too
"into the woods" for me.

21:21.577 --> 21:23.328
So what is it
we're doing out here?

21:23.454 --> 21:24.746
We're gonna cut down a tree.

21:24.872 --> 21:26.456
Oh.

21:42.807 --> 21:44.474
God damn it!

21:47.019 --> 21:49.020
Want me to give it a try?

22:05.538 --> 22:07.497
(Chainsaw starts)

22:10.793 --> 22:12.460
(Revs chainsaw)

22:32.773 --> 22:34.691
(Dexter) Stand back.

22:34.817 --> 22:36.526
(Crashing)

22:48.748 --> 22:52.208
So...about the kids...

22:52.334 --> 22:55.920
uh, one of them doesn't wanna do
any of the things I suggested.

22:56.047 --> 22:59.215
- So don't make them suggestions.
- What do you mean?

23:00.384 --> 23:02.218
They're just children, Kyle.

23:02.344 --> 23:03.928
If you let them do whatever they want,

23:04.055 --> 23:07.223
they'd suck their thumbs
and diddle themselves all day.

23:11.228 --> 23:14.939
So why did we come out here
instead ofjust go to the hardware store?

23:15.066 --> 23:17.817
I don't want the lumber
in the hardware store.

23:17.943 --> 23:20.445
- This is better?
- Yeah, it's better.

23:20.571 --> 23:24.032
OK, Arthur,
you're a bit off today.

23:45.387 --> 23:46.387
Uh...

23:46.514 --> 23:48.473
Kyle, I didn't mean to hit it.

23:48.599 --> 23:50.266
(Whimpers)

23:52.436 --> 23:56.773
- Of course not. It was an accident.
- Huh, we should go.

23:57.441 --> 23:59.526
It's gonna die. It's suffering.

24:00.986 --> 24:03.363
It needs to be put out of its misery, Arthur.

24:12.123 --> 24:13.915
You need to kill it.

24:15.167 --> 24:17.168
No, I... I can't.

24:17.294 --> 24:20.505
He spent his life
killing innocent people,

24:20.631 --> 24:22.132
but he can't kill Bambi?

24:22.716 --> 24:25.260
This is your new role model, Dex?

24:28.013 --> 24:29.639
It's in pain, Arthur.

24:29.765 --> 24:31.975
Please, I can't.

24:32.643 --> 24:35.812
Get that axe from him.
Kill him now.

24:39.483 --> 24:41.151
Would you like me to kill it?

24:44.321 --> 24:47.198
Would you do that for me?

24:53.664 --> 24:56.082
Now, Dexter. Kill Arthur now.

25:00.838 --> 25:02.046
(Slashing)

25:15.144 --> 25:19.105
Man, early mornings with Trinity
can be murder.

25:19.231 --> 25:20.148
(Quinn) Lieutenant.

25:20.274 --> 25:23.943
The judge won't issue a search warrant
on Farrow's studio.

25:24.069 --> 25:26.446
- (Quinn) No probable cause.
- Well, that's bad news.

25:26.572 --> 25:28.573
Very, 'cause I'm still sure he's our guy.

25:28.699 --> 25:30.366
I think this means he's my guy.

25:30.492 --> 25:32.994
And this case may be bigger
than what we originally thought.

25:33.120 --> 25:35.246
I've got the names
of at least three models

25:35.372 --> 25:37.624
from Central and South America who have

25:37.750 --> 25:40.251
- all gone missing over the past year.
- All here illegally.

25:40.377 --> 25:43.463
(Batista) Now, we know that
at least one of them worked for Farrow.

25:43.589 --> 25:46.799
I figure he picks his victims
knowing that once they've disappeared,

25:46.926 --> 25:49.636
their families have no way of
getting an investigation started.

25:49.762 --> 25:52.138
And I can't get a search warrant
on this come mierda.

25:52.264 --> 25:55.767
FortunateIy, unIike Batista,
l don't need a search warrant.

25:55.893 --> 25:57.727
Keep working it.
Find another way in.

26:04.944 --> 26:08.112
Can I ask you something?
Off the record.

26:08.239 --> 26:09.906
Go for it.

26:10.824 --> 26:14.619
Is it true that you and Batista
are in some kind of relationship?

26:14.745 --> 26:16.496
Excuse me, Detective?

26:18.415 --> 26:21.668
- It's just there's a rumor going around...
- Then please stop spreading it.

26:21.794 --> 26:24.337
As a fellow woman
in a largely male workforce,

26:24.463 --> 26:27.924
I'd think you'd have a little more sensitivity
to this kind of situation.

26:28.050 --> 26:30.969
Sergeant Batista and I
are co-workers and friends.

26:34.598 --> 26:35.598
Shit.

26:38.269 --> 26:42.105
Farrow has a reputation for partying
Iate into the night.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.900
And tonight shouId be no different.

26:54.868 --> 26:57.954
Farrow's trusty assistant cIosing up shop.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.747
Right on scheduIe.

28:06.690 --> 28:08.024
(Sighs)

28:10.319 --> 28:12.362
Estrella Carazo.

28:13.238 --> 28:15.865
Are those tears for real?

28:36.136 --> 28:38.262
I know you Iike to create
images of vioIence,

28:38.389 --> 28:40.306
but this isn't fake bIood I'm seeing.

28:40.432 --> 28:42.934
Someone was hit right here.

28:46.939 --> 28:49.482
Managed to make it this far
before she was...

28:52.820 --> 28:54.737
hit again.

28:56.698 --> 28:57.907
And then here.

29:04.790 --> 29:06.457
A fingernaiI.

29:18.429 --> 29:21.013
Not exactIy CindereIIa's gIass sIipper.

29:21.140 --> 29:22.765
But it is a fit.

29:52.379 --> 29:53.921
- Valerie?
- that would be me.

29:54.047 --> 29:56.257
- Debra Morgan.
- I figured. Sit down.

29:56.383 --> 29:59.010
I left you messages weeks ago.
I figured you weren't gonna call.

29:59.136 --> 30:00.845
Well, I was on a cruise.

30:00.971 --> 30:03.973
Rich old men love to spend money on me.

30:04.641 --> 30:08.519
Um... So you used to work for my dad,
Harry Morgan?

30:08.645 --> 30:09.562
I did.

30:09.688 --> 30:12.648
I still have my sources,
if that's what you're wondering.

30:12.774 --> 30:14.066
Pick up where we left off.

30:14.193 --> 30:16.652
Of course, my fee's gonna be
a little higher now.

30:16.778 --> 30:19.614
No, actually, I just wanted
to ask you about my dad.

30:22.326 --> 30:24.494
Did you and my father...

30:26.163 --> 30:29.665
Did you ever
have a romantic relationship?

30:30.667 --> 30:32.502
Oh, um,

30:32.628 --> 30:36.172
I'm not sure
romantic is the right word.

30:36.298 --> 30:39.717
I was one of his girlfriends,
if that's what you're asking.

30:41.011 --> 30:42.512
There were others?

30:43.514 --> 30:47.767
I think he picked the C.I.s
based on how good we were in the sack.

30:50.979 --> 30:52.855
I'm sorry, that's just...

30:54.858 --> 30:57.068
that's just not the picture
I have of my dad.

30:57.194 --> 30:59.237
Oh...

30:59.363 --> 31:03.574
Hey, I knew he was a hound
when I met him, we all did.

31:05.410 --> 31:07.286
I was one of his favorites, though.

31:07.412 --> 31:10.289
I used to drive him crazy
with this one thing...

31:10.415 --> 31:12.708
That's... That's... That's enough.

31:14.419 --> 31:16.379
Thank you. Thanks.

31:17.381 --> 31:19.882
Does this mean you're not gonna hire me?

31:23.637 --> 31:25.763
(Sighs)
I should have listened to everybody.

31:25.889 --> 31:27.974
It was a huge mistake
to look into Dad's past.

31:28.100 --> 31:30.434
- What happened?
- It's too much.

31:30.561 --> 31:33.437
- I don't need to know all this stuff.
- What stuff?

31:33.564 --> 31:35.940
Dad was fucking Valerie Hodges.

31:37.442 --> 31:40.111
- Really?
- But apparently she was just one of many.

31:41.071 --> 31:43.406
It's every father's nightmare...

31:43.532 --> 31:45.116
disappointing his children.

31:45.242 --> 31:47.410
That doesn't sound like Harry.

31:47.536 --> 31:48.744
Thank you, Dex.

31:48.870 --> 31:51.289
I don't even know
who Harry is anymore.

31:51.415 --> 31:54.542
He's still everything
you remember him to be.

31:55.627 --> 31:56.794
Is he?

31:57.713 --> 31:59.380
We all have secrets, Deb.

32:00.924 --> 32:03.259
Some of them
shouldn't be found out.

32:04.511 --> 32:07.013
I don't have any secrets like that.

32:09.933 --> 32:11.517
No, me neither.

32:11.643 --> 32:13.436
I should just leave it alone.

32:14.396 --> 32:16.147
My mother.

32:16.273 --> 32:19.567
Yeah, I think that's probably
for the best.

32:19.693 --> 32:23.279
- I'll turn these in and be done with it.
- No, you don't have to. I'll do it.

32:23.405 --> 32:25.031
Thanks.

32:33.790 --> 32:36.542
You need to destroy that file, Dexter.

32:36.668 --> 32:38.127
Close that door forever.

33:01.443 --> 33:03.944
I can't Iet her be cut up again.

33:14.790 --> 33:16.082
Hey.

33:16.208 --> 33:18.042
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

33:18.168 --> 33:19.377
Not another gift.

33:19.503 --> 33:23.172
(Whispers) No, it's not a gift.
It's a push, remember?

33:26.009 --> 33:29.553
- What's that for?
- It's for you. It's your new guitar.

33:29.680 --> 33:30.888
Why?

33:31.014 --> 33:34.016
- 'Cause you're gonna take guitar lessons.
- Says who?

33:34.643 --> 33:36.227
Me.

33:36.353 --> 33:37.853
We'll see.

33:40.273 --> 33:41.816
(Rita sighs)

33:41.942 --> 33:46.821
I learned a long time ago you can't force
them to do things they don't wanna do.

33:46.947 --> 33:49.156
Yeah, I guess.

33:49.282 --> 33:51.450
So are you ready
for your big weekend?

33:53.120 --> 33:54.245
What big weekend?

33:54.371 --> 33:57.331
The overnight camping trip
with the young sailors.

33:58.375 --> 34:01.961
I'm not a young sailor; Cody is.
I'm a 30-something sailor.

34:02.087 --> 34:04.130
But you have to go with him.
That's part of the deal.

34:04.256 --> 34:06.424
They need adults with boats.

34:06.550 --> 34:09.093
You're signed up
to take four of the boys.

34:09.219 --> 34:11.220
I didn't realize that.

34:13.056 --> 34:14.348
(Sighs)

34:16.893 --> 34:20.980
I didn't know I'd have to get so involved.
This isn't a good weekend for me.

34:21.106 --> 34:23.816
Dexter, what do you have to do
that's so important?

34:24.735 --> 34:25.901
Stuff.

34:26.820 --> 34:28.946
- Stuff?
- Stuff.

34:29.072 --> 34:31.574
You can't cancel
because of "stuff".

34:31.700 --> 34:33.367
Cody will be so disappointed.

34:34.911 --> 34:37.413
Well, what time do we have to leave
in the morning?

34:37.539 --> 34:39.749
You have to meet
at the docks at eight a.m.

34:39.875 --> 34:42.418
lf l can't do Farrow tomorrow,
I'II do him tonight.

34:42.544 --> 34:44.378
Everything's ready.

34:45.297 --> 34:47.506
Where are you going?

34:47.632 --> 34:49.175
I gotta prep the boat.

34:49.301 --> 34:53.012
If we're camping out, we'll need a tent,
sleeping bags, food, water.

34:53.138 --> 34:55.347
I gotta get two children's life vests.

34:55.474 --> 34:57.975
Abduct Jonathan Farrow
take him back to his studio,

34:58.101 --> 35:00.644
kiII him, cut him to pieces,
dump him in the ocean.

35:00.771 --> 35:03.355
Honestly, Rita,
this is gonna take me a while.

35:04.566 --> 35:07.193
- Do you need some help?
- No, I got it.

35:07.944 --> 35:09.904
This really means a lot to Cody.

35:11.364 --> 35:13.032
Me too.

35:19.414 --> 35:21.207
And suddenIy...

35:21.333 --> 35:23.167
tonight's the night.

35:23.293 --> 35:26.504
Jonathan Farrow, party animaI.

35:26.630 --> 35:30.049
OK, Jonathan,
party Iike there's no tomorrow.

35:38.016 --> 35:40.100
I'm on Mr. Farrow's list.

36:24.604 --> 36:27.439
I don't have aII night.
Neither does Jonathan Farrow.

36:27.566 --> 36:30.234
Excuse me,
could you tell Mr. Farrow

36:30.360 --> 36:34.113
I just saw a homeless guy throwing up
in the back seat of his car?

36:59.556 --> 37:00.472
Quinn?

37:00.599 --> 37:03.893
What is he doing here?
lt couldn't be coincidence.

37:04.895 --> 37:07.146
This whoIe thing
just became too risky.

37:11.067 --> 37:12.902
Can you believe he's here?

37:14.029 --> 37:15.487
Uh, who is he?

37:16.406 --> 37:18.365
That's Quinn.

37:18.491 --> 37:20.284
I've never heard of him.

37:20.410 --> 37:22.620
You'd be making a big mistake.

37:38.345 --> 37:39.261
Hello.

37:39.387 --> 37:41.430
Hello yourself.

37:41.890 --> 37:42.973
You must be Quinn.

37:43.099 --> 37:44.600
I am.

37:48.939 --> 37:50.940
This lab geek
just fucking ditched me?

37:54.277 --> 37:56.987
OK, tonight's not the night.

37:57.113 --> 38:00.032
Guess I'm prepping the boat
to go camping after aII.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.851
The Biscayne Bay, boys!

38:27.978 --> 38:32.189
Home to the Seminole Indians,
the Spanish conquistadors,

38:32.315 --> 38:33.857
cutthroat pirates...

38:33.984 --> 38:37.152
And now Dexter Morgan
and four skinny boys.

38:38.238 --> 38:40.155
Harry used to take me camping.

38:40.281 --> 38:42.282
If I can't kiII Jonathan Farrow tonight,

38:42.409 --> 38:45.494
at least l can make the most
of my time with Cody.

38:46.788 --> 38:48.247
(Laughs)

39:45.555 --> 39:48.015
See, you just pull it tight,
like that,

39:48.141 --> 39:49.850
and that's your bowline.

39:49.976 --> 39:51.477
That's my personal favorite.

39:51.603 --> 39:54.396
You might prefer a taut-line hitch.
I'll show you on the other side.

39:54.522 --> 39:56.106
Or maybe you wanna see a trucker's hitch.

39:56.232 --> 39:57.941
- That's a fun one.
- Dexter?

39:58.860 --> 39:59.818
What?

39:59.944 --> 40:02.112
Can I throw dirt clods?

40:02.238 --> 40:03.906
Oh, OK.

40:05.617 --> 40:07.493
You forgot the rope.

40:07.619 --> 40:09.244
Right.

40:12.665 --> 40:14.291
You seem a little distracted.

40:14.417 --> 40:16.752
Yeah, well, Arthur's technique
of keeping the kids busy

40:16.878 --> 40:19.797
and therefore keeping me free
isn't working out like it was supposed to.

40:19.923 --> 40:22.049
So maybe it's time to kill him.

40:22.759 --> 40:24.259
After Farrow.

40:43.905 --> 40:45.572
(Phone rings)

40:50.245 --> 40:51.161
Hey.

40:51.287 --> 40:53.413
I just got the official go-ahead
from LaGuerta

40:53.540 --> 40:56.416
to open a Trinity Killer investigation.

40:57.043 --> 40:58.544
Really?

40:59.838 --> 41:02.089
She went for the whole...

41:02.215 --> 41:03.674
serial killer thing?

41:03.800 --> 41:07.511
OK, let's call it
a limited Trinity investigation.

41:07.637 --> 41:09.096
What's that mean?

41:09.222 --> 41:12.224
Right before I went in, I realized
if I pitched the entire Trinity theory

41:12.350 --> 41:15.352
and I added that he also
shot me and Lundy,

41:15.478 --> 41:18.814
I'd look like a fucking lunatic, so I boiled it
down to the bare essentials.

41:20.024 --> 41:20.941
Which are?

41:21.067 --> 41:23.652
The bIudgeonings.
They stiII go back 30 years.

41:23.778 --> 41:27.406
So I can investigate Trinity without LaGuerta
knowing I'm investigating Trinity.

41:28.491 --> 41:30.325
Smart.

41:30.451 --> 41:32.077
What's the next step?

41:32.871 --> 41:35.038
I don't know.

41:35.165 --> 41:38.500
I don't know, but what I do know
is that Trinity killed Frank.

41:38.626 --> 41:40.335
And I'm gonna catch him.

41:40.461 --> 41:42.129
I'm sure you will.

41:48.261 --> 41:51.680
So, Sarge.
What's this about you and LaGuerta?

41:51.806 --> 41:53.182
A little bump and grind?

41:54.392 --> 41:58.687
Do not talk about Lieutenant LaGuerta
that way. Comprende?

41:58.813 --> 42:00.355
Wow.

42:00.481 --> 42:01.690
Sorry.

42:01.816 --> 42:03.483
You must really dig her.

42:06.446 --> 42:07.779
(Speaking Spanish)

42:14.829 --> 42:16.747
- Angel.
- Quinn just asked me

42:16.873 --> 42:19.416
if you and I were
bumping and grinding.

42:21.169 --> 42:23.754
Debra Morgan
asked me the same thing.

42:23.880 --> 42:25.422
Well, not in those words.

42:25.548 --> 42:27.966
- Where are they getting this from?
- I don't know.

42:28.092 --> 42:29.384
It's you.

42:30.220 --> 42:32.054
- The way you keep looking at me.
- (Laughs)

42:32.180 --> 42:34.264
Everywhere I go
you're staring at my culo.

42:34.390 --> 42:37.226
OK, that is so not true.

42:37.352 --> 42:38.352
It is too.

42:38.478 --> 42:39.895
Now I know...

42:40.897 --> 42:42.773
that I have a pretty nice ass...

42:42.899 --> 42:43.815
(Laughs)

42:43.942 --> 42:45.776
..but you gotta stop.

42:50.490 --> 42:53.242
I miss you, Angel.

42:55.828 --> 42:57.246
I miss you too.

42:59.249 --> 43:02.417
- But we made our choice.
- Yeah, yeah.

43:10.301 --> 43:12.135
When all of a sudden,

43:12.262 --> 43:14.972
they heard a scratching noise
on the roof of the car.

43:15.098 --> 43:16.765
(Makes scratching noise)

43:20.270 --> 43:23.355
(Whispers) "What was that?"
And they thought, "Let's get outta here."

43:23.481 --> 43:25.899
And they drove home
as fast as they could.

43:26.025 --> 43:27.609
And when they got home,

43:27.735 --> 43:31.989
he went around to open the car door
for his girlfriend,

43:32.115 --> 43:35.492
and there hanging from the handle,

43:35.618 --> 43:37.703
a bloody hook!

43:37.829 --> 43:39.496
(Laughter)

43:41.916 --> 43:44.334
That doesn't even make sense.

43:44.460 --> 43:45.836
Your turn, Dexter.

43:45.962 --> 43:50.340
Uh, actually, I don't know any scary stories.

43:50.466 --> 43:53.468
- Oh, come on. Give it a shot.
- (Kids) Come on.

43:54.762 --> 43:56.096
All right.

43:59.309 --> 44:00.976
There's a man.

44:04.939 --> 44:07.274
You can call him
the Man of Three.

44:07.400 --> 44:09.067
You can call him Trinity.

44:11.654 --> 44:15.115
You can call him anything you want
but the fact is he's not a man at all,

44:15.241 --> 44:16.783
he's a monster.

44:18.077 --> 44:21.038
He was born in a bathtub
filled with blood.

44:23.082 --> 44:27.044
For countless years he's roamed
the countryside killing the innocent,

44:27.170 --> 44:30.964
leaving behind
bits of his dead sister.

44:33.676 --> 44:37.929
Sometimes he'll sneak up on a man

44:38.056 --> 44:40.807
and raise his hammer overhead...

44:42.352 --> 44:43.602
and then he'll swing it down...

44:43.728 --> 44:46.563
Smash his own thumb
and then go crying all the way home,

44:46.689 --> 44:48.231
like a little baby.

44:49.567 --> 44:51.026
That's what happens!

44:52.737 --> 44:55.155
- That was funny.
- Thanks.

44:55.281 --> 44:57.824
And now I think it's time
to hit the sleeping bags.

44:57.950 --> 45:01.370
You guys are beat.
You've had a huge day.

45:24.560 --> 45:25.685
Hey, buddy.

45:25.812 --> 45:27.270
You need anything?

45:27.397 --> 45:28.438
I'm good.

45:28.564 --> 45:30.232
Do you need anything?

45:31.359 --> 45:33.360
No, I'm good too.

45:47.500 --> 45:49.751
It's onIy nine o'cIock.

45:49.877 --> 45:51.795
The kids won't wake up tiII it's Iight out.

45:51.921 --> 45:53.588
PIenty of time for me.

47:09.499 --> 47:12.834
(Farrow) What the hell is going on?
What is this?

47:12.960 --> 47:14.294
(Dexter) This...

47:16.005 --> 47:18.048
is the decisive moment.

47:22.261 --> 47:26.598
What's the name of the photographer
who always talked about that?

47:26.724 --> 47:29.392
- Cartier-Bresson.
- Right. Right.

47:32.021 --> 47:33.897
Once you miss it
it's gone forever,

47:34.023 --> 47:35.899
a perfect moment...

47:36.943 --> 47:39.110
frozen in time.

47:39.237 --> 47:41.613
Something like that, right?

47:41.739 --> 47:43.073
Yes, but...

47:43.199 --> 47:45.909
Ow! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

47:47.870 --> 47:49.329
Who are you?

47:50.540 --> 47:54.543
I'm the person who's going to keep you
from killing any more women.

47:55.378 --> 47:58.380
What? I've never killed anyone.

47:59.507 --> 48:02.509
You killed Estrella Carazo.

48:03.719 --> 48:05.428
Who knows how many others?

48:05.555 --> 48:09.182
I didn't fucking kill them!
I photographed them!

48:09.308 --> 48:13.562
- It's too fucking bad they're dead but I...
- "Too fucking bad they're dead."

48:14.146 --> 48:16.439
Life is...is hard,

48:16.566 --> 48:18.441
and it's brutal and ugly,

48:18.568 --> 48:20.360
and way too fucking short!

48:20.486 --> 48:23.613
That's why I shoot what I do,
beautiful women!

48:23.739 --> 48:27.784
Who are bruised and cut and bleeding.

48:27.910 --> 48:28.952
Oh, fuck.

48:29.078 --> 48:31.955
It's for the contrast!

48:32.081 --> 48:35.792
You add a little bit of the real world.
It makes them all the more beautiful.

48:35.918 --> 48:37.460
Until you kill them.

48:40.631 --> 48:42.924
If they could thank me,
they fucking would.

48:43.050 --> 48:46.344
Because of my pictures,
those women will live on forever!

48:46.470 --> 48:48.597
Nothing lasts forever.

48:48.723 --> 48:49.764
(Screaming)

49:04.530 --> 49:07.324
Man has aIways been drawn to the sea.

49:11.704 --> 49:14.289
But it's an unnaturaI setting for us,

49:14.415 --> 49:16.416
a pIace of great danger.

49:26.469 --> 49:28.511
Tides, currents,

49:28.638 --> 49:31.097
waves, wind...

49:31.682 --> 49:34.059
each presenting their own hazards,

49:34.185 --> 49:35.852
none of which can be ignored.

49:43.319 --> 49:45.195
The sIightest Iapse ofjudgment

49:45.321 --> 49:48.657
can be a mistake
you might never recover from.

49:52.203 --> 49:56.706
But a good saiIor doesn't fight
against these eIements.

50:07.176 --> 50:11.554
A good saiIor works with them,
using them to his advantage.

50:11.681 --> 50:15.517
While others less fortunate
might be forever cast adrift,

50:15.643 --> 50:18.144
often in several pieces,

50:18.270 --> 50:20.230
he aIways comes home safeIy.

50:40.918 --> 50:42.585
What the hell?

50:47.842 --> 50:49.926
- Isn't that...
- Farrow's assistant.

50:50.052 --> 50:52.887
I just arrested him
for the murder of Estrella Carazo.

50:54.014 --> 50:55.598
- But, no, I thought...
- Yeah.

50:55.725 --> 50:57.809
At first it looked like Farrow,
but this is airtight.

50:57.935 --> 51:01.813
We got camera footage from the tollbooth
of him heading over to Alligator Alley.

51:01.939 --> 51:04.566
We got DNA evidence.
We got everything.

51:29.633 --> 51:31.301
I killed an innocent man.
