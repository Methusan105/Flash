WEBVTT

00:02.049 --> 00:03.966
PreviousIy on Dexter.

00:05.386 --> 00:07.095
You need to kill it.

00:07.221 --> 00:08.471
No, I-I can't.

00:08.597 --> 00:11.224
(Harry) What's the real reason
you're stalling on killing Trinity?

00:11.350 --> 00:13.601
(Dexter) I still have things
to learn from him.

00:13.727 --> 00:16.145
Judging from the spray,
we're looking at somebody tall,

00:16.271 --> 00:17.730
over six feet.

00:17.856 --> 00:19.691
(Dexter) He moved the arm...

00:19.817 --> 00:21.317
for a reason.

00:21.443 --> 00:23.820
(Masuka) That smudge you found
at the crime scene?

00:23.946 --> 00:26.239
Cremated human remains.

00:26.365 --> 00:27.907
We got the killer's goddamn DNA?

00:28.033 --> 00:30.451
The killer is related
to the human remains.

00:30.577 --> 00:32.286
Same family. The same DNA.

00:32.413 --> 00:35.123
He keeps his family
with him all the time.

00:35.249 --> 00:36.374
Vera Mitchell.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.876
Sister of Arthur Mitchell.

00:39.002 --> 00:40.253
Found dead in a...

00:40.379 --> 00:41.295
Bathtub.

00:41.422 --> 00:43.965
This is Arthur Mitchell at his core.

00:44.091 --> 00:47.009
Is there something in his DNA
that Iets him keep a famiIy,

00:47.136 --> 00:49.345
some magic gene I'm missing?

00:49.471 --> 00:51.264
I just got the official
go-ahead from LaGuerta

00:51.390 --> 00:53.307
to open a Trinity Killer investigation.

00:53.434 --> 00:54.642
What's that mean?

00:54.768 --> 00:57.437
I realized if I pitched
the entire Trinity theory

00:57.563 --> 00:59.689
and I added that he also
shot me and Lundy,

00:59.815 --> 01:00.898
look like a fucking lunatic,

01:01.024 --> 01:03.192
so I boiled it down
to the bludgeonings.

01:03.318 --> 01:05.737
I am no longer seeing
Lieutenant LaGuerta.

01:05.863 --> 01:07.530
We broke up, officially.

01:07.656 --> 01:10.491
If I find out this is bullshit,
there will be consequences -

01:10.617 --> 01:13.494
severe, career-ending
consequences.

01:13.620 --> 01:14.871
Who are you?

01:14.997 --> 01:16.914
I'm the person
who's going to keep you

01:17.040 --> 01:18.583
from killing any more women.

01:18.709 --> 01:20.168
I didn't fucking kill them!

01:20.294 --> 01:22.879
Because of my pictures,
those women will live on forever!

01:23.005 --> 01:25.298
- Nothing lasts forever.
- (Screams)

01:26.300 --> 01:28.509
- Isn't that...
- Farrow's assistant.

01:28.635 --> 01:30.845
I just arrested him for
the murder of Estrella Carazo.

01:30.971 --> 01:32.472
But, no, I thought...

01:32.598 --> 01:34.682
Yeah, at first it looked like Farrow,
but this is airtight.

01:34.808 --> 01:37.310
We got DNA evidence.
We got everything.

01:37.436 --> 01:39.729
I killed an innocent man.

03:39.558 --> 03:42.351
So l made a mistake.
It couId've happened to anyone -

03:42.477 --> 03:44.687
weII, any murderer -

03:44.813 --> 03:46.439
not that murderers typicaIIy care

03:46.565 --> 03:49.150
whether their victims
are innocent or not.

03:49.276 --> 03:51.527
But why is it eating at me?

03:55.157 --> 03:59.160
Jonathan Farrow - S&M photographer,

03:59.286 --> 04:01.203
abuser of women,

04:01.330 --> 04:03.372
asshole, but not a killer -

04:03.498 --> 04:05.833
not up to Harry's code.

04:05.959 --> 04:07.251
Yet l killed him.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.170
Now l'm...

04:10.130 --> 04:12.298
uncomfortable.

04:14.301 --> 04:16.928
lt should've been
Arthur MitcheII on my tabIe.

04:17.554 --> 04:18.512
(Sighs)

04:18.639 --> 04:20.765
Trinity, shooter of my sister.

04:20.891 --> 04:22.558
l should've...

04:23.602 --> 04:27.104
No, no "should'ves."
l don't do "should'ves." That's not me.

04:30.359 --> 04:31.692
(Whispers) This isn't me.

04:31.818 --> 04:33.486
Aah, shit.

04:33.612 --> 04:36.197
I just need to stop thinking about it.

04:36.323 --> 04:37.949
Jonathon Farrow...

04:38.075 --> 04:41.243
originally a suspect,
now possibly a victim.

04:41.370 --> 04:43.371
lt was a mistake, for fuck's sake.

04:43.497 --> 04:45.831
Farrow disappeared
right before his assistant,

04:45.958 --> 04:49.043
Timothy Brand, confessed
to murdering those models.

04:49.169 --> 04:51.545
Missing persons
has been investigating,

04:51.672 --> 04:53.047
and now they're passing it on to us.

04:53.173 --> 04:54.715
You think Brand killed Farrow?

04:54.841 --> 04:57.551
Maybe he found out what Brand
was up to, it's hard to say.

04:57.678 --> 05:00.179
Soderquist, Yale, stay with Farrow.

05:00.305 --> 05:02.264
Brand probably
turned him into gator bait.

05:02.391 --> 05:03.849
l wish l could take comfort

05:03.976 --> 05:06.060
that my crime
has been pinned on Brand.

05:06.186 --> 05:08.020
But l can't.

05:08.146 --> 05:10.272
What is wrong with you?

05:10.399 --> 05:11.649
(Sighing) I don't know.

05:11.775 --> 05:15.236
OK, moving on. Morgan...
what do we have on your bludgeonings?

05:15.362 --> 05:17.571
Maybe this'll cheer you up.

05:17.698 --> 05:20.658
Not if you're making headway on Trinity.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.331
We've got a serial bludgeoner.

05:27.457 --> 05:29.875
The victims are all men in their 40s.

05:30.002 --> 05:31.585
I've got cases
dating back 30 years,

05:31.712 --> 05:35.423
which most likely puts
our bludgeoner in his 50s or 60s.

05:35.549 --> 05:37.842
The break in the case
came with the discovery

05:37.968 --> 05:39.885
of the human ash
he left behind,

05:40.012 --> 05:41.971
along with his own saliva -

05:42.097 --> 05:43.305
read DNA.

05:43.432 --> 05:45.725
You're welcome.
Just doing myjob.

05:45.851 --> 05:48.936
The killer leaves the ash
as his sick-ass signature,

05:49.062 --> 05:51.897
making his vics point at it postmortem.

05:52.024 --> 05:54.233
I can't be sure
all of these are ash marks,

05:54.359 --> 05:57.069
but the finger-pointing indicates
a strong possibility that...

05:57.195 --> 05:59.572
Ahh, how'd that get in there?

06:01.283 --> 06:03.659
No, whoa. Could you go back?

06:04.786 --> 06:06.579
Go back.

06:08.415 --> 06:09.999
This isn't a bludgeoning.

06:10.125 --> 06:11.709
No.

06:12.919 --> 06:16.297
Yet the victim's finger seems
to be pointing towards a smudge.

06:16.423 --> 06:17.923
Ash?

06:18.592 --> 06:19.842
Don't do it, Deb.

06:19.968 --> 06:21.886
Uh...

06:22.929 --> 06:24.346
Yeah, probably.

06:24.473 --> 06:30.019
When you presented this case to me,
you said it was limited to a bludgeoner.

06:32.272 --> 06:35.649
So how about we hear all of it,
Detective Morgan?

06:35.776 --> 06:37.651
It's gonna sound insane...

06:37.778 --> 06:39.445
I hope.

06:40.614 --> 06:44.033
All right.
I found possible smudges

06:44.159 --> 06:47.244
in several old bathtub killings.

06:48.413 --> 06:50.956
Also several jumper suicides.

06:51.083 --> 06:52.750
And that's the pattern -

06:52.876 --> 06:55.169
bathtub, jumper, bludgeon -

06:55.295 --> 06:57.463
all in close succession.

06:57.589 --> 07:01.008
One cycle of three vics
every year or so,

07:01.134 --> 07:02.843
possibly for 30 years.

07:02.969 --> 07:04.887
Different cities, different states.

07:05.013 --> 07:08.140
It's a...a trinity of victims...

07:09.101 --> 07:11.644
which is why Frank Lundy
called him the Trinity Killer.

07:11.770 --> 07:14.313
- This is an FBI case?
- The FBI never bought it.

07:14.439 --> 07:15.731
Yet we're supposed to.

07:15.857 --> 07:18.818
Lundy came to Miami
to hunt this guy.

07:20.445 --> 07:24.323
I think he got too close,
and I think it got him killed and me shot.

07:25.283 --> 07:30.412
So this Trinity Killer
did that to you?

07:30.539 --> 07:33.749
Come on, LaGuerta,
say it's far-fetched.

07:36.837 --> 07:38.212
Go on.

07:38.338 --> 07:41.173
Great, Iike I need you peopIe
getting in my way.

07:41.299 --> 07:44.343
WeII, Trinity is past his due date.
This just confirms it.

07:44.469 --> 07:47.012
Dex. Can you believe it?

07:47.139 --> 07:50.266
- Yeah, you really did it.
- I kept Lundy's legacy alive.

07:50.392 --> 07:51.767
I even got the bosses on board.

07:51.893 --> 07:54.687
Detective Morgan, my office.

07:54.813 --> 07:56.564
Is that a commendation I smell?

07:56.690 --> 07:58.023
Go get 'em, tiger.

07:58.150 --> 07:59.567
Ess.

07:59.693 --> 08:01.193
Tigress.

08:05.323 --> 08:07.908
Dex. Hey, buddy.

08:08.034 --> 08:10.161
Keep waIking. Not in the mood.

08:10.287 --> 08:11.745
Halftime?

08:11.872 --> 08:14.373
It's called lunch, buddy.

08:14.499 --> 08:16.250
Off campus, as usual.

08:16.376 --> 08:18.294
(Elevator bell dings)

08:18.420 --> 08:21.172
I reaIIy do need to stab something.

09:12.098 --> 09:14.099
The Trinity KiIIer.

09:16.603 --> 09:18.145
This is good.

09:18.271 --> 09:20.814
There's no question of his guiIt,

09:20.941 --> 09:23.317
and I couId use some certainty.

09:23.443 --> 09:25.778
Hey, Jonah,
how those wheels holding up?

09:25.904 --> 09:27.529
Like a dream, Mr. Butler.

09:27.656 --> 09:29.323
Like a real nice dream.

09:29.449 --> 09:31.158
Kyle!

09:32.744 --> 09:36.163
Hey. What brings you here
this fine day?

09:36.289 --> 09:37.957
Ah, just checking in.

09:38.083 --> 09:40.209
You know, after the...

09:40.335 --> 09:42.503
..deer.
Wanted to make sure you're OK.

09:42.629 --> 09:45.798
Oh, that's kind of you,
but I've put it out of my mind,

09:45.924 --> 09:48.259
no need to dwell.

09:48.385 --> 09:49.885
You can just do that?

09:50.011 --> 09:53.681
No, no, no.
Smooth, circular motion, son,

09:53.807 --> 09:56.267
- and the paint job will last for years.
- I got it, Dad.

09:56.393 --> 09:58.310
If you've got it,
I wouldn't have to remind you.

09:58.436 --> 10:01.063
There are two ways to do things.
Why not choose the right way?

10:01.189 --> 10:03.691
SmaII cracks in the perfect famiIy,

10:03.817 --> 10:06.360
which makes them perfectIy normaI.

10:07.153 --> 10:08.487
(Door opens)

10:09.823 --> 10:11.657
- Kyle, hello.
- Hey.

10:11.783 --> 10:15.494
Honey, your clothes are clean,
folded, and ready to be packed.

10:16.329 --> 10:17.663
Going out of town?

10:17.789 --> 10:19.498
- Yeah, Tampa.
- Oh.

10:19.624 --> 10:20.708
A Four Walls build.

10:20.834 --> 10:23.961
An out-of-town buiId - is his cycIe
starting over again aIready?

10:24.087 --> 10:25.421
- Rebecca.
- Mm-hm?

10:25.547 --> 10:28.215
The ground needs
to be really soaked.

10:28.341 --> 10:30.718
A good soaking, or all these
flowers are just gonna die.

10:30.844 --> 10:32.303
OK, sorry.

10:34.431 --> 10:36.265
So, Tampa -
the whole family going?

10:36.391 --> 10:38.058
No, not on out-of-towners.

10:38.184 --> 10:39.935
It's too expensive to put 'em all up.

10:40.061 --> 10:41.562
Oh, admit it, Arthur.

10:41.688 --> 10:44.189
You enjoy those vacations from us.

10:44.316 --> 10:47.359
He always comes home
so relaxed.

10:47.485 --> 10:49.611
I'm sure.

10:49.738 --> 10:53.240
- You leaving today?
- No, tomorrow, right from work.

10:53.366 --> 10:54.908
There's the where and the when.

10:55.035 --> 10:58.370
An out-of-town kill -
Trinity's own MO.

10:58.496 --> 10:59.955
How poetic.

11:00.081 --> 11:01.415
Well, happy travels.

11:01.541 --> 11:03.792
Take care, Kyle.

11:03.918 --> 11:05.919
Now I need to come up
with my own where and when

11:06.046 --> 11:09.548
to convince my boss
and my wife to Iet me Ieave.

11:12.677 --> 11:16.096
All l need is some convention
that smeIIs a IittIe Iike bIood spatter,

11:16.222 --> 11:18.891
something science-y.

11:19.684 --> 11:21.602
Brake and muffler exhibit - no.

11:21.728 --> 11:24.313
Knitting and needIepoint
convention -

11:24.439 --> 11:26.607
no blood there unless
someone impaIes themseIves.

11:26.733 --> 11:29.026
A trade show convention.

11:30.570 --> 11:33.072
Wow, a convention on conventions.

11:37.869 --> 11:39.536
Remember me?

11:40.663 --> 11:42.956
Debra Morgan, sister.

11:43.083 --> 11:45.376
Debra Morgan,
former detective on the Trinity case.

11:45.502 --> 11:46.627
Former?

11:46.753 --> 11:48.545
Fucking LaGuerta
took me off the case,

11:48.671 --> 11:51.590
'cause officially I'm a victim
of this cocksucker's crimes.

11:53.510 --> 11:55.094
That's too bad.

11:55.220 --> 11:56.887
Too bad?

11:57.013 --> 11:59.765
(Chuckles) It fucking sucks.

12:01.267 --> 12:03.268
Well, the bright side
is this frees you up

12:03.395 --> 12:06.438
to help the department
in so many ways.

12:06.564 --> 12:08.982
In the course of one day,

12:09.109 --> 12:13.487
I go from bringing in the biggest case
Miami Metro has ever seen

12:13.613 --> 12:15.656
to being "freed up in so many ways"?

12:15.782 --> 12:17.866
(Sighs)

12:17.992 --> 12:20.786
I love you, bro, but sometimes
you're a fucking 'tard.

12:20.912 --> 12:22.788
Yeah, I know.

12:27.127 --> 12:28.836
(Computer beeps)

12:28.962 --> 12:30.796
Tampa. What the hell's in Tampa?

12:34.342 --> 12:36.009
Something science-y.

12:36.136 --> 12:38.345
A crime scene is basically
a micro-climate

12:38.471 --> 12:39.721
subject to so many variables.

12:39.848 --> 12:42.433
In the world of blood spatter,
those variables can mean the difference

12:42.559 --> 12:44.309
between good science
and the guilty going free.

12:44.436 --> 12:46.728
Everything from the anomalous
effects of barometric pressure

12:46.855 --> 12:49.857
on particulate liquids
in a high-humidity environment

12:49.983 --> 12:52.025
- to the ionization of...
- Point, please.

12:52.152 --> 12:53.360
Oh.

12:53.486 --> 12:55.571
Meteorological conference, Tampa.

12:56.531 --> 12:58.699
If I let you go, will you stop talking?

12:58.825 --> 13:01.452
You see, learning even more
about hemoglobin dispersion

13:01.578 --> 13:04.705
and the magnetic effects of lightning
in the case of severe thunderstorms

13:04.831 --> 13:05.956
could prove invaluable,

13:06.082 --> 13:08.417
because it can all be
considered causal

13:08.543 --> 13:10.878
in the determination
of bloodstain analysis.

13:16.050 --> 13:17.342
Oh...

13:17.469 --> 13:18.510
Is that it?

13:18.636 --> 13:20.888
That's all I could come up with.

13:21.014 --> 13:23.807
Well, it sounds like you're very excited
about this conference.

13:23.933 --> 13:27.436
Not to mention how it will look
when my salary review comes up.

13:27.562 --> 13:30.022
We could start paying
for your college.

13:30.148 --> 13:32.524
I love your dedication...

13:32.650 --> 13:35.235
to work, to this family.

13:35.361 --> 13:37.446
It's one of the reasons
why I married you.

13:37.572 --> 13:39.948
- One of the many, right?
- Right.

13:40.074 --> 13:41.909
- (Harrison coos)
- You know, and, actually,

13:42.035 --> 13:43.702
Elliot's taking the kids fishing,

13:43.828 --> 13:46.830
so they'll be busy
at least one of those days.

13:46.956 --> 13:49.791
He's a good neighbor, that Elliot.

13:49.918 --> 13:52.586
But I do need some space too,

13:52.712 --> 13:54.254
so I'll trade you.

13:54.380 --> 13:56.298
I'll cover the kids this weekend,

13:56.424 --> 13:58.550
and you cover them Tuesday nights
when I go to yoga?

13:58.676 --> 14:00.093
Yoga?

14:00.220 --> 14:01.637
It's the new me.

14:01.763 --> 14:03.388
Well, I like the new you.

14:06.184 --> 14:07.893
Though scheduIing my activities

14:08.019 --> 14:11.563
around her downward-facing dog
couId prove chaIIenging.

14:13.733 --> 14:15.734
l'll dwell on that later.

14:25.203 --> 14:28.539
What does one pack
for an out-of-town kill?

14:28.665 --> 14:31.750
Got to traveI Iight.
Can't raise suspicion.

14:32.544 --> 14:34.878
I just need a reIiabIe tooI,

14:35.004 --> 14:37.047
something I can count on.

15:49.037 --> 15:50.495
Hey!

15:50.622 --> 15:52.664
Oh, you startled me.

15:52.790 --> 15:54.166
Sorry.

15:54.292 --> 15:56.543
- I was hoping to catch a ride to Tampa.
- Kyle...

15:56.669 --> 15:58.795
I need to get away,
even just for the weekend.

15:58.921 --> 16:00.922
Um, I'm sorry.

16:01.049 --> 16:03.717
There'll be other opportunities,
but not this one.

16:03.843 --> 16:06.178
I can't wait.
Arthur, I need to do this.

16:07.180 --> 16:10.265
Give something back to the world.
Make things right.

16:12.935 --> 16:14.936
I can't do that without your help.

16:19.525 --> 16:22.152
I have to get out of here.

16:23.363 --> 16:25.155
Out of here.

16:26.866 --> 16:29.368
Away from this...

16:29.494 --> 16:30.994
feeling, whatever it is.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.579
And with you, I feel focused,

16:32.705 --> 16:36.625
like I have a sense
of purpose and certainty.

16:38.211 --> 16:39.961
I need you.

16:40.088 --> 16:42.089
I...

16:43.174 --> 16:45.467
I have nothing to give you.

16:46.719 --> 16:49.221
Generosity of spirit, Arthur?

16:51.182 --> 16:54.601
I know those are more than just words
to you. Tell me they're not just...

16:54.727 --> 16:56.353
words.

17:00.566 --> 17:02.484
You need my help?

17:02.610 --> 17:04.528
More than you know.

17:04.654 --> 17:06.613
There's nobody else?

17:06.739 --> 17:09.074
You're the one, Arthur.

17:09.909 --> 17:12.285
The only one.

17:14.706 --> 17:17.416
- Well, come on.
- I knew I could count on you.

17:30.430 --> 17:34.015
According to Dexter's spatter work,
our suspect is at least six feet tall.

17:34.142 --> 17:35.183
(Quietly) closer to 6'4".

17:35.309 --> 17:36.643
More like 6'4".

17:36.769 --> 17:38.437
The DNA profile
says we're looking

17:38.563 --> 17:40.856
for a Caucasian male
of Northern European descent,

17:40.982 --> 17:42.315
blue eyes...

17:42.442 --> 17:44.443
50 to 70 years old.

17:44.569 --> 17:48.488
So we're looking for
a potentially retired, old, white guy.

17:48.614 --> 17:50.031
In Miami?

17:50.158 --> 17:51.491
Great.

17:51.617 --> 17:53.285
And this is the snowbird season.

17:53.411 --> 17:55.036
Which quadruples
our old-white-guy quotient.

17:55.163 --> 17:58.832
There's got to be something else we can do,
some other angle...

17:58.958 --> 18:00.292
Uh, DNA sweep.

18:00.418 --> 18:03.503
We could do
a targeted DNA sweep

18:03.629 --> 18:07.466
of white males, 60-ish,
in the Miami Metro area.

18:07.592 --> 18:09.676
You know how much work that is?

18:09.802 --> 18:12.053
I've got a big weekend planned.
As in twins.

18:12.180 --> 18:14.806
- You got twins lined up?
- Not yet, but that's the plan.

18:14.932 --> 18:18.185
Besides, the ACLU will shut this down
the minute word gets out.

18:18.311 --> 18:19.853
(Batista) And they always do.

18:19.979 --> 18:21.730
You can't do a roadblock
without drawing some attention.

18:21.856 --> 18:23.899
Uh, it's the weekend.

18:25.777 --> 18:27.319
Um...

18:27.445 --> 18:29.196
Next week's Thanksgiving,

18:29.322 --> 18:31.823
so, uh, the courts will be closed.

18:33.409 --> 18:35.494
Sweeps have worked
in Miami before.

18:35.620 --> 18:37.204
Right, the South Beach rapist,

18:37.330 --> 18:40.040
the robbery-homicide case in '06.

18:40.166 --> 18:42.542
- '07.
- '07.

18:42.668 --> 18:45.212
Wait, wait, who's gonna...
who's gonna pay for all this?

18:45.338 --> 18:48.590
The department's so strapped,
we can't even afford coffee filters.

18:48.716 --> 18:51.802
I used toilet paper to make
the coffee this morning.

18:52.512 --> 18:54.721
If DNA is our only lead,
then DNA is what we'll look for.

18:54.847 --> 18:56.556
Let me worry about the budget.

18:56.682 --> 18:59.684
Masuka, write up a protocol for random
field swabbing that Patrol can follow.

18:59.811 --> 19:01.353
Everything goes through you.

19:01.479 --> 19:03.188
There go my plans.

19:05.691 --> 19:07.025
Happy?

19:08.694 --> 19:10.904
How are we gonna pay for this?

19:11.030 --> 19:13.073
I have no idea.

19:13.199 --> 19:16.535
But I'm about to spend a lot of hours
looking for loose change in the budget.

19:17.119 --> 19:19.162
That's a lot of work.

19:19.664 --> 19:20.872
Want some help?

19:20.998 --> 19:23.708
- Absolutely. Come on in.
- OK.

19:24.877 --> 19:26.586
You know...

19:26.712 --> 19:28.922
the briefing room might be better.

19:30.383 --> 19:31.508
Out in the open?

19:31.634 --> 19:33.760
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah?

19:33.886 --> 19:35.262
Better?

19:46.065 --> 19:48.275
I aIready feeI
the cIoud of Farrow Iifting

19:48.401 --> 19:50.527
in anticipation of tonight.

19:50.945 --> 19:55.782
So what time do we get started
in the morning?

19:55.908 --> 19:57.993
Six o'clock.

20:00.079 --> 20:01.997
It'll be mostly local guys?

20:02.123 --> 20:03.915
Yeah, women too.

20:04.041 --> 20:07.085
The first kiII in his cycIe
of three is aIways a woman,

20:07.211 --> 20:08.587
but he won't get the chance.

20:08.713 --> 20:11.298
- Do we all stay at the same hotel?
- I don't know.

20:11.424 --> 20:13.091
Is it close to the build?

20:15.720 --> 20:17.137
It's walking distance.

20:17.263 --> 20:20.223
- Does everybody hang out together or...
- Good Lord, you have a lot of questions.

20:22.059 --> 20:23.560
Sorry.

20:25.563 --> 20:28.273
You told me you were troubled.
About what?

20:35.781 --> 20:38.450
I did something. (Sighs)

20:39.577 --> 20:41.328
Well, let's hear it.

20:41.454 --> 20:42.537
I made a mistake.

20:42.663 --> 20:44.706
- We all make mistakes.
- It was a big one.

20:44.832 --> 20:48.168
You're being purposely vague, Kyle,

20:48.294 --> 20:50.128
like one of my tenth-graders

20:50.254 --> 20:53.840
who's trying to explain
why he didn't do his homework.

20:53.966 --> 20:57.552
I have a feeIing I'm gonna
make some tenth-graders very happy.

20:57.678 --> 20:59.137
Pit stop.

21:19.325 --> 21:23.203
- You're a brave man, Kyle.
- How so?

21:23.329 --> 21:25.246
Eating from a vending machine.

21:25.373 --> 21:28.291
Years of training - iron stomach.

21:29.335 --> 21:31.336
Maybe you could show
some of that same bravery

21:31.462 --> 21:34.047
by sharing what's bothering you.

21:37.343 --> 21:40.095
How am I supposed to help you
when I don't know what the problem is?

21:40.221 --> 21:42.180
- It's not that important.
- It's important to me.

21:42.306 --> 21:43.932
Why?

21:44.058 --> 21:47.352
Because helping someone is a good deed,
and God rewards good deeds,

21:47.478 --> 21:50.105
but in order to help, I need to know
the problem. That's how these things work.

21:50.231 --> 21:51.356
I really don't want to talk about it.

21:51.482 --> 21:54.776
You asked me, remember?
That's why I brought you.

21:54.902 --> 21:57.529
- Why don't we just...
- Tell me, Kyle!

21:59.365 --> 22:01.741
I'm gonna get into my van and just
leave you here to fend for yourself.

22:01.867 --> 22:03.868
I killed a man.

22:14.296 --> 22:15.422
You killed someone?

22:15.548 --> 22:18.425
You, of all people, act appalled.

22:18.551 --> 22:21.553
- By mistake.
- How? What happened?

22:21.679 --> 22:24.347
I thought he was the right...

22:31.188 --> 22:33.606
I thought he was an animal.

22:33.733 --> 22:37.152
You... You were hunting?

22:38.237 --> 22:40.739
Yes, it was a hunting accident.

22:41.866 --> 22:44.492
I was so sure.
I'm always so careful.

22:44.618 --> 22:47.287
Then it truly was an accident.

22:47.413 --> 22:49.622
Still, it's left me with this...

22:51.917 --> 22:53.918
feeling.

22:56.338 --> 22:59.382
There are few things
harder to bear than remorse.

23:00.217 --> 23:01.801
Remorse?

23:01.927 --> 23:03.303
Guilt. Remorse.

23:03.429 --> 23:05.555
It's what separates us
from the animals.

23:08.476 --> 23:11.269
Your conscience
is eating away at you.

23:12.980 --> 23:15.690
But you're gonna feel better.

23:15.816 --> 23:17.859
Confession is good for the soul.

23:17.985 --> 23:20.820
All the more proof l have no soul.

23:21.864 --> 23:25.825
Doing good deeds,
scoring points with God.

23:30.289 --> 23:32.957
You and I are way beyond
the point system, Arthur.

23:33.084 --> 23:35.960
The best deed l can do
is rid the world of you.

23:40.299 --> 23:42.175
A fitting kiII room.

23:42.301 --> 23:45.220
Small, but l'll be
cutting him down to size.

23:47.973 --> 23:50.809
I just need to pick up a few suppIies.

23:52.019 --> 23:54.312
(Cell phone rings)

23:55.314 --> 23:58.775
- Hey, Deb.
- How's the weather?

23:58.901 --> 23:59.901
Funny.

24:00.027 --> 24:03.696
You talking climate
with a bunch of dorks and nerds,

24:03.823 --> 24:04.989
you really lead the life.

24:05.116 --> 24:07.992
Is there a reason for this call?
It's getting late.

24:08.119 --> 24:11.579
That jumper out at the warehouse,
you took a bunch of crime-scene photos.

24:11.705 --> 24:13.706
Did you put them all in the file?

24:15.126 --> 24:18.169
I take a lot of photos.
I don't use 'em all.

24:18.295 --> 24:20.505
- But you save them?
- I do.

24:20.631 --> 24:23.216
I want to look through 'em,
see if I can find any ash smudges.

24:23.342 --> 24:25.343
Well, they're all
on the lab computer.

24:25.469 --> 24:27.387
Masuka can access 'em for you.

24:27.513 --> 24:29.889
- I can't ask Masuka.
- Why?

24:30.015 --> 24:31.683
Because I'm not working this case.

24:32.893 --> 24:35.478
- Could've fooled me.
- I know, right?

24:35.604 --> 24:37.355
At least I got Quinn to start
DNA sweeps tomorrow.

24:37.481 --> 24:39.315
That's something anyway, right?

24:39.441 --> 24:41.234
DNA sweeps?

24:41.360 --> 24:43.403
Yeah, we're gonna do
random cheek swabs

24:43.529 --> 24:46.781
on tall white men over 50,
preferably with blue eyes.

24:46.907 --> 24:48.408
Good luck with that.

24:48.534 --> 24:49.784
Thanks.

24:49.910 --> 24:54.122
Hey, you run into
that weather guy, Sonny Skyes,

24:54.248 --> 24:55.915
you tell him he's got a stupid name.

24:56.041 --> 24:57.750
Will do.

24:57.877 --> 24:59.878
But first a IittIe shopping.

25:06.093 --> 25:08.094
Oh. (Chuckles)

25:08.220 --> 25:09.470
Are you headed out?

25:09.597 --> 25:11.764
- Yeah, for ice.
- Change of plan for tomorrow.

25:11.891 --> 25:14.767
We're not going to the build.
I got a surprise for you instead.

25:14.894 --> 25:18.271
Uh... I don't like surprises.

25:18.397 --> 25:21.024
You'll like this one.
It'll make you feel better.

25:27.531 --> 25:29.115
How will it make me feel better?

25:29.241 --> 25:32.911
Could he have some kind of formula
for remorse or something?

25:35.080 --> 25:37.707
If anyone does, it'd be him.

25:37.833 --> 25:40.710
It's not Iike I can't kiII him tomorrow night.

25:42.129 --> 25:44.881
Good. So far we've saved...

25:45.007 --> 25:46.925
$24,000.

25:48.010 --> 25:50.470
- Not bad.
- Mm, it's not enough.

25:50.596 --> 25:53.765
We need at least 12 more.

25:58.771 --> 26:00.438
What?

26:01.565 --> 26:02.941
Your hair.

26:03.067 --> 26:04.984
- My heart skips a beat.
- Stop it.

26:05.110 --> 26:07.111
And thank you.

26:09.114 --> 26:10.657
What time is it? Dios mio.

26:10.783 --> 26:12.784
It's late.

26:12.910 --> 26:14.953
We're the last ones here.

26:25.965 --> 26:28.466
- (Door opens)
- Yo!

26:29.635 --> 26:31.135
You're still here.

26:31.262 --> 26:35.223
Me and a bunch of guys were at the bar.
I came back with some good news.

26:35.349 --> 26:37.850
They want to donate
a vacation day to help pay

26:37.977 --> 26:40.019
for this DNA-sweep thing.

26:40.145 --> 26:41.646
That's amazing, bro.

26:41.772 --> 26:43.940
Fucker shot one of our own.

26:46.318 --> 26:48.569
Look at this. All those days.

26:48.696 --> 26:51.406
It's enough. It fills the gap.

27:01.625 --> 27:03.042
(Sighs)

27:04.962 --> 27:06.713
(Elevator bell dings)

27:11.010 --> 27:12.468
(Lock clicks)

27:14.138 --> 27:15.805
Fuck it.

27:20.144 --> 27:22.061
- Papi...
- (Batista groans)

27:22.187 --> 27:23.896
(LaGuerta) Si.

27:25.357 --> 27:27.191
(Knock at door)

27:29.778 --> 27:31.446
Who the fuck is it?

27:31.572 --> 27:33.114
(Christine) It's me.

27:33.240 --> 27:36.284
I called, but you didn't pick up.

27:38.203 --> 27:41.247
(Sighs) I know it's late,
but I've had the worst day.

27:41.373 --> 27:43.708
I'm sorry, babe, but I...

27:43.834 --> 27:46.252
I could lose myjob.

27:46.378 --> 27:48.671
Not like I'm the only one.
Being a journalist these days

27:48.797 --> 27:51.090
is a straight ticket
to the unemployment line.

27:51.216 --> 27:54.344
- You're not gonna lose yourjob.
- My editor laid it out.

27:55.179 --> 27:57.805
He said either I get
"a lead that bleeds,"

27:57.931 --> 28:00.558
or basically I'm done.

28:01.226 --> 28:03.227
So you're here.

28:06.190 --> 28:07.106
What?

28:07.232 --> 28:11.277
Look, Christy, I'm half-asleep
and half in the bag.

28:11.403 --> 28:12.904
I can't give you anything.

28:14.281 --> 28:16.115
How about a little support?

28:16.241 --> 28:18.659
You know, like a hug?

28:18.786 --> 28:20.453
Or an "everything's
gonna be all right"?

28:20.579 --> 28:22.413
Everything's gonna be all right.

28:23.457 --> 28:26.084
- That's bullshit.
- Hey, come here.

28:28.170 --> 28:29.837
It is gonna be all right,

28:29.963 --> 28:31.964
'cause you're a kick-ass reporter,

28:32.091 --> 28:34.175
and I'm gonna help you
dig something up,

28:34.301 --> 28:36.761
just not in Homicide.

28:41.308 --> 28:43.434
Maybe you should stay.

28:52.778 --> 28:55.154
Not if you're on the fence.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.532
I'll see you tomorrow.

29:04.415 --> 29:06.666
Quick cab to
the meteoroIogicaI conference.

29:06.792 --> 29:08.793
Check in, establish an alibi.

29:08.919 --> 29:11.003
- l'll be back in time to...
- Kyle!

29:11.130 --> 29:12.046
Hey.

29:12.172 --> 29:13.506
You're an early bird too, huh?

29:13.632 --> 29:16.634
Yeah, how else
would I catch the worm?

29:16.760 --> 29:20.805
Yeah, I'm so excited about today's surprise,
I practically sprang out of bed.

29:20.931 --> 29:21.848
(Laughs)

29:21.974 --> 29:24.183
- You ready for this?
- So ready.

29:24.309 --> 29:27.728
(Laughs) That's the spirit. Mmm!

29:28.313 --> 29:29.730
Come on.

29:29.857 --> 29:30.857
(Door shuts)

29:30.983 --> 29:33.192
Yesterday he's jumping down my throat,

29:33.318 --> 29:35.695
today he's the happy dancing man.

29:35.821 --> 29:38.030
Is that mask of his crumbIing?

29:58.093 --> 29:59.677
Oh, Frank.

30:05.184 --> 30:08.561
So I was thinking, it might not be
a bad idea to ask Masuka...

30:08.687 --> 30:12.064
Oh, fuck me. Don't you have other cases
you should be working on?

30:12.191 --> 30:13.983
I'm trying to help you.

30:14.109 --> 30:16.819
Maybe you should ask Masuka
if you could get Dexter's old discard photos

30:16.945 --> 30:19.614
from the Tarla Grant crime scene.

30:19.740 --> 30:21.407
You know, Tarla Grant,
the supposed jumper?

30:21.533 --> 30:23.242
Yeah, I know who Tarla Grant is.

30:23.368 --> 30:25.077
Why do I care
about your brother's snaps?

30:25.204 --> 30:28.414
Well, because if she's one of Trinity's
victims, you might find an ash smudge.

30:28.540 --> 30:31.375
So basically I'm your tool. That it?

30:31.502 --> 30:34.504
Yeah. That's it.

30:34.630 --> 30:38.216
I'm using you to make you look good,
but I wouldn't want you to feel like a tool.

30:46.225 --> 30:48.726
Make sure each kit
gets a chain-of-custody sticker.

30:51.063 --> 30:53.439
These swab things gonna take
a long time to turn around?

30:53.565 --> 30:56.651
Well, in the real world, yes,
but since I'm organizing it,

30:56.777 --> 30:59.820
we've got mad mojo,
top-of-the-pile action going on.

30:59.947 --> 31:02.156
Come on, people, the faster
we get 'em out in the field,

31:02.282 --> 31:04.408
the faster we get 'em
back here digesting.

31:04.535 --> 31:07.411
You got access to Dexter's
discard crime-scene photos?

31:07.538 --> 31:09.622
We share everything.

31:09.748 --> 31:12.333
- Not in a gay way.
- Yeah, that jumper, Tarla Grant,

31:12.459 --> 31:14.752
maybe he accidentally
snapped a smudge or something.

31:14.878 --> 31:17.964
Good idea, especially from you.

31:18.090 --> 31:20.466
And one more thing I have to handle
while he's at his conference.

31:20.592 --> 31:23.427
You guys and your
fucking geek fests.

31:25.931 --> 31:27.390
I'll have you know,

31:27.516 --> 31:30.184
I've almost banged so much tail
at those "geek fests".

31:30.310 --> 31:32.228
Sure. You.

31:32.354 --> 31:34.313
But Poindexter?

31:35.065 --> 31:37.525
Dexter is pure jungle cat.

31:37.651 --> 31:39.569
You should've seen
the hot English muffin

31:39.695 --> 31:42.989
he was "bow-chicka-wowing" a couple
years ago...while he was dating Rita.

31:43.115 --> 31:45.866
- Huh.
- Lila was insane.

31:45.993 --> 31:47.702
Literally.

31:47.828 --> 31:49.704
I could tell you stories.

31:49.830 --> 31:51.581
Really?

31:53.667 --> 31:55.334
Mom! Look, I caught one!

31:55.460 --> 31:57.336
Wow! That's a monster.

31:57.462 --> 31:59.171
Yeah, and Astor caught
the biggest fish of the day.

31:59.298 --> 32:01.549
Come on, show your mom.

32:01.675 --> 32:02.675
Impressive.

32:02.801 --> 32:05.303
- No biggie, just lucky.
- Can we eat him?

32:05.429 --> 32:07.680
Absolutely, but we have to wait
till Dexter comes home.

32:07.806 --> 32:09.015
He's the fish gutter around here.

32:09.141 --> 32:10.683
I clean a pretty decent fish.

32:10.809 --> 32:13.686
Oh, no, it's all right. You don't have to.

32:13.812 --> 32:15.229
No, please, my pleasure.

32:15.355 --> 32:18.357
How about I clean 'em, you cook 'em,
and we all eat 'em together?

32:18.483 --> 32:20.026
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

32:20.152 --> 32:23.654
All right. I do make
a mean mango salsa.

32:24.573 --> 32:27.491
All right. Kids, fishies, to the sink.

32:31.496 --> 32:33.664
What are we doing here?

32:33.790 --> 32:35.499
Trying to help you.

32:42.883 --> 32:45.051
(Doorbell ringing)

32:45.177 --> 32:48.596
Hello, my name is Arthur Mitchell.
This is my friend Kyle Butler.

32:48.722 --> 32:51.724
- No, thank you.
- I'm not trying to sell anything.

32:51.850 --> 32:54.685
You see, I grew up in this house
many years ago.

32:54.811 --> 32:56.395
I was hoping to take a look.

32:56.521 --> 32:58.397
We'll just take a minute.
We'll be out before you know it.

32:58.523 --> 33:00.608
(Both speaking Korean)

33:00.734 --> 33:02.526
(Arthur) Upstairs!

33:02.653 --> 33:03.944
You have a lovely home.

33:04.071 --> 33:07.698
(Both speak Korean)

33:18.543 --> 33:20.544
(Door creaks)

33:24.591 --> 33:26.634
A bathroom?

33:28.512 --> 33:31.097
This is where it all started.

33:31.223 --> 33:32.723
What started here?

33:38.146 --> 33:40.147
I was standing here...

33:42.275 --> 33:45.069
watching my sister take a shower.

33:46.196 --> 33:47.822
You were watching your sister?

33:47.948 --> 33:51.575
I was ten. It was innocent.

33:52.619 --> 33:55.413
But Vera saw me...

33:55.539 --> 33:57.540
in the mirror.

33:59.584 --> 34:02.086
I startled her,
and she slipped...

34:03.088 --> 34:05.297
shattered the shower doors.

34:05.424 --> 34:07.091
The glass...

34:09.886 --> 34:12.221
sliced her leg.

34:18.103 --> 34:20.604
She was dead by the time
the ambulance came.

34:24.109 --> 34:26.360
So much blood.

34:27.237 --> 34:29.655
Born in blood, both of us.

34:29.781 --> 34:32.158
My parents blamed me.

34:32.284 --> 34:37.830
My mother became a shell, a ghost.

34:37.956 --> 34:41.667
She eventually killed herself.

34:41.793 --> 34:43.961
Jumped to her death.

34:44.087 --> 34:46.672
Left me all alone...

34:46.798 --> 34:48.799
with him.

34:51.428 --> 34:53.095
He was always a drinker...

34:53.221 --> 34:56.223
but without Mother,
it became worse.

34:57.142 --> 34:58.434
So did the beatings.

34:58.560 --> 35:01.395
"Little fucking pervert,

35:01.521 --> 35:03.981
"fucking cunt, you killed them."

35:07.068 --> 35:08.778
What happened to him?

35:11.948 --> 35:13.783
He died.

35:13.909 --> 35:15.701
No, you kiIIed your father.

35:15.827 --> 35:17.828
I'm betting hammer.

35:26.505 --> 35:28.923
I never told anyone...

35:29.049 --> 35:31.050
any of this.

35:33.887 --> 35:35.679
Why did you tell me?

35:35.806 --> 35:38.933
So you'd know you're not alone.
You're just like me.

35:39.059 --> 35:42.228
We're both responsible
for the death of an innocent.

35:42.354 --> 35:44.355
We share that.

35:52.697 --> 35:54.532
You feel better?

35:56.326 --> 35:58.577
You have to go now! Leave!

35:58.703 --> 36:00.663
- I call the police!
- Don't be absurd.

36:00.789 --> 36:02.748
Uh... Why don't we grab some lunch?

36:02.874 --> 36:04.708
I heard about a great place
back in Tampa.

36:04.835 --> 36:07.461
Yeah. Lunch does sound good.

36:08.547 --> 36:09.547
Sorry.

36:15.428 --> 36:18.013
Little coffee with that sugar?

36:18.139 --> 36:21.308
Can't beat the combo -
caffeine and sugar rush.

36:26.147 --> 36:27.606
Quinn's out on a warrant check.

36:27.732 --> 36:30.109
Actually, I'm here to see you.

36:30.235 --> 36:32.695
I don't know nothing about nothing.

36:33.905 --> 36:37.783
Not even about the DNA roadblocks
popping up all over the city?

36:43.331 --> 36:46.125
Quinn's been fucking with you.

36:46.251 --> 36:48.252
And not in that
heavy-breathing kind of way.

36:48.378 --> 36:51.839
Yeah, if I got it from him,
would I be asking you?

36:51.965 --> 36:54.925
Are the sweeps connected
to the shootings of Agent Lundy and...

36:55.051 --> 36:56.302
We're just dragging for drunk drivers.

36:56.428 --> 36:58.596
We toss up roadblocks all the time
around the holidays.

36:58.722 --> 37:00.598
Yeah, Patrol.

37:00.724 --> 37:02.766
Not Homicide.

37:02.893 --> 37:04.018
Why the DNA testing?

37:04.144 --> 37:07.104
Uh, Lieutenant's idea.
Got a lot of open cases.

37:07.230 --> 37:09.315
She's trying to up her solve rate.

37:09.441 --> 37:10.649
Really no story here.

37:10.775 --> 37:12.443
Yeah, well, it's all I got.

37:12.569 --> 37:14.194
My editor's breathing down
my neck, so...

37:14.321 --> 37:16.405
Well, you'll embarrass yourself.

37:16.531 --> 37:17.489
(Chuckles)

37:17.616 --> 37:21.285
Look, I know it's really tough
for reporters right now.

37:21.411 --> 37:24.413
And as girls we've got to
double-prove ourselves.

37:25.582 --> 37:28.500
So maybe instead of this one,

37:28.627 --> 37:32.171
I can give you that interview
you've been wanting from me.

37:32.297 --> 37:33.881
Are you serious?

37:34.007 --> 37:37.134
As long as you
make me look good.

37:37.969 --> 37:39.720
Call me. We'll set up a time.

37:42.974 --> 37:44.808
Yeah.

37:47.604 --> 37:49.271
Uh, two.

37:57.155 --> 37:59.156
This is the great place
you heard about,

37:59.282 --> 38:00.532
a hotel coffee shop?

38:00.659 --> 38:04.453
Well, it says their tuna melts
are "taste-tastic".

38:07.582 --> 38:10.167
I'm gonna go to the men's room.
Would you order me a...

38:10.293 --> 38:12.461
- A tuna melt?
- Yeah.

38:25.350 --> 38:28.227
Uh, Dexter Morgan.
Sorry I'm late.

38:29.854 --> 38:31.605
Thank you.

38:36.319 --> 38:38.487
(Man) Hey, Sonny Skyes.
Love you, man.

38:38.613 --> 38:40.072
Hey, Sonny Skyes?

38:40.198 --> 38:41.782
That would be me. Hi.

38:41.908 --> 38:45.119
Do you mind?
My wife is a huge fan.

38:45.245 --> 38:47.037
Sure.

38:47.163 --> 38:49.248
- Oops. Here we go.
- (Chuckles)

38:52.168 --> 38:55.004
- Fantastic. Thanks.
- Great. Thank you.

38:56.589 --> 38:58.590
(Phone beeping)

39:02.345 --> 39:04.471
Alibi - check.

39:04.597 --> 39:06.390
Arthur next.

39:07.517 --> 39:09.601
- No, no, no!
- Come on, he wants a smooch.

39:09.728 --> 39:12.938
Come here! Come kiss Mr. Fish head now.
Kiss Mr. Fish lips.

39:13.064 --> 39:14.106
That's disgusting!

39:14.232 --> 39:17.651
- Don't leave Mr. Fish...
- (Screams)

39:21.072 --> 39:23.657
Kyle! Over here!

39:23.783 --> 39:26.076
- Hey, where you been?
- Sorry, there was a line.

39:26.202 --> 39:29.788
No, no, gave me a chance
to say hello to the neighbors.

39:29.914 --> 39:33.125
Kyle Butler, this is, uh,
Bob and Sally Moore of Sarasota,

39:33.251 --> 39:35.836
Their beautiful daughter Hanna,
and their son, uh...

39:35.962 --> 39:37.963
Spencer!

39:38.089 --> 39:39.465
- Hi.
- Sit, sit.

39:39.591 --> 39:41.925
- There's plenty of room, right, Bob?
- I guess.

39:42.052 --> 39:44.344
I've been telling them
about our...our morning.

39:44.471 --> 39:45.596
What about our morning?

39:45.722 --> 39:47.306
You know, how we visited
my childhood home.

39:47.432 --> 39:49.808
I showed you the bathroom
where my sister died.

39:49.934 --> 39:51.977
Kids don't need to hear
any more about that.

39:52.103 --> 39:53.771
Bob, they should learn
to speak the truth.

39:53.897 --> 39:55.355
I think they know
how to speak the truth.

39:55.482 --> 39:57.399
We all need to confess our mistakes,

39:57.525 --> 39:59.526
so we can go into the light unburdened.

39:59.652 --> 40:02.154
That's what Kyle
taught me yesterday.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.697
- (Sighs)
- Not on purpose.

40:03.823 --> 40:05.866
It was such a revelation to me

40:05.992 --> 40:08.535
when he told me what he did.

40:09.370 --> 40:11.288
Huh?

40:12.791 --> 40:15.292
- We're leaving.
- What about your tuna melt?

40:15.418 --> 40:18.545
These folks want to enjoy
their family time alone.

40:21.633 --> 40:23.425
Let's go.

40:28.681 --> 40:30.682
That was rather rude.

40:30.809 --> 40:33.185
Yeah, sorry.
I'm just not as open as you are.

40:33.311 --> 40:35.270
It's the remorse.
You need to shed it.

40:35.396 --> 40:37.648
Believe me, I'm trying,
but there's only one thing that'll do it.

40:37.774 --> 40:39.858
- What's that?
- Giving.

40:39.984 --> 40:42.236
Is it OK if we stop by
a hardware store?

40:42.362 --> 40:45.489
I want to pick up some things to donate
to the Four Walls build tomorrow.

40:46.825 --> 40:48.826
That's an excellent idea.

40:58.336 --> 41:01.255
- (Door opens)
- (Humming)

41:02.215 --> 41:03.382
Morgan.

41:03.508 --> 41:04.550
Lieutenant.

41:04.676 --> 41:06.260
What are you doing?

41:06.845 --> 41:08.554
Nothing.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.514
Why were you singing?

41:11.641 --> 41:14.726
I wasn't singing. I was humming.
People have been known to hum.

41:14.853 --> 41:16.687
Not without reason.

41:17.689 --> 41:19.606
You happy about something?

41:19.732 --> 41:22.025
Are you hiding something?

41:22.861 --> 41:23.944
Are you?

41:27.991 --> 41:29.700
(Humming)

41:37.792 --> 41:39.877
Oh...

41:43.673 --> 41:46.258
Dissolving stitches my ass.

41:48.553 --> 41:50.554
Fuck me.

41:57.478 --> 41:59.563
Mother shit fuck.

42:09.115 --> 42:11.408
How tall was my shooter?

42:12.702 --> 42:16.705
These wounds have a trajectory
that's totally fucking straight.

42:20.251 --> 42:23.253
Jesus, Masuka, they're just tits.

42:24.005 --> 42:26.548
But they're yours - perky, perfect.

42:26.674 --> 42:29.134
Grow the fuck up and tell me
how tall my shooter is.

42:29.260 --> 42:31.637
Uh, if it was the Trinity Killer,

42:31.763 --> 42:34.681
then he's about 6'4".

42:41.814 --> 42:43.440
Up.

42:48.404 --> 42:50.530
That puts you
at about his height.

42:50.657 --> 42:53.659
So if you're Trinity, how exactly do you
shoot me and get wounds like this?

42:53.785 --> 42:58.163
Casings and GSR
from your shirt put you about...

42:58.289 --> 43:01.667
about five feet away.

43:01.793 --> 43:03.210
So I'm 6'4",

43:03.336 --> 43:07.172
and the vast majority of shooters
hold their guns like this.

43:07.298 --> 43:09.675
Unless he's trying
not to attract attention.

43:09.801 --> 43:11.343
Then like this.

43:13.346 --> 43:17.391
Either way, to hit you on the side
from up here,

43:17.517 --> 43:21.144
I got to shoot you
with a downward trajectory.

43:22.647 --> 43:24.856
There's nothing downward about this.
It's completely level.

43:24.983 --> 43:26.191
Unless I'm kneeling.

43:26.317 --> 43:29.319
But then again, I'm, like, 60,
and I got to be mobile.

43:29.445 --> 43:33.198
Plus Lundy would've reacted
to some old guy kneeling behind me.

43:33.324 --> 43:35.200
I remember his face exactly.

43:35.326 --> 43:38.120
- So I'm not kneeling.
- Then how tall is he?

43:46.629 --> 43:49.172
My height, approximately.

43:51.509 --> 43:53.719
Oh, fucking fuck.

43:56.389 --> 43:58.056
Then it wasn't Trinity.

43:58.182 --> 43:59.224
Nope.

43:59.350 --> 44:01.351
Then who the fuck shot me?

44:06.858 --> 44:10.027
Nothing like the spirit of charity
to make the heart right.

44:11.195 --> 44:13.196
About time I gave back.

44:14.574 --> 44:17.242
It's a good call with
the plastic sheeting, by the way.

44:17.368 --> 44:19.953
This is Florida. You never know
when it's gonna rain.

44:20.079 --> 44:21.747
(Yawns)

44:23.624 --> 44:27.336
Ah, compadre, I don't know
about you, but I'm bushed.

44:28.046 --> 44:30.630
We're kindred spirits, you and I.

44:34.177 --> 44:35.802
Keep doing good work.

44:35.928 --> 44:37.888
Oh, I will.

44:46.773 --> 44:49.274
Just go to sIeep.

44:49.400 --> 44:50.942
No more surprises.

44:51.069 --> 44:52.277
(Door closes)

44:52.403 --> 44:54.404
(Muffled TV noise)

44:54.530 --> 44:56.531
Good enough.

45:04.499 --> 45:05.957
(Rita) You know what's great?

45:06.084 --> 45:08.293
- Your mango salsa?
- (Laughs)

45:08.419 --> 45:09.920
Wine.

45:10.046 --> 45:12.464
Nine months without it sucked.

45:12.590 --> 45:13.673
(Both laugh)

45:13.800 --> 45:15.967
- You want to polish this off?
- No, I'm...

45:16.094 --> 45:17.594
I'm already pretty buzzed.

45:17.720 --> 45:19.846
Oh, lightweight.

45:19.972 --> 45:23.141
Yeah. If you'd said that 15 years ago,
nobody would've believed you.

45:23.267 --> 45:25.852
Oh, so you weren't
always a soccer mom?

45:25.978 --> 45:28.146
Mm, are you kidding?

45:28.272 --> 45:30.899
I was a dress-over-the-head party girl.

45:33.194 --> 45:34.820
Oh, God, did I just say that?

45:34.946 --> 45:36.530
(Laughs)

45:36.656 --> 45:37.864
You must think I'm...

45:37.990 --> 45:39.574
Totally charming.

45:49.585 --> 45:52.129
I, um...
I better start cleaning up.

45:52.255 --> 45:55.841
- Yeah, let me...let me help you.
- No, no. It's getting late.

45:55.967 --> 45:58.176
I'm sure you want to get home.

45:58.302 --> 46:00.595
Right. I'll, uh, get the kids.

47:20.593 --> 47:22.719
Where the fuck did you go?

47:33.898 --> 47:36.233
He's on foot.

47:36.359 --> 47:37.901
With his tools.

47:39.278 --> 47:40.779
The Four Walls build.

47:40.905 --> 47:43.615
A IittIe early, but waIking distance.

47:54.585 --> 47:57.170
Empty, no security.

48:11.602 --> 48:15.063
Just me, Arthur, and a little M-99.

48:23.072 --> 48:25.824
No more confessions,
no more good deeds,

48:25.950 --> 48:28.118
and no more fucking remorse.

48:35.459 --> 48:37.586
(Breathing heavily)

48:38.963 --> 48:41.214
What are you doing?

48:44.302 --> 48:46.595
No, you're mine.

48:48.431 --> 48:50.140
(Grunting)

48:51.892 --> 48:53.518
This isn't how you die.

48:53.644 --> 48:55.395
Let go!

48:57.023 --> 48:59.608
Why keep him aIive
just to kiII him?

49:01.652 --> 49:05.822
But as Iong as it's by my hand...

49:08.159 --> 49:11.036
Gotcha! Gotcha!

49:11.162 --> 49:12.370
Hold on.

49:12.496 --> 49:14.372
Give me your hand.

49:14.498 --> 49:16.082
(Grunting)

49:20.338 --> 49:23.089
This is his solution
to remorse - suicide.

49:23.215 --> 49:25.592
That's why he couId unburden himseIf.

49:25.718 --> 49:27.844
He knew this was next.

49:28.846 --> 49:31.681
WiII it be my onIy soIution someday?

49:33.851 --> 49:37.937
I thought God sent you
so that I could save you.

49:38.689 --> 49:40.065
But God had another plan.

49:40.191 --> 49:41.858
So did l.

49:41.984 --> 49:43.902
He sent you to save me.

49:44.028 --> 49:46.488
- Not exactIy.
- (Man) You're a hero.

49:50.868 --> 49:52.285
Thank you.

49:53.871 --> 49:57.207
(People chattering)

49:59.585 --> 50:01.961
So much for anonymity.

50:02.088 --> 50:04.923
Arthur Mitchell,
you just got a reprieve.

50:10.554 --> 50:13.264
So the Trinity Killer
didn't shoot you and Lundy.

50:13.391 --> 50:14.349
Nope.

50:14.475 --> 50:16.267
Someone Masuka's size shot you.

50:16.394 --> 50:17.268
Yep.

50:17.395 --> 50:19.312
- That's all we got to go on Lundy's case?
- That's it.

50:19.438 --> 50:23.817
Well, the upside is there's no longer a
conflict of interest for you in the Trinity case.

50:24.902 --> 50:26.361
You mean I can work it again?

50:26.946 --> 50:29.447
Thank Christ,
no more backseat driving.

50:29.573 --> 50:33.118
Nobody knows this case
better than you. You're taking lead.

50:33.244 --> 50:35.620
Motherfucker, really?

50:35.746 --> 50:38.206
- Well, what about Lundy's case?
- That's my case now.

50:39.041 --> 50:42.502
Don't worry, I'm gonna find
the shithead that shot you.

50:42.628 --> 50:43.753
Oh, oh, whoa...

50:43.879 --> 50:45.797
- Oh, are you OK?
- I'm f... I'm fine.

50:45.923 --> 50:46.923
You OK?

50:47.049 --> 50:48.800
(Laughs)

50:48.926 --> 50:52.804
- Well, we're done here.
- We're done.

50:52.930 --> 50:56.766
Morgan, update the squad
at three o'clock, please.

50:59.186 --> 51:01.187
Glad that didn't happen last night.

51:04.817 --> 51:06.067
Any regrets?

51:06.193 --> 51:08.945
That we didn't have breakfast together.

51:16.370 --> 51:18.371
At least I'll get Trinity.

51:20.124 --> 51:21.416
Promise.

51:29.467 --> 51:32.927
l've killed an innocent man,
and I've saved a guiIty one.

51:35.097 --> 51:37.182
I won't make that mistake again.

51:38.350 --> 51:40.059
ls that the purpose of remorse,

51:40.186 --> 51:42.979
to keep you from repeating mistakes?

51:45.483 --> 51:48.067
You're watching me.

51:49.820 --> 51:51.654
I'm just concerned.

51:53.032 --> 51:55.700
No need. I was confused before.

51:55.826 --> 51:57.702
But you're not anymore.

51:57.828 --> 52:00.705
No. Embarrassed, perhaps.

52:00.831 --> 52:03.291
In fact, I'd appreciate it

52:03.417 --> 52:07.045
if you'd think of
this weekend's events as a...

52:07.171 --> 52:09.297
a little accident.

52:10.299 --> 52:13.009
You stepped off a roof.

52:13.135 --> 52:15.470
It was a mistake.

52:16.847 --> 52:19.015
We all make them.

52:21.644 --> 52:23.061
(Arthur) Don't worry.

52:23.187 --> 52:25.730
Your accident
will never be spoken of by me.

52:25.856 --> 52:27.816
To err is human.

52:32.321 --> 52:35.281
Little early for a drunk-driving checkpoint.

52:37.368 --> 52:39.244
Looks like one of Debra's DNA sweeps.

52:39.370 --> 52:42.288
(Woman) Stand over here, sir, please.

52:42.414 --> 52:44.374
(Man) You, sir, pull over here.

52:46.877 --> 52:49.420
(Man) Step on out of the car, sir, please.

52:49.547 --> 52:51.756
Yeah, I heard about this on the radio.

52:51.882 --> 52:55.552
The police are looking
for some huge serial killer.

52:57.221 --> 52:59.681
They have his DNA.
They're looking for a match.

53:01.976 --> 53:03.560
Sounds scary.

53:03.686 --> 53:07.188
ExactIy how much
do you want to Iive, Arthur?

53:09.108 --> 53:13.695
I think this gentleman in the red car
has the right idea. This line is endless.

53:16.407 --> 53:18.324
What say we take the scenic route?

53:18.450 --> 53:20.785
Yeah, sure, Arthur.

53:24.206 --> 53:27.083
A changed man at peace with himseIf.

53:30.588 --> 53:33.089
Maybe onIy monsters feeI no regret.

53:36.427 --> 53:40.263
If erring is human,
then remorse must be too.

53:42.892 --> 53:46.311
Wait, does that make me human?

53:46.437 --> 53:48.438
Huh.
