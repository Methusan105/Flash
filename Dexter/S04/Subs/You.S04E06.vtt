<i>Charles Bukowski once wrote:</i>

00:24.065 --> 00:25.483

00:27.485 --> 00:29.404

00:30.864 --> 00:32.991
<i>I found Marienne in London...</i>

00:34.367 --> 00:36.161
<i>and it did just about kill me.</i>

00:36.161 --> 00:38.329
You're a murderer, Joe.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.167
<i>Well, killed Joe Goldberg anyway.</i>

00:42.167 --> 00:45.420
<i>Professor Jonathan Moore stayed
in the city to heal his broken heart</i>

00:45.420 --> 00:47.172
<i>and enjoy a quiet holiday.</i>

00:47.172 --> 00:49.883
<i>Would have been nice,
if things stayed quiet.</i>

00:50.925 --> 00:54.721
You saved Kate's life,
you'll come along with us tonight.

00:54.721 --> 00:58.683
<i>Unfortunately, rich douchebags exist
in every major city on Earth,</i>

00:58.683 --> 01:00.477
<i>living without consequences.</i>

01:01.227 --> 01:02.228
Give it to me.

01:02.228 --> 01:05.482
<i>Those consequences always fall
on the little guy.</i>

01:05.482 --> 01:07.025
Add a little bend to it.

01:07.525 --> 01:11.196
<i>And staying out of their way
is deceptively tricky.</i>

01:11.196 --> 01:13.615
They're dancing while the world burns.

01:13.615 --> 01:16.201
-  <i>I should have tried harder.</i>
- Drink!

01:17.410 --> 01:18.328
<i>Oops.</i>

01:20.413 --> 01:22.707
<i>Malcolm? Wait, did I...?</i>

01:23.917 --> 01:27.796
<i>Turned out I was in an even worse circle
of hell than I thought.</i>

01:27.796 --> 01:29.839
<i>"I thought when I left him on your table,</i>

01:29.839 --> 01:31.549
<i>you'd go down for my sins."</i>

01:31.549 --> 01:33.676
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

01:33.676 --> 01:35.720
They're calling him
the Eat The Rich Killer.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.806
<i>That I couldn't solve fast enough.</i>

01:40.809 --> 01:45.396
<i>And in the middle of it all,
one person worth saving.</i>

01:46.815 --> 01:49.609
<i>- I did my best to find the killer.</i>
- Did you kill Malcolm

01:49.609 --> 01:52.028
- because you're in love with Kate?
- No, did you?

01:52.028 --> 01:53.530
<i>I thought I had it.</i>

01:53.530 --> 01:55.990
Must be wondering where you are.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.576
<i>I know, don't quit my day job.</i>

01:58.576 --> 02:02.247
We're gonna pin all the murders on him.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.331
Grab on!

02:04.791 --> 02:08.837
<i>I know who you are now, Rhys.</i>

02:09.629 --> 02:12.340
<i>You have taken so much from me.</i>

02:12.340 --> 02:14.759
Your past doesn't scare me.

02:14.759 --> 02:17.095
- I can't.
- Captain fucking America.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.305
<i>You think you're getting started.
You're wrong.</i>

02:19.305 --> 02:21.558
<i>I, Rhys Montrose,</i>

02:21.558 --> 02:25.979
<i>officially announce my candidacy
for the mayor of London.</i>

02:25.979 --> 02:29.607
<i>Because I am going to stop Dexter.</i>

02:33.236 --> 02:35.155
I grew up in a council estate in Lewisham.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.241
I saw over and over again

02:38.241 --> 02:40.243
how not everybody's getting
the same chances.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.452
If I become mayor,

02:41.452 --> 02:43.746
I wanna do more
for the working class of London.

02:43.746 --> 02:46.791
<i>You're one clever psychopath,
I'll give you that.</i>

02:46.791 --> 02:49.794
<i>Who would believe
a would-be mayor is a serial killer?</i>

02:49.794 --> 02:51.087
<i>Perfect disguise.</i>

02:51.087 --> 02:53.965
What if we young people aren't
all that interested in work?

02:53.965 --> 02:58.052
<i>But I know the real you,
a cruel man in his own immoral universe.</i>

02:58.052 --> 03:00.096
<i>What I don't know is why.</i>

03:00.096 --> 03:03.141
What about these rich friends
of yours being offed?

03:03.141 --> 03:08.104
-  <i>Yes, why did you kill them?</i>
- I understand people are curious.

03:08.104 --> 03:12.650
The Met police will find whoever it is
and catch them, I have every faith.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.944
<i>But who will the police catch?</i>

03:14.944 --> 03:17.155
<i>They think I'm a hero
for saving Roald now.</i>

03:17.155 --> 03:20.491
<i>How long until you turn the tables
and try to pin it all on me?</i>

03:24.078 --> 03:28.082
- Thanks for coming again. Nice to see Dexter.
-  Nice to see Dexter.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.343
<i>I can't turn you in,
no one would believe me.</i>

03:38.343 --> 03:41.846
<i>But I can catch you
and get the irrefutable evidence I need</i>

03:41.846 --> 03:43.431
<i>to stop you forever.</i>

04:03.409 --> 04:05.745
<i>First up, find where you live.</i>

04:05.745 --> 04:07.747
<i>Following your amicable divorce,</i>

04:07.747 --> 04:10.541
<i>you bought a bright, airy, three-bedroom.</i>

04:10.541 --> 04:12.293
<i>Nice but not pretentious.</i>

04:12.293 --> 04:16.881
<i>Hmm. Breaking into Henderson's was tricky.
This one is worse.</i>

04:16.881 --> 04:19.759
<i>I need some other way to get to Dexter.</i>

04:19.759 --> 04:23.137
 Let's just get this over with.
Thanks for helping me with this.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.890
If these Bureau twats insist
on making me clear out Malcolm's office,

04:25.890 --> 04:27.850
the least they can do is unlock the door.

04:27.850 --> 04:30.478
 <i>I had to push her away
because of Dexter.</i>

04:30.478 --> 04:33.856
<i>No surprise that tapeworm in Tom Ford
has latched on to her again.</i>

04:33.856 --> 04:36.192
I have too much to do today
with this fundraiser.

04:36.192 --> 04:40.405
I received your very kind invitation,
but I'm unable to make the event.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.533
I'm gonna escape for a few months.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.661
Take the family to St. Barts
and unwind my nerves.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.371
Let everything here cool off.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.248
Come with me.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.959
We can take a breath
while they catch this psycho,

04:52.959 --> 04:55.169
and then you can throw
all the charity events you like.

04:55.169 --> 04:58.423
I appreciate it, I do.
I'm not scared of this nutter.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.883
We'll have more than enough security--

05:00.883 --> 05:04.387
No one's going to stop you
from doing what you want to do.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.352
Bring me back a trinket
or a bottle of rum.

05:11.352 --> 05:15.648
 <i>Good riddance, he doesn't
deserve her or her very kind invitation.</i>

05:22.613 --> 05:24.115
<i>If it wasn't for you,</i>

05:24.991 --> 05:27.076
<i>she would have invited me too.</i>

05:27.910 --> 05:30.747
Steve, I'm not selling you
the Maybach, the Rolls,

05:30.747 --> 05:33.416
and my Aston for less than they're worth.

05:33.416 --> 05:37.670
The way I hear it, you're not
in the strongest negotiating position.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.048
- What?
- Verge of bankruptcy.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.549
Staff walking out.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.551
I assume Phoebe doesn't know.

05:44.635 --> 05:48.306
But, hey, why not put a ring on it?
That'd keep your club open.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.476
See, this is why you are single.

05:51.476 --> 05:55.021
You talk about proposing like it's lunch.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.231
That shit needs to be perfect.

05:57.231 --> 06:00.568
- You are the diamond guy, you know.
- I do. They cost a kingdom.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.781
I tell you what,

06:05.364 --> 06:08.785
I'll get you a diamond that will more
than pay for your car collection.

06:08.785 --> 06:12.497
If Phoebe says yes, you get a wife
and unlimited money bags.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.707
- You win.
- And if she says no?

06:14.707 --> 06:17.418
You return the stone
and I keep the car collection.

06:18.836 --> 06:22.673
- Steve. Why would I risk that?
- Because you're desperate.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.175
Or you're a soulless shit-burger

06:24.175 --> 06:26.719
who can't resist trying to fuck me
with your micro dick.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.472
Fine. Don't take the bet.

06:29.472 --> 06:34.060
I'm sure Phoebe will be happy to marry
a financial and emotional black hole.

06:36.854 --> 06:37.980
Fuck it.

06:38.689 --> 06:39.941
You're on.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.026
You inbred Chelsea anus.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.028
- Prepare to eat shit.
- Okay.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.365
- Phoebe.
- Hi, Stevie, darling.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.283
Nice to see Dexter.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.452
- And Dexter. Have a good day.
- And Dexter.

06:53.162 --> 06:56.582
Uh-oh. What's wrong, my pretty peanut?

06:57.792 --> 06:59.794
Uh, when you promised
we'd work through our issues,

06:59.794 --> 07:01.504
I assumed you meant in the same room.

07:01.504 --> 07:05.383
Of course. But I told you
I had a very important meeting today.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.093
I didn't sleep again.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.514
Every time I close my eyes,
I see the fire ripping through Hampsie.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.183
This morning, I went for a stroll
to hear the birdies.

07:14.183 --> 07:16.018
- That's great.
- No, it's not.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.147
I feel like I'm being followed.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.568
You're famous.
When are you not being followed?

07:23.568 --> 07:26.028
You have your security.
It wasn't Zarek? Hi, Zarek.

07:26.821 --> 07:29.782
- Mm. I miss Vic.
- I know.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.576
Come on, breathe. Come here.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.369
It's okay. It's okay.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.747
You have not slept in days
and it's no wonder

07:37.290 --> 07:39.000
you're feeling so paranoid.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.377
No. No, Adam, you're not getting it.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.880
I feel like someone is watching me.

07:45.631 --> 07:46.966
You don't believe me?

07:47.550 --> 07:51.012
No, I believe what you need is me.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.514
I'm moving you in here
until you're feeling more like yourself.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.515
Hmm.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.268
- That could help.
- Mm-hmm.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.853
I want the penthouse.

08:01.731 --> 08:02.565
Of course.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.234
<i>Your house is a no-go.</i>

08:05.234 --> 08:08.446
<i>So I need you out
in the world alone, unguarded.</i>

08:08.446 --> 08:12.158
<i>Thankfully, you're a narcissist.
You've done a billion interviews.</i>

08:12.158 --> 08:15.495
<i>What is a typical day
in the life of Rhys Montrose?</i>

08:15.495 --> 08:17.205
<i>Oh, God, it'd be so boring.</i>

08:17.205 --> 08:18.998
<i>Only if you leave out the murder.</i>

08:18.998 --> 08:20.875
<i>You write at home,</i>

08:20.875 --> 08:24.754
<i>you'd rather eat at home than go out,
your vice is online poker at home.</i>

08:24.754 --> 08:27.340
<i>When you do leave the house,
it's to volunteer at a hospital.</i>

08:27.340 --> 08:30.384
<i>You're safe at home
or surrounded in public.</i>

08:30.384 --> 08:33.221
<i>How can I get you
if I can't get close to you?</i>

08:33.971 --> 08:37.099
Professor. Hi.
Office hours. Did you forget?

08:37.099 --> 08:38.017
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

08:38.017 --> 08:42.563
- You all right? You look knackered.
- I'm sorry. I'm swamped. Research.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.650
Is this about Rhys Montrose?

08:45.650 --> 08:46.734
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

08:48.569 --> 08:49.862
I'm thinking about using his past

08:49.862 --> 08:52.240
as a modern Dickensian,
rags-to-riches story.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.575
You don't have to be ashamed.

08:54.575 --> 08:57.078
You got a thing for Rhys Montrose
like the rest of London.

08:57.078 --> 09:00.331
Even I have to admit, his heart does seem
to be in the right place,

09:00.331 --> 09:01.666
as far as politicians go.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.376
<i>You've even fooled Nadia.</i>

09:03.376 --> 09:05.836
One of the girls saw him shirtless
on his morning jog

09:05.836 --> 09:08.130
round Regent's Park last Saturday.

09:08.130 --> 09:11.008
-  <i>Regent's Park.</i>
- He's training for the London marathon.

09:11.008 --> 09:15.721
<i>Lucky for me, tomorrow is Saturday,
which means we have a date in the park.</i>

09:25.356 --> 09:26.941
<i>A few issues to solve.</i>

09:26.941 --> 09:28.859
<i>How to get you back here.</i>

09:28.859 --> 09:34.615
Well, if it isn't the hero
of the Hampsie house fire.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.662
One of the perks of growing up
on a council estate,

09:40.788 --> 09:43.583
- you know how to pick a lock.
- What do you want?

09:45.918 --> 09:46.961
Isn't it obvious?

09:47.878 --> 09:48.963
I want a friend.

09:52.216 --> 09:55.636
Someone who shares my interests, relates.

09:55.636 --> 09:58.055
Someone I can tell all my secrets to.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.476
Like why you've been killing these people?

10:02.476 --> 10:04.520
Now, you're smart, why would I,

10:05.146 --> 10:07.732
aspiring mayor of London, kill them?

10:10.192 --> 10:15.281
Because they all became
a liability to your campaign in some way.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.199
See, now you're getting it.

10:17.199 --> 10:20.870
Malcolm was blackmailing me
over my not-so-little gambling habit.

10:20.870 --> 10:24.665
Simon's exploitation of women was
about to leak. Couldn't be associated.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.792
Gemma...

10:28.169 --> 10:31.339
Drunken shag, or four,
back when I was still married.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.424
She was bound to open
that big hole in her face,

10:33.424 --> 10:35.843
embarrass me, fuck my image,
ruin my campaign.

10:35.843 --> 10:36.927
You're sick.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.055
I prefer practical.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.350
They were in my way,
and now that they're not,

10:42.350 --> 10:44.143
I need this eat-the-rich story over.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.271
It's become a distraction from the good
I'm trying to do for this city.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.148
You don't care about this city.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.650
I love London.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.736
Well, I love power.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.864
Only because it'd be a complete sin
if I didn't use my strengths

10:56.864 --> 10:58.783
on the grandest possible scale.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.208
I care about you, Joe.

11:07.958 --> 11:10.294
If I weren't, don't you think
you'd be dead by now?

11:11.253 --> 11:13.547
What we have in common is rare.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.132
I don't take it for granted.

11:15.132 --> 11:17.218
We could be talking books
over a pint right now

11:17.218 --> 11:21.055
if only you'd killed Roald
and pinned it on him like I asked.

11:21.055 --> 11:24.475
I know your strengths too,
and when you fail to live up to them,

11:24.475 --> 11:26.227
oh, it's so disappointing.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.564
One chance to make it up to me.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.028
Find someone to frame for it all.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.448
Rhys, how--?

11:39.448 --> 11:41.575
I'll take care of the how,
you take care of the who.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.663
Otherwise,
you're going down for all of it.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.181
So big event tonight.

12:04.181 --> 12:07.643
We are so grateful
that you could start on short notice.

12:07.643 --> 12:10.729
Payroll lady,
she's on a little break right now,

12:11.605 --> 12:13.524
so there might be a delay,
but we'll get Dexter.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.234
Will you fix that tie?

12:28.914 --> 12:30.875
The police are coming
to the event tonight.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.918
They're eager to watch over us.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.879
It'll be very safe and orderly.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.802
Fuck. Did you invite him here?

12:41.802 --> 12:43.596
I feel safe with him around.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.140
He's like my bottle of human Valium.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.600
And he's a hero.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.644
How quickly people have forgotten
it was me who pulled him

12:50.644 --> 12:52.229
from a burning building.

12:58.319 --> 13:01.864
Hmm. You know what they say:
"Colder the stare, the warmer the heart."

13:01.864 --> 13:04.825
- Do they say that?
- I've never seen her so smitten.

13:04.825 --> 13:07.244
Come, sit down. I need to talk to Dexter.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.791
Adam says I'm paranoid,

13:13.709 --> 13:15.586
but I think I'm being followed.

13:15.586 --> 13:18.714
- Have you seen someone?
- No. I just have this feeling.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.674
I've even begun questioning my friends.

13:20.674 --> 13:24.345
<i>As much as I hate seeing her upset,
I am looking for someone to frame.</i>

13:24.345 --> 13:28.182
Well, sure, they're a little wild,
but are any that terrible?

13:29.266 --> 13:31.227
Sweet Jonathan.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.811
You have no idea, do you?

13:33.437 --> 13:34.647
This must stay between us.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.859
First, Sophie.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.070
Love her. She's heavenly. Cherub.

13:41.904 --> 13:46.283
But slightly too overmedicated
and her priorities in regards to career,

13:46.283 --> 13:47.660
sorry, give me pause.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.247
<i>fame-seeking pillhead
more vapid than evil.</i>

13:51.247 --> 13:54.708
I can't imagine her ever
doing anything bad, of course.

13:54.708 --> 13:55.626
Now, Blessing.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.171
Absolute gem. Iconic, tall, skinny legend.

13:59.171 --> 14:02.633
But not the most loving little lamb.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.969
<i>Heartless, self-centered,
even a soupçon sociopathic.</i>

14:04.969 --> 14:07.638
Her businesses can be unconventional.

14:07.638 --> 14:08.681
<i>Pyramid schemes.</i>

14:08.681 --> 14:12.351
Unsuspecting elderly people get in
a bit over their heads.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.896
<i>Cons Grandma out
of her retirement fund. That's up there.</i>

14:15.896 --> 14:19.191
I can see why you might think that they--

14:19.191 --> 14:21.819
Oh, God, no, I'm just gossiping, darling.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.821
I can't see either of them hurting a fly.

14:24.780 --> 14:26.574
Connie, on the other hand...

14:26.574 --> 14:29.159
-  <i>Go on.</i>
- Oh, I'm so concerned.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.911
He's untethered.

14:31.579 --> 14:35.124
Drinking in the morning.
Drugged up to his eyeballs. Erratic.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.960
The police are even suspicious
because he has no alibi.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.671
-  <i>I can work with that.</i>
-  Well, hello, darling.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.631
Jonathan, do not look.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.470
<i>Who the fuck is that?</i>

14:49.638 --> 14:51.056
<i>Why is he touching her like that?</i>

14:51.056 --> 14:52.641
That's Niko Leandros.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.185
Shipping heir, bachelor,

14:55.185 --> 14:56.729
sex on a stick.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.397
What is he doing in London?

14:58.397 --> 15:01.400
It's been ages. Since Mykonos?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.819
Your event is quite the hot ticket.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.615
<i>Nope, can't get distracted.
She's a free woman.</i>

15:07.615 --> 15:09.116
I'm sorry for your loss.

15:09.742 --> 15:13.203
I tell myself Simon would have
much preferred to die young.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.872
His work will live on.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.374
Speaking of which,

15:17.374 --> 15:20.920
I was hoping I'd charm you
into giving a private showing.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.924
It's not ready and, Niko,

15:25.716 --> 15:28.135
I have serious collectors coming tonight.

15:28.135 --> 15:34.475
Mm. And I'm just a charming fuck-boy
using daddy's money to buy trendy art.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.101
- Is that what you think?
- Well...

15:37.519 --> 15:41.273
Worth mentioning, I don't work
for my dad anymore. I know.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.608
For most of my life,

15:43.275 --> 15:45.194
that man dictated every thought,

15:46.153 --> 15:47.821
feeling, and decision.

15:47.821 --> 15:51.408
It wasn't easy to get free, but I did.
I'm chasing my own passions.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.202
Art included.

15:53.202 --> 15:57.331
And since I noticed you're not using
the Lockwood name,

15:59.041 --> 16:00.668
I thought you might get it.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.171
I tell you what.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.801
You make an offer
and I'll need guarantees.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.637
But I'll take it seriously.
I think that's fair.

16:12.805 --> 16:13.847
See you tonight.

16:20.437 --> 16:23.691
<i>I asked Connie to lunch
to assess him for frame-ability.</i>

16:23.691 --> 16:26.610
<i>I was surprised by how happy
he sounded to hear from me.</i>

16:28.570 --> 16:30.114
You probably think I deserve this.

16:30.114 --> 16:33.367
-  <i>It's like he knows why I'm here.</i>
- No. No.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.661
- What happened?
- Fell over in the loo.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.622
As you can see, I'm not doing very well.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.667
I'm glad you called, actually.

16:42.459 --> 16:46.422
I owe you a massive apology
for everything that happened at Hampsie.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.591
- Emotions were running high.
- Just say it.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.928
Gloat. You're a hero.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.304
I'm a twat.

16:59.101 --> 17:02.104
The police think it could be me.
Do you know that?

17:02.896 --> 17:03.731
You?

17:05.315 --> 17:06.233
That's absurd.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.651
<i>Absurdly helpful.</i>

17:07.651 --> 17:09.570
I don't have a single alibi.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.199
Not because I'm a killer, I just...

17:16.118 --> 17:17.995
I have so little memory of anything.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.497
I'm so off my tits, I barely remember
my own name sometimes.

17:20.497 --> 17:24.752
And the truth is, this and the blow,

17:24.752 --> 17:26.712
are the only things I get up for
in the morning.

17:26.712 --> 17:27.796
I'm sorry.

17:27.796 --> 17:30.799
- You can't do coke with a broken nose.
- I know.

17:30.799 --> 17:34.386
So I asked my maid to give me
a booty bump this morning and she quit.

17:35.721 --> 17:39.391
When someone blows cocaine
up your bum through a straw.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.602
<i>This might be the saddest.</i>

17:44.563 --> 17:46.190
Help me, Jonathan.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.610
The night you met Phoebe,
she said your words had

17:49.610 --> 17:51.195
a profound effect on her.

17:51.779 --> 17:52.780
What were they?

17:53.280 --> 17:55.949
- We talked about so much...
- What do I do?

17:57.159 --> 17:58.202
<i>Be a better person.</i>

17:58.202 --> 18:01.121
<i>Do something with all that money
besides reenact</i> Leaving Las Vegas.

18:01.121 --> 18:03.499
Or am I beyond help?

18:04.208 --> 18:05.584
<i>If I frame him,</i>

18:06.460 --> 18:08.420
<i>- I could be saving his life.</i>

18:13.675 --> 18:16.178
Once you find someone,
check your freezer.

18:46.667 --> 18:50.045
Do it tonight, or it's on you tomorrow.

18:50.045 --> 18:53.006
<i>Oh, so no pressure, then.</i>

19:13.277 --> 19:16.488
<i>A busy event, oblivious guests,
strong drinks...</i>

19:17.364 --> 19:20.784
<i>the perfect place for a frame J-O-B.</i>

19:26.582 --> 19:29.585
The Soo collection is mixed in
with several artists

19:29.585 --> 19:31.670
whom the foundation aims to nurture.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.882
Look around, enjoy,
and if you have any questions,

19:34.882 --> 19:36.383
don't hesitate to ask.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.136
<i>I want this to go well for Kate.</i>

19:39.136 --> 19:40.804
<i>I have to do this quietly.</i>

19:42.389 --> 19:44.933
<i>Oh, great, my detective friends.</i>

19:46.185 --> 19:47.561
<i>Where's Connie?</i>

19:52.274 --> 19:53.525
I'm doing it, buddy.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.861
<i>"Buddy"? Thought
I was a calculating snake.</i>

19:55.861 --> 19:57.696
- Adam--
- I said some things in Hampsie,

19:57.696 --> 20:01.158
but I was on a bunch of shit
and I am sober as a pope now.

20:01.158 --> 20:04.620
And I forgive you for everything.
Truly. Okay, listen.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.747
I am proposing to Phoebe.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.790
I got a sick diamond,
I'm chartering a jet,

20:08.790 --> 20:10.667
I'm gonna do the fairy-tale proposal.

20:11.501 --> 20:12.753
- Congrats.
- Thank Dexter.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.922
Listen, she values your opinion,

20:14.922 --> 20:17.090
so when you see her,
maybe say something nice

20:17.090 --> 20:19.176
about how I swallowed my pride
and apologized to Dexter.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.344
<i>He did?</i>

20:22.095 --> 20:23.096
You're the best.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.891
I have to go finalize the whole proposal,

20:25.891 --> 20:28.143
but will you look after her
while I'm gone?

20:28.143 --> 20:32.064
She's been, you know, a lot.
Say nice things, okay?

20:32.064 --> 20:34.107
- Adam, I'm busy.
- Say nice things.

20:37.527 --> 20:38.946
Professor Moore?

20:39.863 --> 20:41.782
Nadia-- Edward. Hello.

20:42.908 --> 20:46.495
I'm confused. Are you rich?
No offense, it's just--

20:46.495 --> 20:48.789
I have friends here.
I could ask the same of you two.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.624
My mother wanted me to absorb culture.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.167
And Nadia is my...

20:53.126 --> 20:54.670
- What are we saying?
- I'm his date.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.797
Could you get me another drink?

20:56.797 --> 20:58.882
<i>I fucking called this, day one.</i>

21:00.050 --> 21:01.551
I'm a little surprised.

21:01.551 --> 21:05.222
Never repeat this,
but I think I might have been wrong.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.808
No, I misjudged. Edward might be cool.

21:07.808 --> 21:11.019
It's not his fault that his parents are
like evil newspaper vipers.

21:11.019 --> 21:14.147
He is actively trying
not to be a prick, so...

21:14.147 --> 21:15.899
Shit. Oh, my--

21:15.899 --> 21:19.278
That's Lady Phoebe.
Do you think she'd take a selfie with me?

21:19.945 --> 21:21.738
Ironically, obvs, but...

21:21.738 --> 21:24.074
- She's quite friendly.
- You know her?

21:25.242 --> 21:26.410
Uh, introduce me.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.997
<i>Love to, but I have to plant
a decomposing ear on a train wreck.</i>

21:29.997 --> 21:31.248
I will, later.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.500
I have to find somebody
and give them something.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.585
I'll be back, okay?
I'll see you later. Okay?

21:43.427 --> 21:45.637
<i>Don't engage, can't engage.</i>

21:45.637 --> 21:47.264
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.308
You look great.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.060
Everything looks great.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.981
- We don't have to do this.
- No, you're right.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.274
But let me just say,

21:57.274 --> 21:59.818
I know it must have been hard
to pull together, not...

22:01.153 --> 22:02.738
Not logistically but everything--

22:02.738 --> 22:04.448
You're giving mixed messages.

22:05.699 --> 22:06.533
I am.

22:06.533 --> 22:10.162
You say you don't want to pursue anything
and then you come to my event.

22:11.204 --> 22:13.874
You say sweet things, it's nice.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.043
And it makes me feel worse.

22:16.668 --> 22:17.502
Right.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.631
- Kate--
- Do you--?

22:21.631 --> 22:23.592
Do you really know what you want?

22:28.388 --> 22:29.222
Excuse me.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.810
<i>I want to go after her, fix this.</i>

22:33.810 --> 22:36.813
<i>I want to be by her side, helping
as she tries to make something good</i>

22:36.813 --> 22:38.273
<i>out of all the bad that's happened.</i>

22:38.273 --> 22:42.235
<i>I want to be anything
but your severed-ear errand boy.</i>

22:55.373 --> 22:57.042
<i>Wow, making it too easy.</i>

23:08.053 --> 23:10.263
- Oh. Johnny Boy.
- Hi.

23:10.847 --> 23:14.184
Oh, my-- God, I've missed Dexter.
Can I get you a drink?

23:14.184 --> 23:16.686
I'm abstaining,
but it doesn't mean you have to.

23:16.686 --> 23:19.272
Our conversation was a real wake-up call.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.650
- It was?
- Seeing your face,

23:21.650 --> 23:26.613
the look of pure pity when I told you
about the whole booty-bump debacle.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.365
Made me realize I need to change.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.450
I want to do something good with my money.

23:30.450 --> 23:34.162
You know, instead of reenacting
<i>Leaving Las Vegas.</i>

23:34.162 --> 23:37.249
-  <i>This can't be happening.</i>
- I look at you, Jonathan.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.960
No money, dressed like a drab librarian,

23:39.960 --> 23:42.170
but you don't let it stop you
being a good person.

23:42.170 --> 23:45.382
And I want to be like that. Like Dexter.

23:45.382 --> 23:48.677
<i>He picks today, of all days,
to have a spiritual awakening.</i>

23:48.677 --> 23:50.512
I've booked myself into rehab.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.721
Mm.

23:51.721 --> 23:54.266
I know, but I go tomorrow.

23:54.891 --> 23:57.644
<i>It's like you said, the more time
you spend with someone,</i>

23:57.644 --> 24:00.063
<i>the more cursed you are
to see them as human.</i>

24:00.063 --> 24:00.981
Hang on.

24:01.565 --> 24:04.025
I'm thanking my higher power for Dexter.

24:04.025 --> 24:05.735
Go on. Meditate with me.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.280
Got to start with deep breaths.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.199
Oh, yeah, that's it.

24:12.993 --> 24:16.329
<i>But you've got a gun to my head
and I'm out of options.</i>

24:16.329 --> 24:17.914
Om.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.587
Come in, I'm sure Kate's around.

24:29.342 --> 24:31.845
- Lady Borehall-Blaxworth?
- Yes?

24:31.845 --> 24:34.139
The police have asked me
to escort you to the safe room.

24:35.473 --> 24:37.559
- Okay. Yes.
- We need to leave now.

24:37.559 --> 24:38.476
Right.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.189
What's happening?

24:42.189 --> 24:44.316
I can tell you more
when we're inside the room.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.400
Okay.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.069
I-- Sorry.

24:48.069 --> 24:50.572
Lady Phoebe, would I be able
to get a selfie with you?

24:50.572 --> 24:51.907
I'm a really big fan.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.701
- Oh, bless Dexter.
- No, I'm sorry, not the moment.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.995
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.914
The police need to speak to me urgently.

25:11.718 --> 25:12.761
What did I miss?

25:13.386 --> 25:16.181
Kate's foundation just got
a serious head start.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.767
Niko bought Simon's entire art collection.

25:18.767 --> 25:23.396
My brother's art breaking new records...
He's bigger than he ever was in life.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.316
Booze. Now.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.239
Niko, what the fuck?

25:32.239 --> 25:35.951
I couldn't decide which I love the most,
so I bought them all.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.828
Well, assuming I approve
this lavish purchase--

25:38.828 --> 25:42.165
Come on. I plan to loan most of them
to the National Gallery in Athens.

25:42.165 --> 25:43.875
A few I'll keep at home.

25:43.875 --> 25:49.214
Perhaps you could advise me
in a more private setting.

25:50.423 --> 25:51.633
I don't come with the art.

25:51.633 --> 25:53.343
I understand entirely.

25:53.343 --> 25:54.719
You come separately.

25:57.764 --> 26:00.767
If I'm still standing here,
it means I'm listening.

26:00.767 --> 26:03.645
Cards on the table.
You're fucking hot, Kate.

26:03.645 --> 26:07.649
And you're smart and powerful,
and that's so sexy.

26:08.191 --> 26:12.404
Truth is, I just love fucking so much,

26:12.404 --> 26:14.948
I'd think it was a curse
if I wasn't so good at it.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.203
My place.

26:20.912 --> 26:21.746
Tomorrow.

26:23.039 --> 26:23.915
Bring wine.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.043
I'll get the champagne.

26:29.587 --> 26:31.214
Kate, darling!

26:33.091 --> 26:35.593
<i>I'm not jealous
because I'm not with Kate, I can't be.</i>

26:35.593 --> 26:36.845
<i>So I'm not.</i>

26:36.845 --> 26:40.140
Hey. Is there something going on?

26:40.140 --> 26:42.267
I asked Lady Phoebe for a selfie.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.686
She's been dragged out
by some really rude waitress.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.062
The police need to speak to her.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.660
If we're in danger,
I should really warn my friends.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.580
My phone's missing.

27:03.580 --> 27:06.082
Don't worry about your friends.
They'll be looked after.

27:06.082 --> 27:08.877
Situation is being handled
this very moment.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.920
So just sit down, take a deep breath.

27:12.172 --> 27:15.216
All right? It's all been taken care of,
don't worry.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.719
You said the police wanted to talk to me.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.556
I feel you can handle the truth.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.725
The police aren't doing their jobs.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.435
Someone needs to protect Dexter.

27:25.435 --> 27:26.895
This was my idea.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.773
To bring you to a safe room.

27:32.859 --> 27:33.985
A safe room?

27:33.985 --> 27:35.362
From the killer.

27:35.862 --> 27:38.323
I've adapted the door specially.

27:52.962 --> 27:54.339
Oh, don't be scared.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.882
You know me.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.094
I do know Dexter.

28:00.845 --> 28:03.098
I've seen you, you're a photographer.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.391
No, I'm your friend.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.144
Oh, it's okay.

28:08.144 --> 28:11.439
You've been through so much.
I'm going to take care of Dexter.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.316
It's going to be all right.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.111
Thank you so much.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.488
I know you went to all this effort,

28:18.488 --> 28:21.282
but I think I'd like to go now.

28:21.282 --> 28:23.618
Must insist that we unlock that door.

28:23.618 --> 28:25.995
No, absolutely not.

28:25.995 --> 28:27.914
We're not going anywhere.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.501
Right, okay. Thank Dexter.

28:32.252 --> 28:35.004
So none of our officers have asked
a waitress to communicate

28:35.004 --> 28:36.172
with Lady Phoebe.

28:36.172 --> 28:38.466
Why are we waiting?
They couldn't have gone far.

28:38.466 --> 28:41.761
Check the street and any vehicles.
You take the back, I'll take the front.

28:41.761 --> 28:43.596
And get someone on the security cameras.

28:43.596 --> 28:46.349
- I'll look too.
- Stay here. You keep calm.

28:46.349 --> 28:48.143
- We will handle this.
- But--

28:48.143 --> 28:51.312
Kate, keep this thing going.
Don't raise any alarms.

28:51.312 --> 28:54.733
Neither one of us can afford
to have this night go nuclear. I got it.

29:01.531 --> 29:04.826
- Think it's the Eat The Rich Killer?
-  <i>No, you said you want this over.</i>

29:04.826 --> 29:07.203
Phoebe told me
that she thought she had a stalker.

29:07.203 --> 29:09.873
I assumed she was overreacting,
but maybe--

29:09.873 --> 29:12.417
Or the most obvious answer is the answer.

29:12.417 --> 29:15.044
Killer's been targeting her friends,
now Phoebe gets taken.

29:15.044 --> 29:17.422
It's not the killer.
At least, it might not be.

29:17.422 --> 29:20.341
If she tells me that she has a stalker,
I have to believe her.

29:20.341 --> 29:21.426
Okay.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.471
Where would you take Phoebe
if you were her stalker?

29:24.471 --> 29:26.598
I'd know the first thing they do
is check the cameras,

29:26.598 --> 29:28.808
- thinking I left with her.
- She's still in the building?

29:28.808 --> 29:31.144
<i>Assuming there's no time
to build anything in the basement.</i>

29:31.144 --> 29:34.939
She's in one of the hotel rooms,
one with few or no adjoining walls,

29:34.939 --> 29:35.940
in case she screams.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.942
Isolated near a fire escape
would be smart.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.487
- There can't be many in the building.
- Tell the cops.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.988
- I'm gonna check a floor plan.
- Okay.

29:41.988 --> 29:45.033
I so appreciate
that you care, Dawn.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.911
My best friend Kate,
it's her big event tonight

29:47.911 --> 29:50.246
and I should be there cheering her on.

29:50.246 --> 29:51.831
Come, we'll go together.

29:51.831 --> 29:54.709
Phoebe, you do so much for everyone,

29:54.709 --> 29:57.670
but I cannot let you put yourself
in harm's way.

29:57.670 --> 30:01.466
I'm going to hide you here
until the police find this killer.

30:03.009 --> 30:06.846
I'm gonna text your friends,
tell them you went to bed early.

30:06.846 --> 30:10.016
Then tomorrow, early, we will sneak out.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.184
I've got a flat.

30:11.184 --> 30:14.187
Oh, I know you love throw cushions.

30:14.187 --> 30:15.438
I bought you a ton.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.440
Don't be scared.

30:18.358 --> 30:22.529
You'll be safe there.
There are big locks on the doors.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.948
I'm not gonna let anything happen
to my soul sister.

30:24.948 --> 30:27.367
Remember the tattoos we got together?

30:35.750 --> 30:36.876
Show me yours.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.261
Did it heal over?

30:47.637 --> 30:49.305
Can't have been deep enough.

30:52.642 --> 30:54.519
We will give you another one.

31:00.024 --> 31:02.360
We can use this. It'll be fine.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.531
It's not so much about what it looks like,

31:06.531 --> 31:08.908
it's more about the deep intent behind it.

31:08.908 --> 31:12.120
Help! Somebody help me, I'm in here!

31:12.120 --> 31:14.998
- Help!
- I told you, it's not safe! Come on.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.750
It's not safe. Shh!

31:19.002 --> 31:22.171
There is a crazy person out there.

31:36.352 --> 31:37.353
Give...

31:42.317 --> 31:43.610
How silly I'm being.

31:43.610 --> 31:46.070
I've just been so jumpy lately, Dawn.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.406
I'm so grateful
you're always looking out for me.

31:49.073 --> 31:50.700
Of course. What are friends for?

31:51.951 --> 31:53.953
You are a good friend, aren't you?

31:54.954 --> 31:57.707
I'm your best friend, Phoebe,
and you're mine.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.002
I try to be a good friend, I do.

32:01.002 --> 32:03.546
I know. All those years watching you
on the telly,

32:03.546 --> 32:07.634
following your social media,
I could feel the connection between us.

32:07.634 --> 32:10.553
When you went to Bora Bora
and you tweeted about the sunrise,

32:10.553 --> 32:15.350
I knew you were telling me
that I was the light to your life.

32:16.851 --> 32:18.811
I only wish you'd been there.

32:20.939 --> 32:24.442
Why don't we leave this wretched city
and go there tonight?

32:24.442 --> 32:26.694
- Really?
- Yes! Yes!

32:26.694 --> 32:28.988
Just let me text Adam
and he'll book us a flight.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.239
Oh, no.

32:32.200 --> 32:37.997
Um, this is gonna be hard for you,
but Adam is not the man you think he is.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.582
- Meaning what?
- He's broke.

32:39.582 --> 32:41.626
He's using you as a meal ticket.

32:42.543 --> 32:45.421
No, Dawn, that's not true.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.465
Adam has plenty of money.

32:47.465 --> 32:50.051
No, he's behind on all his leases!

32:50.051 --> 32:52.762
It's all the staff are talking about,
people are walking out

32:52.762 --> 32:54.514
'cause they don't think
he's gonna pay them.

32:54.514 --> 32:58.142
Rumor has it that he's just sold
his collection of cars.

32:58.977 --> 32:59.978
His cars?

33:01.896 --> 33:04.107
No, Adam would never sell his cars.

33:04.107 --> 33:09.278
- He loves his cars, he wouldn't--
- Adam Pratt is a man of secrets.

33:09.278 --> 33:13.074
They also say he's been unfaithful.

33:16.244 --> 33:17.996
Perhaps you're looking the other way.

33:19.414 --> 33:20.999
My mom did the same.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.042
Head over heels for a man...

33:24.419 --> 33:27.547
who treated her like Princess Di in public

33:27.547 --> 33:32.802
and was humiliating her in private.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.764
Eventually, everyone knew.

33:39.267 --> 33:40.309
How awful.

33:41.477 --> 33:43.312
To be made a fool of like that.

33:43.312 --> 33:47.775
I begged her to leave him,
to have some self-respect.

33:47.775 --> 33:52.113
But you can't command love
if you don't love yourself anymore.

33:54.115 --> 33:56.701
- Oh, I didn't mean to upset Dexter.
- No.

33:57.243 --> 33:58.286
No, no.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.079
It's good that you told me.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.207
No one has ever looked out
for me this way before.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.478
So tell me more about your mom.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.148
Maintenance.

34:28.524 --> 34:29.984
It's not a good time.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.738
We've got a leak in the room below,
so I need to come in.

34:34.447 --> 34:37.033
Jonathan! Is that you?

34:37.033 --> 34:38.117
Yes.

34:38.117 --> 34:39.952
Is everything all right?

34:39.952 --> 34:41.954
I'm with my friend, Dawn.

34:42.705 --> 34:44.123
Told you all about her.

34:45.666 --> 34:46.501
You have?

34:46.501 --> 34:50.254
Yes, the paparazzi lady
I only speak to through the television.

34:52.548 --> 34:54.675
Of course, I remember Dawn.

34:56.719 --> 34:59.722
Why don't you let me in
so we can talk face-to-face?

35:00.848 --> 35:02.433
Not in this lifetime.

35:02.433 --> 35:05.103
- He could be the killer.
-  Oh, he's not.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.979
He's a hero, he saved my friend's life.

35:06.979 --> 35:09.774
Then why is he pretending
to be maintenance?

35:09.774 --> 35:14.779
Um, probably because he thought
something had happened to me.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.073
- Isn't that right, Jonathan?
- Yeah.

35:17.073 --> 35:21.452
Listen, I don't want you to panic.

35:23.996 --> 35:26.624
You are both in danger,
the killer is here.

35:26.624 --> 35:29.043
And if you let me in,
I can explain everything.

35:30.086 --> 35:31.337
I don't believe him.

35:32.004 --> 35:33.965
Jonathan's the most honest person I know.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.925
And he shouldn't be out there
with the killer.

35:35.925 --> 35:38.261
If something happens to him,
I'll never forgive Dexter.

35:57.029 --> 35:57.864
Hi, Dawn.

35:58.865 --> 35:59.866
You can trust me.

36:00.449 --> 36:01.450
I'm a friend.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.050
Lock the door.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.645
What have you got
to tell us about the killer?

36:31.314 --> 36:32.732
Wait, I know Dexter.

36:33.441 --> 36:36.944
I've been watching you
since you shoved in with Phoebe.

36:36.944 --> 36:38.863
I followed you to that political speech.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.616
You were acting strange,
like you didn't want anyone to see Dexter.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.826
<i>She was following me
while I was following Dexter.</i>

36:43.826 --> 36:46.495
I tried to look him up,
but there's nothing.

36:46.495 --> 36:49.582
This man isn't what he says he is.
He's either a con man or worse.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.000
I won't hear of this.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.712
- Jonathan's one of my best friends.
- How's that?

36:55.213 --> 36:57.131
When's Phoebe's birthday?

36:57.757 --> 37:00.301
August 3rd. Favorite song?
"Gimme More," Britney Spears.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.970
Name her childhood dog.
Punky Spunky Sparkle.

37:02.970 --> 37:06.682
This one doesn't care about Dexter.
He's another user, hanger-on.

37:06.682 --> 37:10.228
What do you want with Lady Phoebe?
Tell me the truth.

37:13.981 --> 37:14.982
Okay.

37:16.275 --> 37:17.735
This is the truth.

37:17.735 --> 37:23.074
Whatever relationship you think
you have with this woman, you don't.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.825
It's a figment of your imagination.

37:24.825 --> 37:28.037
- You're trying to confuse me.
- You care. That part is real, I know.

37:28.037 --> 37:30.498
- But look at her. She's scared.
- I don't believe that.

37:30.498 --> 37:32.208
- Tell him.
-  Dawn, it's okay.

37:32.208 --> 37:35.378
I know you're a good person,
but you need help.

37:35.378 --> 37:38.047
- You're not well.
- Nothing's wrong with me. I'm fine.

37:38.047 --> 37:41.550
A German postal worker thought
he knew my friend Madonna.

37:41.550 --> 37:45.346
He was suffering from something
called erotomania, sweetheart.

37:45.346 --> 37:47.223
- It's a delusion.
- You're cross with me.

37:47.223 --> 37:48.766
You think you know someone you don't.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.893
He thought Madge
was proposing through traffic lights.

37:50.893 --> 37:52.770
That's not happening to me.
I know what's real.

37:52.770 --> 37:56.232
We can still be friends.
Starting today, a new friendship.

38:00.027 --> 38:01.404
Put the knife down.

38:02.071 --> 38:03.239
Unlock the door.

38:06.659 --> 38:07.702
Let her go.

38:09.453 --> 38:10.788
But she's not safe.

38:10.788 --> 38:13.958
If somebody killed her,
I would never forgive myself.

38:15.376 --> 38:16.961
I would never forgive you!

38:16.961 --> 38:18.546
Drop the knife.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.381
You're crazy! Get--

38:21.757 --> 38:24.927
I have tried to be nice, you crazy bitch.

38:24.927 --> 38:26.262
But enough is enough!

38:26.262 --> 38:29.098
I am sick of being manipulated

38:29.098 --> 38:32.184
and underestimated and fake protected.

38:32.184 --> 38:34.103
You think you know me, Dawn?

38:34.103 --> 38:35.980
What am I gonna do next?

38:36.605 --> 38:37.857
Come on, tell me!

38:42.820 --> 38:44.071
Freeze! Stay where you are!

38:44.071 --> 38:46.782
- Put the knife down!
- Happily. Happily.

38:47.658 --> 38:50.453
This woman kidnapped me,
and then she tried to carve up my arm

38:50.453 --> 38:51.412
and kill Jonathan.

38:51.412 --> 38:52.997
Phoebe, I didn't do that.

38:52.997 --> 38:56.083
- I was trying to help her.
-  Andrews, look inside the bag.

38:56.083 --> 38:58.502
Phoebe, I did this to help Dexter.

39:03.382 --> 39:05.343
Oh, my God. That's disgusting.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.012
<i>Unlike Connie
who was only hurting himself,</i>

39:08.012 --> 39:11.057
<i>Dawn was endangering Phoebe.
A better choice.</i>

39:11.057 --> 39:12.516
That's Simon's earring.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.694
- She's the Eat The Rich Killer.
- No.

39:23.694 --> 39:27.073
You are being arrested on suspicion
for the murders of Malcolm Harding,

39:27.073 --> 39:30.576
- Simon Soo, and Gemma Graham-Greene.
- I didn't do it.

39:30.576 --> 39:33.829
- You have the right to remain silent...
- Phoebe. Are you all right?

39:34.497 --> 39:35.498
Phoebe.

39:36.248 --> 39:38.459
- It's all right, pumpkin. Okay?
- Adam.

39:43.464 --> 39:44.507
A hero, again.

40:02.525 --> 40:03.526
<i>It's over.</i>

40:03.526 --> 40:04.902
<i>I did what you asked.</i>

40:04.902 --> 40:07.029
<i>The killer, in quotes, was caught.</i>

40:07.863 --> 40:09.782
<i>Dawn will get psychiatric help</i>

40:09.782 --> 40:13.994
<i>and eventually be exonerated
once I've exposed the real killer,</i>

40:13.994 --> 40:14.912
<i>Dexter.</i>

40:17.373 --> 40:19.750
<i>Of course, you found a way
to spin this in your favor.</i>

40:19.750 --> 40:22.169
<i>Enjoy it while it lasts.</i>

40:23.754 --> 40:24.964
I should be jealous.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.717
The man hijacked my date
and enlisted her to catch

40:28.717 --> 40:30.136
an infamous murderer.

40:30.136 --> 40:32.096
Do you not think it's weird
that a few weeks ago

40:32.096 --> 40:37.435
he knew bugger all about detective stories
and now suddenly he's Hercule Poirot?

40:37.435 --> 40:38.519
Clearly you do.

40:39.854 --> 40:43.232
Lady Phoebe said something
about him being the hero again.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.527
It just seems weird.

40:48.154 --> 40:51.574
When's the last time you read something
where the outsider kept being the hero

40:51.574 --> 40:54.994
but had no deeper connection
whatsoever to the story?

40:56.579 --> 40:58.914
- What are you saying?
- I don't know.

41:01.709 --> 41:04.753
Just seems like he's the kind of man
who knows more than he lets on.

41:12.178 --> 41:13.387
Hello, my love.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.973
This seems a lot for two people.

41:16.974 --> 41:18.058
What?

41:18.058 --> 41:21.061
Nothing is too much
when it comes to you, darling.

41:21.061 --> 41:23.439
Sit, sit, sit.

41:24.982 --> 41:27.318
- Nice.
- What is this about, Adam?

41:28.277 --> 41:31.447
It's about Dexter. Actually, it's about us.

41:33.032 --> 41:35.034
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

41:36.452 --> 41:37.578
Mm.

41:37.578 --> 41:38.496
Here.

41:42.249 --> 41:43.501
Why don't you open that up?

41:59.892 --> 42:01.477
Phoebe, will you marry me?

42:03.687 --> 42:07.024
- Oh, my... Adam--
- I've chartered a jet

42:07.024 --> 42:09.527
and it's gonna take us
straight to the Hotel du Cap.

42:10.819 --> 42:12.112
Where we first met?

42:14.532 --> 42:15.699
I need Dexter.

42:15.699 --> 42:18.118
Almost losing you made me realize that.

42:20.496 --> 42:22.331
Or was it almost losing something else?

42:23.707 --> 42:24.542
What?

42:26.710 --> 42:30.548
Your club,
your reputation, your lifestyle...

42:30.548 --> 42:32.550
I know about your money problems.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.761
I found out from my stalker,
of all people.

42:35.761 --> 42:38.847
How sad and humiliating is that, Adam?

42:39.807 --> 42:41.100
I can't do it again.

42:42.518 --> 42:43.602
Be made a fool of.

42:44.353 --> 42:49.233
- Phoebe, come on.
- I have been incredibly kind in the past,

42:49.233 --> 42:53.529
had so many dear little lambs
who were, in actuality, cruel wolves.

42:53.529 --> 42:54.613
That's not me.

42:55.239 --> 42:57.199
I want someone who loves me.

42:59.034 --> 43:01.453
Really, truly loves me.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.582
Because that is the one thing
I've never had.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.959
Don't say that. Okay, I love Dexter.

43:06.959 --> 43:08.877
I love you more than anything.

43:08.877 --> 43:10.129
Me or my money?

43:12.423 --> 43:15.551
Money? It's not about money.

43:15.551 --> 43:17.011
Well, if that's true,

43:18.095 --> 43:21.390
then you will sort your problems out
and come back to me, won't you?

43:21.390 --> 43:22.725
Then I'll know you mean it.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.107
Fuck.

43:47.458 --> 43:48.459
To independence.

43:48.459 --> 43:49.543
Independence.

44:20.157 --> 44:20.991
What the--?

44:21.909 --> 44:22.910
Tom Lockwood?

44:24.370 --> 44:25.204
Shit.

44:26.288 --> 44:27.665
Katherine. Kate.

44:27.665 --> 44:30.167
- I can explain.
- Katherine? You--

44:33.462 --> 44:34.463
Oh, my...

44:37.007 --> 44:38.050
Oh, my God.

44:39.593 --> 44:41.011
You're working for him?

44:41.011 --> 44:44.264
- You're working for my father?
- It's not what you think. I'm just--

44:44.264 --> 44:47.851
He had you buy the art, didn't he?

44:50.813 --> 44:54.483
He wanted to do something nice,
help you start your foundation,

44:54.483 --> 44:56.944
but knew you were doing
this independent woman thing.

44:56.944 --> 44:59.613
I don't know
what makes my blood boil more,

44:59.613 --> 45:03.659
that comment or the fact
that you've been lying this whole time.

45:03.659 --> 45:05.702
I wasn't. I have stepped away
from my family.

45:05.702 --> 45:08.747
Yes, to work for mine.
It's infinitely worse.

45:08.747 --> 45:11.500
He really is trying to help.

45:12.167 --> 45:13.001
No.

45:14.002 --> 45:16.046
I know-- I know you believe that

45:16.046 --> 45:18.424
because you're not smart enough
to see you're being played.

45:18.424 --> 45:20.801
By helping Tom give
your foundation millions?

45:20.801 --> 45:25.055
By sending me a message
that he is ever present,

45:25.722 --> 45:27.099
ever controlling,

45:27.099 --> 45:30.727
no matter how I try
to get out of his shadow.

45:30.727 --> 45:32.396
You can leave now.

45:33.814 --> 45:34.648
Now!

46:07.055 --> 46:09.183
<i>Well, she wasn't wrong
when she called me out</i>

46:09.183 --> 46:10.934
<i>for sending mixed messages.</i>

46:25.157 --> 46:27.326
<i>So, what the hell do I say?</i>

46:29.453 --> 46:30.829
There's something here.

46:31.955 --> 46:33.415
Then why are we wasting time?

46:33.415 --> 46:37.461
<i>Because even if I get rid of you,
there's the issue of Joe Goldberg.</i>

46:37.461 --> 46:39.463
Because what I told you is real.

46:40.172 --> 46:44.009
My past is not great.
Otherwise, I wouldn't waste a second.

46:44.009 --> 46:47.721
I think about you, I see who you are,
how you take care of people.

46:47.721 --> 46:49.848
The good you're trying to do.

46:49.848 --> 46:55.312
I got jealous the moment I saw
that prick touch you,

46:55.979 --> 46:57.314
and I have zero right.

46:57.314 --> 46:59.024
Believe me, I know.

46:59.775 --> 47:01.485
But I see Dexter.

47:03.654 --> 47:06.281
- I just--
- Are you trying to say you want me?

47:07.407 --> 47:10.327
Kate, of course, I want Dexter.

47:14.122 --> 47:15.916
But I can't have Dexter.

47:17.876 --> 47:19.002
Do I have this straight?

47:19.002 --> 47:21.380
You ran away from who you were

47:22.047 --> 47:26.343
and what you did, or both,
and you don't want me to know.

47:26.885 --> 47:27.719
Yes.

47:28.303 --> 47:31.014
Your desire is to be honest,
but you can't.

47:31.014 --> 47:34.268
So your only choice is
to run away from this too.

47:35.519 --> 47:36.728
No. Yeah.

47:36.728 --> 47:40.983
Yeah, well, I have a past too, Jonathan.

47:41.608 --> 47:44.361
In another place with another name.

47:45.070 --> 47:47.948
All I want is to never be her again.

47:50.617 --> 47:54.955
Well, for what it's worth,
all I see is Kate.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.084
I know you do.

48:03.964 --> 48:09.261
So I will never ask your name,
who you were, what you did.

48:09.261 --> 48:11.221
I don't need to know. Ever.

48:11.722 --> 48:13.932
If you are honest with me from now forward

48:13.932 --> 48:16.059
and I'm honest with you, then--

48:16.059 --> 48:17.561
- Yes.
- That's what matters.

48:17.561 --> 48:19.438
If you let me leave her in the past,

48:19.438 --> 48:21.690
then the least I can do
is the same for Dexter.

48:21.690 --> 48:23.442
We are trying.

48:24.985 --> 48:26.486
So do the same thing.

48:27.029 --> 48:30.115
I don't have to ice you out
and you don't have to run away.

48:30.115 --> 48:31.199
We can just...

48:33.910 --> 48:36.622
- We can be this.
- Whatever the fuck this is.

48:50.218 --> 48:51.762
<i>Best reason yet</i>

48:51.762 --> 48:54.598
<i>to get you out of the picture permanently.</i>

49:14.743 --> 49:16.411
Sofa or bed?

49:16.411 --> 49:17.496
I don't care.

49:38.433 --> 49:39.476
Hello, Joe.

49:41.645 --> 49:46.274
You know, there's nothing quite
like a nice cold, crisp lager after sex.

49:48.860 --> 49:52.030
Your hair, mate. Oh, and the window.

49:53.240 --> 49:56.118
I hope you're not gonna give me
a lecture about watching people.

49:56.827 --> 49:59.454
- No, no, no, don't turn it off, Joe.

50:13.343 --> 50:16.012
- I did what you asked.
- And a stellar job of it, mate.

50:17.013 --> 50:19.516
- Pinning it all on that woman.
- Yeah.

50:19.516 --> 50:21.893
Opportunity fell in my lap, didn't it?

50:21.893 --> 50:23.854
You thought on your feet.

50:23.854 --> 50:26.481
Erotomania, fuck, it's brilliant.

50:26.481 --> 50:28.358
You know, I had to google it.

50:28.358 --> 50:31.862
The whole "voices in my head thing
made me do it" is very hard to disprove.

50:31.862 --> 50:32.779
Okay.

50:34.156 --> 50:35.157
What now?

50:35.157 --> 50:37.993
- This is over, right?
- Over?

50:38.535 --> 50:39.494
Um...

50:40.162 --> 50:43.498
We're done dealing with the little people,
if that's what you mean.

50:43.999 --> 50:46.418
One last thing. The biggest and greatest.

50:47.335 --> 50:48.420
Our main event.

50:48.420 --> 50:49.963
<i>Of course.</i>

50:49.963 --> 50:51.965
- No.
- But you're gonna love it.

50:53.091 --> 50:56.636
So he's a man
who represents everything we hate.

50:56.636 --> 50:58.805
Capitalist greed, hypocrisy.

50:58.805 --> 51:01.224
He's also backing my political opponent

51:01.224 --> 51:05.395
and he's a massive thorn
in the side of your girlfriend.

51:08.148 --> 51:09.357
Kate's father.

51:10.484 --> 51:12.986
Tom Lockwood. The devil.

51:13.570 --> 51:15.864
We're gonna have so much fun killing him.
