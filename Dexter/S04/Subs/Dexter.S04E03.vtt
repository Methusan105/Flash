00:02.007 --> 00:03.758
PreviousIy on Dexter...

00:06.720 --> 00:08.596
(Woman) Do you know where you are?

00:08.722 --> 00:11.099
- Ambulance. What happened?
- (Woman) You were in an accident.

00:11.225 --> 00:13.226
Bad news is that
you sustained a concussion.

00:13.352 --> 00:15.103
I'd like to keep you here for observation.

00:15.229 --> 00:17.730
Dexter! Oh, my God!

00:17.856 --> 00:21.192
- You all right?
- I'm fine. Just a little fender bender.

00:21.318 --> 00:22.568
Doc says I'm good to go.

00:22.695 --> 00:23.861
You got a minute?

00:23.987 --> 00:25.697
I'd like to pick your brain.

00:25.823 --> 00:27.365
Lisa Bell?

00:27.491 --> 00:29.075
The girl in the bathtub.

00:29.201 --> 00:32.578
Of course. The Trinity Killer's
most recent victim.

00:32.705 --> 00:34.038
(Lundy) Trinity is going to kill again.

00:34.164 --> 00:36.958
Another woman.
Older than Lisa Bell this time.

00:37.084 --> 00:40.461
The person that you should really be talking
to is my sister. She's lead on Lisa Bell.

00:40.587 --> 00:42.880
You sure that's a good call?
Given our history.

00:43.006 --> 00:48.052
I wouldn't want to mislead you.
What I have with Anton. It's...It's great.

00:48.178 --> 00:49.762
I fucking love you.

00:49.888 --> 00:52.974
The reason I'm in Miami
is because I'm convinced

00:53.100 --> 00:58.062
these bathtub murders are connected to
a series of murders all over the country.

00:58.188 --> 01:00.398
Christ. I'm an idiot.

01:00.524 --> 01:01.733
Debra!

01:01.859 --> 01:03.484
Tell me again this isn't crazy.

01:03.610 --> 01:04.861
Crazy good.

01:06.196 --> 01:08.406
I brought you a copy of my article.

01:08.532 --> 01:11.075
"A string of robberies turned deadly
in what authorities

01:11.201 --> 01:12.827
"are now calling the Vacation Murder."

01:12.953 --> 01:14.912
Found your guy.
Name's Johnny Rose.

01:15.038 --> 01:17.248
Briefing room in five minutes.
Strategy meeting.

01:17.374 --> 01:19.500
Dexter's turned up a lead
on our shooter.

01:24.381 --> 01:26.007
(Dexter) Don't sweat it, Quinn.

01:26.133 --> 01:28.259
I've got much bigger things
to worry about.

01:28.385 --> 01:29.761
I thought it was a fender bender.

01:29.887 --> 01:32.430
I'm sure there's a bent fender
somewhere in this mess.

01:32.556 --> 01:33.681
Oh, my God.

01:33.807 --> 01:36.893
- Rita, what are you doing here?
- You lied to me, Dexter.

03:26.336 --> 03:29.338
(   Latin music)

03:34.303 --> 03:36.387
(Dexter) The backyard barbecue.

03:36.513 --> 03:40.266
It's a hoIdover from the Iast ice age
when food was scarce

03:40.392 --> 03:44.353
and men had to work together
to take down such a Iarge beast.

03:45.314 --> 03:47.732
Those who worked well with others
survived,

03:47.858 --> 03:50.401
and their genes have been passed down
through the centuries

03:50.527 --> 03:52.570
untiI they Ianded here,

03:52.696 --> 03:54.071
in this...

03:55.198 --> 03:56.824
my community.

04:17.846 --> 04:19.013
Soda?

04:20.182 --> 04:21.182
Whatever.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.062
How about you?

04:28.231 --> 04:29.565
I'm good.

04:30.984 --> 04:33.736
Ah, wasted youth.

04:35.614 --> 04:37.782
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

04:37.908 --> 04:39.075
Yeah.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.913
I just got off the phone
with Dr. Montgomery,

04:44.039 --> 04:46.874
the doctor that took care of you
after your accident.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.542
Oh, right.

04:48.669 --> 04:50.670
Why didn't you tell me
you had a concussion?

04:50.796 --> 04:52.338
I just wanted
to keep you from worrying.

04:52.464 --> 04:54.006
You already have so much
to deal with.

04:54.132 --> 04:56.550
The doctor also told you
you weren't supposed to drive

04:56.677 --> 04:58.594
for the next ten days,
and you didn't listen.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.304
So I will now be doing all your driving.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.974
I will take you to work in the morning
and pick you up at the end of the day.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.476
- Rita, I'm perfectly capable...
- Dexter.

05:06.603 --> 05:11.065
The past few weeks, you have not been
the most present father and husband.

05:11.191 --> 05:13.442
Remember, we're a team here, right?

05:13.568 --> 05:16.362
OK? We work together.

05:17.906 --> 05:21.993
She's right. Maybe now's the time
to turn that around, score a few points.

05:22.119 --> 05:24.078
Which will then make Rita
more IikeIy to say yes

05:24.204 --> 05:26.664
when I need a IittIe time for myseIf.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.249
You're right.

05:28.375 --> 05:29.750
I'm sorry.

05:29.876 --> 05:32.670
Thank you. Let's go eat.

05:36.466 --> 05:39.218
So I guess you saw somebody
bashed in Kate's birdbath.

05:39.344 --> 05:41.429
(Rita sighs) I know, that's awful.

05:41.555 --> 05:43.681
Poor birds.

05:43.807 --> 05:45.474
And poor Kate.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.184
Why would someone do such a thing?

05:47.310 --> 05:49.770
For the same reason he knocked over
the Andersons' fountain,

05:49.896 --> 05:52.148
pulled down the Garcias'
basketball hoop

05:52.274 --> 05:54.442
and spray-painted the Schwarzes'
trash cans. He's a dick.

05:54.568 --> 05:56.610
He knocked the sea horse
off my mailbox, too.

05:56.737 --> 05:58.612
I hated that sea horse.

05:58.739 --> 06:01.323
Well, your mom picked it out.

06:03.326 --> 06:06.287
- You know Andy.
- Uh, yeah, of course.

06:06.413 --> 06:09.373
Hi, how are you doing?
Hey, Jess. Jess. Jess?

06:09.499 --> 06:11.083
Do you really need
to be doing that?

06:11.209 --> 06:12.877
Yeah, I really do.

06:13.003 --> 06:15.337
His wife passed away last year.

06:16.548 --> 06:19.216
So, um, so about this
neighborhood vandal.

06:19.342 --> 06:21.385
We all need to work together
to deal with this guy.

06:21.511 --> 06:24.513
The last thing we need is a dangerous
presence in our neighborhood.

06:24.639 --> 06:28.684
You know, it's a funny thing, Dexter. This all
started to happen time you moved in.

06:28.810 --> 06:30.519
A little suspicious, don't you think?

06:32.147 --> 06:34.315
I'm just busting your chops.

06:34.441 --> 06:36.400
- Oh.
- (They laugh)

06:36.526 --> 06:37.777
My chops are busted.

06:38.612 --> 06:41.238
The danger of community
is that the peopIe who don't beIong

06:41.364 --> 06:42.782
are Iooked upon with suspicion.

06:42.908 --> 06:46.077
Those of us who prefer
to work by ourseIves,

06:46.203 --> 06:48.662
the lone wolves,
risk being singIed out.

06:48.789 --> 06:51.499
Cody. What's that?

06:51.625 --> 06:52.833
Waah!

06:52.959 --> 06:54.960
(Laughter)

06:55.629 --> 06:58.214
- I'm gonna get you!
- Oh, I'm scared!

06:58.965 --> 07:03.219
So I become an expert at bIending in,
camouflaging myseIf,

07:03.345 --> 07:05.471
becoming one of the guys.

07:05.597 --> 07:08.599
- Astor, what's that?
- (Screams)

07:08.725 --> 07:09.892
Oh, my God!

07:10.018 --> 07:11.060
Dexter!

07:12.062 --> 07:14.605
I'm so humiliated.

07:15.816 --> 07:17.483
What were you thinking?

07:17.609 --> 07:19.360
She was wearing a bathing suit.

07:19.486 --> 07:22.321
This bIending-in thing
isn't as easy as it Iooks.

07:27.828 --> 07:28.869
(Sobbing)

07:38.421 --> 07:39.672
We're here.

07:39.798 --> 07:41.465
Stop right here.

07:50.183 --> 07:51.851
It's OK.

07:56.690 --> 07:58.440
Oh!

07:58.567 --> 08:00.860
Oh, God, please don't hurt me.

08:00.986 --> 08:03.904
Oh, God! Oh, God!

08:08.326 --> 08:09.994
(Continues sobbing)

08:14.124 --> 08:16.083
(Mitchell) Don't do anything stupid.

08:21.298 --> 08:23.048
Careful, now.

08:23.175 --> 08:25.634
- Wouldn't want to hurt yourself.
- (Moans)

08:40.150 --> 08:42.067
It's pretty, isn't it?

08:44.946 --> 08:47.948
OK, now.
It's time for you to jump.

08:48.074 --> 08:49.617
What?

08:50.577 --> 08:51.577
God, no.

08:51.703 --> 08:54.038
Yes. It always ends like this.

08:54.164 --> 08:55.873
- No, but...
- Shh.

08:55.999 --> 08:57.541
(Sobbing)

08:57.667 --> 08:59.335
It's already over.

09:01.171 --> 09:03.714
Why are you doing this to me?

09:03.840 --> 09:05.382
You know I'm not to blame here.

09:05.508 --> 09:06.800
(Sobbing) Oh, God!

09:06.927 --> 09:08.344
- Come on, now.
- Oh no.

09:13.058 --> 09:14.350
Please, no!

09:15.352 --> 09:17.019
You just need to let go...

09:18.355 --> 09:19.605
and fall.

09:19.731 --> 09:21.106
Please, I'll do anything.

09:21.233 --> 09:22.942
- Good. Jump.
- No, I can't!

09:23.068 --> 09:25.152
- You can.
- I have children!

09:25.278 --> 09:28.239
I know. Jason and Susie.

09:28.365 --> 09:29.240
(Groaning)

09:29.366 --> 09:30.950
If you like, I can swing by your house,

09:31.076 --> 09:33.577
put an ice pick
in your husband's head,

09:33.703 --> 09:36.455
and bring your kids back
and throw them off one at a time

09:36.581 --> 09:38.374
till you finally decide to jump.

09:39.751 --> 09:41.877
Is that what you want?

09:45.924 --> 09:46.966
Please...

09:48.218 --> 09:50.302
- What?
- Please.

09:51.471 --> 09:53.180
Just push me.

09:57.727 --> 09:59.603
Doesn't work that way.

10:02.274 --> 10:03.899
Jump.

10:10.991 --> 10:12.658
(Gasps, screams)

10:13.410 --> 10:14.535
(Thud)

10:26.006 --> 10:27.131
Oh...

10:28.383 --> 10:29.842
Mommy.

11:22.312 --> 11:24.897
(Harry) You've only been here a month
and they've already got you tagged.

11:25.023 --> 11:26.857
It's not just me.
There are other houses.

11:26.983 --> 11:30.069
Dex, we've been through this before.
1 1th grade.

11:30.195 --> 11:32.071
Bunch of kids T.P.ed the house.

11:32.197 --> 11:33.989
And you made me clean it up.

11:34.991 --> 11:37.242
Because it raised questions, Dexter.

11:37.369 --> 11:39.912
It would have made people think,
"Why this kid? Why him?"

11:40.038 --> 11:42.414
You can't afford to have people
asking those questions.

11:42.540 --> 11:45.250
No one's asking questions.

11:45.377 --> 11:47.795
Getting married, having a kid,

11:47.921 --> 11:49.671
moving here...

11:49.798 --> 11:51.757
I know you're under a lot of pressure.

11:51.883 --> 11:53.258
Yeah, I am.

11:53.385 --> 11:55.469
But you can't let things slip.

11:57.972 --> 12:01.558
I'm not sIipping.
But somebody is.

12:16.241 --> 12:18.909
How come you never make the coffee,
even if you're up first?

12:19.035 --> 12:21.745
'Cause I don't want it
bad enough to make it.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.330
I don't even know
what to say to that.

12:23.456 --> 12:25.582
If there was chocolate cake here
I would eat it,

12:25.708 --> 12:27.626
but I sure as hell don't want to bake one.

12:33.049 --> 12:35.342
- Hey! Good news!
- Yeah?

12:35.468 --> 12:38.554
Yeah, the Sandpiper Hotel wants to book
my band for a one-month gig.

12:39.305 --> 12:41.598
- Three nights a week.
- Wow, that's great.

12:41.724 --> 12:43.809
No more cruise ships.

12:43.935 --> 12:46.437
And best of all, it means
no more time away from you.

12:46.563 --> 12:47.688
Really?

12:47.814 --> 12:49.273
Yeah, I'll be here every day.

12:49.399 --> 12:53.527
Going to bed with you every night.
Waking up with you every morning.

12:54.529 --> 12:57.531
Waiting for you to make me coffee.

12:57.657 --> 12:59.575
(They laugh)

13:04.289 --> 13:07.499
(Sings along to radio
playing Karma Chameleon)

13:07.625 --> 13:08.834
You come and go

13:08.960 --> 13:10.669
OK, if I count yesterday,

13:10.795 --> 13:15.257
then this is day two of me being
the best husband in the world.

13:15.383 --> 13:16.967
I can Iast another five days.

13:17.093 --> 13:19.511
I really need to stop
for a coffee someplace.

13:19.637 --> 13:20.679
You already had a coffee.

13:20.805 --> 13:24.558
Red, gold, and green

13:24.684 --> 13:27.644
Every day is like survival

13:27.770 --> 13:30.147
Survival

13:30.273 --> 13:34.776
ReaIIy, I started Saturday afternoon,
so it's actuaIIy been more Iike 21/2 days.

13:34.903 --> 13:37.154
Every day is like survival

13:37.280 --> 13:39.865
OnIy 41/2 to go.

13:39.991 --> 13:42.159
I'm never gonna make it.

13:42.285 --> 13:45.537
As far as our Vacation Murder suspect,
Johnny Rose,

13:45.663 --> 13:47.498
we've still come up with nothing.

13:47.624 --> 13:51.627
We've spoken to his mother, his sister,
his past two employers...

13:51.753 --> 13:55.172
Everyone in his building, his mailman,
the liquor store guy across the street.

13:55.298 --> 13:56.632
So no one's talking.

13:56.758 --> 13:59.092
We have his immediate family members
under surveillance,

13:59.219 --> 14:01.845
- but we're still not getting any hits.
- Well, expand the search.

14:01.971 --> 14:03.347
Draw up a new list of subjects.

14:03.473 --> 14:05.557
Morgan, where do we stand
on the Lisa Bell murder?

14:05.683 --> 14:07.226
Somewhere in the middle of Shit Creek.

14:07.352 --> 14:10.854
Well, find a paddle, or I'm moving you onto
the Vacation Murder with the rest of us.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.190
Finding Johnny Rose
is our number-one priority.

14:13.316 --> 14:16.193
- Yes, ma'am.
- Dexter. Hey.

14:16.319 --> 14:17.236
Uh, hi.

14:17.362 --> 14:19.905
Quick question -
do you like the Dolphins?

14:20.031 --> 14:23.283
I'm really more
of a manatee guy, but sure.

14:23.409 --> 14:25.035
Club level seats.

14:25.161 --> 14:27.037
- Enjoy.
- Why?

14:27.163 --> 14:28.372
I can't go.

14:28.498 --> 14:31.708
And I asked myself who's a friend
that I could give 'em to?

14:32.835 --> 14:35.712
So I thought of you.

14:39.801 --> 14:42.678
Miami Dolphins. Football.

14:42.804 --> 14:44.221
Club level?

14:44.347 --> 14:48.392
Jeez, who do I gotta fuck
to get those kind of tickets?

14:48.518 --> 14:50.185
Here.

14:51.437 --> 14:53.522
No fucking.

14:54.607 --> 14:55.607
Dude.

14:55.733 --> 14:59.736
All right, listen up. We got a report of
a female body found at the old port.

14:59.862 --> 15:01.822
Looks like a jumper.
Who wants it?

15:01.948 --> 15:03.240
Sounds exciting, sarge,

15:03.366 --> 15:05.576
but I think I'm gonna hold out
for a cat stuck in a tree.

15:05.702 --> 15:08.745
Huh, I wonder if that's the woman
Lundy predicted.

15:08.871 --> 15:10.247
We'll take it.

15:10.373 --> 15:11.665
OK.

15:11.791 --> 15:14.543
Unless she landed on a pile of
marshmallows, there's gonna be blood.

15:14.669 --> 15:16.795
- Grab your kit.
- Sure, I'll follow you there.

15:16.921 --> 15:19.756
Ha-ha! Not a chance, concussion-boy.
Rita said no driving for you.

15:19.882 --> 15:22.050
- You're coming with us.
- (Sighs)

15:25.138 --> 15:28.098
(Car stereo plays hip-hop)

15:28.224 --> 15:30.934
Climb in the back, Dexter.
You'll be right on the subwoofer.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.061
You can feel the bass in your spine.

15:39.986 --> 15:41.069
(Dexter) Loud!

15:52.498 --> 15:55.500
Female. Caucasian.
Mid-thirties, I'm guessing.

15:55.627 --> 15:58.503
lf this is the latest victim
of Lundy's Trinity KiIIer,

15:58.630 --> 16:01.298
then he's a very different monster than I am.

16:01.424 --> 16:02.591
Cause of death?

16:06.220 --> 16:07.471
Gravity.

16:08.598 --> 16:11.683
Why her? Why here?

16:11.809 --> 16:14.478
What is Trinity's code?

16:14.604 --> 16:16.063
Does he have one?

16:16.189 --> 16:19.066
No sign of a struggle.
No pre-mortem bruising.

16:19.192 --> 16:20.400
No ligature marks.

16:20.526 --> 16:22.444
It's looking like a suicide to me.

16:24.322 --> 16:27.115
Oh, well, if it isn't
Special Agent Grandpa.

16:27.241 --> 16:30.202
- Shut up, Quinn.
- Detectives.

16:30.328 --> 16:32.120
- Morgan.
- Agent Lundy.

16:33.456 --> 16:34.581
Masuka.

16:34.707 --> 16:36.291
Cool hat.

16:36.417 --> 16:37.918
You have a name yet?

16:38.044 --> 16:41.296
Driver's license in her car says Tarla Grant
from Fort Lauderdale.

16:41.422 --> 16:44.007
So what brings you
to our little suicide?

16:44.133 --> 16:45.300
Just observing.

16:45.426 --> 16:47.594
You're a little quick to decide it's a suicide.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.680
Still has herjewelry, her wallet.
Wasn't robbed.

16:49.806 --> 16:51.515
Why would she drive
from Fort Lauderdale

16:51.641 --> 16:54.518
- to jump off this abandoned warehouse?
- Maybe she liked seagulls.

16:54.644 --> 16:59.022
Until we know one way or the other, I'll treat
this as a homicide if that's OK with you.

16:59.148 --> 17:00.357
All right.

17:00.483 --> 17:03.819
You two, on the sixth floor.
The rest of you, search the grounds.

17:03.945 --> 17:05.946
Victim - Tarla Grant.

17:06.072 --> 17:07.531
Thirties...

17:07.657 --> 17:10.575
So, listen...

17:10.702 --> 17:13.662
I want to apologize for being such a douche
the other night.

17:13.788 --> 17:15.539
No need.

17:15.665 --> 17:18.291
We're all allowed to be
the occasional douche.

17:18.418 --> 17:19.918
Thanks.

17:20.962 --> 17:23.171
It was pretty embarrassing.

17:23.297 --> 17:26.717
Debra, if we're being
completely honest here,

17:26.843 --> 17:30.220
then, uh, yes, I did come to Miami
to follow a case.

17:30.346 --> 17:34.015
But...I have to admit that...

17:34.142 --> 17:37.060
I'm glad the killer chose this city,

17:37.186 --> 17:39.396
knowing I'd find you here.

17:41.399 --> 17:44.568
So is Dexter right?
Did you predict this jumper?

17:44.694 --> 17:47.779
What I did was suggest
that if Trinity held to his pattern,

17:47.905 --> 17:51.408
we could expect to see
another woman die soon.

17:51.534 --> 17:52.909
Is this her?

17:53.035 --> 17:55.370
Little early to tell.

17:55.496 --> 17:58.081
But you might want to check
your missing persons reports.

17:58.207 --> 18:01.543
I wouldn't be surprised to discover
that she's married with two kids.

18:01.669 --> 18:02.794
(Debra) What else?

18:02.920 --> 18:07.424
I'm very curious to know if there was
a similar death at this site 30 years ago.

18:07.550 --> 18:09.259
I make my bodies disappear.

18:09.385 --> 18:11.678
Trinity Ieaves his out in the open,

18:11.804 --> 18:15.265
supremeIy confident that no one
will ever trace them to him,

18:15.391 --> 18:17.434
decade after decade...

18:19.061 --> 18:21.062
after decade.

18:23.107 --> 18:25.192
(   Truck stereo plays country music)

18:32.575 --> 18:33.700
Thanks for the ride.

18:33.826 --> 18:35.368
Anytime, partner.

18:44.504 --> 18:46.171
(Sighs)

19:00.436 --> 19:02.687
Great - security Iights.

19:02.814 --> 19:05.649
Just what every seriaI kiIIer needs.

19:05.775 --> 19:08.652
What are you looking at?

19:15.451 --> 19:17.369
- Oh.
- Dexter!

19:17.495 --> 19:21.998
Did you get my message about
the neighborhood watch meeting?

19:22.124 --> 19:25.168
Actually, no, I didn't.

19:25.294 --> 19:28.922
This is my community.
I am one of you.

19:29.048 --> 19:31.925
Uh, great.
Love having the neighbors over.

19:32.051 --> 19:35.428
- Are you ready to fight crime, Dexter?
- You betcha.

19:35.555 --> 19:37.347
That's good.
Be aware of your neighbors.

19:37.473 --> 19:40.308
Know their schedules. That way
you'll know if something's different,

19:40.434 --> 19:42.477
- if anything seems off.
- We don't want that.

19:42.603 --> 19:45.689
Here, have a whistle
and a head flashlight.

19:45.815 --> 19:49.359
It'll keep your hands free
when you're out patrolling.

19:49.485 --> 19:51.695
Patrolling? We're patrolling?

19:51.821 --> 19:55.448
Yourjob is to watch and report,
watch and report.

19:55.575 --> 19:57.784
- Watch and report.
- You got it.

19:58.411 --> 19:59.703
(Laughter)

20:00.997 --> 20:02.706
Community college for me now.

20:02.832 --> 20:06.251
Dexter, our neighborhood beautification
association asked me to give this to you.

20:06.377 --> 20:09.546
I'm the secretary. It's a warning
against the graffiti on your gate.

20:09.672 --> 20:11.506
I know it's silly,
but they want you to repaint.

20:11.632 --> 20:12.549
Hey, Dex.

20:12.675 --> 20:16.928
I guess you saw the new
motion-detector lights I just put in.

20:17.054 --> 20:18.471
Sure are bright.

20:18.598 --> 20:20.056
Yeah, brightest I could get.

20:20.182 --> 20:22.684
Made sure I angled one
right on your place, too.

20:22.810 --> 20:25.145
That's very neighborly of you.

20:25.271 --> 20:26.813
We have to look after each other.

20:26.939 --> 20:30.233
Yeah, this guy started off small,
a few broken windows, Andy's mailbox,

20:30.359 --> 20:33.862
but yesterday he broke into the Walkers'
guesthouse and trashed the place.

20:33.988 --> 20:35.989
Yeah, next thing
he'll be stealing our women.

20:36.699 --> 20:39.659
Can't let him steal our women now,
can we?

20:39.785 --> 20:41.286
No, they're our women.

20:41.412 --> 20:42.370
(They laugh)

20:42.496 --> 20:44.706
- Is that the sign-up sheet?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:44.832 --> 20:46.750
We're setting up patrols
for every night of the week.

20:46.876 --> 20:50.253
I'm good for every night but Wednesday.
I got a poker night at the lodge.

20:51.047 --> 20:51.963
Great.

20:52.089 --> 20:55.258
No one will come in or out
of this neighborhood unnoticed.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.593
IncIuding me.

20:56.719 --> 21:01.181
It's not the neighborhood vandaI I'm worried
about, it's the neighborhood watch.

21:04.018 --> 21:05.977
Hmm, graffiti.

21:06.103 --> 21:07.771
Excuse me.

21:07.897 --> 21:10.774
So I was all set to go to
the University of Miami next year

21:10.900 --> 21:13.151
till my dad decided
to get himself laid off.

21:13.277 --> 21:14.778
That blows.

21:14.904 --> 21:16.780
How about you, Jesse?

21:16.906 --> 21:19.366
You want to sign up for
the neighborhood watch?

21:19.492 --> 21:20.784
Sounds kind of lame.

21:20.910 --> 21:22.285
So lame.

21:25.456 --> 21:28.959
Paint can, soda can.
I'm thinking fingerprints.

21:29.085 --> 21:30.961
Let me get that for you.

21:32.004 --> 21:34.881
And I know one little lady
who is up past her bedtime.

21:35.007 --> 21:37.050
Mom!

21:39.595 --> 21:42.639
Dexter, you can't treat her
like a little girl anymore.

21:43.391 --> 21:45.058
I can't?

21:49.063 --> 21:50.230
Hey, Dex.

21:50.356 --> 21:52.023
Hey, Elliot.

22:06.956 --> 22:08.456
Have a nice day!

22:21.595 --> 22:23.930
You knew this day
would come, Dexter.

22:24.056 --> 22:27.017
You've always been good with kids,
but eventually they grow up.

22:27.143 --> 22:29.644
They become more mature,

22:29.770 --> 22:32.522
develop complex emotions
that just aren't in your skill set.

22:32.648 --> 22:34.691
Astor's becoming a whole person,
and you're...

22:34.817 --> 22:36.317
Something less.

22:36.444 --> 22:38.361
I hope you're not taking
any of this seriously,

22:38.487 --> 22:41.281
the wife, the kids,
the house in the 'burbs.

22:41.407 --> 22:44.701
It's all great camouflage,
but that's all it is.

22:44.827 --> 22:46.578
It's gotten more complicated than that.

22:46.704 --> 22:48.455
Then uncomplicate it.

22:48.581 --> 22:52.625
You need to realize your limitations.
Remember exactly who you are.

22:52.752 --> 22:55.628
Probably should have used
something a little darker.

22:55.755 --> 22:58.214
It's fine, Dad.
Nothing's gonna show through.

22:59.091 --> 23:01.760
I hope not, Dex.
For your sake.

23:04.889 --> 23:07.057
- Hey, you ready to go?
- Almost.

23:07.183 --> 23:08.850
I've got The Best OfBananarama.

23:10.186 --> 23:12.395
It's a cruel summer.

23:15.524 --> 23:18.902
As Iong as the neighborhood vandaI
keeps my neighbors on edge,

23:19.028 --> 23:21.071
I wiII have no privacy.

23:26.911 --> 23:30.205
And I'm not going to Iet you
do that to me, Jesse.

23:34.085 --> 23:37.087
Tarla Grant,
married, mother of two.

23:37.755 --> 23:38.755
It fits.

23:38.881 --> 23:40.757
- Fits what?
- Lundy's theory.

23:40.883 --> 23:42.759
That she's another victim
of the serial killer?

23:42.885 --> 23:45.011
Yes.

23:45.137 --> 23:48.598
- What?
- His whole life is about serial killers.

23:48.724 --> 23:52.018
That's all he thinks about, so of course
he thinks she was killed by a serial killer.

23:52.144 --> 23:54.312
I think he's a little smarter than that.

23:54.438 --> 23:56.940
I'm sure you do, otherwise
you wouldn't be sitting at your desk

23:57.066 --> 23:59.150
going through 30-year-old files all afternoon.

23:59.276 --> 24:02.070
Oh, yeah? Guess what.
So are you.

24:02.571 --> 24:05.615
Just unsealed the juvey records
of Johnny Rose,

24:05.741 --> 24:07.283
our Vacation Murder suspect.

24:07.409 --> 24:08.618
Anything?

24:08.744 --> 24:11.788
Shoplifting with his high school girlfriend,
Nikki Wald.

24:11.914 --> 24:15.792
That was like, what, ten years ago?
You think they're still in touch?

24:15.918 --> 24:19.546
Since she testified against him back then,
I'd say extremely unlikely.

24:19.672 --> 24:22.966
Well, at this point, I think
we need to take any shot we can.

24:23.092 --> 24:25.969
She lives in Oakland Park.
I'll drive out there with you.

24:26.095 --> 24:27.804
Let's go.

24:31.350 --> 24:34.269
That seem accidental
and unplanned to you?

24:34.395 --> 24:36.187
Even I believed it.

24:36.313 --> 24:38.815
I was thinking we could stop
somewhere for lunch first.

24:38.941 --> 24:43.361
I know a little place where
we can order some room service.

24:43.487 --> 24:46.656
OK, here we go.
30 years ago to the week.

24:46.782 --> 24:50.368
Female, Caucasian, 36,
mother of two.

24:50.494 --> 24:52.412
Jumped to her death
off the same warehouse.

24:52.538 --> 24:55.248
The woman's family insisted
she was the victim of foul play,

24:55.374 --> 24:58.543
- but it was ruled a suicide.
- Doesn't mean fuck all.

24:58.669 --> 25:02.714
Someone fell orjumped off
the same warehouse eight years ago.

25:02.840 --> 25:06.926
Someone else jumped off a ship loading
crane on the same pier back in '86,

25:07.052 --> 25:09.304
and another body
washed up on the rocks

25:09.430 --> 25:12.056
right in front of the warehouse
only two years ago.

25:12.183 --> 25:13.683
Nobody knows how it got there.

25:13.809 --> 25:15.602
This is Miami, Deb.
People die.

25:15.728 --> 25:19.105
And sometimes it's by murder.
I want to follow up on this.

25:19.231 --> 25:22.192
OK, Tarla Grant seemed
to have a pretty decent life.

25:22.318 --> 25:25.195
No apparent reason for suicide,
so keep it open for now.

25:25.321 --> 25:27.238
Fuckin'-A we'll keep it open.

25:27.364 --> 25:29.157
I'd know that foul mouth anywhere.

25:30.367 --> 25:32.535
Anton, what are you doing here?

25:32.661 --> 25:35.246
I love you too, baby.
Come on, let's have some lunch.

25:35.372 --> 25:36.956
I have a fuckload of work to do.

25:41.086 --> 25:42.170
All right.

25:43.255 --> 25:46.049
All right, but it's a working lunch.

25:46.967 --> 25:48.760
Ah, solitude.

25:48.886 --> 25:51.554
Something I won't enjoy again
until l deal with Jesse,

25:51.680 --> 25:53.890
the neighborhood shithead.

25:57.519 --> 25:59.312
(Anton) Hey, Dexter.

25:59.438 --> 26:00.688
Hey.

26:00.814 --> 26:04.609
Dexter, I was looking for you.
Hello, Debra.

26:04.735 --> 26:06.819
- Hi.
- May I?

26:06.946 --> 26:07.946
Yeah.

26:11.575 --> 26:12.617
Frank Lundy.

26:12.743 --> 26:15.203
- Anton Briggs.
- My lover...

26:15.329 --> 26:18.206
Friend. My boyfriend.

26:18.874 --> 26:21.209
All of the above.

26:21.335 --> 26:23.962
So, Dexter, I was wondering

26:24.088 --> 26:27.090
if you'd gotten the blood tox results back
on Tarla Grant yet?

26:27.216 --> 26:29.092
Yeah, I should check
on that right away.

26:29.218 --> 26:31.177
- Please, finish your lunch.
- Mm.

26:31.303 --> 26:32.470
All done.

26:35.557 --> 26:39.811
Tarla Grant, just like you said.
36 years old, married, mother of two.

26:39.937 --> 26:43.356
- That's a shame.
- I found a matching 30-year-old case.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.277
- What's that?
- Big case we're working on.

26:48.028 --> 26:51.447
I'm afraid I've enlisted Debra
in another of my mad theories.

26:52.074 --> 26:53.741
Ah. (Laughs)

26:54.743 --> 26:55.994
What's it all about?

26:56.120 --> 26:57.912
Finding out who killed her.

27:01.333 --> 27:03.376
I don't suppose you happened to bring the...

27:03.502 --> 27:05.420
30-year-old file?

27:05.546 --> 27:08.298
Read the husband's statement
from 30 years ago.

27:08.424 --> 27:10.258
Family never believed
it was a suicide.

27:11.844 --> 27:15.555
But since Trinity never leaves a trace,
there was nothing to investigate.

27:22.187 --> 27:24.063
You give good room service, Angel.

27:24.189 --> 27:26.858
You know, uh, we should
do lunch out more often.

27:28.944 --> 27:30.903
Missed one.

27:31.030 --> 27:32.447
(Giggles)

27:33.741 --> 27:36.659
No arrests since she got busted with Rose
back in high school.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.453
Spotty job record,
but that's about it.

27:38.579 --> 27:40.371
It's a stretch, I know.

27:47.671 --> 27:49.005
Nikki?

27:52.176 --> 27:53.843
Nikki Wald?

27:53.969 --> 27:56.971
Hmm. I'm not sure
Miss Nikki Wald is home.

27:59.475 --> 28:00.475
OK.

28:03.354 --> 28:05.938
Hey, I'm Sergeant Batista
from Miami Metro homicide.

28:06.065 --> 28:07.231
- It's Rose.
- Get down!

28:13.989 --> 28:16.074
Shots fired, 41st and Andrews.
We need backup!

28:16.200 --> 28:17.658
- Good?
- Yeah, I'm good, let's go.

28:22.748 --> 28:24.248
(Tires screech)

28:27.378 --> 28:29.712
Suspects Johnny Rose
and Nikki Wald going northbound

28:29.838 --> 28:32.048
on 41st Street in a white sedan.

28:32.174 --> 28:34.092
- I think it was gray.
- A light-colored sedan.

28:34.218 --> 28:35.593
Make? Model?

28:35.719 --> 28:38.388
Suspects are
armed and dangerous.

28:44.186 --> 28:46.562
Rita thinks l'm with
the neighborhood watch.

28:46.688 --> 28:50.024
Truth is, I'm gonna do
a little more than watch.

28:51.110 --> 28:55.279
There's dad,
off to his weekIy poker game.

28:55.406 --> 28:57.073
(Car starts)

29:01.078 --> 29:03.371
And if l were the delinquent son...

29:04.623 --> 29:07.959
I wouId take advantage
of my father's absence.

29:09.420 --> 29:11.754
Going after him feeIs very famiIiar,

29:11.880 --> 29:14.632
except it won't have
its usuaI satisfying ending.

29:14.758 --> 29:18.302
The best l can do is scare
a little sense into this kid.

29:25.727 --> 29:28.646
Hey! Come on, it's the vandal.
Let's get him!

29:28.772 --> 29:30.440
- Oh, fuck.
- (Blows whistle)

29:41.702 --> 29:45.413
It's watch and report, asshoIes,
not watch and chase.

29:46.665 --> 29:48.499
This is so humiIiating.

29:51.753 --> 29:52.795
Go that way.

30:22.284 --> 30:25.286
This neighborhood's gonna kill me.

30:28.957 --> 30:30.291
(Knock at door)

30:32.211 --> 30:33.836
Already? The kids
aren't even dressed yet.

30:33.962 --> 30:38.424
I know, I know, I'm early. Just wanted you
to see the latest work of the vandal.

30:41.303 --> 30:43.179
Happened in the middle of the night.

30:43.305 --> 30:46.516
He obviously smashed the window,
released the emergency brake,

30:46.642 --> 30:49.852
Gave it a shove,
and, uh, let it roll.

30:49.978 --> 30:51.687
Oh, that's so dangerous.

30:51.813 --> 30:54.106
Is that Cody's bike?

30:54.233 --> 30:55.566
(Rita) Oh, my God.

30:55.692 --> 30:58.152
What if he had been out here playing?

31:07.663 --> 31:11.624
These dummies share the same size
and weight distribution as our victim.

31:11.750 --> 31:14.627
At this height,
any variant in trajectory

31:14.753 --> 31:17.630
resulting from a simple jump
or being pushed off the building

31:17.756 --> 31:19.423
will be evident
in where they land.

31:19.550 --> 31:22.093
(Quinn) What if she took a running leap?

31:23.345 --> 31:26.055
People don't kill themselves that way.
They just let go.

31:26.181 --> 31:29.809
Oh, hey, either of you interested in buying
tickets to the Dolphins game?

31:29.935 --> 31:31.769
Club level? I'll let them go for 500 bucks.

31:31.895 --> 31:33.396
- Where'd you get those?
- Dexter.

31:33.522 --> 31:34.647
Son of a bitch.

31:34.773 --> 31:36.566
Come on,
we have dummies to drop.

31:36.692 --> 31:38.985
Is he gonna pay me for those?

31:40.737 --> 31:43.573
Must be weird for you,
Lundy coming back.

31:43.699 --> 31:45.408
Why would it be weird?
You're weird.

31:45.534 --> 31:47.660
None of my business, I know.

31:47.786 --> 31:49.537
But...

31:49.663 --> 31:52.915
if I loved someone,
and that person was gone,

31:53.041 --> 31:55.167
and then I moved on,
and then found someone else,

31:55.294 --> 31:57.545
and then the first person
suddenly showed up again...

31:57.671 --> 32:00.798
I don't know,
I've never had that problem.

32:00.924 --> 32:03.426
But it's gotta be a little confusing.

32:03.552 --> 32:05.052
Maybe.

32:06.471 --> 32:07.555
A little.

32:07.681 --> 32:11.976
So then maybe if you know that it's
supposed to be weird and confusing,

32:12.102 --> 32:14.395
then maybe it's a little easier to handle.

32:15.105 --> 32:16.397
Thanks.

32:16.523 --> 32:20.234
It's always the same
three kills with Trinity -

32:20.360 --> 32:23.279
a young woman in a bathtub,

32:23.405 --> 32:27.074
followed by a mother
falling to her death,

32:27.200 --> 32:29.493
and ending with a man
getting bludgeoned.

32:29.620 --> 32:32.913
I put her in a short skirt so that we can see
her panties while she's falling.

32:37.669 --> 32:39.712
Specific.

32:42.507 --> 32:43.966
How many times
that you know of?

32:44.092 --> 32:47.970
I've got the bits and pieces
that add up to at least 15 cycles.

32:48.889 --> 32:52.183
Since we just turned the clock
back another 15 years...

32:53.602 --> 32:56.187
I'm sure there are
considerably more.

32:56.980 --> 32:58.022
Wow.

32:59.524 --> 33:00.775
That's impressive.

33:04.321 --> 33:06.656
In a very evil way.

33:08.617 --> 33:11.494
What's really impressive
is that I can't prove a thing.

33:12.788 --> 33:15.665
Could never get anyone at the Bureau
convinced. He's that good.

33:15.791 --> 33:18.501
Why do you think
he's so successful?

33:19.461 --> 33:24.215
Trinity's likely someone who's gone
his own solitary way through life,

33:24.341 --> 33:26.342
so preoccupied
with his own obsessions

33:26.468 --> 33:31.889
that he's foregone all but the most
rudimentary of human connections.

33:32.015 --> 33:34.684
A lone wolf.

33:34.810 --> 33:36.310
Exactly.

33:37.646 --> 33:39.146
It's a little bit disturbing.

33:40.023 --> 33:41.315
- Yeah.
- I mean...

33:42.984 --> 33:45.695
I could just as well
be talking about myself.

33:47.155 --> 33:48.864
Sure, I've been married.

33:48.990 --> 33:52.368
Was married for 29 years, happily.

33:52.494 --> 33:54.453
But even so,

33:54.579 --> 33:58.499
the only thing that really got
my heart beating was the hunt.

34:00.001 --> 34:01.544
I'm sure you can't relate.

34:02.587 --> 34:04.380
No, sorry.

34:04.506 --> 34:07.383
And now here I am at 60,

34:07.509 --> 34:09.927
watching dummies fly off a roof,

34:10.053 --> 34:12.054
still on the hunt.

34:13.223 --> 34:15.558
(Dexter) It sounds like Trinity
is worthy prey.

34:15.684 --> 34:21.230
What's really got me intrigued
is the notion that he's returned to Miami.

34:23.024 --> 34:24.692
He's come home.

34:26.111 --> 34:28.195
I'm not sure "home" is the right word.

34:29.990 --> 34:33.325
People like us
don't really belong anywhere.

34:34.369 --> 34:36.495
We just pass through.

35:45.774 --> 35:46.774
Drink up.

35:52.113 --> 35:53.781
You're next.

36:02.624 --> 36:05.125
The Vacation Murders.

36:05.252 --> 36:07.711
Word is, you know who
Johnny Rose's accomplice is.

36:07.838 --> 36:10.589
Forget it, you'll get the press release
same time as everyone else.

36:10.715 --> 36:13.175
But my sergeant and lieutenant
were almost killed yesterday,

36:13.301 --> 36:16.303
so if you put any negative spin on it,
I'll be very angry.

36:16.429 --> 36:18.430
When you're angry,
you're very sexy,

36:18.557 --> 36:20.933
so this could be
sort of a win-win for me.

36:21.059 --> 36:24.645
Let's just say I'll be angry
in a very withholding sort of way.

36:24.771 --> 36:25.938
OK.

36:26.064 --> 36:28.357
- The bathtub murder?
- Still under investigation.

36:28.483 --> 36:31.318
The jumper at the old port building?

36:31.444 --> 36:32.444
Ditto.

36:32.571 --> 36:34.363
I gotta run. See you tonight?

36:34.489 --> 36:35.656
Sure.

36:35.782 --> 36:38.075
Can you just go over
the figures one more time?

36:38.201 --> 36:39.535
They're not gonna change.

36:39.661 --> 36:42.663
The test results indicate that Tarla Grant
jumped rather than was pushed.

36:42.789 --> 36:44.999
I don't buy it.
I think we're looking at a murder victim.

36:45.125 --> 36:47.418
Deb, we also got the autopsy report.
She had a small tumor.

36:47.544 --> 36:49.962
Talked to the husband.
Theyjust found out last week.

36:50.088 --> 36:53.048
Maybe she was taking the easy way out.

36:53.174 --> 36:56.886
Maybe she was determined to fight it.
That doesn't mean she killed herself.

36:57.012 --> 36:58.637
I checked her cell phone records.

36:58.763 --> 37:00.639
No text messages,
no suicide note.

37:00.765 --> 37:02.057
Not everyone leaves a note.

37:03.435 --> 37:07.688
I just got word. We will be debriefed
on our shooting incident In the morning.

37:07.814 --> 37:09.815
OK, good.

37:09.941 --> 37:13.235
We need to get our stories straight about
why we left the precinct at 12:30

37:13.361 --> 37:16.071
and didn't get to Wald's apartment
until after 3:00.

37:16.197 --> 37:19.783
We grabbed some lunch
and then we had a flat tire.

37:19.910 --> 37:21.577
Flat tire it is.

37:21.703 --> 37:23.537
You OK?

37:24.706 --> 37:26.332
I've read Masuka's notes.

37:26.458 --> 37:29.835
That, along with the autopsy reports,
leads me to believe that there's no reason

37:29.961 --> 37:32.212
to keep Tarla's case open
as a murder investigation.

37:32.339 --> 37:35.299
Lieutenant, I think it's premature to close it.
Lundy has this theory...

37:35.425 --> 37:38.135
You don't work for Lundy.
You're welcome to pursue this,

37:38.261 --> 37:40.679
but between the Vacation Murders
and Lisa Bell,

37:40.805 --> 37:42.932
I think you're gonna be very busy.

37:44.434 --> 37:45.935
You're on your own with this one.

37:46.061 --> 37:48.103
(Dexter) Poor Cody.

37:49.022 --> 37:50.272
Ouch.

37:51.358 --> 37:54.318
- Where'd the glass come from?
- (Rita) That car on EIIiot's Iawn.

37:54.444 --> 37:58.280
Cody was coming back from their pool
and he stepped on a piece.

37:58.406 --> 37:59.823
Does it need stitches?

37:59.950 --> 38:01.617
No, he's fine, he's just scared.

38:01.743 --> 38:03.410
First his bike, now this.

38:03.536 --> 38:07.414
Poor guy.
Give him a hug for me.

38:10.251 --> 38:11.961
Hi.

38:12.087 --> 38:13.712
Help me out here, Dexter.

38:13.838 --> 38:16.131
I've been going out of my way
to make things good with you,

38:16.257 --> 38:19.718
but no matter what I do,
you just throw it back in my face.

38:19.844 --> 38:22.513
You don't need to
make things good with me.

38:22.639 --> 38:25.391
Come on,
what's it gonna take?

38:26.434 --> 38:27.893
Quinn...

38:28.019 --> 38:30.771
I don't care if you're a dirty cop.

38:32.983 --> 38:36.276
If I didn't take that money, it would just
sit inside a locker until some fatass

38:36.403 --> 38:39.989
who sits behind a desk grabs it to buy new
carpet for his office which he never leaves.

38:40.115 --> 38:41.740
I put my life on the line every day.

38:41.866 --> 38:43.325
I give this job everything I've got,

38:43.451 --> 38:45.494
and I can't even afford
a down payment on a condo.

38:45.620 --> 38:47.705
I thought you had family money.

38:47.831 --> 38:51.583
Had, and that has nothing to do with
anything. Just don't fucking call me dirty.

38:51.710 --> 38:53.961
The Iast thing I need
is a cop mad at me.

38:57.674 --> 38:59.258
Look...

38:59.384 --> 39:00.926
you're right, I take it all back.

39:02.137 --> 39:04.388
I honestly...

39:04.514 --> 39:05.764
don't give a shit.

39:06.808 --> 39:09.727
Just keep my sister out of it, OK?

39:11.563 --> 39:14.982
You don't understand
any of this, do you?

39:15.108 --> 39:18.110
You can't,

39:18.236 --> 39:20.237
'cause you're not a cop.

39:21.865 --> 39:24.700
- You're not one of us.
- (Sighs)

39:24.826 --> 39:27.870
Cops, another community
l'm not part of.

39:43.011 --> 39:44.803
(Sighs)

39:47.265 --> 39:49.224
What?

39:49.350 --> 39:52.269
It's so crowded in there.

39:52.395 --> 39:54.855
Well, I guess so.
A wife and three kids.

39:58.234 --> 40:00.360
They're always there.

40:00.487 --> 40:01.653
Tell me about it.

40:02.697 --> 40:05.616
It was easy living with Anton
when he was never home.

40:06.493 --> 40:07.993
I'd come back
to a quiet apartment

40:08.119 --> 40:10.496
and unwind without having
to deal with anybody.

40:10.622 --> 40:14.416
Now, as soon as I walk through the door,
he's there, waiting to engage.

40:14.542 --> 40:15.918
There's no escape.

40:16.836 --> 40:19.213
And now Lundy shows up.

40:20.715 --> 40:22.883
Is that good or bad?

40:24.636 --> 40:27.971
I have no fucking clue.

40:28.098 --> 40:30.390
- (Giggles)
- What?

40:32.143 --> 40:34.603
We're complaining because
people want to be with us?

40:34.729 --> 40:36.396
How lame is that?

40:38.566 --> 40:41.110
You think Tarla Grant killed herself?

40:42.237 --> 40:43.904
No, I don't.

40:45.365 --> 40:48.951
Masuka said she wasn't thrown
or pushed from the building.

40:49.077 --> 40:53.122
She jumped.
What would make her do that?

40:54.290 --> 40:57.292
Fear is a powerful motivator.

41:02.799 --> 41:04.675
(Sighs) You should go inside.
You're home.

41:04.801 --> 41:06.301
(They laugh)

41:06.427 --> 41:07.594
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

41:16.938 --> 41:19.106
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

41:19.232 --> 41:20.357
Where is everybody?

41:20.483 --> 41:21.942
I'm in here.

41:22.068 --> 41:24.111
Fort Cody.

41:28.700 --> 41:31.160
Hey, buddy, how's your foot?

41:31.286 --> 41:32.661
It's better.

41:32.787 --> 41:34.163
Good.

41:34.956 --> 41:38.000
- Keep holding down the fort.
- OK.

41:38.126 --> 41:42.504
And I'II take care of my end
once you guys go to sIeep tonight.

41:42.630 --> 41:45.090
You may want to talk to Astor.

41:48.469 --> 41:52.347
This is one of those moments
when I wish I was Iike everyone eIse.

41:52.473 --> 41:55.142
I'm sure other peopIe
wouId know what to say.

42:01.649 --> 42:02.816
Hey.

42:09.616 --> 42:11.700
I know you're not
a little kid anymore.

42:11.826 --> 42:12.993
Duh.

42:15.205 --> 42:16.205
I'm sorry.

42:18.625 --> 42:20.667
It's just...

42:20.793 --> 42:22.461
sometimes I'm...

42:24.797 --> 42:26.173
dumb.

42:33.598 --> 42:34.848
It's OK.

42:37.518 --> 42:39.853
You can be dumb.

42:43.524 --> 42:45.359
(Sighs) Thanks.

42:48.029 --> 42:49.196
(Elevator pings)

43:04.087 --> 43:05.879
What?

43:09.217 --> 43:10.884
It's funny.

43:11.010 --> 43:13.929
A few months ago,
after a shoot-up like this,

43:14.055 --> 43:16.932
people saw me leaning against you,
they wouldn't think twice.

43:17.058 --> 43:20.602
They still wouldn't think twice.
They don't know anything about us.

43:20.728 --> 43:21.895
I know.

43:23.564 --> 43:25.232
But I think twice.

43:26.067 --> 43:30.237
I'm constantly worried that
people will misinterpret.

43:37.120 --> 43:38.787
Let them misinterpret.

43:41.332 --> 43:43.000
Hey...

43:44.502 --> 43:46.503
I need this as much as you do.

43:51.634 --> 43:52.759
This Dexter guy.

43:52.885 --> 43:55.429
First of all, who the fuck
is named Dexter?

43:57.598 --> 43:59.641
Oh, that feels good.

43:59.767 --> 44:04.479
What, did his parents know he was gonna
grow up to be a fucking egghead?

44:04.605 --> 44:07.149
I met him. He seems OK.

44:07.275 --> 44:09.568
He's a lab geek.

44:09.694 --> 44:11.361
Fuck, that feels good.

44:13.781 --> 44:15.115
What else?

44:15.241 --> 44:18.535
What else? I'm exhausted.

44:18.661 --> 44:23.874
I spent all afternoon in the sun
throwing dummies off a warehouse...

44:25.001 --> 44:27.961
'cause super agent Lundy
has a hunch that

44:28.087 --> 44:31.715
the dead woman is connected
to this big serial killer case.

44:31.841 --> 44:32.924
Hmm, really?

44:33.051 --> 44:35.886
Oh, yeah.
Lundy always gets his man.

44:37.513 --> 44:38.764
Yeah?

44:41.142 --> 44:43.977
- Well, so do I.
- (Both laugh)

44:48.483 --> 44:50.817
This is where
I first noticed the pattern.

44:50.943 --> 44:53.070
Raleigh, North Carolina, 1993.

44:53.196 --> 44:55.364
That got you curious?

44:55.490 --> 44:58.200
Then I found
San Francisco, Louisville,

44:58.326 --> 45:00.577
Detroit, Richmond.

45:00.703 --> 45:03.705
Eight different cities in all
that I know of.

45:03.831 --> 45:05.874
Never the same place twice.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.501
Until now.

45:10.505 --> 45:11.922
Ready for another?

45:12.048 --> 45:13.757
Oh. Yeah.

45:17.678 --> 45:20.806
(Laughs) So now this is your
little retirement project?

45:20.932 --> 45:24.476
You're completely incapable
of relaxing, aren't you?

45:24.602 --> 45:27.646
That's just it.
This is how I relax.

45:27.772 --> 45:31.566
I get the scent of a bad guy,
I can feel my blood pressure go down.

45:31.692 --> 45:33.110
And I thought I was bad.

45:33.236 --> 45:34.361
You are.

45:35.863 --> 45:38.740
You're exactly the same as me,

45:38.866 --> 45:42.202
just...in a much prettier package.

45:43.788 --> 45:45.997
Are you flirting with me, Agent Lundy?

45:47.542 --> 45:49.501
Simply stating the truth, miss.

45:49.627 --> 45:51.086
(Phone vibrates)

46:03.057 --> 46:04.099
Thank you.

46:04.225 --> 46:07.310
(Cell phone rings)

46:07.437 --> 46:09.187
Excuse me just a second.

46:11.732 --> 46:12.691
Hey.

46:12.817 --> 46:16.778
Hey, so, um, you want me
to order some takeout?

46:18.406 --> 46:22.075
Uh... I'm still working,
so I'll just grab something here.

46:22.994 --> 46:25.954
OK, well, I love you, babe.

46:26.873 --> 46:28.748
Me too.

46:41.262 --> 46:42.512
(Glass shatters, car alarm)

46:42.638 --> 46:45.640
Ah, Jesse, hard at work.
Big surprise.

46:51.105 --> 46:55.400
I'm gonna wait in your room
and scare the shit out of you.

47:05.745 --> 47:07.078
Jesse.

47:07.205 --> 47:08.330
If you're in here...

47:08.456 --> 47:10.123
(Door squeaks)

47:12.585 --> 47:13.752
(Door shuts)

47:21.469 --> 47:22.427
Andy!

47:22.553 --> 47:26.014
ApparentIy I'm not the onIy one
who isn't exactIy what he seems.

47:32.271 --> 47:35.023
(Disguised voice) Is that the wrench
you use to break windows?

47:35.149 --> 47:36.483
- What the heck?
- Don't move.

47:38.110 --> 47:39.778
OK, what's going on?
Who are you?

47:39.904 --> 47:43.532
You're gonna stop breaking things,
stop rolling cars down the street.

47:43.658 --> 47:45.867
stop everything
you've been doing.

47:45.993 --> 47:49.371
If you so much as touch another window,
I will come back here,

47:49.497 --> 47:52.207
and I will leave
with your head in a bag.

47:53.918 --> 47:55.335
I already have the bag.

48:00.883 --> 48:02.092
Fuck you!

48:07.765 --> 48:10.016
Let go of me,
you fucking asshole!

48:11.310 --> 48:12.644
Fuck!

48:14.105 --> 48:15.897
You really don't know
what you're doing here.

48:16.023 --> 48:19.651
I know exactly what I want to fucking do,
piece of fucking shit.

48:19.777 --> 48:21.570
You should've seen their faces.

48:21.696 --> 48:27.075
Those boxes in their driveways
with their big fucking flat-screen TVs.

48:27.201 --> 48:29.411
"Oh, look at us,
aren't we so fucking rich?"

48:29.537 --> 48:30.495
Huh?

48:30.621 --> 48:33.039
They're lucky the only thing I broke
was their fucking windows.

48:33.165 --> 48:35.709
And you're Iucky
I don't break your fucking neck.

48:35.835 --> 48:38.378
- It's over.
- Fuck you, it's over.

48:43.718 --> 48:45.969
- Give up.
- No!

48:46.095 --> 48:50.223
I played by the rules my entire life.
And look what it got me.

48:52.310 --> 48:54.978
My wife's dead.
I lost myjob.

48:55.104 --> 48:56.771
My son hates me. And now...

48:58.649 --> 49:01.109
The bank wants
to take my house away.

49:01.235 --> 49:03.612
So if you want to take
my fucking head, you take it.

49:03.738 --> 49:07.532
I said stop! You want me to come back
for your son's head too?

49:07.658 --> 49:09.034
What? No!

49:09.160 --> 49:10.452
Not my boy!

49:12.496 --> 49:14.039
It's all I have!

49:16.584 --> 49:20.962
You're gonna save what's left of your family,
save what's left of yourself.

49:22.590 --> 49:24.382
Because all that other stuff...

49:28.262 --> 49:29.429
Say it.

49:30.431 --> 49:32.432
Yeah, it's over.

49:40.650 --> 49:43.234
Bad news for Andy
is he's lost his house.

49:43.361 --> 49:45.528
Good news for me is
he'II be out of the neighborhood.

49:45.655 --> 49:48.531
But why shouId I care about him?
lt's his world.

49:48.658 --> 49:50.742
PeopIe Iike him made it this way.

49:50.868 --> 49:53.453
At Ieast he had a chance to beIong.

50:03.047 --> 50:05.048
It's still there, Dex.

50:05.174 --> 50:08.009
A stain so deep
it can't be erased.

50:27.863 --> 50:29.364
(Grunts)

50:29.490 --> 50:31.491
(Sighs)
