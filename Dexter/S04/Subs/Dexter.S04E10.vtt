WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:03.549
PreviousIy on Dexter...

00:03.676 --> 00:06.052
(Debra) Bathtub, jumper, bludgeon.

00:06.178 --> 00:08.388
Lundy came to Miami to hunt this guy.

00:08.514 --> 00:12.433
I think he got too close,
and I think it got him killed and me shot.

00:12.559 --> 00:15.728
(Christine) I can't even imagine
looking into the eyes of the person you love,

00:15.854 --> 00:17.438
watching as he takes his last breath.

00:17.564 --> 00:19.565
(Debra) How much did you teII Christine
about the Lundy shooting?

00:19.692 --> 00:22.527
I learned my lesson. I never even took
the Lundy files out of the station.

00:22.653 --> 00:24.028
There's no way she could've seen it.

00:24.154 --> 00:25.738
How did she know that?

00:25.864 --> 00:27.198
How tall was my shooter?

00:29.326 --> 00:31.786
- My height.
- Then it wasn't Trinity.

00:31.912 --> 00:34.247
Look, I know it's really tough
for reporters right now,

00:34.373 --> 00:37.458
so maybe I can give you that interview
you've been wanting from me.

00:39.044 --> 00:39.919
I'm married.

00:40.045 --> 00:42.046
- We have this connection.
- I have Dexter.

00:43.340 --> 00:44.882
That smudge you found at the crime scene,

00:45.008 --> 00:48.428
how do you think he got
the ashes to stick to the wall?

00:48.554 --> 00:50.096
We got the killer's goddamn DNA?

00:50.222 --> 00:52.306
- Going out of town?
- Yeah, on a Four Walls build.

00:52.433 --> 00:55.101
An out-of-town build?
Is his cycIe starting over again?

00:56.395 --> 00:57.270
(Grunts)

00:57.396 --> 00:59.731
This is where it all started.
Vera saw me.

00:59.857 --> 01:02.942
I startled her and she slipped,
shattered the shower doors.

01:03.068 --> 01:04.777
The glass sliced her leg.

01:04.903 --> 01:07.071
She was dead by the time
the ambulance came.

01:07.197 --> 01:09.282
Don't touch my sister!

01:09.408 --> 01:11.367
Fuck you and fuck Vera!

01:12.244 --> 01:13.453
(Both grunting)

01:13.579 --> 01:16.164
Get the fuck off him!

01:17.583 --> 01:20.418
I should've fucking killed you
when I had the chance.

01:23.672 --> 01:25.506
Hi, Dad.

03:20.706 --> 03:22.915
A hypodermic needIe.

03:23.041 --> 03:26.085
The perfect drug deIivery system.

03:26.211 --> 03:29.672
Rapid. Efficient.

03:29.798 --> 03:32.258
EspeciaIIy in the right hands.

03:32.384 --> 03:35.094
(Harrison whining)

03:35.220 --> 03:36.804
So how's everyone doing over there?

03:36.930 --> 03:38.681
(Harrison crying)

03:38.807 --> 03:41.058
Honey, I know.
Everything's gonna be OK.

03:41.184 --> 03:42.768
Are you OK?

03:42.895 --> 03:45.605
Well, I'm not the one
getting four booster shots.

03:45.731 --> 03:47.148
I don't know how you're
not a complete wreck.

03:47.274 --> 03:48.691
Serial killer, remember?

03:48.817 --> 03:52.361
Well, a little pain now
means a lot less later on.

03:52.487 --> 03:53.613
l should know.

03:53.739 --> 03:56.449
I had my chance to eIiminate
Arthur early on.

03:56.575 --> 03:57.950
l didn't and now...

03:58.076 --> 03:59.660
We ready?

04:02.164 --> 04:04.040
OK, buddy, look at Daddy.

04:04.166 --> 04:05.875
(Crying)

04:09.212 --> 04:10.421
(Screams)

04:10.547 --> 04:13.132
I know, I know, I know.

04:13.258 --> 04:15.468
All right, that's one down.
Three more to go.

04:15.594 --> 04:19.388
The good news is,
he won't remember any of this.

04:24.478 --> 04:27.563
I didn't remember what happened
to me as a child...

04:31.777 --> 04:33.819
until l was forced to.

04:36.114 --> 04:40.993
Keeping my tooIs in a shipping container
makes more sense than a backyard shed.

04:41.119 --> 04:45.247
After all, it's where
my dark passenger was born.

04:49.294 --> 04:52.713
And, after tonight,
it's where Arthur Mitchell will call home.

04:59.304 --> 05:02.098
Arthur is a man of ritual, like me.

05:02.641 --> 05:05.267
Gas up the car,
a quick stop at Starbucks,

05:05.394 --> 05:06.686
choir practice...

05:06.812 --> 05:10.398
That's where I'm going to take him, when
he's aIone in the parking Iot of his church.

05:12.818 --> 05:14.902
Wait. Why isn't he stopping?

05:40.554 --> 05:42.054
(Car doors slam)

05:47.019 --> 05:49.395
Scott, hold your sister's hand
until we're inside.

05:49.521 --> 05:51.647
(Scott) You're not my mother.

05:53.191 --> 05:56.986
lf Arthur thinks he can lose me in a crowd,
he's dead wrong.

05:59.197 --> 06:03.492
"Nick, Barb, Scott...

06:08.165 --> 06:10.166
"Abby."

06:11.209 --> 06:12.918
(Chatter and laughter)

06:14.713 --> 06:16.714
(Carousel music)

06:44.743 --> 06:46.494
l know that look.

06:51.750 --> 06:54.001
I'm not the onIy one on a staIk.

06:54.127 --> 06:58.089
But it's too soon. Arthurjust finished
his Iast kiII cycIe.

06:59.049 --> 07:01.842
By saving his Iife,
have I set it aII in motion again?

07:24.533 --> 07:25.825
(Bell rings)

07:25.951 --> 07:27.952
(Carousel music playing)

07:29.621 --> 07:31.622
Where'd you go?

07:32.624 --> 07:35.626
(Video game gunfire)

07:37.295 --> 07:41.006
Scott, I'm Officer Carney.

07:42.134 --> 07:44.135
Am... Am I in trouble?

07:44.261 --> 07:45.386
No, no.

07:49.307 --> 07:52.226
Are your mom and dad Nick and Barb?

07:53.770 --> 07:54.687
Yes.

07:54.813 --> 07:56.897
I'm afraid they've been in a car accident.

07:57.023 --> 07:58.065
Are they OK?

07:58.191 --> 08:00.860
They're gonna be fine,
but they've asked me to take you

08:00.986 --> 08:03.028
to go see them in the hospital.

08:03.155 --> 08:05.614
- We have to go get my sister.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

08:05.740 --> 08:08.492
My partner's got Abby
in our patrol car.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.286
Come on.

08:11.496 --> 08:13.789
I'm just glad I found you.

08:34.561 --> 08:36.729
It wasn't the baby-sitter he was after.

08:36.855 --> 08:39.398
- This isn't a police car.
- I work undercover.

08:39.524 --> 08:41.233
Wait, where's my sister?

08:41.359 --> 08:44.028
Well, let me radio in
and see where my partner is.

08:44.154 --> 08:46.197
(Muffled shouts)

08:48.491 --> 08:50.451
(Dexter) Arthur!

08:51.786 --> 08:52.870
(Car door slams)

08:52.996 --> 08:54.580
(Tires squealing)

09:07.552 --> 09:09.220
- Shit.
- (Cell phone ringing)

09:13.725 --> 09:16.727
Kyle, I don't appreciate being followed.

09:17.229 --> 09:18.812
Arthur, what are you doing?

09:18.939 --> 09:20.940
I don't know what you think you saw,

09:21.066 --> 09:24.526
but I promise I'll preserve
this boy's innocence.

09:24.653 --> 09:26.445
I'm calling the police.

09:26.571 --> 09:30.157
If I so much as see a police car,
the boy pays the price.

09:30.283 --> 09:32.868
You like protecting children, don't you?

09:32.994 --> 09:34.828
Like my son.

09:35.455 --> 09:37.539
Arthur, just pull over. Tell me where you are.

09:37.666 --> 09:41.961
I have a process. As long as it's not
interrupted, I'll set the boy free.

09:42.087 --> 09:44.922
- Arthur, don't do this. Let the boy go.
- (Phone beeps)

09:47.342 --> 09:49.260
Dexter, he's gonna kill that child.

09:49.386 --> 09:52.554
- He's never taken a child before.
- That you know of.

09:52.681 --> 09:55.432
If this is new, this is on you.

09:57.477 --> 09:58.978
Not if I find him first.

10:03.275 --> 10:04.650
(Pounding on door)

10:04.776 --> 10:07.152
- Mr. Butler?
- Where's your mother?

10:07.279 --> 10:11.156
She's picking up Rebecca from ballet,
but she'll be back any minute.

10:11.283 --> 10:13.826
- I really don't think that you...
- Jonah, don't talk.

10:13.952 --> 10:16.537
Just listen and answer.
Do you have any idea where your father is?

10:16.663 --> 10:18.998
He's at some teaching thing up in Naples.

10:19.124 --> 10:21.542
- How long?
- A couple days.

10:21.668 --> 10:23.502
A coupIe of days. Good.

10:24.129 --> 10:27.131
If Arthur's process takes that Iong,
the boy stiII has time.

10:30.677 --> 10:34.638
You know, it's like
Thanksgiving never happened.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.307
Except for this.

10:37.976 --> 10:40.185
Why are you still here?

10:40.312 --> 10:43.022
I can't leave my mom
and sister alone with him,

10:43.148 --> 10:44.481
and my mom won't leave, so I'm fucked.

10:44.607 --> 10:46.525
Look, I need to find your dad, and fast.

10:46.651 --> 10:49.111
- I need your help.
- Don't you understand?

10:49.237 --> 10:52.698
The longer he's gone,
the better, for all of us.

10:52.824 --> 10:55.326
Jonah, we both know what he's capable of.

10:59.497 --> 11:02.041
Did... Did he hurt someone else?

11:02.167 --> 11:04.209
I hope not.
That's why I need to find him,

11:04.336 --> 11:08.505
to keep him from doing
something really wrong.

11:10.967 --> 11:13.844
You have the chance
to finally break the cycle.

11:15.722 --> 11:17.139
What do you want me to do?

11:17.265 --> 11:20.559
Go through his desk,
journals, computer.

11:20.685 --> 11:23.103
Anything, everything.
Find out what he's been working on.

11:23.229 --> 11:24.563
He'd kill me.

11:24.689 --> 11:26.690
I'll make sure he never finds out.

11:28.193 --> 11:30.277
You know, I...

11:30.403 --> 11:33.072
I'm... I'm not sure if I can...
If I can do it.

11:33.698 --> 11:35.366
That's my mom and Rebecca.

11:35.492 --> 11:38.744
There is a great big shit-ugly
world out there, Jonah.

11:38.870 --> 11:42.247
The bad stuff doesn't just end
at your doorstep.

11:42.374 --> 11:45.167
You can help put an end to all of it.

11:45.293 --> 11:48.253
- To all of what?
- The sins of your father.

11:50.590 --> 11:51.757
Help me, Jonah.

12:12.904 --> 12:14.238
Where am I?

12:20.745 --> 12:22.121
What is this place?

12:22.247 --> 12:24.123
Do you like trains, Arthur?

12:25.458 --> 12:27.835
My name isn't Arthur. It's Scott.

12:35.927 --> 12:37.928
Look at that.

12:39.055 --> 12:41.056
It's a thing of beauty.

12:48.731 --> 12:50.941
I want my mom and dad.

12:54.571 --> 12:56.822
(Imitating train whistle)
Whoo-whoo!

12:56.948 --> 12:59.741
Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo
choo-choo-choo-choo

12:59.868 --> 13:03.495
Choo-choo-choo-choo
choo-choo-choo.

13:03.621 --> 13:06.415
Whoo-whoo!

13:09.419 --> 13:12.796
lf Arthur's ritual, like mine,
was born in the past,

13:14.674 --> 13:17.217
the past is where l'll find him.

13:20.972 --> 13:23.974
His Iast cycIe of kiIIs
took place in New Orleans.

13:30.190 --> 13:32.107
Matthew Hicks, ten years oId,

13:32.233 --> 13:34.610
went to the IocaI pooI, never came home.

13:34.736 --> 13:38.322
Five days before a woman
was found murdered in her bathtub.

13:38.448 --> 13:40.324
Before?

13:48.458 --> 13:50.542
You always did have a soft spot for kids.

13:51.294 --> 13:55.297
They remind you of what you lost that day
in the shipping container.

13:55.423 --> 13:57.299
Innocence.

13:57.926 --> 14:01.386
Arthur said that's what he would preserve
in the boy he took.

14:02.472 --> 14:06.808
If each of Arthur's victims
represents members of his family,

14:06.935 --> 14:10.103
- then the boy...
- Must be Arthur himself.

14:10.730 --> 14:13.398
He was ten when his sister died.

14:15.276 --> 14:17.819
Omaha, another ten-year-old
goes missing.

14:21.157 --> 14:24.034
Five days later, another bathtub murder.

14:24.911 --> 14:26.578
St. Paul.

14:32.085 --> 14:33.794
Denver.

14:35.630 --> 14:37.756
Lundy misread the pattern.

14:38.883 --> 14:42.427
It's not three victims
he leaves behind, it's four.

14:42.554 --> 14:46.056
Lundy didn't think to look
at missing children because...

14:48.017 --> 14:50.519
they were never recorded as homicides.

14:50.645 --> 14:54.314
Which means five days before the Lisa Bell
bathtub murder here in Miami...

15:05.785 --> 15:08.120
another ten-year-old went missing.

15:09.080 --> 15:12.040
My God.
The boys begin the cycle.

15:18.423 --> 15:19.464
Hey.

15:19.591 --> 15:21.300
Sorry. Working late.

15:21.426 --> 15:23.468
Like always.

15:23.595 --> 15:25.304
Is everything OK?

15:25.430 --> 15:29.266
Harrison isn't sleeping,
so I'm gonna keep him in our bed tonight.

15:30.351 --> 15:31.685
I'll be there in a sec.

15:33.146 --> 15:34.813
OK.

15:46.826 --> 15:49.286
Arthur couId have that boy anywhere,

15:49.412 --> 15:52.497
and now there'II be an army of poIice
and voIunteers surrounding his parents

15:52.624 --> 15:54.708
to help find their son.

15:56.461 --> 15:58.795
l need to be one of them.

16:01.716 --> 16:05.844
If Arthur picked this particuIar boy
for a reason, l need to know.

16:05.970 --> 16:07.846
- (Knock on door)
- Come in.

16:07.972 --> 16:09.723
Hey, Dex, you wanted to see me?

16:09.849 --> 16:12.934
- Gordy, thanks for coming.
- Yeah, sure, no sweat. What's up?

16:13.061 --> 16:15.979
I dinged a parked van last night,

16:16.105 --> 16:20.442
and I left a note,
but the driver hasn't called me back.

16:20.568 --> 16:22.486
And I'm thinking, after I totaled my car,

16:22.612 --> 16:25.030
I can't afford to let the insurance companies
get involved.

16:25.156 --> 16:28.408
You think you can do a stake and notify
so I can find this guy, pay him in cash?

16:28.534 --> 16:32.079
Yeah, sure. Just, uh, give me the plate,
and if patrol spots your van,

16:32.205 --> 16:35.499
- I'll give you a heads-up on its location.
- Perfect.

16:38.670 --> 16:40.879
Hold on. As soon as he's done
with the uni, I'm next.

16:41.005 --> 16:43.548
- Next for what?
- I have to talk to him.

16:43.675 --> 16:45.050
He's right in there.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.804
I'm still figuring out...how to phrase it.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.473
How gay are you?

16:51.599 --> 16:53.308
Look, I...

16:53.434 --> 16:56.895
I saw something at Thanksgiving
I wish I hadn't.

16:57.021 --> 16:58.897
(Door opens)

17:01.984 --> 17:03.985
- Morgan.
- Gordon.

17:08.616 --> 17:12.035
Jesus, ever hear of a comb?
It looks like you have a cat on your head.

17:12.161 --> 17:14.913
I'm kind of on a mission here.
What's up?

17:15.039 --> 17:18.083
I've got that interview
with Quinn's squeeze today.

17:18.209 --> 17:19.584
Christine?

17:20.795 --> 17:24.756
Are you sure it's a good idea
to dredge up all that Lundy stuff?

17:24.882 --> 17:26.758
Actually, I've got a few questions for her.

17:26.884 --> 17:28.927
I think she might have some ideas
about who shot him.

17:29.053 --> 17:31.638
The real question is,
do I give Quinn a heads-up...

17:31.764 --> 17:35.392
- No, you don't. I gotta go.
- Just no? He's my partner.

17:35.518 --> 17:39.187
Yeah, he's also her boyfriend.
You don't know where his loyalties are.

17:39.313 --> 17:42.274
- Deb, I've got field work I gotta do.
- Yeah, and I've got a briefing on Trinity

17:42.400 --> 17:44.317
in, like, two minutes. My case.

17:44.444 --> 17:45.694
I need your big brain, bro.

17:45.820 --> 17:48.155
- There's no new blood. There's no need.
- No way.

17:48.281 --> 17:51.408
You do realize I will stand here
all fucking morning.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.119
If Trinity works in the public school system

17:54.245 --> 17:57.539
and we can't get the OK to swab these guys,
we are beyond boned.

17:57.665 --> 17:59.750
If he's even in the school system.

17:59.876 --> 18:01.960
Sorry, Deb, but the sooner this is over,

18:02.086 --> 18:04.296
the sooner I get to
that missing boy's parents.

18:04.422 --> 18:08.467
We've had better luck with private schools
and so far we're looking at 240 males

18:08.593 --> 18:10.635
who fit our Trinity profile.

18:10.762 --> 18:12.304
Collect their samples
and get them to Masuka.

18:12.430 --> 18:14.681
Oh, wonderful.
More old man spit.

18:14.807 --> 18:17.225
Dexter, I need the blood evidence
in that bar stabbing.

18:17.351 --> 18:18.435
I'm proofing it.

18:18.561 --> 18:21.813
Proof faster. Prelim's tomorrow.
Where are we on the Lundy shooting?

18:21.939 --> 18:25.400
I'm still on the foreign nationals
that were staying at the hotel.

18:25.526 --> 18:27.986
So no significant developments.

18:29.030 --> 18:31.406
When you say it like that, no.

18:32.116 --> 18:34.075
- OK.
- (Sighs)

18:40.291 --> 18:43.168
Hey, uh, Dex, you got a minute?
It's about Thanksgiving.

18:43.294 --> 18:45.170
Later, Vince.

18:45.296 --> 18:47.130
Uh...

18:48.132 --> 18:49.299
OK.

18:49.425 --> 18:52.928
Uh, Lieutenant, could you
authorize this requisition?

18:53.054 --> 18:57.349
Could it be so wrong if you and I hopped
on the first plane to an island somewhere?

18:57.475 --> 19:00.018
Yes, and this isn't a requisition.

19:00.144 --> 19:01.686
- It's a Thai menu.
- Mm-hm.

19:01.813 --> 19:03.855
Thank you for bringing that
to my attention, Sergeant.

19:03.981 --> 19:06.274
Start at community colleges,
work our way up?

19:06.400 --> 19:08.693
- Detectives.
- Babe?

19:08.820 --> 19:11.321
Keep it in your pants. She's here to see me.

19:11.447 --> 19:13.031
Oh, you're finally doing the interview?

19:13.157 --> 19:16.201
- She is persistent.
- Tell me about it.

19:16.327 --> 19:19.704
And when I'm done, everyone in Miami
is gonna know what a true hero is.

19:19.831 --> 19:23.166
Don't forget your partner.
That's Quinn with two Ns.

19:23.292 --> 19:26.253
Oh, shit, I forgot to run something by
Batista. Will you show her to the box?

19:26.379 --> 19:29.005
- I'll be there in two seconds?
- Yeah.

19:33.261 --> 19:36.805
I need you to watch Christine interview me.

19:36.931 --> 19:38.890
And I would do that why?

19:39.016 --> 19:41.768
This could have something
to do with the Lundy shooting.

19:41.894 --> 19:44.688
- No significant developments, remember?
- OK.

19:53.030 --> 19:54.531
I'm hungry.

19:54.657 --> 19:59.870
Well, why don't you put your pajamas on
and we'll have something to eat.

20:02.373 --> 20:04.666
No, I won't do it.

20:04.792 --> 20:06.835
I won't do anything you tell me to.

20:19.223 --> 20:21.433
Don't you understand?

20:22.894 --> 20:26.354
Father drinks,
and Mother pays the price.

20:29.734 --> 20:32.694
I'm just trying to protect you, Arthur.

20:34.071 --> 20:35.488
My name is Scott!

20:39.368 --> 20:41.411
Very well.

20:55.509 --> 20:56.927
- Mr. Smith.
- Yes.

20:57.053 --> 20:59.095
I'm Dexter Morgan, Miami Metro.

20:59.221 --> 21:01.932
I'm not here in any official capacity.

21:02.058 --> 21:05.977
I just want to do anything I can
to help find your missing son.

21:06.103 --> 21:08.480
We haven't set up phone banks yet,

21:08.606 --> 21:12.150
but, uh, we have some flyers.

21:12.276 --> 21:14.736
- May I take some with me?
- Great.

21:16.656 --> 21:18.823
(Phone ringing)

21:18.950 --> 21:21.743
(Overlapping chatter)

21:22.954 --> 21:25.163
I'm the onIy one here
who knows what happened.

21:25.289 --> 21:29.542
I couId point the poIice
in Arthur Mitchell's direction.

21:29.669 --> 21:32.003
But the sIightest misstep on their part

21:32.129 --> 21:34.798
ensures this famiIy is never whoIe again.

21:39.679 --> 21:41.888
Is there any information at all on your son?

21:42.014 --> 21:43.890
A tip, a lead, a phone call?

21:44.016 --> 21:45.976
Anything that couId point me
in a direction?

21:46.102 --> 21:50.313
None. I keep waiting for...a ransom note.

21:50.439 --> 21:52.148
Something.

21:52.274 --> 21:54.150
I'd better go post these.

21:55.194 --> 21:58.530
I'm gonna do everything I can
to help you get your son back.

21:58.656 --> 22:00.782
- (Phone ringing)
- Thank you.

22:03.494 --> 22:06.871
Can you imagine walking by
your kid's empty bedroom,

22:06.998 --> 22:08.206
not knowing where he is?

22:08.332 --> 22:11.001
No. l can't.

22:14.088 --> 22:17.382
How does a guy like this make a dead body
just disappear into thin air?

22:17.508 --> 22:19.968
The Gulf Stream does the trick for me.

22:20.094 --> 22:23.638
But there's no ocean in Omaha,
Des Moines, St. Paul, or Denver.

22:23.764 --> 22:26.516
The Four Walls houses.

22:26.642 --> 22:31.021
He goes to each one of those cities
on a build as a pretext for his killing cycle.

22:31.147 --> 22:34.733
Construction site would be a convenient
place to bury a body.

22:34.859 --> 22:36.901
Or to hold a boy captive.

22:40.573 --> 22:42.657
Three years on patrol,

22:42.783 --> 22:44.409
two years in Vice.

22:46.203 --> 22:47.537
Why Homicide?

22:49.206 --> 22:52.584
- My dad was a detective here.
- Hmm.

22:52.710 --> 22:55.295
But it was completely different
being a cop back then.

22:55.421 --> 22:59.215
Yeah, I bet. Talk about your man's world.

22:59.341 --> 23:01.801
Oh, no, no, it wasn't just that.

23:03.137 --> 23:06.097
I think you had to rely more
on your instincts back then.

23:06.223 --> 23:10.935
There wasn't all this forensics stuff
to lean on to break a case.

23:11.062 --> 23:13.063
Back then, you had to rely on your gut.

23:14.065 --> 23:15.398
Amen to that.

23:20.237 --> 23:22.322
Have you seen these?

23:25.951 --> 23:28.286
(Exhales)

23:28.412 --> 23:31.289
Forensically, we're at a dead end
with the Lundy case,

23:31.415 --> 23:36.252
so I just stare at these, looking for answers.

23:43.969 --> 23:45.261
You know what?

23:47.681 --> 23:50.225
I've got enough background info.

23:51.435 --> 23:54.229
How about I just write this up
and give you a call

23:54.355 --> 23:58.525
if, uh, we didn't cover everything?

23:58.651 --> 24:00.485
Sure.

24:02.905 --> 24:05.490
Can I ask you something?

24:05.616 --> 24:08.076
- You live over in the Gables, right?
- Yeah.

24:08.202 --> 24:12.205
Wow, that must be really nice,
being away from all that touristy stuff.

24:12.331 --> 24:14.707
Well, I got lucky.
Found a great building.

24:14.834 --> 24:16.876
Yeah, so the Gables, that's what, like, uh,

24:17.002 --> 24:20.672
60 minutes from the hotel
where Frank was staying?

24:20.798 --> 24:22.507
- I guess.
- Wow.

24:22.633 --> 24:25.635
You sure got to the crime scene fast.

24:25.761 --> 24:27.554
(Sighs)

24:28.597 --> 24:30.515
There's no traffic at 5 a.m.

24:30.641 --> 24:31.850
Oh, I know that.

24:31.976 --> 24:35.520
But dispatch didn't
put out the call till 5:05.

24:35.646 --> 24:38.982
You were the first reporter on scene at 5:20.

24:42.653 --> 24:45.697
I like to roll out of bed
and hit the gym early.

24:45.823 --> 24:48.324
I was on my way there
when I heard the scanner.

24:48.450 --> 24:51.202
Bullshit. She's lying.

24:55.624 --> 24:57.292
Um, how do I get out of here?

25:00.921 --> 25:04.841
You just follow the windows
till you get to the elevator.

25:21.066 --> 25:24.444
We've got to tread
very, very lightly with it. If Quinn...

25:24.570 --> 25:27.155
No shit. That's why I'm asking you
to help me sort through this.

25:27.281 --> 25:29.073
- Tell me I'm not crazy.
- You're not crazy.

25:29.200 --> 25:32.076
I spoke to Christine
at your crime scene.

25:32.203 --> 25:33.828
Hair made, full makeup.

25:33.954 --> 25:35.955
No way she rolled out of bed
at 5 a.m. looking like that.

25:36.081 --> 25:38.499
I'm telling you she knows more
than she's letting on.

25:38.626 --> 25:42.253
She's a hard-boiled crime scene reporter,
and she couldn't even look at those photos.

25:42.379 --> 25:45.340
Suspicious, but it doesn't prove a thing.

25:45.466 --> 25:49.928
Well, there's something else.
I know it sounds weird, but the other day,

25:50.054 --> 25:54.974
she was talking to me about how I was
looking in Lundy's eyes when he died.

25:55.100 --> 25:56.935
How does she know he didn't die instantly?

25:57.061 --> 26:00.188
LaGuerta got Broward County school district
to let us collect samples.

26:00.314 --> 26:03.441
- Still working on Dade.
- Great.

26:03.567 --> 26:04.776
Everything OK?

26:04.902 --> 26:07.278
Yeah. Great.

26:07.404 --> 26:08.947
Be right there.

26:09.073 --> 26:10.949
Great.

26:12.076 --> 26:14.452
We can't be doing this with Quinn around.

26:14.578 --> 26:15.703
Thank you.

26:26.423 --> 26:28.132
BuiId's nearly finished.

26:28.259 --> 26:30.260
No one's here.

26:40.604 --> 26:42.188
They're not here.

26:43.899 --> 26:45.650
Fuck!

26:45.776 --> 26:48.278
(Cell phone rings)

26:48.404 --> 26:49.445
Hello?

26:49.571 --> 26:52.824
Kyle, I went through my dad's desk.
You know, there's nothing here.

26:52.950 --> 26:54.325
What about his computer?

26:54.451 --> 26:57.453
I already looked.
There's... It's just school stuff.

26:57.579 --> 27:00.707
Look at the search history.
Does anything stand out?

27:00.833 --> 27:04.002
OK, OK, OK. One sec, one sec.

27:05.087 --> 27:08.006
Nothing, really.
We got some Bible stuff.

27:08.132 --> 27:12.093
A hardware store. A real-estate agency,
the local paper...

27:12.219 --> 27:14.095
The real-estate site.
What was he looking at?

27:14.221 --> 27:16.014
Uh, let's see.

27:17.349 --> 27:19.642
It's just a bunch of homes for sale.

27:19.768 --> 27:23.354
An empty house. Good pIace to ensure
his process isn't disturbed.

27:23.480 --> 27:27.608
- (Jonah) I can email you the list if you want.
- (Exhales)

27:27.735 --> 27:28.860
I don't have email.

27:28.986 --> 27:31.195
Who doesn't have email, Kyle?

27:31.322 --> 27:33.656
Off the top of my head,
peopIe who don't exist.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.868
Fax them to the Kinko's near your house
under my name. I'll pick them up there.

27:36.994 --> 27:38.202
OK.

27:38.329 --> 27:40.496
Jonah, you're doing the right thing.

27:41.457 --> 27:42.790
You know, how...

27:42.916 --> 27:46.878
How come you're the only one
who can see my dad for what he is?

27:47.004 --> 27:49.130
We have a few things in common.

27:52.676 --> 27:55.678
(Radio) PoIice are searching for a North
Miami boy who went missing Iast night.

27:55.804 --> 27:58.222
Ten-year-oId Scott Smith
was in an arcade with his sister

27:58.349 --> 28:00.516
and their nanny at around 7:45 p.m.

28:00.642 --> 28:04.562
when the nanny, Susan Peterson, reaIized
that Scott was no Ionger at her side.

28:04.688 --> 28:06.898
(Kids chanting) Fight! Fight! Fight!

28:07.024 --> 28:09.067
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

28:09.193 --> 28:11.152
Cody?

28:11.278 --> 28:13.071
- Let go.
- Let go of him, Cody.

28:13.197 --> 28:15.490
Cody! Cody, come here.
Cody, what are you doing?

28:15.616 --> 28:17.909
He said he saw Dexter leave
the Young Sailors camp-out

28:18.035 --> 28:20.370
in the middle of the night
cos he was scared, so I hit him.

28:20.496 --> 28:22.747
I'm so sorry. Boys, huh?

28:22.873 --> 28:26.542
If my son said that's what he saw,
I believe him.

28:26.668 --> 28:28.169
Come on.

28:39.181 --> 28:40.932
(Phone buzzes)

28:42.810 --> 28:44.352
(Beeps)

28:44.478 --> 28:45.770
Why, hello.

28:46.397 --> 28:48.773
(Exhales) I'm so glad I finally got you.

28:48.899 --> 28:51.192
Actually, I'm in the middle of a project.

28:51.318 --> 28:53.319
Dad, I really need to see you.

28:53.445 --> 28:55.988
You just did. Thanksgiving night.

28:57.616 --> 29:00.868
I can't wait another
four months until my birthday.

29:00.994 --> 29:05.706
Can we meet in between
our usual visits? Just this once?

29:05.833 --> 29:09.293
There's a reason why we only see each
other a couple of times a year, Christine.

29:09.420 --> 29:12.588
I have a full life
and a family who needs me.

29:14.091 --> 29:16.092
I'm your family too.

29:17.386 --> 29:20.263
I need you. More than they do.

29:20.389 --> 29:23.391
Sorry, sweetie, it'll have to wait.

29:23.517 --> 29:24.517
Love you.

29:25.936 --> 29:28.354
I think I'm in trouble.

29:31.608 --> 29:33.276
Dad?

29:40.159 --> 29:42.285
(Thud)

30:02.973 --> 30:05.600
So, are you gonna let me go?

30:07.144 --> 30:09.270
In due time, Arthur.

30:10.647 --> 30:12.482
Why do you keep calling me that?

30:22.534 --> 30:26.037
(   '50s-era music playing)

30:29.208 --> 30:30.583
Is that food for me?

30:31.543 --> 30:33.711
You can have something to eat...

30:35.088 --> 30:37.715
once you put your pajamas on, Arthur.

30:49.144 --> 30:51.145
Oh, this is delicious.

31:25.055 --> 31:28.766
So far l've looked at
six empty houses on Jonah's Iist.

31:30.686 --> 31:34.397
This one...not so empty.

31:38.068 --> 31:40.486
(Cell phone rings)

31:42.906 --> 31:44.365
(Beeps)

31:44.491 --> 31:45.700
Hey.

31:45.826 --> 31:47.868
Dexter, are you on your way home?

31:48.912 --> 31:50.746
Just finishing up a few things.

31:50.872 --> 31:52.540
Oh. The baby has a fever.

31:52.666 --> 31:54.542
How long do you think you're gonna be?

31:54.668 --> 31:56.043
Not very.

31:56.169 --> 31:58.629
There's still another house
I can check on the way home.

31:58.755 --> 32:01.173
(Engine starts)

32:01.300 --> 32:03.301
(Door closes)

32:27.451 --> 32:29.160
Scott?

32:29.286 --> 32:30.578
Scott Smith?

32:39.963 --> 32:41.922
Me and my kids got nowhere else to be.

32:42.049 --> 32:44.925
My babies just need a place
to feel safe at night.

32:45.052 --> 32:47.219
We don't make a mess or nothin'.

32:47.346 --> 32:49.430
You ain't gonna tell?

32:51.433 --> 32:52.850
No.

32:53.894 --> 32:55.561
No, I won't.

33:04.112 --> 33:05.988
- Shh.
- (Door opens)

33:06.114 --> 33:08.115
Thank God.

33:08.241 --> 33:10.201
Hey, can you take him?

33:10.327 --> 33:11.744
Yeah.

33:13.622 --> 33:15.706
Oh, he's so warm.

33:15.832 --> 33:18.084
Yeah. Those shots really
did a number on him.

33:18.210 --> 33:20.795
Can you take his temperature again?
The thermometer's on the counter.

33:20.921 --> 33:22.880
You're late. Big day?

33:23.006 --> 33:24.882
Yeah, I was helping out
with that missing boy.

33:25.008 --> 33:28.594
Oh, that's so sweet. Those poor parents.

33:29.471 --> 33:32.056
Speaking of which, Paul's folks called.

33:32.182 --> 33:35.351
They want to take the kids
to Disney World one weekend.

33:35.477 --> 33:38.562
You sure that's a good idea?
I've never even met them.

33:38.689 --> 33:40.064
They're nothing like Paul.

33:40.190 --> 33:42.191
He was the abusive black sheep
of the family.

33:43.652 --> 33:46.153
Plus, I think it would be good
for Cody right now.

33:52.285 --> 33:53.536
What happened to his eye?

33:53.662 --> 33:57.665
One of the Young Sailors said you
disappeared the night of the camping trip.

33:57.791 --> 33:59.250
Cody was defending your honor.

34:00.961 --> 34:02.586
Huh!

34:02.713 --> 34:07.758
The only time I left my tent that night
was to find a tree.

34:07.884 --> 34:10.386
Well, Cody doesn't want to be
part of the group anymore.

34:10.512 --> 34:13.514
He said he doesn't want to be
around somebody who tells lies.

34:13.640 --> 34:14.765
Too late.

34:14.891 --> 34:16.434
(Thermometer beeps)

34:16.560 --> 34:18.185
100.1 .

34:18.311 --> 34:21.272
Oy. You mind giving him
a sponge bath, cool him off?

34:21.398 --> 34:24.191
- Food will be ready when you're done.
- OK.

34:24.317 --> 34:28.612
This is so frustrating.
None of it makes any fucking sense.

34:28.739 --> 34:33.492
What if Christine was covering for a source
that knew something about this?

34:35.078 --> 34:36.746
Possibly.

34:40.250 --> 34:42.084
(Sighs)

34:42.210 --> 34:44.462
I couldn't even look Quinn in the eye.

34:44.588 --> 34:48.299
Don't worry.
We're gonna figure this out.

34:48.425 --> 34:50.801
We just gotta think outside the box.

34:50.927 --> 34:53.596
How's this for outside the box?

34:54.556 --> 34:56.807
Christine's the same height
as the shooter.

35:03.648 --> 35:06.442
Christine shoots Lundy. Why?

35:11.948 --> 35:15.326
Beats the motherfuck out of me.
She doesn't have a record.

35:15.452 --> 35:16.535
You ran her prints?

35:16.661 --> 35:20.664
After the interview, I lifted them off
some pictures I got her to pick up.

35:22.459 --> 35:25.419
Maybe she has priors that
she hasn't been nailed on.

35:26.171 --> 35:29.298
We get her DNA,
we check it against the database.

35:30.634 --> 35:34.303
You and I both know we don't have enough
to get a warrant.

35:34.429 --> 35:36.847
Think outside the box, Sergeant.

35:42.145 --> 35:45.898
Nothing like clean, cool water,
huh, big guy?

35:47.150 --> 35:49.360
You'll be as good as new in no time.

35:49.486 --> 35:51.487
But will l?

35:51.613 --> 35:54.949
l killed an innocent man
when I Ieft the campsite that night.

35:55.075 --> 35:58.327
Now Rita and Cody have been
drawn into defending a Iie.

35:58.453 --> 36:00.204
My Iie.

36:02.499 --> 36:05.918
Trinity's not the onIy one
using his famiIy as human shieIds.

36:07.504 --> 36:09.046
Are you out of your fucking mind?

36:09.172 --> 36:12.299
No way Christine had anything
to do with shooting you or Lundy!

36:12.425 --> 36:15.469
You've been dating her for what, two
months? How well do you even know her?

36:15.595 --> 36:18.681
Is this some Morgan vendetta against me?
Is your asshole brother behind this?

36:18.807 --> 36:21.475
Why the fuck would my brother
have anything to do with this?

36:21.601 --> 36:23.978
Forget it. It...

36:24.104 --> 36:27.982
(Sighs) Look, you're probably right
about Christine,

36:28.108 --> 36:30.109
and I am totally off-base,

36:30.235 --> 36:32.736
but you're a cop, and a good one,
and I know you know what it's like

36:32.863 --> 36:35.155
when you have a hunch.

36:35.282 --> 36:37.116
Who else knows about this?

36:38.952 --> 36:40.077
Batista.

36:40.203 --> 36:42.830
Great. Make me look
like a fucking asshole.

36:42.956 --> 36:44.915
Don't make this about you.

36:46.543 --> 36:48.544
Does she keep a toothbrush here?

36:50.088 --> 36:53.215
Christine will never know about this.

36:53.341 --> 36:58.512
And when the results come back clean, you
can shove this up my ass anytime you want.

37:00.432 --> 37:03.559
I need you to get a DNA panel
on this ASAP.

37:04.686 --> 37:06.020
That's your emergency?

37:07.397 --> 37:10.149
Project Runway is on.

37:10.275 --> 37:11.901
(Sighs) Fuck you.

37:12.027 --> 37:15.321
- I'll owe you one, all right?
- Who's it belong to?

37:15.447 --> 37:18.490
We may have a big fucking lead
on the Lundy case, and...

37:20.160 --> 37:21.994
Just fucking run it.

37:23.747 --> 37:25.247
(Sighs)

37:34.090 --> 37:38.260
Six houses down, another eight to go,
and I'm running out of time.

37:38.386 --> 37:40.554
(Cell phone rings)

37:42.682 --> 37:43.682
Morgan.

37:43.808 --> 37:45.726
Dexter, where the hell are you?

37:45.852 --> 37:48.479
En route. Traffic.

37:48.605 --> 37:51.523
OK, well, the DA's all over me
about that blood report.

37:52.609 --> 37:55.653
I'll have it on your desk in half an hour.

38:05.372 --> 38:07.915
- What?
- I was just thinking.

38:08.041 --> 38:11.293
Christmas is coming up.
You got any plans?

38:12.879 --> 38:15.756
- You and me.
- What about your family?

38:17.342 --> 38:20.302
Hmm. We're not that close.

38:20.428 --> 38:23.597
I guess that's why
you never talk about them.

38:23.723 --> 38:25.516
Have you seen my toothbrush?

38:26.559 --> 38:29.478
Oh, the cleaning lady must have
thrown it out by mistake.

38:29.604 --> 38:31.647
She's jealous of my perfect teeth.

38:31.773 --> 38:33.774
Here. Brand-new.

38:38.238 --> 38:39.196
Are you OK?

38:39.322 --> 38:40.823
Yeah.

38:41.741 --> 38:43.534
Yeah?

38:43.660 --> 38:45.619
Are you sure?

38:46.705 --> 38:48.247
Now's not a good time.

38:53.503 --> 38:57.131
Well, maybe it is a good time for me.
You ever consider that?

38:59.551 --> 39:01.010
Wow. Um...

39:01.761 --> 39:05.347
This is about your partner, isn't it?
Did she say something to you?

39:05.473 --> 39:06.890
About what?

39:08.852 --> 39:12.438
She gave a shitty interview.
I'm ditching the article.

39:12.564 --> 39:16.442
- So you think she's pissed about that?
- I don't know. It doesn't matter.

39:16.568 --> 39:18.360
I'm gonna be late for work.

39:23.158 --> 39:27.786
Daddy, I can't wait.
I need to see you now.

39:27.912 --> 39:29.997
We might be in trouble.

39:32.208 --> 39:34.543
We have to talk about, uh...

39:37.714 --> 39:43.052
that woman in the bathtub that night
when I was little.

39:44.179 --> 39:45.846
Please call me back. Please.

39:51.102 --> 39:53.687
(   '50s-era music playing)

39:54.731 --> 39:57.149
Now what'll we call this station?

39:57.275 --> 39:58.734
Why can't I go home?

39:58.860 --> 40:02.613
Northern Springs? Rainbow Valley?

40:02.739 --> 40:06.784
How about, uh, Copper Flats?

40:11.289 --> 40:13.415
This is stupid!

40:15.418 --> 40:17.252
You should take me home.

40:17.378 --> 40:19.088
I want to see my mom and dad.

40:20.590 --> 40:23.383
(   Frankie Avalon: Venus playing)

40:33.019 --> 40:35.479
(Singing along)    Venus, make her fair

40:35.605 --> 40:39.316
A lovely girl with sunlight in her hair

40:39.442 --> 40:43.070
And take the brightest stars
up in the skies

40:43.196 --> 40:46.573
And place them in her eyes for me

40:54.874 --> 40:55.874
(Crying)

41:00.130 --> 41:01.463
Why are you so sad?

41:04.259 --> 41:06.301
It was Vera's favorite song.

41:08.805 --> 41:10.639
She was my sister.

41:12.475 --> 41:14.685
What happened to her?

41:17.772 --> 41:19.523
She died.

41:21.442 --> 41:23.152
It wasn't my fault.

41:23.278 --> 41:25.529
It wasn't my fault! (Crying)

41:34.289 --> 41:35.664
Listen.

41:35.790 --> 41:38.542
Uh, I'm sorry about your sister.

41:39.836 --> 41:45.924
And if it'll make you feel any better,
you can call me Arthur.

41:49.012 --> 41:52.014
You'd let me do that?

41:53.224 --> 41:54.474
Sure.

41:55.768 --> 41:58.395
Now how about we play trains
a little bit more

41:58.521 --> 42:01.190
and then you can take me home?

42:11.993 --> 42:14.870
You're a dear boy, Arthur.

42:14.996 --> 42:16.747
So innocent.

42:16.873 --> 42:19.791
Kind-hearted.

42:20.710 --> 42:23.212
Promise me you'll always stay that way.

42:25.215 --> 42:26.423
Sure.

42:31.221 --> 42:33.263
Do you like ice cream?

42:54.160 --> 42:59.331
After you've, uh, finished your treat...

43:02.752 --> 43:05.128
I think it's time to let you go free.

43:22.939 --> 43:25.107
Yeah, I'm calling about the house on Olive.

43:25.233 --> 43:27.985
Yeah, I'm sure
the curbside appeal is great,

43:28.111 --> 43:30.862
but I need to know, is the house occupied?

43:32.031 --> 43:35.117
Oh, the current owners
are still living there.

43:36.119 --> 43:38.996
Great. Ah, that's OK.

43:39.122 --> 43:40.706
No need for a drive-by.

43:40.832 --> 43:42.916
You stay blessed too.

43:43.042 --> 43:45.544
Lieutenant, blood report
on the bar stabbing.

43:45.670 --> 43:48.672
Hey, Dexter, just got word
on that stake and notify.

43:48.798 --> 43:51.508
We found your van
about 20 minutes ago.

43:51.634 --> 43:53.802
It was at a diner on Flagler and Fourth.

43:53.928 --> 43:56.013
- Hope you find your guy.
- Me too.

43:57.890 --> 44:00.892
lf Arthur's van was spotted
cIose to where he has the boy,

44:01.019 --> 44:03.353
that should narrow
my search down considerabIy.

44:03.479 --> 44:05.522
Fourth and Flagler.

44:05.648 --> 44:08.650
Four listings in the area.

44:09.694 --> 44:13.363
Two within a mile.

44:14.365 --> 44:16.742
Uh, hey, Dex...

44:17.160 --> 44:19.870
- Where are you off to?
- KiII the guy you're Iooking for.

44:19.996 --> 44:22.080
Save a kid.
Remember to pick up diapers.

44:22.206 --> 44:24.374
I have to be two places at once.

44:24.500 --> 44:25.709
Not a great day.

44:25.835 --> 44:28.211
I hear you.

44:28.338 --> 44:30.714
I'm half out of my mind
trying to crack this Lundy thing.

44:30.840 --> 44:32.215
(Woman) Debra Morgan!

44:33.343 --> 44:35.052
Fuck me twice on Sunday.
That's all I need.

44:35.178 --> 44:36.678
Who's that?

44:36.804 --> 44:39.222
One of dad's old fuck buddies.
Emphasis on old.

44:39.349 --> 44:41.475
Harry's past is a minefieId.

44:41.601 --> 44:43.685
But I've got my own
ticking bomb to defuse.

44:43.811 --> 44:45.520
Let me know what happens.

44:46.898 --> 44:48.607
What's up, Valerie?

44:48.733 --> 44:51.109
I'm sorry I said those things
about your father.

44:51.235 --> 44:54.946
He dumped me for another CI,
and all this time, it still hurts.

44:55.073 --> 44:58.075
Do you happen to remember
this other woman's name?

44:58.201 --> 45:02.704
No, but I bet she'd remember me.
God, I was completely out of my mind.

45:02.830 --> 45:05.040
Went to her house, confronted her.

45:05.166 --> 45:07.167
Valerie, I have to go. I will call you.

45:12.340 --> 45:14.674
So, um, pick you up later?

45:14.801 --> 45:16.593
Get a bottle of wine?

45:16.719 --> 45:19.262
- You're...
- In love with a beautiful woman.

45:19.389 --> 45:21.306
So shoot me.

45:22.433 --> 45:23.809
Lieutenant.

45:25.186 --> 45:27.104
The DNA results on Christine Hill are back.

45:27.230 --> 45:29.648
She's fucking related to Trinity.

46:13.192 --> 46:14.734
Bomb shelter.

46:40.219 --> 46:42.012
1960s Miami.

46:42.138 --> 46:44.014
Cuban Missile Crisis.

46:44.140 --> 46:47.100
Irony is, places like this
were built to keep people safe.

46:47.226 --> 46:48.935
I hate irony.

46:54.442 --> 46:56.943
They were here...

46:57.069 --> 46:59.321
and I just missed them.

47:10.541 --> 47:12.000
I'm sorry, Daddy.

47:12.126 --> 47:13.460
Thanks for meeting me.

47:13.586 --> 47:16.046
I never told you because
I thought it was a dream.

47:16.172 --> 47:17.672
And I wanted it to be, but it wasn't.

47:17.798 --> 47:21.968
Now, now, now, now, now, slow down.
What are you talking about?

47:22.803 --> 47:24.638
I saw you that night.

47:24.764 --> 47:26.515
Back when I was five.

47:26.641 --> 47:28.391
You told me to stay in the car, but I didn't.

47:28.518 --> 47:31.645
So I got out and I went
into that woman's house.

47:33.731 --> 47:37.442
And I saw you in the bathtub with her.

47:37.568 --> 47:39.528
The water was so red.

47:39.654 --> 47:41.279
It was a dream.

47:42.448 --> 47:44.866
You were right the first time.

47:45.868 --> 47:47.994
It wasn't.

47:48.829 --> 47:53.041
I knew it wasn't when it happened again
in the same house 30 years later.

48:05.054 --> 48:06.721
I couldn't figure this out in time.

48:09.559 --> 48:12.686
You'll have another shot at Arthur.
Isn't that what you want?

48:13.646 --> 48:15.480
What if it was Harrison or Cody?

48:16.524 --> 48:18.275
Your priorities have changed.

48:18.401 --> 48:20.402
(Exhales)

48:21.821 --> 48:24.030
I'm a father now.

48:25.950 --> 48:29.536
I went back and I looked through all
the postcards you sent me over the years.

48:29.662 --> 48:35.041
Every trip you took in every city you went,
a woman died in a bathtub.

48:35.167 --> 48:39.588
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- It's all right. I protected you.

48:39.714 --> 48:42.632
That FBI agent? Lundy.

48:42.758 --> 48:45.760
He was starting to get close,
but I stopped him.

48:46.887 --> 48:51.891
I got in with the Homicide department
so I'd know what they knew.

48:52.018 --> 48:54.311
And I followed Lundy

48:54.437 --> 48:55.979
and I saw you run into him.

48:56.105 --> 49:00.650
And he started putting things together,
and he was never gonna stop, so I shot him.

49:00.776 --> 49:01.985
You what?

49:02.111 --> 49:03.320
It's OK.

49:03.446 --> 49:06.448
I made it look like another crime spree.

49:06.574 --> 49:09.534
The Vacation Murders.
The police had no idea.

49:10.077 --> 49:11.077
Had?

49:12.830 --> 49:15.123
Well, they still don't have anything solid.

49:15.791 --> 49:18.293
But they're starting to ask questions.

49:18.419 --> 49:20.253
No.

49:29.972 --> 49:31.181
Dad.

49:31.307 --> 49:32.682
(Crying)

49:32.808 --> 49:34.934
You put yourself at risk...

49:36.062 --> 49:37.771
for me.

49:39.231 --> 49:40.899
I'd do anything for you.

49:42.818 --> 49:45.904
More than your other kids.
They would never do what I did for you.

49:46.030 --> 49:47.364
It's gonna be OK, baby.

49:47.490 --> 49:50.659
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, I promise you.

49:50.785 --> 49:52.202
OK.

49:52.328 --> 49:55.330
You've always been so special to me.

49:55.456 --> 49:57.874
(Crying)

50:04.340 --> 50:05.382
Dad.

50:05.508 --> 50:07.967
Dad... (Crying)

50:09.261 --> 50:10.762
Now go home.

50:10.888 --> 50:11.971
No.

50:12.098 --> 50:14.307
I'll drop by tonight,

50:14.433 --> 50:16.643
and we'll figure all of this out, OK?

50:18.646 --> 50:20.063
Go on now.

50:20.189 --> 50:22.691
- (Exhales)
- It's gonna be fine.

50:43.212 --> 50:46.172
Stupid fucking cunt!

50:46.298 --> 50:48.550
(Engine starts)

51:16.704 --> 51:18.955
No wonder none of those missing boys
has ever been found.

51:19.081 --> 51:20.957
Encase a body in cement

51:21.083 --> 51:23.168
and it's preserved forever.

51:24.336 --> 51:26.504
The Four Walls build.

51:26.630 --> 51:29.841
You were already there.
Arthur wasn't ready then.

51:30.885 --> 51:33.011
He is now.

51:44.231 --> 51:47.776
Burying a child in cement.
That's not very Christian.

51:51.614 --> 51:52.822
No closer.

51:52.948 --> 51:55.617
I'll take that to mean the boy is still alive.

51:55.743 --> 51:59.078
Walk away, Kyle.
This doesn't concern you.

52:00.039 --> 52:01.790
There's no way I can do that.

52:02.374 --> 52:03.708
I need to do this.

52:20.935 --> 52:22.685
I can't stop this.

52:24.814 --> 52:26.105
I can.

52:57.263 --> 52:59.180
Alive.

52:59.306 --> 53:01.307
(Breathing heavily)

53:13.904 --> 53:16.322
(Yells) Arthur!

53:18.200 --> 53:20.577
(Knock on door)

53:20.703 --> 53:22.370
(Exhales)

53:25.374 --> 53:27.375
Daddy.

54:02.453 --> 54:04.537
(TV on)

54:07.625 --> 54:09.208
(Turns TV off)

54:09.335 --> 54:10.877
Hey, you.

54:11.921 --> 54:13.796
Hey, you too.

54:15.841 --> 54:17.967
(Exhales)

54:18.093 --> 54:19.469
(Sighs)

54:19.595 --> 54:22.555
- Long day?
- Oh...

54:23.599 --> 54:24.849
The longest.

54:24.975 --> 54:26.309
Mm.

54:28.729 --> 54:32.065
- Mm.
- They found that boy.

54:33.651 --> 54:36.694
Do the police have
any idea what happened?

54:37.863 --> 54:40.323
If they do, they're not saying.

54:40.449 --> 54:43.242
Those parents must be so relieved.

54:45.621 --> 54:47.622
(Crickets chirping outside)

54:48.916 --> 54:50.917
Do you hear that?

54:55.422 --> 54:56.756
Crickets.

54:56.882 --> 54:58.675
(Laughs)

54:58.801 --> 55:01.344
For once, the house is quiet.

55:01.470 --> 55:02.470
(Sighs)

55:02.596 --> 55:03.513
Mm.

55:03.639 --> 55:06.099
(Harrison crying)

55:06.225 --> 55:07.350
(Sighs)

55:07.476 --> 55:08.643
Jinxed it.

55:08.769 --> 55:09.811
Hmm.

55:09.937 --> 55:12.897
- I got this. I got it.
- No, but you're so tired.

55:13.023 --> 55:14.941
It's OK.

55:15.067 --> 55:17.318
I want to.

55:21.156 --> 55:23.032
(Harrison fusses)

55:25.577 --> 55:28.121
Yeah, it's OK, big guy.

55:28.247 --> 55:29.998
It's OK.

55:30.124 --> 55:31.791
Mm.

55:34.503 --> 55:36.838
I'm sorry you're in pain.

55:40.134 --> 55:41.467
Yeah.

55:42.302 --> 55:45.638
I promise you, no one's
ever gonna hurt you again.

55:53.272 --> 55:55.273
Especially me.
