00:02.007 --> 00:03.007
PreviousIy on Dexter...

00:03.133 --> 00:04.384
Dexter.

00:04.510 --> 00:07.053
How's my favorite serial killer hunter?

00:07.179 --> 00:10.306
The reason I'm in Miami
is because I'm convinced

00:10.432 --> 00:13.142
that these bathtub murders
are connected

00:13.268 --> 00:15.728
to a series of murders
all over the country.

00:15.854 --> 00:17.814
It's always the same three kills with Trinity.

00:17.940 --> 00:19.691
Young woman in a bathtub...

00:21.777 --> 00:23.736
..followed by a mother
falling to her death.

00:23.862 --> 00:25.488
(Screams)

00:26.240 --> 00:27.532
You're next.

00:28.575 --> 00:31.077
(Dexter) lf this is the latest victim
of Lundy's Trinity KiIIer,

00:31.203 --> 00:34.288
then he's a very different
monster than l am.

00:34.415 --> 00:36.916
- Lundy has this theory...
- You don't work for Lundy.

00:37.042 --> 00:40.128
You're welcome to pursue this, but between
the Vacation Murders and Lisa Bell,

00:40.254 --> 00:41.587
I think you're gonna be very busy.

00:41.714 --> 00:44.757
Yes, I did come to Miami
to follow a case,

00:44.883 --> 00:47.260
but I have to admit I'm glad
the killer chose this city,

00:47.386 --> 00:48.678
knowing I'd find you here.

00:48.804 --> 00:52.849
Hey, good news! The Sandpiper Hotel
wants to book my band for a one-month gig.

00:52.975 --> 00:54.100
Best of all, it means

00:54.226 --> 00:56.269
- no more time away from you.
- Wow, that's great.

00:56.395 --> 00:58.312
(LaGuerta) I'm not gonna tell you
who to date,

00:58.439 --> 01:02.483
but there's no such thing as "off the record"
with reporters, so watch the pillow talk.

01:02.609 --> 01:04.527
Super Agent Lundy has a hunch

01:04.653 --> 01:08.156
that the dead woman is connected
to this big serial killer case.

01:08.282 --> 01:10.116
Lundy always gets his man.

01:10.242 --> 01:12.577
- Well, so do I.
- (Laughs)

01:12.703 --> 01:16.706
(LaGuerta) Look, I was a little worried
that people will misinterpret.

01:16.832 --> 01:20.543
Let them misinterpret.
I need this as much as you do.

01:20.669 --> 01:24.881
The past few weeks, you have not been
the most present father and husband.

01:26.258 --> 01:28.634
My dark passenger is Iike
a trapped coaI miner,

01:28.761 --> 01:30.803
aIways tapping,
aIways Ietting me know

01:30.929 --> 01:33.765
it's still in there, still alive.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.426
Everyone needs a vacation.

03:33.552 --> 03:36.804
In my case, it's time off for bad behavior.

03:37.681 --> 03:40.892
But l intend to make the most
of this famiIy trip...

03:41.018 --> 03:42.768
that they're taking without me.

03:42.895 --> 03:44.312
(Astor) Shotgun!
(Cody) Shotgun!

03:44.438 --> 03:46.147
- I called it first.
- I called it inside.

03:46.273 --> 03:49.609
- It doesn't count if you call it inside.
- Does so! Mom! Dexter!

03:49.735 --> 03:52.862
- How about you switch every hour?
- Want to trade places?

03:53.530 --> 03:54.989
I stay home and...

03:55.115 --> 03:58.451
you can stuff cousin Marlene into
some Spanx on her wedding day.

03:58.577 --> 04:02.121
I wish I could, but things are pretty hectic
at the station.

04:02.247 --> 04:04.206
You're not gonna work
the whole time, are you?

04:04.333 --> 04:05.541
I'll try not to.

04:05.667 --> 04:09.462
You can't let yourself get to that
boiling point again. It's not healthy.

04:09.588 --> 04:12.048
And I'd rather not have to lie
to the neighbor again

04:12.174 --> 04:14.884
if you decide to smash
any more security lights.

04:15.010 --> 04:16.886
I hate that you saw me that way.

04:17.012 --> 04:20.389
I'm your wife. I want to know
what's going on inside you.

04:20.515 --> 04:22.516
I don't think you do.

04:22.643 --> 04:25.978
Just recharge your batteries, all right?
Enjoy your freedom.

04:26.104 --> 04:27.146
Go wild.

04:27.272 --> 04:29.315
Right. Go wild.

04:29.441 --> 04:31.108
Have fun.

04:32.569 --> 04:34.612
- Say "Goodbye, Dexter."
- (Both) Goodbye, Dexter!

04:34.738 --> 04:37.615
Goodbye, Dexter!
Bye-bye.

04:40.285 --> 04:42.620
The kids left you a present
in the kitchen.

04:56.301 --> 04:59.053
Just the thing to meIt a father's heart.

05:01.932 --> 05:03.641
Let the good times roll.

05:03.767 --> 05:05.893
(   Latin music)

05:07.980 --> 05:09.647
Whoops!

05:10.691 --> 05:11.816
Three days.

05:11.942 --> 05:15.528
72 precious hours
to recharge my batteries.

05:17.280 --> 05:20.199
'Course Rita doesn't know I'II be recharging
with another woman.

05:22.202 --> 05:23.828
Officer Zoey Kruger.

05:23.954 --> 05:26.998
Pembroke Pines patroI.

05:27.124 --> 05:30.001
Eight months ago,
Officer Kruger's husband and daughter

05:30.127 --> 05:31.877
were kiIIed during a home invasion.

05:32.004 --> 05:34.338
Zoey was shot in the arm and foot.

05:35.465 --> 05:38.259
She survived. ObviousIy.

05:38.385 --> 05:42.471
But there was one person who thought
it was Zoey herseIf who kiIIed her famiIy.

05:44.683 --> 05:47.685
The one person who aIways knows
the truth of a crime...

05:48.895 --> 05:50.187
the bIood guy.

05:50.313 --> 05:51.814
(Knock at door)

05:51.940 --> 05:54.025
Morgan. Good to see a friendly face.

05:54.151 --> 05:55.609
Aren't many around here.

05:55.736 --> 05:58.571
Nice to have an excuse to visit.

05:58.697 --> 06:00.072
Even if l made it up.

06:00.198 --> 06:02.783
With your caseload,
I can't believe you have time to write a paper

06:02.909 --> 06:04.243
on feathering and blood swipes.

06:04.369 --> 06:06.746
Well, I have a small window for...

06:06.872 --> 06:08.289
a side project.

06:08.415 --> 06:11.208
And I remembered at
the spatter conference last spring,

06:11.334 --> 06:13.544
you mentioned something about
a questionable swipe

06:13.670 --> 06:14.837
in a case you were working.

06:14.963 --> 06:15.963
Who was it, Cooper?

06:16.089 --> 06:18.758
Kruger, and, shhh, we don't talk about that.

06:27.976 --> 06:30.686
Zoey's husband.
Shot in the stairway.

06:34.858 --> 06:36.567
Her daughter in her bedroom.

06:39.821 --> 06:43.240
Zoey said she was shot twice
wrestIing the shooter's gun from him,

06:43.366 --> 06:45.242
and turned it on him as he fled.

06:50.665 --> 06:53.334
That blood swipe
belongs to Darius Rae,

06:53.460 --> 06:57.379
a drug dealer Zoey roughed up
the day before her family was murdered.

06:57.506 --> 07:00.382
According to her, she winged him
in her front hallway.

07:00.509 --> 07:03.177
The feathering is textbook.
Why'd you say it was questionable?

07:03.303 --> 07:06.806
Because it's the only blood of Rae's
anywhere at the scene.

07:07.766 --> 07:09.433
Interesting...

07:09.559 --> 07:10.768
for my paper.

07:10.894 --> 07:12.561
My theory?

07:13.105 --> 07:15.481
Uh, forget it.
Doesn't matter.

07:15.607 --> 07:18.109
You think she planted
the blood herself?

07:18.235 --> 07:22.321
Maybe she even provoked
that confrontation with Darius Rae.

07:22.447 --> 07:24.156
That's where she got his blood.

07:24.282 --> 07:27.368
Also gives her the perfect narrative
for the crime.

07:27.494 --> 07:29.578
Rae breaks in looking
for retribution,

07:29.704 --> 07:32.206
cop's family becomes collateral damage.

07:32.332 --> 07:34.583
Was Darius Rae ever arrested?

07:34.709 --> 07:39.088
Darius Rae was gunned down in
a supposedly gang-related incident.

07:39.756 --> 07:42.383
But that's another theory, another day.

07:42.801 --> 07:44.635
I try not to think about it.

07:44.761 --> 07:46.679
Because if I'm right,

07:46.805 --> 07:48.848
there's a monster
walking around free.

07:48.974 --> 07:50.975
With a badge and a gun.

07:52.978 --> 07:56.772
Zoey said she aimed at Darius Rae
but onIy winged him.

07:59.985 --> 08:02.319
But Zoey aIways hits her targets.

08:02.445 --> 08:04.989
Just ask her husband and daughter.

08:05.490 --> 08:07.992
I'm feeIing recharged aIready.

08:10.620 --> 08:13.038
Monsters come in aII shapes and sizes.

08:13.165 --> 08:16.375
Sometimes it's the very peopIe
who are supposed to be protecting us:

08:16.501 --> 08:18.836
a cop, a parent,

08:18.962 --> 08:20.296
the spatter guy.

08:24.342 --> 08:26.969
Oh, God. Close the door, will you?

08:27.095 --> 08:29.180
Here's a bludgeoning from July.

08:29.306 --> 08:32.391
The one we're looking for
will be five days after the suicide.

08:32.517 --> 08:35.102
Right. Here's a middle-aged guy
from October.

08:35.228 --> 08:38.898
- Sorry, I thought this was my lab.
- We're hiding from LaGuerta.

08:39.566 --> 08:42.860
Quinn's reporter fuck-buddy has now
officially fucked all three of us.

08:44.446 --> 08:48.407
"Catching the Vacation Murderer may not
be the department's top priority.

08:48.533 --> 08:51.452
"Detectives spent last Thursday
indulging the pursuits of

08:51.578 --> 08:56.123
"retired FBI manhunter, Frank Lundy."
It's a good picture.

08:56.249 --> 08:59.752
I'm guessing that Lieutenant LaGuerta's
open-door policy with me...

08:59.878 --> 09:01.128
is about to close.

09:01.254 --> 09:04.048
We've got to narrow down
Trinity's next move.

09:04.758 --> 09:07.676
Bludgeoning.
Final kill in his cycle?

09:07.802 --> 09:09.929
And he's repeating his pattern
from 30 years ago,

09:10.055 --> 09:13.015
so if we can find where
he bludgeoned back then...

09:13.141 --> 09:17.686
Then maybe we can keep the next Trinity
victim from becoming the next Trinity victim.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.565
Where's Masuka?

09:22.275 --> 09:23.442
On vacation?

09:23.568 --> 09:27.446
He's probably in Mexico
taking a donkey show tour.

09:27.572 --> 09:29.865
There's a briefing in five minutes.

09:29.991 --> 09:30.950
Agent Lundy...

09:31.076 --> 09:32.660
My visitor's badge has expired?

09:32.786 --> 09:34.370
Sorry.

09:35.956 --> 09:38.123
Crap. Fuck.

09:38.250 --> 09:41.460
I guess we'll have to stake out potential
bludgeoning sites on my off hours.

09:41.586 --> 09:43.128
Hey.

09:43.255 --> 09:45.923
I don't want this theory of mine
to jeopardize yourjob.

09:46.591 --> 09:47.967
I want in on this.

09:49.219 --> 09:52.096
- Well, OK, then.
- OK, then.

10:00.272 --> 10:02.940
You ever feel like you're this close
to nabbing somebody?

10:03.066 --> 10:05.776
Sometime in the next 67 hours.

10:07.779 --> 10:09.446
It's a good feeling.

10:27.882 --> 10:31.510
(Girl) Oh, my God!
I can't believe he posted that.

10:31.636 --> 10:33.762
- You are so busted.
- I'm busted?

10:33.888 --> 10:37.433
OK, it's totally Photoshopped.
The point is it looks real, so...

10:37.559 --> 10:39.310
- You're busted!
- (They giggle)

10:39.769 --> 10:40.769
Shh!

10:57.495 --> 11:00.706
I know, I know, my dick's been making
some bad decisions.

11:03.126 --> 11:04.793
So according to Quinn's girlfriend,

11:04.919 --> 11:10.716
these Vacation Murders are costing the city
900,000 tourist dollars a day.

11:10.842 --> 11:13.552
Well, at least the article
got the tip line ringing.

11:13.678 --> 11:16.764
Those assholes can't hide with
all those eyes on them.

11:16.890 --> 11:19.350
Well, those eyes are on us too.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.686
- (Sighs)
- Uh-oh.

11:24.314 --> 11:25.647
What "Oh"?

11:25.774 --> 11:28.567
That sigh thing
you do when, you know,

11:28.693 --> 11:32.196
- there's something I'm not gonna like.
- I don't do a sigh thing.

11:33.365 --> 11:34.615
OK, you don't.

11:36.242 --> 11:38.744
What was it that you were gonna say?

11:38.870 --> 11:39.870
(Sighs)

11:44.250 --> 11:47.920
I think we should inform the brass
about our relationship.

11:48.046 --> 11:50.130
Look, it's just a formality.

11:50.256 --> 11:52.841
Paperwork.
Entirely confidential.

11:52.967 --> 11:57.137
- It's none of their business.
- It's department policy for good reason.

11:57.263 --> 11:59.807
We will catch these killers,

11:59.933 --> 12:02.101
and the defense attorney
could use the details

12:02.227 --> 12:05.145
of an off-the-books romance between us
to sensationalize the case,

12:05.271 --> 12:07.147
- distract the jury...
- If they find out.

12:10.235 --> 12:11.568
On a death penalty case?

12:13.571 --> 12:15.114
OK, they will find out.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.407
But not for a while.

12:16.533 --> 12:19.243
And what would we even
report to the brass?

12:19.369 --> 12:22.704
- Well, that we're seeing each other.
- What does that mean?

12:25.834 --> 12:28.627
- What do you think it means?
- It means it's new.

12:29.671 --> 12:31.547
We're still figuring it out.

12:31.673 --> 12:35.300
- So this could just be a passing thing.
- No, it's not a passing thing.

12:35.427 --> 12:36.468
Then what is it?

12:41.683 --> 12:44.435
- I don't know.
- Well, I don't know either.

12:45.770 --> 12:48.605
- I'm confused.
- Yeah. I can see that.

12:51.943 --> 12:54.528
Can we just...wait?

12:56.614 --> 12:58.323
Fine.

13:12.297 --> 13:14.798
As a cop, Zoey has been
to pIenty of crime scenes.

13:14.924 --> 13:17.801
She knows what should be there
and what shouldn't.

13:19.137 --> 13:23.307
No prints in the bIood on the door,
which means she wore gIoves.

13:29.522 --> 13:31.899
She was stiII wearing gIoves
when she shot herself,

13:32.025 --> 13:34.693
but they were gone
when the EMTs arrived.

13:34.819 --> 13:37.446
Where'd you leave
those gloves, Zoey?

13:37.572 --> 13:39.323
Easier to think here, isn't it?

13:41.326 --> 13:43.076
(Dexter sighs)

13:43.203 --> 13:45.871
Only 52 hours of freedom left.

13:45.997 --> 13:48.373
You sure chose an interesting person
to spend it on.

13:48.500 --> 13:52.002
Don't read anything into it.
Zoey was a challenge, that's all.

13:53.338 --> 13:56.423
A woman who wiped out her own family
in order to be free.

13:58.134 --> 14:02.054
She should have shot herself
instead of her husband and child.

14:02.180 --> 14:05.265
Yeah. Except that doesn't get her free.

14:05.391 --> 14:06.767
Just dead.

14:06.893 --> 14:08.894
Well, she had other options.

14:09.020 --> 14:10.771
Alimony. Visitation.

14:10.897 --> 14:14.399
Trading off holidays,
there go your weekends.

14:14.526 --> 14:16.944
Fine. She could have moved away.

14:17.070 --> 14:19.446
And forfeit herjob?
Her home?

14:20.281 --> 14:22.366
Her only option
was to make her vacation

14:22.492 --> 14:24.576
from her family
as permanent as possible.

14:24.702 --> 14:26.537
There are always alternatives.

14:29.415 --> 14:31.917
Why do you think
Trinity's been so successful?

14:32.043 --> 14:34.628
He travels a lot.

14:34.754 --> 14:36.046
Stays on the move.

14:36.172 --> 14:37.881
He doesn't have a family.

14:39.384 --> 14:40.676
Well, I do.

14:42.053 --> 14:43.387
Miss them yet?

14:46.975 --> 14:50.060
All right, Trinity used a hammer
in Portland and in Fresno,

14:50.186 --> 14:52.521
but wasn't it a tire iron
in Albuquerque?

14:57.443 --> 15:02.197
OK, all right. We'll go with the dude
that was pulverized by the hammer.

15:02.824 --> 15:04.491
Where was that?

15:06.536 --> 15:09.079
OK, what time tomorrow?
Great.

15:13.001 --> 15:14.626
- Pad Thai, my favorite.
- Mmm.

15:14.752 --> 15:18.130
- How's Frank Lundy?
- I didn't say that was Lundy.

15:18.256 --> 15:19.381
Oh, your voice did.

15:19.507 --> 15:21.758
It goes up a notch every time
you talk to him,

15:21.884 --> 15:24.136
which you're doing a lot of lately.

15:24.262 --> 15:25.387
Your point?

15:25.513 --> 15:28.223
I get a gig in town
to spend more time with you.

15:29.601 --> 15:32.269
You spend all your time with your ex.

15:33.521 --> 15:37.024
Our relationship
is strictly professional.

15:46.701 --> 15:48.619
You twist your hair
when you talk to him.

15:50.496 --> 15:53.832
You have nothing to be jealous of
when it comes to Frank Lundy.

15:53.958 --> 15:55.125
All right?

16:07.305 --> 16:09.139
Poker night at home.

16:09.265 --> 16:12.643
Zoey's poIice famiIy surrounds her
on and off the job.

16:13.436 --> 16:15.979
Between her buddy system
and her security system,

16:16.105 --> 16:18.815
her house will be difficult
to break in tonight.

16:20.860 --> 16:23.320
But not tomorrow.

16:41.047 --> 16:43.173
(Whistles)

16:55.019 --> 16:56.687
(Belches)

17:03.861 --> 17:05.529
Cunt.

17:06.989 --> 17:08.573
What the hell did you just say?

17:08.700 --> 17:10.617
You're a cunt!

17:10.743 --> 17:11.952
(Laughs)

17:12.620 --> 17:14.079
Fuck off, old man.

17:14.205 --> 17:15.205
Fucking pussy!

17:19.752 --> 17:21.795
(Groans)

17:21.921 --> 17:23.964
You looking to get
the shit kicked out of you?

17:24.090 --> 17:25.757
(Panting)

17:27.009 --> 17:28.093
Faggot!

17:32.056 --> 17:33.557
(Whimpers)

17:33.683 --> 17:36.268
You gonna shut up now?

17:36.394 --> 17:37.602
(Winded) Faggot.

17:37.729 --> 17:38.729
Faggot.

17:42.275 --> 17:43.525
(Groans)

17:49.657 --> 17:51.658
It's your fault.

17:52.452 --> 17:54.327
The fuck is wrong with you?

17:54.454 --> 17:56.788
All your fault.

17:58.958 --> 18:00.625
(Coughs, splutters)

18:05.757 --> 18:08.800
The living room is here to the left,
kitchen in the back,

18:08.926 --> 18:10.594
and way out back is the hot tub.

18:12.430 --> 18:14.765
Ah, welcome, welcome, welcome.

18:14.891 --> 18:17.184
Oh, you're gonna love this house.

18:17.310 --> 18:18.602
(Laughs)

18:18.728 --> 18:21.772
Newer construction,
only one previous owner,

18:21.898 --> 18:23.648
all sorts of upgrades.

18:23.775 --> 18:26.193
Come on, let me show you
its special wonders.

18:27.111 --> 18:30.989
Uh, would it be all right if I discovered
those special wonders on my own?

18:31.115 --> 18:33.492
Any questions, just holler.

18:36.913 --> 18:38.330
I do have one question:

18:38.456 --> 18:40.415
where did Zoey stash her gIoves?

18:40.541 --> 18:44.419
I'm sure they're Iong gone,
but they couId have Ieft trace evidence.

18:45.797 --> 18:48.465
She swiped the door
with blood here.

18:51.010 --> 18:53.595
Shoots herself, collapses.

18:54.722 --> 18:57.349
Crawls toward the kitchen to call 91 1 .

19:06.025 --> 19:07.859
Did she burn them?

19:07.985 --> 19:11.196
If the gIoves meIted, there wouId be residue
on the underside of the grate.

19:14.492 --> 19:15.826
It's just for show.

19:17.078 --> 19:18.954
Who needs a fire in this climate?

19:19.956 --> 19:21.915
- I'm Zoey. I live here.
- Hey.

19:22.041 --> 19:24.584
I just thought I'd stop by,
see how the open house was going.

19:24.710 --> 19:26.711
Oh. It's a nice place.

19:26.838 --> 19:27.796
Thanks.

19:27.922 --> 19:29.047
Family friendly.

19:29.173 --> 19:30.340
Mm.

19:31.968 --> 19:34.469
I'll be glad to give you a tour
if you're interested.

19:36.764 --> 19:37.889
Very interested.

19:38.808 --> 19:41.351
OK, follow me.

19:45.189 --> 19:48.900
Wow, my daughter would
go crazy over this room.

19:49.026 --> 19:51.570
It's a little girl's dream.

19:51.696 --> 19:53.363
May I ask why you're selling?

19:54.240 --> 19:56.783
My husband and I are separated.

19:56.909 --> 19:58.577
Now our daughter's with him.

19:58.703 --> 20:00.871
So you're single.

20:02.039 --> 20:03.331
I am.

20:05.501 --> 20:07.711
You've been married long?

20:07.837 --> 20:11.006
Uh, yes, about six months.

20:12.383 --> 20:15.010
- Uh... That came out wrong.
- (Laughs)

20:15.136 --> 20:16.803
I understand.

20:16.929 --> 20:18.305
Believe me.

20:18.431 --> 20:21.892
(Realtor) Zoey, there's a couple here
who have a question about the hot tub.

20:22.018 --> 20:23.226
OK, I'll be right down.

20:25.146 --> 20:28.064
- To be continued.
- Sure.

20:34.864 --> 20:37.407
A IittIe girl's dream.

20:42.204 --> 20:43.747
Follow the blood.

20:44.916 --> 20:46.583
Follow the blood...

20:48.210 --> 20:49.794
Zoey crawIed into the kitchen,

20:49.921 --> 20:52.213
grabbed the counter to puII herseIf up,

20:52.340 --> 20:54.382
then reached for the phone,

20:54.508 --> 21:00.055
giving her a perfect opportunity...
to use the garbage disposaI.

21:14.278 --> 21:15.946
How we doing in here?

21:16.072 --> 21:18.782
Uh, there seems to be
a problem with the disposal.

21:19.575 --> 21:20.784
Oh. Oh.

21:23.537 --> 21:25.455
Oh, no, no, no.

21:25.581 --> 21:28.208
It's probablyjust something jammed
in there. It's an easy fix.

21:28.334 --> 21:29.417
Let me take a look.

21:29.543 --> 21:31.795
- You'd do that?
- Sure.

21:56.320 --> 21:59.990
Blue nitrile. The same material
found in poIice protective gIoves.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.787
If the gIove fits...

22:15.297 --> 22:18.925
Isn't he a doll? Fixing the disposal.

22:19.051 --> 22:22.220
Huh. Wasn't broken this morning.

22:22.346 --> 22:23.722
Give it a try.

22:23.848 --> 22:25.015
All right.

22:26.183 --> 22:28.101
Yay!

22:31.480 --> 22:33.606
If I was your wife,

22:33.733 --> 22:35.150
I'd hang on to you.

22:36.068 --> 22:38.194
You're so...handy.

22:38.946 --> 22:39.946
(Chuckles)

22:44.035 --> 22:48.163
So it's either the cannery bludgeoning
or the bar beating.

22:49.206 --> 22:50.707
The cannery body was a dump.

22:50.833 --> 22:52.250
Trinity's not a dumper.

22:52.376 --> 22:54.794
He picks a location,
takes his victims there.

22:55.588 --> 22:56.755
So it's the bar.

22:56.881 --> 22:58.048
Hmm.

22:59.633 --> 23:01.092
Fuckin' A.

23:01.218 --> 23:04.387
We've found Trinity's
30-year-old kill site.

23:05.389 --> 23:07.932
- Oh! Oh, no, oh!
- Here, here, here.

23:08.059 --> 23:11.019
- Fuck me.
- Take the file, take the file.

23:11.145 --> 23:12.562
No harm.

23:12.688 --> 23:15.523
(Clears throat) Um... Mind if I...?

23:16.442 --> 23:18.109
Yeah, sure, why don't you?

23:26.494 --> 23:30.080
So, uh, 30 years ago,

23:30.206 --> 23:32.499
a father of two
was bludgeoned to death

23:32.625 --> 23:35.293
between the hours
of 7 and 10 p.m.

23:35.419 --> 23:38.213
in the bathroom of Murphy's Tavern.

23:38.339 --> 23:40.256
Which is where I'll be today.

23:41.217 --> 23:42.425
Me too.

23:43.135 --> 23:45.220
Won't that be a problem with Ashton?

23:46.597 --> 23:47.889
Anton.

23:48.015 --> 23:50.391
And, no, he's cool.

23:51.435 --> 23:52.435
Sort of.

23:53.521 --> 23:55.480
Sort of?

23:55.606 --> 23:57.857
He gets jealous for no reason.

24:00.277 --> 24:01.736
He's a smart man.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.285
Look...

24:10.287 --> 24:12.330
don't make me come up
with thought bubbles

24:12.456 --> 24:15.583
to put over those silent looks of yours.

24:15.709 --> 24:18.962
Just say what you're thinking.

24:21.132 --> 24:22.257
All right.

24:24.802 --> 24:26.636
I, uh...

24:26.762 --> 24:28.972
I thought I could keep my feelings for you

24:29.098 --> 24:31.641
as background noise
to this investigation.

24:33.144 --> 24:35.145
But, in working with you...

24:36.981 --> 24:39.607
that noise has gotten...

24:42.027 --> 24:43.820
Loud?

24:45.698 --> 24:47.323
Deafening.

24:49.910 --> 24:51.619
But they're my feelings.

24:53.747 --> 24:55.081
Yup.

24:56.792 --> 24:59.752
They're your feelings.

25:00.588 --> 25:02.964
You're in a committed relationship.

25:04.508 --> 25:05.842
I am.

25:07.178 --> 25:09.846
And I would hate to...

25:11.015 --> 25:13.516
(Softly) I'd hate that too.

25:16.061 --> 25:17.770
Jesus.

25:22.526 --> 25:24.986
I've gotta go.

25:31.118 --> 25:32.702
Will I see you tonight?

25:34.747 --> 25:36.623
I don't...

25:38.083 --> 25:40.168
Fuck!

25:50.221 --> 25:52.180
Is there a break
in the Vacation Murders case?

25:52.306 --> 25:55.099
I'm having intimate relations with LaGuerta.

25:57.519 --> 25:58.811
Congratulations?

25:58.938 --> 26:00.355
I need some advice.

26:02.149 --> 26:04.692
Huh, lot of wise people out there.

26:06.153 --> 26:08.446
I don't trust anyone else
with this secret.

26:08.572 --> 26:10.448
That's too bad.

26:10.574 --> 26:13.618
Maria has awakened...

26:15.287 --> 26:16.287
Right.

26:16.413 --> 26:18.414
When I'm with her,
I feel like a man.

26:19.667 --> 26:21.918
Like my heart is blossoming.

26:22.586 --> 26:23.920
- That's a problem?
- No.

26:24.046 --> 26:28.466
The problem is she wants to disclose
our relationship to the higher-ups,

26:28.592 --> 26:31.469
which I-I understand is a formality.

26:31.595 --> 26:33.513
I just hate the thought
of them knowing.

26:35.266 --> 26:37.100
- Because you're embarrassed.
- No.

26:37.226 --> 26:40.311
Because once you define it, it's defined.

26:40.437 --> 26:43.439
It's-it's-it's officially official.

26:43.565 --> 26:45.233
- You're her boyfriend.
- Exactly.

26:45.359 --> 26:47.986
Next thing you know,
you're moving in, your life is gone,

26:48.112 --> 26:51.656
and it's just kids
and neighbors and painted mugs.

26:53.117 --> 26:55.159
- Painted mugs?
- It's a metaphor.

26:55.286 --> 26:56.703
For what?

26:56.829 --> 26:58.621
Look, if you want out, get out.

26:59.790 --> 27:02.000
Before you have to do
something drastic.

27:02.126 --> 27:05.003
I don't want out. I don't.

27:05.129 --> 27:07.046
I just want to protect it

27:07.172 --> 27:08.631
by keeping it private.

27:08.757 --> 27:10.300
Yeah.

27:10.426 --> 27:12.552
Who knew it would matter
so much to me?

27:13.637 --> 27:15.013
Thanks, socio.

27:15.139 --> 27:17.807
I'll keep you posted on the details.

27:19.184 --> 27:20.852
Great.

27:26.900 --> 27:29.319
l am a stickler for details.

27:32.990 --> 27:34.866
You still dating
that she-bag reporter?

27:34.992 --> 27:37.035
- Is it that hard for you to get laid?
- I'm not...

27:37.161 --> 27:39.537
After she put Lundy's name in the paper
and ruined everything?

27:39.663 --> 27:41.706
I'm not seeing her.

27:41.832 --> 27:43.416
Maybe you should have told her that.

27:43.542 --> 27:45.626
Newsflash, Quinn:
you're an idiot.

27:48.005 --> 27:50.631
Yeah, I got your messages.

27:50.758 --> 27:52.717
But you didn't call me back.

27:52.843 --> 27:55.261
Tell me, is this conversation
gonna end up in the paper too?

27:55.387 --> 27:57.221
You have no idea the shitstorm
you've got me into.

27:57.348 --> 27:59.223
I'm sorry.

27:59.350 --> 28:01.434
Really, but...

28:01.560 --> 28:03.353
we can work this out.

28:04.938 --> 28:06.689
I'm not interested in working it out.

28:07.649 --> 28:08.733
Don't say that.

28:08.859 --> 28:12.070
Come on, it's not like
this was a big deal.

28:13.197 --> 28:15.865
Don't you dare tell me
there's nothing here.

28:19.036 --> 28:21.913
You're right, I won't.

28:22.039 --> 28:24.332
But it's way too complicated.

28:27.461 --> 28:30.421
- I don't want to lose you.
- Christine.

28:30.547 --> 28:32.006
You never had me.

28:32.132 --> 28:34.217
Find yourself another source.

28:45.646 --> 28:47.939
On vacation,
we buy snow gIobes,

28:48.065 --> 28:50.900
send postcards to preserve
the good times,

28:51.026 --> 28:52.693
remind us where we've been.

28:55.239 --> 28:58.449
Zoey's crime scene
had its own memento...

28:58.575 --> 29:03.246
a gIove whose roIIed cuff preserved
the gunshot residue after she shot herseIf.

29:06.583 --> 29:08.793
And blood.

29:08.919 --> 29:11.212
Odds are it beIongs
to the late Darius Rae.

29:11.338 --> 29:12.380
(Sighs)

29:12.506 --> 29:15.133
Ah, Zoey, wish you were here.

29:15.259 --> 29:16.759
But since you're not...

29:17.803 --> 29:19.804
I'll come to you.

29:19.930 --> 29:24.934
I shouId get to Pembroke Pines
just in time to foIIow Officer Kruger home.

29:26.186 --> 29:30.314
Original structure
was a single-story tavern.

29:31.775 --> 29:34.026
Current building:

29:34.153 --> 29:36.529
12 floors, mostly vacant.

29:57.259 --> 29:58.926
I'm found.

30:18.614 --> 30:23.034
Lobby's open 24 hours, guard on duty,
too much foot traffic.

30:23.160 --> 30:25.369
Trinity would have to choose another floor.

30:25.496 --> 30:28.998
Ooh! Uh, I'm so sorry.
I wasn't watching where I was going.

30:29.124 --> 30:31.334
No damage done.

30:40.886 --> 30:43.095
Excuse me.

30:47.142 --> 30:49.560
You dropped these.

30:49.686 --> 30:51.020
Thanks.

31:08.539 --> 31:10.748
Bus number 432.

31:10.874 --> 31:13.626
White male, maybe 6'4",

31:13.752 --> 31:16.379
200, 220 pounds,

31:16.505 --> 31:18.297
age around 60,

31:18.423 --> 31:21.425
hair gray, eyes blue...

31:22.761 --> 31:24.595
something in them.

31:32.145 --> 31:34.605
Maybe I do miss Rita and the kids...

31:34.731 --> 31:35.773
(Ringing tone)

31:35.899 --> 31:37.358
- (Baby cries)
- Hello?

31:37.484 --> 31:38.609
Hi, it's me.

31:38.735 --> 31:40.236
Oh, uh, hey, guys, keep it down.

31:40.362 --> 31:41.779
I was just checking in.

31:41.905 --> 31:44.699
Oh, we have the rehearsal dinner
in 20 minutes and...

31:44.825 --> 31:46.742
Astor, your dress
is getting wrinkled.

31:46.868 --> 31:48.286
Sounds like you got your hands...

31:48.412 --> 31:50.746
Cody, put your shoes on.
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

31:50.872 --> 31:53.040
I was just saying
you probably have your hands...

31:53.166 --> 31:56.127
- Mom, Cody pulled my barrettes out.
- It was an accident.

31:56.253 --> 31:58.170
You took them
right off my head.

31:58.297 --> 32:00.798
I'm sorry, I didn't hear
what you were saying.

32:00.924 --> 32:02.133
It was nothing.

32:02.259 --> 32:04.677
Uh, we gotta go. Love you.

32:04.803 --> 32:06.012
- Me...
- (Dial tone)

32:06.138 --> 32:07.471
..too.

32:11.059 --> 32:12.602
(Sighs)

32:12.728 --> 32:14.729
(Siren whoops)

32:16.273 --> 32:17.481
Shit.

32:17.608 --> 32:19.984
Going the speed Iimit,
hands-free diaIing,

32:20.110 --> 32:21.152
no violations.

32:21.278 --> 32:22.945
(Siren wailing)

32:33.749 --> 32:35.499
This is bad.

32:35.626 --> 32:36.959
What a coincidence.

32:37.794 --> 32:39.795
Out of the vehicle, please.

32:44.843 --> 32:46.510
Hands on the hood, please.

32:51.308 --> 32:55.186
My wife and I changed our mind
about buying a house.

32:55.312 --> 32:57.813
Dexter Morgan.

32:59.483 --> 33:03.778
You didn't mention that
you were a, uh, spatter analyst,

33:03.904 --> 33:05.946
Miami Metro.

33:07.574 --> 33:09.825
Didn't seem relevant
to house hunting.

33:11.495 --> 33:12.620
Hmm.

33:14.831 --> 33:17.375
Well, the file clerk at my station,

33:17.501 --> 33:19.126
he's a friend.

33:19.252 --> 33:21.087
He told me that Sam
had pulled my case file,

33:21.213 --> 33:24.256
and Sam told me
he'd loaned it to a colleague.

33:24.383 --> 33:28.177
You can imagine my surprise when I looked
up that colleague and saw your face.

33:29.638 --> 33:31.555
I am writing a paper
on blood swipes.

33:31.682 --> 33:35.017
- Are you getting off on this?
- Am I supposed to be?

33:35.686 --> 33:38.646
Are you the kind of sicko
who likes watching a woman in pain?

33:40.691 --> 33:42.817
Not that kind of sicko, no.

33:44.277 --> 33:46.028
I lost my husband.

33:47.781 --> 33:50.866
I watched my child die
in front of me.

33:51.993 --> 33:54.370
Do you have any idea
how agonizing that was?

33:55.038 --> 33:57.289
Agony would be
the normal reaction.

33:58.041 --> 34:01.043
I will not let that wound be reopened.

34:04.381 --> 34:06.590
Do you understand?

34:14.766 --> 34:16.267
Traffic's heavy on Brickell.

34:16.393 --> 34:18.310
Might want to avoid it
on your way home.

34:18.437 --> 34:19.729
Was, uh...

34:20.939 --> 34:22.440
3319 Meadow Lane, right?

34:24.109 --> 34:25.651
I'm letting you off with a warning.

34:27.654 --> 34:29.196
Drive carefully.

34:37.497 --> 34:39.373
I'm calling it off.

34:39.499 --> 34:40.958
You can't.

34:41.084 --> 34:43.127
She knows who you are.

34:43.253 --> 34:46.005
She knows who Dexter Morgan,
lab geek, is.

34:46.131 --> 34:47.590
She knows where you live,

34:47.716 --> 34:50.718
where your wife and children will be
when they get home in 48 hours.

34:50.844 --> 34:53.345
If I back off, she backs off.

34:54.097 --> 34:56.140
Still leaves you
on the radar of a killer cop

34:56.266 --> 34:58.476
who has no qualms
about shooting her family,

34:58.602 --> 34:59.977
much less a lab rat.

35:00.103 --> 35:03.647
She's stalking me. Taking her by surprise
will be out of the question.

35:03.774 --> 35:06.650
You're the one
who wanted a challenge.

35:10.405 --> 35:12.990
And now you've batted the beehive.

35:13.116 --> 35:14.158
(Answerphone beeps)

35:14.284 --> 35:15.993
Dexter, Frank Lundy here.

35:16.119 --> 35:17.495
Sorry to bother you at home.

35:17.621 --> 35:19.497
Just trying to reach your sister.

35:19.623 --> 35:21.123
Thought she was maybe with you.

35:21.249 --> 35:23.793
I had an interesting encounter today.

35:23.919 --> 35:25.586
(Turns off machine)

35:26.546 --> 35:27.546
Me too.

35:35.263 --> 35:37.431
Gotta admit, she is impressive.

35:39.267 --> 35:40.851
Makes you wonder why someone like her

35:40.977 --> 35:43.479
ever got married and had kids
in the first place.

35:43.605 --> 35:45.189
Someone like her?

35:48.026 --> 35:51.153
Someone like her
needs to be in control.

35:53.782 --> 35:55.699
And if she thinks she is...

35:57.118 --> 35:58.786
She won't see me coming.

36:03.041 --> 36:04.708
(Ringing tone)

36:05.710 --> 36:07.378
Pembroke Pines
PoIice Department.

36:07.504 --> 36:08.879
Records, please?

36:09.005 --> 36:09.880
Transferring.

36:10.006 --> 36:11.674
(Phone rings)

36:12.843 --> 36:14.468
Records, Langsbury speaking.

36:15.095 --> 36:17.680
Uh, yeah, this is Miami Metro Forensics.

36:17.806 --> 36:21.559
I wanted to request copies
of a suspect's file.

36:21.685 --> 36:23.269
Suspect's name?

36:23.395 --> 36:25.396
Uh, Darius Rae.

36:25.522 --> 36:27.314
That's Rae with an "e".

36:27.440 --> 36:31.026
(Dexter) Drug deaIer and aIIeged kiIIer
of Zoey Kruger's famiIy.

36:31.903 --> 36:33.320
What is this in regard to?

36:33.446 --> 36:36.907
Uh... It involves the Vacation Murders case.

36:37.868 --> 36:39.827
I'll send the file over.

36:39.953 --> 36:41.412
To whose attention?

36:41.538 --> 36:45.249
Just, uh, Forensics.

36:49.170 --> 36:51.130
Batting the beehive.

36:58.722 --> 37:00.222
Dexter.

37:09.733 --> 37:10.941
I know everything.

37:11.067 --> 37:14.028
I'm gonna choose
not to misinterpret that.

37:14.154 --> 37:16.739
When Angel said
he told you about us, I was...

37:18.033 --> 37:19.491
angry, to say the least.

37:19.618 --> 37:22.411
I really didn't want to know.

37:22.537 --> 37:24.955
- But now you do.
- Yeah.

37:25.081 --> 37:29.877
Actually, I'm glad because I could really use
a man's opinion on how to handle...

37:31.296 --> 37:32.796
our relationship.

37:33.840 --> 37:37.384
Or fling, or whatever it is
that he and I are doing naked.

37:38.929 --> 37:41.263
Well, I was just going to lunch.

37:41.389 --> 37:42.640
That's great.

37:44.976 --> 37:47.019
Beth's cafe sound good?

37:47.145 --> 37:50.898
Oh, actually, we should...just talk here.

37:52.984 --> 37:55.110
- It's more private.
- Yeah.

38:00.116 --> 38:03.077
Angel's a great cop.
The best I know.

38:03.203 --> 38:06.372
But he doesn't understand
the politics in this building.

38:06.498 --> 38:10.793
And we have to manage
how this thing becomes public.

38:10.919 --> 38:13.420
And if it's handled wrong,
ourjobs could be at risk.

38:13.546 --> 38:16.966
And we can't take that chance.

38:19.135 --> 38:21.011
I...

38:21.137 --> 38:23.222
Never leave anything to chance.

38:25.809 --> 38:27.309
(Sighs)

38:29.771 --> 38:30.896
Thank you.

38:31.606 --> 38:33.941
You're getting good
at this relationship stuff.

38:34.067 --> 38:37.152
Mm, marriage agrees with you.

38:38.029 --> 38:39.113
Thank you.

38:44.369 --> 38:46.620
Lundy called last night.
He was trying to reach you.

38:48.373 --> 38:50.874
That is just so...

38:52.085 --> 38:53.669
fucking great.

38:56.631 --> 38:57.673
OK.

39:11.229 --> 39:13.480
Looks Iike the beehive is buzzing.

39:13.606 --> 39:15.733
And here comes the sting.

39:36.379 --> 39:39.381
You're out of yourjurisdiction,
Officer Kruger.

39:53.146 --> 39:54.480
Wait for it.

40:01.029 --> 40:02.529
W-w-what are you doing?

40:02.655 --> 40:04.198
You want info on Darius Rae?

40:04.324 --> 40:05.407
Ask me anything.

40:05.533 --> 40:07.367
That file was for a case I'm working.

40:08.119 --> 40:10.287
I asked you nicely

40:10.413 --> 40:11.789
to leave me alone.

40:11.915 --> 40:13.457
You threatened me.

40:14.584 --> 40:17.920
- You think that was a threat?
- What, are you gonna murder me too?

40:18.880 --> 40:20.464
Like you murdered your family?

40:21.925 --> 40:25.636
- Your own daughter?
- (Sighs)

40:25.762 --> 40:28.055
- You're sick.
- I know what you did.

40:28.181 --> 40:29.890
I have proof.

40:31.434 --> 40:33.227
Not possible.

40:33.353 --> 40:36.605
From the garbage disposal,
the gloves you wore that night.

40:36.731 --> 40:38.899
There was gun residue on them.

40:39.025 --> 40:41.527
I have a meeting with
my superiors tomorrow morning

40:41.653 --> 40:43.320
to tell them everything.

40:45.865 --> 40:47.658
There's no chain of custody.

40:47.784 --> 40:49.701
Still, it'll raise questions.

40:49.828 --> 40:53.580
And if you left this much behind,
we'll find something else.

41:04.509 --> 41:06.176
You're trying to rape me.

41:08.138 --> 41:09.930
I'm not touching you.

41:10.974 --> 41:13.517
That's why you came to my house.

41:13.643 --> 41:18.105
And the real estate agent will testify
that you were flirting with me.

41:18.231 --> 41:22.109
And then you stalked me here
and tried to assault me.

41:22.902 --> 41:25.654
- And I had to defend myself.
- Except...

41:26.656 --> 41:29.032
the blowback of my blood
into the muzzle of your gun

41:29.159 --> 41:34.371
will show a flat contact shot
that's highly unlikely during a struggle.

41:35.248 --> 41:36.331
Mm.

41:39.544 --> 41:41.044
You could shoot me center mass,

41:41.171 --> 41:45.340
but the low directionality will show
I was in a defensive position.

41:45.466 --> 41:48.385
You'd have to calculate
the exact distance

41:48.511 --> 41:52.681
to create a spatter pattern
that supports self-defense.

41:58.438 --> 42:00.105
Go ahead.

42:00.899 --> 42:02.065
Tell them.

42:03.902 --> 42:06.904
No one is going to believe you

42:07.030 --> 42:08.947
over me.

42:11.576 --> 42:13.243
So please...

42:14.204 --> 42:15.245
tell them...

42:15.371 --> 42:17.039
everything.

42:23.880 --> 42:25.881
You won't give me the chance.

42:28.718 --> 42:31.053
I'm counting on it.

42:33.723 --> 42:35.390
(Knocking)

42:41.606 --> 42:42.981
Debra.

42:43.691 --> 42:45.525
You're here.

42:45.652 --> 42:48.070
- I called because, Trinity, I think...
- Shut up.

43:03.586 --> 43:06.296
This time she won't come in a squad car.

43:06.422 --> 43:09.508
This time it won't be about
threats and intimidation.

43:10.551 --> 43:12.219
This time, it's for real.

43:16.683 --> 43:18.183
They're aII props,

43:18.309 --> 43:20.477
the camouflage of a famiIy man.

43:21.854 --> 43:23.522
She'll believe them.

43:24.816 --> 43:27.442
She has no idea who l am,

43:27.568 --> 43:29.236
but I know exactIy who she is.

43:30.780 --> 43:32.322
Marco...

43:32.448 --> 43:34.157
(Door lock clicks)

43:36.494 --> 43:37.703
..Polo.

43:45.461 --> 43:48.046
She's going to make it Iook Iike
I waIked in on a home robbery,

43:48.172 --> 43:50.215
got myseIf kiIIed.

43:50.341 --> 43:52.843
She's good at creating
the narrative of a crime.

44:14.324 --> 44:16.658
That hand's the first thing I cut off.

44:32.216 --> 44:33.842
Surprise.

44:40.183 --> 44:41.183
(Groans)

45:03.122 --> 45:05.374
Help. Help!

45:05.500 --> 45:07.042
Help! (Coughs)

45:07.168 --> 45:10.087
Sorry, sorry, I was just
buying your tickets.

45:10.213 --> 45:12.589
You're taking a boat out of the country.

45:12.715 --> 45:15.926
Eventually you'll land
in the Philippines.

45:16.052 --> 45:18.720
You're smart.
There's no extradition treaty there.

45:19.764 --> 45:21.390
I'm not going anywhere.

45:25.436 --> 45:27.771
I know something about
creating a narrative too.

45:27.897 --> 45:31.691
Suitcases packed,
your car will be left at the port,

45:31.818 --> 45:35.695
and the blue glove
is back in your disposal.

45:36.280 --> 45:37.614
You'll flee the country.

45:37.740 --> 45:39.074
Pshoo!

45:40.118 --> 45:42.285
Never be caught.

45:42.412 --> 45:43.912
You're that good.

45:45.748 --> 45:47.374
Or that dead.

45:48.251 --> 45:49.626
You're gonna rape and kill me?

45:49.752 --> 45:54.297
(Laughs) What is it with you and rape?
No one's raping anyone.

45:54.424 --> 45:56.216
Mm, killing on the other hand...

45:58.261 --> 46:00.804
Why are you doing this to me?

46:01.973 --> 46:03.890
Why did you do this to them?

46:05.309 --> 46:07.060
It was Darius Rae.

46:07.186 --> 46:09.312
No, you wanted out.

46:10.356 --> 46:12.816
You wanted your freedom

46:12.942 --> 46:16.111
from the constant demands.

46:17.238 --> 46:18.530
They took it all,

46:18.656 --> 46:20.323
and they wanted more.

46:23.744 --> 46:25.287
I couldn't breathe.

46:25.955 --> 46:27.581
You did it to survive.

46:30.543 --> 46:32.210
You understand.

46:34.046 --> 46:36.756
I understand, all right.

46:47.101 --> 46:48.393
Look at you.

46:49.937 --> 46:52.814
What kind of father does this?

46:53.733 --> 46:55.400
What kind of husband?

47:01.657 --> 47:04.618
- (Groans)
- Not the kind who kills his family.

47:16.464 --> 47:18.965
You're going to have to choose.

47:20.134 --> 47:21.801
Not what you chose.

47:24.013 --> 47:26.890
You can't hide what you are.

47:27.725 --> 47:29.226
Oh, I can.

47:29.352 --> 47:31.019
I'm better at it than you.

47:31.687 --> 47:35.148
You will choose
your life over theirs.

47:35.274 --> 47:36.608
I won't.

47:36.734 --> 47:39.069
I'd rather risk them knowing the truth...

47:41.864 --> 47:43.532
than lose them.

47:49.997 --> 47:51.915
Wow, wow.

47:56.504 --> 47:57.837
Oh.

47:57.964 --> 47:59.631
I don't want to lose them.

48:02.510 --> 48:04.177
I don't.

48:09.892 --> 48:11.560
That's the difference between us.

48:15.398 --> 48:17.023
(Groans)

48:24.699 --> 48:26.366
Nice souvenir.

48:36.252 --> 48:38.295
Sure you don't want to stay here?

48:38.421 --> 48:41.423
You didn't raise a loner, Dad.

48:42.300 --> 48:43.967
Maybe I should have.

48:45.886 --> 48:47.345
I'll survive.

48:47.471 --> 48:49.389
You sure?

48:53.269 --> 48:55.312
Better see to that drip, son.

48:55.438 --> 48:57.647
You don't want this place
going to hell.

48:57.773 --> 48:59.065
You need it too much.

48:59.191 --> 49:01.151
My own little vacation spot.

49:01.277 --> 49:02.944
(Phone rings)

49:05.489 --> 49:07.741
Hey, how you guys
doing up there?

49:07.867 --> 49:10.243
We're on our way.
We left right after the wedding.

49:10.369 --> 49:11.578
We should be home soon.

49:11.704 --> 49:13.079
Good, I'm glad.

49:13.205 --> 49:14.873
The house!

49:15.958 --> 49:17.876
Don't hurry. Drive safe.

49:48.032 --> 49:49.449
(Door opens)

49:52.453 --> 49:53.828
You're home!

49:53.954 --> 49:55.789
Yeah, we made it.

49:55.915 --> 49:57.540
The wedding was exhausting.

49:57.667 --> 49:59.709
The kids were a nightmare.

49:59.835 --> 50:01.503
I wanted to strangle them.

50:03.714 --> 50:05.715
Oh, no.

50:05.841 --> 50:07.592
Yeah, it just slipped out of my hand.

50:07.718 --> 50:09.511
Sorry.

50:11.514 --> 50:14.099
Oh, the kids will be excited
to make you a new one.

50:14.225 --> 50:16.267
(She sighs)

50:33.202 --> 50:34.703
Mmm.

50:36.539 --> 50:38.206
I missed you so much.

50:41.711 --> 50:43.378
I missed you too.

51:15.995 --> 51:17.579
I'm a fuckwad.

51:17.705 --> 51:19.372
(Laughs)

51:22.001 --> 51:23.668
You're not a fuckwad.

51:27.006 --> 51:28.047
I knew.

51:29.258 --> 51:33.428
From the second I saw you at the station,
I knew how I felt.

51:34.472 --> 51:36.556
It's how I've always felt.

51:36.682 --> 51:38.475
I just wouldn't admit it.

51:40.436 --> 51:41.936
Because I'm a fuckwad.

51:44.982 --> 51:46.441
You're human.

51:48.152 --> 51:49.486
And now I've cheated on a guy

51:49.612 --> 51:52.113
who doesn't deserve
to be treated that way.

51:53.616 --> 51:56.826
I should have broken up with him first.

51:56.952 --> 51:59.662
- But I'm a fuckwad.
- No. Don't.

51:59.789 --> 52:01.456
You're not.

52:02.708 --> 52:04.167
You're beautiful.

52:05.294 --> 52:07.587
And you were confused.

52:09.381 --> 52:10.965
And now you're not.

52:12.676 --> 52:14.177
So...

52:14.970 --> 52:18.014
we'll set this right, together.

52:18.140 --> 52:19.474
All right?

52:39.787 --> 52:42.163
Don't go disappearing on me again.

52:43.332 --> 52:45.124
Not a...

52:45.543 --> 52:46.668
(Gunshot)

52:59.223 --> 53:01.224
(Two gunshots)

53:26.625 --> 53:29.878
Stay with me.
