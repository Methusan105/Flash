WEBVTT

00:13.018 --> 00:14.560
Previously on Dexter.

00:14.687 --> 00:16.771
It's for sure. I'm pregnant.

00:18.190 --> 00:19.649
What kind of father would l be?

00:19.775 --> 00:21.734
After all, l kill people.

00:21.860 --> 00:24.028
Aah!

00:24.154 --> 00:26.906
Me? Demented daddy Dexter.

00:27.032 --> 00:27.990
(Moaning)

00:28.117 --> 00:32.912
This child is happening.
But your role in its life is entirely up to you.

00:33.539 --> 00:36.040
(Debra) Yesterday morning you said
when the case ends, we end.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.084
(Lundy) I thought you understood
when we got involved.

00:38.210 --> 00:39.961
I track killers. That's what I do.

00:40.087 --> 00:41.963
A pattern of bodies
was identified in Oregon.

00:42.089 --> 00:43.256
My flight leaves tonight.

00:43.382 --> 00:45.717
If you're leaving,
we gotta work out logistics.

00:45.843 --> 00:48.219
Do you honestly want
to go down this path?

00:48.345 --> 00:50.596
(Dexter) I don't know if I'm
going to be a father to the kid.

00:50.723 --> 00:52.932
(Debra) How could even say you're not
gonna be a father to that kid?

00:53.058 --> 00:55.435
I mean, where would you be
without Harry?

00:55.561 --> 00:58.938
(Dexter) Harry knew my mother.
Laura Moser was his informant.

00:59.064 --> 01:00.523
Was he just using her?

01:00.649 --> 01:02.525
Was he using me?

01:02.651 --> 01:04.277
Dad wasn't perfect, Deb.

01:04.403 --> 01:06.237
What did he do? Cheat on Mom?

01:06.363 --> 01:09.323
- Bullshit. Who?
- I need all the records you have

01:09.450 --> 01:11.284
on my dad's confidential informants.

01:11.410 --> 01:14.787
- Attractive female CI's?
- Why, you know something?

01:14.913 --> 01:17.373
There's a good reason
why Quinn's of interest to IA.

01:17.499 --> 01:20.501
Internal Affairs is investigating you.
Is there something you're not telling us?

01:20.627 --> 01:22.170
Anton is not officially a CI.

01:22.296 --> 01:25.006
- What do you mean?
- I never filed an arrest report on him.

01:25.132 --> 01:27.341
You are the best thing
that has happened to me.

01:28.969 --> 01:31.596
Just sending out my positive
intentions to our baby.

01:31.722 --> 01:34.557
You know, we're connected.
You're what makes me real.

01:34.683 --> 01:36.809
Please say yes.

01:36.935 --> 01:39.187
Yes, we will marry you.

01:39.313 --> 01:43.483
Syl has offered to list my house
so we can buy something bigger.

01:43.609 --> 01:47.403
Better hope she doesn't insist
on a place with central air.

01:47.529 --> 01:49.447
(Dexter) I was actually thinking
I might keep my place.

01:49.573 --> 01:51.783
"No" doesn't really work
in a relationship, Dexter.

01:51.909 --> 01:54.619
Every man needs his privacy.
Some more than others.

01:55.954 --> 01:57.622
Is it possibIe
I've actuaIIy made a friend?

01:57.748 --> 01:59.957
Someone I can trust
with my dark secrets?

02:00.083 --> 02:02.919
I didn't teach you the code
to share with your buddies.

02:03.045 --> 02:06.339
MigueI reaIIy did it.
And I taught him how.

02:06.465 --> 02:08.966
Harry was right. He used me.

02:09.092 --> 02:12.512
You're all just unchecked
versions of myself,

02:12.638 --> 02:14.847
what I would've become
without my father's code.

02:14.973 --> 02:16.098
(Strangled scream)

02:17.810 --> 02:19.435
I could kill you now.

02:19.561 --> 02:22.855
- I've never felt this.
- You've never had a son before.

02:22.981 --> 02:24.357
You want to see him
come into the world.

02:24.483 --> 02:27.652
Yes. I've never wanted anything
so much in my life.

02:29.488 --> 02:31.531
(Sirens)

02:31.657 --> 02:33.658
I have moved on from my father,

02:33.784 --> 02:35.785
but l still need his code.

02:35.911 --> 02:39.205
But right now, Iife is good.

02:39.331 --> 02:41.290
Dexter Morgan, famiIy man.

04:51.755 --> 04:53.589
Tonight's the night.

04:56.885 --> 05:00.930
The night when a primaI,
sacred need calls to me.

05:01.056 --> 05:04.350
l've waited and waited.

05:04.476 --> 05:07.228
But tonight, this night...

05:10.148 --> 05:12.149
..it's time.

05:39.678 --> 05:41.846
Tonight's the night I finaIIy...

05:43.223 --> 05:45.307
..sIeep.

06:06.830 --> 06:09.081
(Water running)

06:21.595 --> 06:24.555
(Creak)

06:28.852 --> 06:31.020
(Creaking)

06:38.403 --> 06:40.488
(Gasps, screams)

06:40.614 --> 06:42.740
No...

06:42.866 --> 06:44.450
(Screaming)

06:44.576 --> 06:46.911
(Baby cries)

06:47.037 --> 06:48.120
(Sighs)

06:48.246 --> 06:49.955
(Crying)

06:50.082 --> 06:53.125
OK, Harrison.
The driving thing didn't work.

06:53.251 --> 06:54.794
The singing thing didn't work.

06:54.920 --> 06:58.297
You planning on both of us not sleeping
for another three months?

06:58.423 --> 07:00.466
(Crying)

07:00.592 --> 07:02.593
Apparently so.

07:03.720 --> 07:07.807
OK, I want to take you inside,
but I don't want you waking Mommy.

07:07.933 --> 07:11.143
- (Jangling)
- Hey.

07:11.269 --> 07:14.480
If you could talk, you'd tell me
not to worry about you, right?

07:17.943 --> 07:20.277
(Woman) No...

07:20.403 --> 07:23.781
(Sobbing, choking) Oh, please.

07:23.907 --> 07:26.200
No, don't...

07:26.326 --> 07:28.494
No.

07:28.620 --> 07:30.454
Please.

07:31.498 --> 07:33.290
Please. Please.

07:33.416 --> 07:36.085
Shh.

07:37.629 --> 07:40.172
It's already over.

07:54.479 --> 07:56.480
(Gasps)

07:56.606 --> 07:59.483
(Groaning and whimpering)

08:56.041 --> 08:58.083
(Yawns)

09:01.504 --> 09:04.131
(Child 1 ) Marco!
(Child 2) Polo.

09:04.257 --> 09:05.299
(Child 1 ) Marco.

09:05.926 --> 09:07.885
(Child 2) Polo.

09:08.011 --> 09:09.470
(Child 1 ) Marco...

09:09.596 --> 09:11.597
There's this cliche
where serial killers

09:11.723 --> 09:15.267
are aIways described as,
"Quiet, kept to himself. Kind of a loner."

09:15.602 --> 09:17.269
(Toy quacks)

09:17.395 --> 09:19.730
lt's a cliche for a reason.

09:19.856 --> 09:22.107
(   Pop music playing)

09:22.234 --> 09:24.276
Has anybody seen my keys?

09:24.402 --> 09:26.528
(Rita) Astor, I asked you
to keep it down.

09:26.655 --> 09:28.113
(Sighs)

09:29.157 --> 09:31.033
Why do you hate my music
so much?

09:31.159 --> 09:32.493
I don't hate your music.

09:32.619 --> 09:34.161
You don't?

09:34.287 --> 09:37.373
Cody, get out of the Larsons' pool.
It's time for school.

09:37.499 --> 09:39.959
If I had an iPod, you wouldn't
have to listen to my stuff.

09:40.085 --> 09:43.504
You want an iPod, earn one.
Do your chores. Unpack your room.

09:43.630 --> 09:45.047
God, you are so unfair!

09:50.095 --> 09:51.887
Did you get any sleep?

09:52.013 --> 09:53.639
Uh, an hour and a half, maybe.

09:53.765 --> 09:55.307
Oh, and you have court.

09:55.433 --> 09:57.309
Look, I appreciate you
taking the night shift,

09:57.435 --> 10:00.145
but when you have a big day like today,
it's OK to wake me up.

10:00.272 --> 10:03.315
Well, it's kind of on-the-job training,
you know?

10:03.441 --> 10:06.402
All that matters
is his father's there for him.

10:06.528 --> 10:09.363
- I cannot find keys...
- Cody!

10:09.990 --> 10:11.031
Astor, the music.

10:11.157 --> 10:13.075
You usually leave them
right here by the phone.

10:13.201 --> 10:14.868
I know.

10:14.995 --> 10:17.788
- School. Clothes. Now.
- Sorry.

10:20.709 --> 10:25.212
You don't get some sleep, it won't be
your keys that get lost, it'll be your mind.

10:25.338 --> 10:27.798
I lost that years ago.

10:41.604 --> 10:44.606
Dexter Morgan,
good suburban husband.

10:44.733 --> 10:47.401
Happy father of three.

10:47.527 --> 10:49.028
On paper, anyway.

10:49.154 --> 10:51.071
(Children laughing)

10:51.197 --> 10:53.073
Hey, Dex, what's the news?

10:53.199 --> 10:54.658
Uh, too soon to tell.

10:55.452 --> 10:57.911
Dexter? Dexter, you forgot
your cell phone.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.874
Oh, good morning, Elliot.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.752
Another beautiful day.
More pool time for the kids.

11:04.878 --> 11:07.963
Well, you already took the morning shift,
so I'll watch them this afternoon.

11:08.089 --> 11:09.757
Takes a village.

11:12.635 --> 11:13.552
(Chuckles)

11:13.678 --> 11:15.512
- (Cody roars)
- (Shrieks)

11:16.848 --> 11:20.225
- Ah. Mm.
- (Cody) Take that!

11:20.352 --> 11:22.561
Car pools and swimming pools.

11:22.687 --> 11:24.855
How much are we living the dream?

11:25.899 --> 11:28.359
- So much.
- (Laughs)

11:30.028 --> 11:32.404
Living the dream.

11:32.530 --> 11:35.574
(Moaning)

11:37.952 --> 11:39.411
(Man) Mm.

11:39.537 --> 11:44.083
Hey, um, do you think you can
TiVo Jon Stewart for me?

11:44.876 --> 11:46.251
(Anton) Mm.

11:46.378 --> 11:48.921
Thinking about Jon Stewart, huh?

11:49.047 --> 11:50.381
(Chuckles)

11:50.507 --> 11:52.925
Well, he is handsome.

11:53.051 --> 11:54.510
(Giggles)

11:54.636 --> 11:56.261
And funny.

11:56.388 --> 11:58.180
I love you.

12:03.895 --> 12:05.354
(Debra) Oh, fuck me.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.731
That's kind of where this is heading.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.441
No. I'm late for work.

12:11.027 --> 12:12.569
(He sighs)

12:17.700 --> 12:19.743
It's a good thing you moved in,
or I'd never see you.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.121
Well, one of us has to live here.

12:22.247 --> 12:25.874
At least with the cruise ship,
I get to see you every few days.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.918
- I went on tour...
- I know.

12:28.044 --> 12:29.753
It's OK, I kind of like it.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.755
Keeps you from getting sick of me.

12:31.881 --> 12:34.675
- That's never going to happen.
- Yeah, because you're never here.

12:34.801 --> 12:38.095
No, because you make me happy.

12:43.601 --> 12:46.478
And what conclusions did you draw
from the blood evidence, Mr. Morgan?

12:46.604 --> 12:50.232
I was able to determine
the victim's movement and direction

12:50.358 --> 12:53.068
after the initial
blunt-force trauma to the head

12:53.194 --> 12:54.903
caused by the defendant's fist.

12:55.029 --> 12:56.572
How so?

12:56.698 --> 13:01.618
I...reconstructed a...

13:01.744 --> 13:03.495
timeline and sequence of events

13:03.621 --> 13:07.082
by examining...
It's here somewhere.

13:08.501 --> 13:11.128
I noticed a passive
flow pattern bloodstain

13:11.254 --> 13:13.547
approximately two meters in length

13:13.673 --> 13:15.340
emanating from the head wound,

13:15.467 --> 13:19.344
and the sample was consistent
with the sample from the defendant's shirt.

13:20.763 --> 13:23.432
You did say "passive
flow pattern bloodstain"?

13:23.558 --> 13:25.517
Quote, unquote.

13:25.643 --> 13:27.186
What exactly do your notes say?

13:28.605 --> 13:30.105
Um...

13:30.940 --> 13:33.358
"The bloodstain described
a passive pooling

13:33.485 --> 13:36.528
"and flow configuration,
type O negative,

13:36.654 --> 13:39.865
"matching the sample taken from," um...

13:41.493 --> 13:45.829
uh, "Leonetti's shirt."

13:47.499 --> 13:49.708
But this is the Gomez hearing.

13:49.834 --> 13:53.295
Yes, Mr. Morgan.
The defendant's name is Benito Gomez.

13:53.421 --> 13:56.215
(Sighs) I must've brought
the wrong notes.

13:56.341 --> 13:58.383
Do you frequently become
confused and disoriented

13:58.510 --> 14:00.719
while conducting your spatter
analysis, Mr. Morgan?

14:00.845 --> 14:04.681
No, I do not.
We...just had a new baby.

14:04.807 --> 14:06.099
Things were a little hectic this morning.

14:06.226 --> 14:08.852
So you're saying that you're sleep-deprived
and it's affecting yourjudgment?

14:08.978 --> 14:10.896
No, it's just a momentary mix-up.

14:11.022 --> 14:13.065
Wrong notes, wrong blood type.

14:13.191 --> 14:15.108
Wrong defendant. Wrong case.

14:15.235 --> 14:17.903
That's what you call
a momentary mix-up in a murder trial?

14:18.988 --> 14:20.697
I misspoke.

14:20.823 --> 14:22.658
- Oh, fuck.
- Your honor, the witness

14:22.784 --> 14:25.077
has just demonstrated
how unreliable he is in a courtroom.

14:25.203 --> 14:28.080
I would have to ask
how reliable his work is in the lab.

14:28.206 --> 14:29.331
Or on a crime scene.

14:29.457 --> 14:32.125
Moreover, how reliable
is a police department

14:32.252 --> 14:35.128
that would place so much trust
in his expert opinion?

14:43.972 --> 14:46.098
I'm halfway through
the CI files you gave me.

14:46.224 --> 14:50.060
I were you, I'd spend more time
with that man of yours

14:50.186 --> 14:52.688
and less time looking for some
old confidential informant

14:52.814 --> 14:54.898
your daddy might've diddled
back in the day.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.276
I meet another one tomorrow.

14:57.402 --> 15:00.028
Maybe then I'll finally get
some answers.

15:00.154 --> 15:01.572
Say you do.

15:01.698 --> 15:02.781
Then what?

15:02.907 --> 15:07.160
Then...I'll know.

15:07.287 --> 15:11.290
That my perfect fucking father
wasn't so fucking perfect.

15:11.416 --> 15:13.542
So that's what, the meaning of life?

15:14.377 --> 15:16.587
The meaning of my life.

15:21.092 --> 15:22.968
Hey, buddy.

15:23.094 --> 15:24.803
Guess where I was yesterday.

15:26.264 --> 15:28.473
- Well, I'm not sure, I...
- I was at a store.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.684
Want to take a guess
what kind of store?

15:30.810 --> 15:32.644
- I don't know. Grocery?
- Clothing.

15:32.770 --> 15:34.396
You know me,
I'm pretty into that shit.

15:34.522 --> 15:36.398
Gotta come correct and all.
But not yesterday.

15:36.524 --> 15:38.775
- Look, if this is about...
- Come on, buddy. Let me finish.

15:38.901 --> 15:41.320
I was at a store helping a lady
pick out a suit for her son.

15:41.446 --> 15:43.405
Know why?
Because he had to be in court

15:43.531 --> 15:45.115
to see the guy who killed his old man.

15:45.241 --> 15:48.619
Kid's first fucking suit.
Something a father should be doing.

15:48.745 --> 15:50.287
- I'm sorry.
- Little late for "sorry".

15:50.413 --> 15:52.122
That asshole you let walk?

15:52.790 --> 15:55.667
- Benito Gomez.
- Ah, now you get it right.

15:55.793 --> 15:57.794
You actually see
what that fuckhead did?

15:57.920 --> 16:00.756
Gomez hit the kid's old man so hard,

16:00.882 --> 16:03.967
his cheekbone broke,
pushing his eyeball up and out of his face.

16:04.093 --> 16:07.012
Then Gomez, sweetheart that he is,
kills the guy in front of his own son.

16:07.138 --> 16:08.513
- I know.
- How about this beauty?

16:08.640 --> 16:10.349
Gomez did five years
for beating his girlfriend

16:10.475 --> 16:12.351
so bad even her dentist
had a hard time with the ID.

16:12.477 --> 16:14.311
So is your "sorry"
gonna keep Gomez

16:14.437 --> 16:16.104
from pounding somebody else
into the next world?

16:16.230 --> 16:17.397
Jesus, chill out, Quinn.

16:17.523 --> 16:20.567
No, Deb, he's right.
I screwed up in court today.

16:20.693 --> 16:23.362
- Gomez walked. This one's on me.
- Thanks. That means so much to me.

16:23.488 --> 16:25.364
Why don't you hold on to those
for me, OK, buddy?

16:25.490 --> 16:27.407
I'm sick of looking at 'em.

16:27.533 --> 16:30.619
- You screwed up?
- Big time.

16:31.663 --> 16:33.413
Should I be worried?

16:33.539 --> 16:36.333
(Sighs) No, I'll be OK.

16:37.877 --> 16:40.962
Maybe it's Benny Gomez
who should be worried.

16:41.923 --> 16:44.800
And good solve
on the Reynolds case, guys.

16:44.926 --> 16:47.886
Next up, chief's office wants...

16:48.012 --> 16:51.139
Anything I can do to keep that
angry Irish off your ass, let me know.

16:51.808 --> 16:53.767
You're a real friend, Vince.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.772
Quinn's a good cop.
I need a good kiII.

16:58.898 --> 17:02.150
And sometimes one just faIIs
into your Iap.

17:06.489 --> 17:08.156
We've got a body in Kendall.

17:08.282 --> 17:09.866
Morgan, Quinn, you're up.

17:09.992 --> 17:12.411
And, Dexter, there's blood.
Lots of blood.

17:21.379 --> 17:23.422
Talk about your bloodbath.

17:23.548 --> 17:25.966
(Giggles)

17:26.676 --> 17:27.843
Tough room.

17:27.969 --> 17:31.054
OK, femoral artery severed.
She bled out in minutes.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.306
- Suicide?
- No weapon on the premises.

17:33.433 --> 17:35.600
Exactly. The coroner can suck
my uncircumcised dick

17:35.727 --> 17:36.893
if he doesn't rule this a homicide.

17:37.019 --> 17:38.895
That's way TMI, Masuka.

17:39.021 --> 17:42.107
Employment records show
she just got promoted to sous-chef.

17:42.233 --> 17:44.276
(Masuka) A total babe.
And she could cook.

17:44.402 --> 17:45.777
Had it all going on.

17:45.903 --> 17:47.779
Then this.

17:47.905 --> 17:51.116
It's a very well-organized crime scene.
The assailant took his time.

17:53.327 --> 17:55.537
Cleaned up after himself.

17:55.663 --> 17:57.414
ObviousIy doesn't have kids.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.332
Keep an eye on our expert witness.

17:59.459 --> 18:01.418
In case our girl's parents
actually want to see

18:01.544 --> 18:03.754
someone go to jail for doing this
to their daughter.

18:07.091 --> 18:08.633
Harsh.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.762
(Chatter over police radio)

18:15.266 --> 18:17.267
Christine Hill, Broward Journal dispatch.

18:17.393 --> 18:18.393
And?

18:18.519 --> 18:21.229
And was Ms. Bell the only victim?

18:22.607 --> 18:24.900
- Who gave you her name?
- I searched the address

18:25.026 --> 18:26.610
on this thing called the internet.

18:26.736 --> 18:28.987
Now, what can you tell me
about the murder?

18:29.113 --> 18:30.238
Suspects?

18:30.364 --> 18:32.157
Murder? Suspects?

18:32.283 --> 18:34.284
We still haven't officially
ruled out suicide.

18:35.119 --> 18:37.454
- So it was pills?
- No.

18:38.915 --> 18:42.250
Then she bled out. Women pretty much
only do one or the other.

18:42.376 --> 18:45.045
Do me a favor. You break this case
before we do, give me a call.

18:46.798 --> 18:49.049
It's Detective Joseph Quinn.

18:49.175 --> 18:52.135
Miami Metro, extension 3734.

18:55.807 --> 18:57.098
- Cell number?
- Mm.

18:57.225 --> 18:59.518
Nice touch, Joseph.

19:14.242 --> 19:15.534
Damn it.

19:15.660 --> 19:17.869
Can't anyone fill up the...

19:17.995 --> 19:20.205
fucking...water thing?

19:20.331 --> 19:22.249
(Chuckles)

19:22.375 --> 19:24.501
- Tough crime scene?
- No.

19:25.753 --> 19:28.171
Mm...kind of.

19:30.007 --> 19:31.341
Yes.

19:33.302 --> 19:34.719
You know, when things are going good,

19:34.846 --> 19:37.097
I think that's God's way
of saying to cover your ass,

19:37.223 --> 19:39.683
because something's gonna
jump up and bite it, hard.

19:40.768 --> 19:42.185
Well put.

19:42.311 --> 19:44.229
You and Anton doing OK?

19:44.355 --> 19:47.566
- Knock on wood.
- Any sign your ass is gonna get bit?

19:47.692 --> 19:48.775
None.

19:48.901 --> 19:50.861
So this is you just making yourself crazy?

19:50.987 --> 19:52.988
That's kind of what I do.

19:54.699 --> 19:55.740
What?

19:55.867 --> 19:58.201
It's just I've taken that trip
a thousand times before.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.662
- And?
- And knock it off.

20:01.581 --> 20:03.582
Is that an order, boss?

20:04.584 --> 20:07.294
Just some free advice from someone
who's been there before.

20:09.088 --> 20:12.924
Hey, did you ever go out with that guy
that Anton wanted you to meet?

20:13.050 --> 20:15.260
Musicians aren't really my thing.

20:15.386 --> 20:18.054
He owns a restaurant.
Three of 'em.

20:18.180 --> 20:20.223
Cuban restaurants.

20:20.349 --> 20:22.434
What the fuck is wrong
with musicians?

20:22.560 --> 20:24.060
That came out wrong.

20:24.186 --> 20:26.980
What makes you think
a Cuban restaurant matters?

20:28.232 --> 20:29.608
That came out wrong too.

20:30.860 --> 20:32.819
I'm not looking
for anyone new anyway.

20:32.945 --> 20:36.448
But when and if, I'll let you know.

20:37.575 --> 20:39.576
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

20:45.750 --> 20:47.417
(Yawns)

20:49.128 --> 20:51.504
FinaIIy. Peace and quiet.

20:51.631 --> 20:53.214
No crying baby.

20:53.341 --> 20:55.592
No Marco, no Polo.

20:56.427 --> 20:59.596
Just me...and blood.

21:10.733 --> 21:12.442
And Mr. Benito Gomez.

21:12.568 --> 21:15.904
Where to find a washed-up boxer
Iike you?

21:18.699 --> 21:20.492
Trailer park. Great.

21:20.618 --> 21:22.202
Kids, neighbors.

21:22.328 --> 21:23.995
More kids.

21:24.121 --> 21:25.455
Sounds Iike my world.

21:31.963 --> 21:33.838
But this...

21:33.965 --> 21:37.676
the onIy stiII open-for-business
estabIishment in a IoneIy strip maII?

21:37.802 --> 21:39.803
That's kind of caIIing to me.

21:40.429 --> 21:43.890
- This feels good.
- (Phone rings)

21:46.644 --> 21:47.686
Hey, you.

21:47.812 --> 21:49.604
Hey, Dex. You alone?

21:49.730 --> 21:50.939
Uh, yeah. Why?

21:51.065 --> 21:52.857
Well, Harrison won't go down
for his nap.

21:52.984 --> 21:54.693
Surprise, surprise.

21:54.819 --> 21:57.278
You think maybe
you could sing to him?

21:58.114 --> 21:59.406
You bet.

21:59.532 --> 22:02.117
OK. All right, we're gonna
put you on speaker.

22:02.243 --> 22:03.868
(Crying)

22:03.995 --> 22:09.791
Oh, beautiful for spacious skies

22:09.917 --> 22:14.087
For amber waves of grain
- Shh.

22:14.922 --> 22:19.843
For purple mountain majesty

22:19.969 --> 22:24.389
Above the fruited plain

22:24.515 --> 22:30.103
America, America, God...

22:31.022 --> 22:32.981
He's finally calming.

22:33.107 --> 22:35.692
Thank you, Dexter. We love you.

22:36.485 --> 22:37.819
Me too.

22:39.030 --> 22:41.448
First up today,
finish the Lisa Bell blood work.

22:41.574 --> 22:43.742
Tonight, a IittIe Benny Gomez recon.

22:43.868 --> 22:45.994
Then go home and sing
the last 95 verses

22:46.120 --> 22:49.289
of America the Beautiful to my baby son.

22:49.415 --> 22:53.001
Who knew Iife couId get so...
unsimple?

22:54.712 --> 22:57.464
I can deal. I can deal.

23:06.474 --> 23:08.558
Yo, Quinn. Boobs plus drinks equals...

23:08.684 --> 23:10.643
Titty bar. Can't. Got a date.

23:10.770 --> 23:12.312
(Sighs)

23:12.438 --> 23:14.230
Ah. How about you, Morgan?

23:14.356 --> 23:16.107
Stud muffin still out of town?

23:16.233 --> 23:18.943
It's tempting, Masuka. And elegant.

23:19.070 --> 23:21.071
Fuck off and die.
Then die again.

23:21.197 --> 23:22.906
So that's a no.

23:23.032 --> 23:25.533
- I am feeling no love here, folks.
- Then it's working.

23:25.659 --> 23:27.786
Hey, slacker. Half-day?

23:27.912 --> 23:30.205
This is me leaving, Vince.
I do it every day.

23:30.331 --> 23:32.874
But every day wasn't like today.
What you went through? Come on.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.292
Drinks are on me. It'll cheer you up!

23:34.418 --> 23:36.669
- I'm not uncheered.
- Yeah?

23:36.796 --> 23:38.004
Tell that to your face.

23:38.130 --> 23:41.132
- I'm going home to my family.
- Vastly overrated.

23:41.258 --> 23:42.675
Just got a call from Robbery.

23:42.802 --> 23:44.928
Some guy on his honeymoon
took a shot in the head.

23:45.054 --> 23:47.472
Grave condition.
They're pulling the plug tomorrow.

23:47.598 --> 23:49.015
Nice fucking wedding gift.

23:49.141 --> 23:52.310
(Sighs) Yeah. The file is gonna land
on my desk first thing in the morning.

23:52.436 --> 23:53.978
And Robbery's got squat.

23:54.105 --> 23:55.772
It's gonna be a total goat fuck.

23:55.898 --> 23:57.774
It sounds like you need a drink, papi.

23:57.900 --> 23:58.983
You know what, Vince?

23:59.110 --> 24:01.319
I can use a Cuervo. Or ten.

24:01.445 --> 24:04.239
(Giggling)

24:28.973 --> 24:31.850
My dark passenger
is Iike a trapped coaI miner,

24:31.976 --> 24:34.018
aIways tapping,
aIways Ietting me know

24:34.145 --> 24:36.521
it's still in there, still alive.

24:38.399 --> 24:41.860
Quinn's Iegwork may have shown me
where to find our friend,

24:41.986 --> 24:43.695
but this, Benny -

24:43.821 --> 24:46.990
my bIood work is the stuff
that seaIs your fate.

24:47.116 --> 24:49.450
(Music and chatter inside bar)

24:59.295 --> 25:01.504
No security cameras.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.507
Parks away from the lights.

25:04.633 --> 25:08.261
You just come and go
as you please.

25:09.638 --> 25:13.516
But as of tomorrow night,
those days are over.

25:22.818 --> 25:25.028
I wasn't sure you'd actually come by.

25:28.157 --> 25:30.742
Put in my face time with Masuka.

25:30.868 --> 25:33.244
And then I came to where
I really wanted to be.

25:40.211 --> 25:41.836
Tell me again this isn't crazy.

25:41.962 --> 25:44.380
Yeah, it's crazy.

25:45.633 --> 25:47.717
Crazy good.

25:57.436 --> 25:59.479
(Both laughing)

26:06.403 --> 26:07.654
Keep shooting.

26:07.780 --> 26:09.906
He's so sweet
when he's sleeping.

26:13.410 --> 26:16.037
We were all like that once.

26:16.163 --> 26:17.997
Pure and innocent.

26:18.123 --> 26:21.292
But then we grow up...

26:21.418 --> 26:23.253
and things happen.

26:24.630 --> 26:27.090
Well, nothing's going to happen.

26:27.216 --> 26:30.468
Not when he has a great dad
watching over him.

26:30.594 --> 26:32.553
Yeah, he's a lucky guy.

26:32.680 --> 26:35.014
(   Loud pop music plays)

26:35.140 --> 26:38.559
- (Sighs)
- (Harrison wails)

26:39.687 --> 26:41.145
Astor!

26:42.022 --> 26:43.982
- Mom!
- Turn that down.

26:44.108 --> 26:45.942
We wouldn't have this problem
if you would just get me--

26:46.068 --> 26:48.653
This is not how you go about
getting an iPod.

26:48.779 --> 26:50.071
Now, since you woke your brother up,

26:50.197 --> 26:52.448
you can walk him around the living room
until he falls asleep.

26:52.574 --> 26:55.910
- But he never sleeps.
- Think about that next time.

27:00.749 --> 27:02.458
There we go.

27:03.627 --> 27:06.004
You'd like an iPod,
wouldn't you, little Harrison?

27:08.757 --> 27:10.883
Why not just end the terror
and give her an iPod?

27:11.010 --> 27:12.176
Mm-mm.

27:12.303 --> 27:13.678
No, it's a power play.

27:13.804 --> 27:16.264
She's trying to manipulate us
to get what she wants.

27:16.390 --> 27:20.184
- That's not how it works in this family.
- Oh, right. Of course.

27:21.979 --> 27:24.355
Cody. No more Marco Polo
in the mornings.

27:24.481 --> 27:26.983
- But it's important.
- So is being ready for school.

27:27.776 --> 27:29.694
When I grow up,
I want to be just like you.

27:29.820 --> 27:32.030
Do what I want when I want.

27:32.156 --> 27:33.614
You and me both.

27:33.741 --> 27:35.325
And I want to be just like you.

27:35.951 --> 27:37.577
(Growls) Marco!

27:37.703 --> 27:39.037
Polo!

27:52.217 --> 27:54.218
Great time last night, huh, Angel?

27:57.556 --> 27:58.723
What?

27:58.849 --> 28:01.184
You could've totally fucked
that stripper.

28:03.437 --> 28:05.355
(Elevator dings)

28:06.315 --> 28:08.149
Get to work, gentlemen.

28:10.611 --> 28:12.278
What got into her?

28:28.962 --> 28:32.590
What is this? Extreme Home Makeover:
Forensics Edition?

28:32.716 --> 28:36.094
The first pass through, I found some blood
that didn't belong to the victim.

28:36.220 --> 28:38.096
Possible DNA from the killer?

28:38.222 --> 28:40.264
Don't think so.
The sample was pretty degraded.

28:40.391 --> 28:41.474
Then what's the source?

28:41.600 --> 28:43.601
Not sure. Yet.

28:43.727 --> 28:46.437
Coming from you,
why does that not surprise me?

28:46.563 --> 28:47.939
You know he's my brother, right?

28:48.065 --> 28:49.899
Found something. Mr. Morgan.

28:50.025 --> 28:51.025
Hmm?

28:54.071 --> 28:55.238
It's blood.

28:58.575 --> 29:01.119
Pool pattern, not incidental spatter
from the recent murder.

29:01.245 --> 29:03.079
This is something else entirely.

29:03.205 --> 29:05.206
Where's it from?

29:06.458 --> 29:08.126
Bathtub.

29:08.252 --> 29:11.587
So you're taking an already
extremely difficult case

29:11.713 --> 29:13.965
and polluting it with your, what, theories?

29:14.091 --> 29:16.676
- I didn't put the blood there.
- And according to you, neither did our killer.

29:16.802 --> 29:20.471
Joey, why don't we step outside,
let the geeks get their geek on?

29:20.597 --> 29:24.100
Look, I gotta be somewhere, so see if
you can hold things down around here

29:24.226 --> 29:26.686
without going all asshole
on my brother, OK?

29:41.785 --> 29:44.287
BIood teIIs. BIood aIways teIIs.

29:53.130 --> 29:54.964
Dexter.

29:55.090 --> 29:57.467
How's my favorite blood spatter analyst?

29:57.593 --> 29:59.177
(Chuckles) Uh, great.

29:59.303 --> 30:01.721
How's my favorite serial killer hunter?

30:03.140 --> 30:04.974
Uh, you just missed Deb.

30:05.100 --> 30:07.643
Actually, I'm here to see you.

30:07.769 --> 30:08.811
Oh.

30:08.937 --> 30:11.189
Database has a girl
killed here recently.

30:11.315 --> 30:13.483
Severed femoral artery?

30:13.609 --> 30:15.318
Pretty brutal.

30:18.363 --> 30:19.906
Crime scene telling you anything?

30:20.657 --> 30:21.824
Not much.

30:23.952 --> 30:26.162
Killer was careful, right?

30:26.288 --> 30:28.915
- Immaculate.
- Very.

30:30.876 --> 30:34.337
Well, you're in the middle of
something here. I don't want to interrupt.

30:36.006 --> 30:38.090
Mind if I drop by the station later?

30:38.842 --> 30:40.593
Sure, not a problem.

30:43.055 --> 30:44.805
Good seeing you again, Dexter.

30:50.312 --> 30:51.854
Shit.

31:08.247 --> 31:10.039
(Doorbell rings)

31:10.165 --> 31:12.667
Hello, Detective.
Won't you come in?

31:14.586 --> 31:17.004
I'm here to talk about Harry Morgan.

31:17.130 --> 31:19.549
I'm his daughter, Debra.

31:19.675 --> 31:21.676
Debra Morgan.

31:24.596 --> 31:27.390
Handsome Harry Morgan.
How is he?

31:28.892 --> 31:30.309
He died a while back.

31:33.689 --> 31:35.523
Life does tend to suck.

31:36.567 --> 31:39.235
Did you and my father have...

31:42.155 --> 31:43.656
a good relationship?

31:45.242 --> 31:46.742
Well...

31:49.413 --> 31:52.039
Your father was a driven man.

31:52.165 --> 31:55.084
He saw something he wanted,
nothing got in his way.

31:56.503 --> 31:57.962
You're talking about women?

31:58.088 --> 32:00.089
Women. Bad guys.

32:00.215 --> 32:01.591
Anything.

32:02.593 --> 32:03.926
Anyone.

32:05.220 --> 32:09.223
Harry always said the only word
that wasn't in his vocabulary was "no".

32:10.934 --> 32:13.978
- Did you say no to him?
- Dear.

32:14.104 --> 32:16.397
I said yes.

32:17.941 --> 32:20.151
All the time.

32:20.277 --> 32:23.321
Shit, hundreds of times.

32:25.616 --> 32:27.617
Only problem was...

32:31.455 --> 32:33.080
Only problem was what?

32:36.752 --> 32:39.629
I was saying yes to a question
he never asked.

32:41.423 --> 32:43.799
So you didn't have an affair
with my father?

32:45.135 --> 32:49.096
I don't know who you're looking for,
honey, but it ain't me.

32:59.566 --> 33:01.692
Shut down for decades. Way out of town.

33:01.818 --> 33:03.861
I'm liking this.

33:04.655 --> 33:07.865
Broken-down boxer,
broken-down arena.

33:07.991 --> 33:12.828
A fitting pIace for a punk Iike Benny Gomez
to go down for the count.

33:19.628 --> 33:21.420
(Batista) Where you been?

33:21.546 --> 33:24.048
Oh. Looking for misery.

33:24.174 --> 33:26.884
- No upside to that.
- So I'm fucking learning.

33:28.011 --> 33:31.430
That's all we got on the groom.
Plug was pulled 4:45 this morning.

33:31.556 --> 33:33.307
- It's all yours.
- (Sighs)

33:34.017 --> 33:36.894
A man's life and death,
reduced to a few...

33:37.020 --> 33:38.020
What do you call 'em?

33:38.146 --> 33:40.523
- Bytes.
- A few bytes. Just like that.

33:40.649 --> 33:43.609
This economy, last thing
our city needs is dead tourists.

33:43.735 --> 33:46.654
Hey, welcome to Miami.
Have a nice day.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.698
Is that our tourist, Sergeant?

33:48.824 --> 33:50.199
- It is, Lieutenant.
- OK.

33:50.325 --> 33:53.411
The mayor's already given me an aneurysm
over this one, so make it a quick solve.

33:53.537 --> 33:54.662
OK.

33:57.374 --> 34:00.835
So whatever happened between you
and that Barbara Gianna from Vice?

34:00.961 --> 34:02.795
We broke up.

34:02.921 --> 34:04.672
Wanted different things.

34:04.798 --> 34:07.466
Office romances.
Doomed before they fucking start.

34:07.592 --> 34:09.844
- You mind if I ask her out?
- Knock yourself out.

34:33.326 --> 34:36.328
The perfect husband would've
gotten rid of his oId apartment.

34:36.455 --> 34:38.080
But I kiII peopIe.

34:38.206 --> 34:40.916
Not exactIy the perfect husband.

34:47.048 --> 34:49.049
Someone new is moving in.

34:50.552 --> 34:52.553
Be nice.

35:41.228 --> 35:46.148
The land that time
and FIorida EIectric forgot.

36:00.914 --> 36:02.623
Look at this pIace.

36:02.749 --> 36:05.084
AII the cheering, aII the triumph,

36:05.210 --> 36:07.294
all the blood.

36:07.420 --> 36:08.879
All for sport.

36:10.590 --> 36:12.424
UntiI tonight.

36:45.041 --> 36:48.210
(Music and chatter inside bar)

36:49.880 --> 36:52.715
Keep at it, Benny,
and you'II be feeIing no pain.

36:54.801 --> 36:56.343
Better that way.

37:09.190 --> 37:10.900
(Snoring)

37:20.911 --> 37:23.287
Tell me you got a reason
for sleeping alone in your car

37:23.413 --> 37:25.539
outside a bar
other than you're drunk.

37:26.750 --> 37:28.125
I'm tired.

37:28.251 --> 37:31.378
License and registration, please.

37:38.219 --> 37:41.263
Sorry about this, Officer.
This is not what it looks like.

37:43.558 --> 37:45.976
- You're with Homicide?
- Yes, sir.

37:46.102 --> 37:49.271
Then you ought to know better.
Get out of the car, please.

37:55.028 --> 37:56.487
You know your ABCs?

37:57.530 --> 38:00.032
- Of course I do.
- Give me 'em backwards.

38:01.993 --> 38:06.455
Uh...Z, Y, X, W...

38:07.999 --> 38:11.251
V, U, T, S, R, Q,

38:12.754 --> 38:16.507
- P, O, N, M, L, K...
- Clearly you're not drunk.

38:16.633 --> 38:17.675
Yet.

38:17.801 --> 38:20.469
- (Sighs)
- (Engine revving)

38:21.680 --> 38:22.846
Damn it, Benny.

38:22.973 --> 38:25.849
I can't go chasing after you
with a cop up my ass.

38:25.976 --> 38:29.895
You got more important places
to be, Mr. Morgan.

38:31.648 --> 38:34.400
(Sighs) Tell me about it.

38:42.742 --> 38:44.368
Hey.

38:44.494 --> 38:46.495
I thought you were working late.

38:47.372 --> 38:50.207
- So did I.
- Mm.

38:50.333 --> 38:51.709
Baby's down.

38:51.835 --> 38:53.502
You know what that means?

38:53.628 --> 38:56.255
- Mm. Sleep.
- Sex.

38:57.799 --> 39:00.342
- Oh.
- And I'm not talking the rushed, frantic,

39:00.468 --> 39:02.386
- the-kids-are-asleep sex.
- (Unzipping)

39:02.512 --> 39:06.098
But slow, hot, steamy,
naughty sex.

39:06.224 --> 39:08.684
Look, if you're too tired...

39:11.021 --> 39:12.396
(Moans)

39:12.522 --> 39:16.567
Dexter, ever since the move
and the baby,

39:16.693 --> 39:19.236
- we've had, like, zero time together.
- Yeah.

39:19.362 --> 39:22.156
I mean, aren't you
as horny as I am?

39:23.658 --> 39:24.700
Course I am.

39:26.536 --> 39:30.414
All right. Well, just close your eyes.

39:33.835 --> 39:36.336
Maybe I can squeeze in a power nap.

39:36.463 --> 39:37.921
OK, open.

39:41.384 --> 39:42.801
Or not.

39:42.927 --> 39:46.388
I was saving these for when we finally
got some real time alone.

39:47.640 --> 39:48.849
And...

39:52.520 --> 39:55.439
And tonight's the night.

39:55.565 --> 39:57.066
Mm.

39:57.776 --> 39:58.734
(She giggles)

39:58.860 --> 40:00.152
Oh. Ha-ha...

40:00.278 --> 40:01.904
(She giggles)

40:06.576 --> 40:09.119
(Harrison cries)

40:09.245 --> 40:11.747
- (Dexter) Oh...
- Mm.

40:11.873 --> 40:13.582
It's all right. I'll go.

40:15.668 --> 40:17.753
You've already done so much.

40:19.422 --> 40:22.341
- (Crying)
- Oh, it's OK. Who's a good boy?

40:27.764 --> 40:30.682
Yeah, who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

40:31.601 --> 40:33.227
Yeah.

40:41.319 --> 40:43.320
(Whispering) Want to know a secret?

40:46.699 --> 40:48.700
Daddy kills people.

40:51.871 --> 40:53.580
Well, bad people.

40:56.167 --> 40:59.920
Not really anybody else
I can tell about that, you know?

41:07.762 --> 41:10.139
Daddy's not going anywhere, buddy.

41:14.060 --> 41:17.604
I've already lost my innocence.
I'm not going to sacrifice yours too.

41:31.119 --> 41:34.204
- Triple red-eye, please.
- That's your third one today, bro.

41:34.330 --> 41:37.499
You don't cut back,
you're tempting the heart gods.

41:37.625 --> 41:39.626
Least of my worries.

41:40.295 --> 41:41.545
Bro.

41:41.671 --> 41:43.589
Brought you a copy of my article.

41:43.715 --> 41:45.632
Figured you're a dumb cop
and don't read the paper.

41:45.758 --> 41:48.260
Give me some credit.
I never miss the obituaries.

41:48.386 --> 41:51.638
- Front page. Nice.
- I do what I can.

41:51.764 --> 41:54.224
My editor OK'd a follow-up.
You got anything for me?

41:54.350 --> 41:56.018
I would if I could, but I got nothing.

41:56.144 --> 41:57.895
- Hmm.
- Besides, off the record,

41:58.021 --> 42:00.272
we, uh, got bigger fish to fry.

42:00.398 --> 42:02.024
What kind of fish?

42:03.193 --> 42:04.943
Off the record.

42:05.069 --> 42:07.613
You know those pricks who've been
shaking down tourists?

42:07.739 --> 42:10.532
- The Vacation Robbers?
- No, the Vacation Murderers.

42:10.658 --> 42:13.076
They shot some poor newlywed.
Didn't make it.

42:13.203 --> 42:16.496
So...we're more than
a little distracted.

42:18.041 --> 42:20.834
You want another distraction,
I'd love to take you out for a drink.

42:20.960 --> 42:24.755
You know, to thank you
for your help...

42:24.881 --> 42:28.425
- with the bathtub story.
- Uh-huh.

42:28.551 --> 42:30.594
Uh-uh. I am so not hitting on you.

42:30.720 --> 42:33.013
Yeah, me neither.
Let's make it dinner.

42:39.062 --> 42:40.938
I got the blood work back
from our bathroom do-over.

42:41.064 --> 42:42.981
- Did you run it through the database?
- No point.

42:43.107 --> 42:45.275
The blood you swabbed
showed shit-all on the DNA front.

42:45.401 --> 42:47.277
Our chances of finding out
who it belongs to

42:47.403 --> 42:49.821
are about, oh,
one in six fucking billion.

42:51.741 --> 42:54.117
What was Lisa Bell's address?

42:54.244 --> 42:56.620
1578 Glencoe. Why?

42:56.746 --> 42:58.163
Well...

42:58.289 --> 43:02.125
if the DNA won't tell us who it
belonged to, maybe the address will.

43:02.252 --> 43:04.127
(Masuka) 1578 Glencoe.

43:04.254 --> 43:06.964
April 1 1th, 1979. Homicide.

43:07.090 --> 43:08.757
1979?

43:12.679 --> 43:14.805
(Dexter) Vicky Noonan, 22.

43:14.931 --> 43:16.848
Found in the bathtub.

43:16.975 --> 43:19.434
Bled out. Incision to her thigh.

43:19.560 --> 43:21.812
What are the chances of that?

43:21.938 --> 43:24.940
What are the chances of what?

43:25.066 --> 43:26.566
Special Agent Lundy.

43:26.693 --> 43:28.819
Vincent Masuka, if memory serves.

43:30.238 --> 43:31.822
That's right.

43:31.948 --> 43:34.199
LFI on the BHB.

43:34.325 --> 43:36.368
- Heh.
- You're working a case, right?

43:36.494 --> 43:39.371
- Feds need us to...
- Mind if I speak with Dexter?

43:40.790 --> 43:43.834
Uh...I'll go, uh, to Records

43:43.960 --> 43:46.086
and get the write-up on Noonan.

43:47.130 --> 43:48.797
Just doing myjob.

43:54.304 --> 43:57.055
- He's right, you know.
- About?

43:57.181 --> 44:00.142
Why I'm in Miami. It is a case.

44:00.268 --> 44:02.686
Yeah, I figured.

44:02.812 --> 44:06.106
But why do you need me?
You have the full resources of the FBI.

44:07.066 --> 44:09.693
Not any more. I'm retired.

44:09.819 --> 44:13.155
Oh. Their loss.

44:13.698 --> 44:15.198
Yeah, well.

44:15.325 --> 44:16.992
I fish. Travel.

44:17.118 --> 44:19.161
And, uh...

44:19.287 --> 44:22.664
now I have the time to track down
the one twisted son of a bitch who got away.

44:23.458 --> 44:26.752
So who is the twisted son of a bitch?

44:26.878 --> 44:29.504
I call him the Trinity Killer.

44:30.590 --> 44:31.840
Kills in threes.

44:31.966 --> 44:34.301
Been doing it all over
the country for years.

44:34.427 --> 44:37.304
Problem is,
I can't prove he exists.

44:37.430 --> 44:40.015
Law enforcement
doesn't talk to each other.

44:40.141 --> 44:42.684
So no one at the FBI
is even on board.

44:44.187 --> 44:45.228
Just me.

44:45.355 --> 44:48.231
I've been looking for a break.
Then this happens.

44:48.358 --> 44:49.649
Lisa Bell.

44:49.776 --> 44:53.445
Her murder profile
fits the previous victims.

44:54.530 --> 44:56.948
Trinity's in Miami, Dexter.

44:57.075 --> 44:59.159
Starting his cycle all over again.

44:59.285 --> 45:01.912
- (Water splashing)
- (Man, muffled) No... No...

45:02.038 --> 45:04.122
No!

45:05.666 --> 45:06.958
No...

45:07.085 --> 45:09.086
How far back do your cases go?

45:09.212 --> 45:11.004
About 15 years.

45:11.714 --> 45:16.259
The house and room
where Lisa Bell was murdered

45:16.386 --> 45:20.389
was the site of a very similar homicide
30 years ago.

45:20.515 --> 45:22.099
Take a look.

45:22.225 --> 45:25.060
- (Water splashing)
- (Man sobbing)

45:25.186 --> 45:29.064
No... No...

45:29.899 --> 45:32.901
We've come full circle.
He's back where his killing began.

45:33.528 --> 45:35.612
Whew. 30 years.

45:35.738 --> 45:37.155
You know what this means?

45:38.199 --> 45:42.452
Trinity's the most
successful serial killer to ever...

45:42.578 --> 45:44.413
get away with it.

45:52.630 --> 45:54.673
(Hissing)

45:58.136 --> 46:01.471
(Moaning)

46:03.558 --> 46:05.684
(Screaming)

46:07.520 --> 46:11.106
What? I'm fine.
I can't wait to see you.

46:15.736 --> 46:18.071
Anton, I have to go.
I have a meeting.

46:22.076 --> 46:23.743
Hello, Debra.

46:25.788 --> 46:27.414
Motherfucking fuck.

46:27.540 --> 46:29.624
(Chuckles)

46:29.750 --> 46:31.668
Nice to see you too.

46:31.794 --> 46:33.170
What are...

46:34.547 --> 46:36.840
What... What are you doing here?

46:36.966 --> 46:38.592
Are you here on a case?

46:40.136 --> 46:41.970
Actually, I'm retired now.

46:42.972 --> 46:45.307
Yet you're here.

46:45.433 --> 46:49.936
Life has a natural forward momentum.
Certain things are inevitable.

46:52.023 --> 46:53.940
Like you.

46:54.859 --> 46:56.485
Making detective.

46:57.195 --> 46:59.237
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

46:59.363 --> 47:02.407
- I never had any doubt.
- (Chuckles)

47:03.534 --> 47:08.121
So how long will your forward momentum
keep you in Miami?

47:09.248 --> 47:10.624
Not sure exactly.

47:15.671 --> 47:18.840
- Be seeing you.
- Yeah.

47:20.009 --> 47:22.677
I guess. Maybe.
I mean, I don't... I don't know.

47:40.696 --> 47:43.406
Big plans this evening, Sergeant?

47:43.533 --> 47:45.492
The usual, Lieutenant.

47:46.494 --> 47:48.537
(Elevator dings)

47:57.463 --> 47:58.463
Oh.

47:58.589 --> 48:00.590
- Hey, guys.
- (LaGuerta) Hey.

48:02.009 --> 48:03.718
Drinks?

48:06.556 --> 48:09.641
I had Benny Gomez on the ropes
and Iet him sIip away.

48:09.767 --> 48:11.434
No way I can go to that bar again.

48:11.561 --> 48:14.062
Officer Alphabet made sure of that.

48:14.188 --> 48:16.773
Which means I grab Benny
where he lives.

48:16.899 --> 48:19.484
A higher degree of difficuIty,
but l don't have a choice.

48:20.236 --> 48:23.488
If I want to be around for my son,
I have to do this right.

48:23.614 --> 48:26.199
I'm...kiIIing for two now.

48:28.536 --> 48:31.288
(Man speaking Spanish on TV)

48:50.850 --> 48:53.893
- The fuck you want?
- You.

49:07.491 --> 49:10.702
Look at him. Fast asIeep.

49:10.828 --> 49:12.621
Lucky guy.

49:18.336 --> 49:19.878
(Sniffs)

49:36.520 --> 49:38.521
I know you.

49:38.648 --> 49:41.232
(Muffled)

49:42.276 --> 49:43.735
I'm the blood guy.

50:03.714 --> 50:07.175
You've made a lot of people
very miserable.

50:08.177 --> 50:09.928
Me included.

50:13.891 --> 50:15.725
Till now.

50:15.851 --> 50:18.186
Oh...

50:20.690 --> 50:23.983
Because now I get to answer
Iife's big question.

50:24.110 --> 50:25.485
My Iife, anyway.

50:31.492 --> 50:34.536
Can I do it? Can I have it all?

50:35.246 --> 50:36.913
(Cell phone rings)

50:37.039 --> 50:38.289
Oh, shit.

50:38.416 --> 50:39.916
(Ringing continues)

50:43.754 --> 50:45.046
Hello?

50:45.172 --> 50:47.632
Dexter, I need you to go to
an all-night pharmacy right away.

50:47.758 --> 50:49.592
I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

50:49.719 --> 50:53.096
Well, Harrison has an ear infection.
He's in a lot of pain, Dexter.

50:53.222 --> 50:54.681
Whatever you're doing can wait.

50:55.975 --> 50:58.143
Uh, right. My mistake.
I wasn't thinking.

50:58.269 --> 51:00.145
I'm on my way.

51:02.106 --> 51:03.231
Kids.

51:10.531 --> 51:12.115
Gotta go.

51:12.241 --> 51:14.743
No time to savor this.

51:14.869 --> 51:16.453
Clock's ticking.

51:16.579 --> 51:18.121
But it's all about sacrifice.

51:18.247 --> 51:20.415
- (Muffled scream)
- For the good of the family.

51:20.541 --> 51:22.584
(Muffled scream)

51:42.813 --> 51:44.147
Shit!

52:09.298 --> 52:10.882
Maybe tonight wasn't perfect.

52:11.008 --> 52:13.927
Maybe I need to reboot
the way I do things.

52:17.306 --> 52:19.474
But at Ieast I'm on the right road.

52:20.643 --> 52:23.102
I'm on my way
to taking care of my famiIy,

52:24.605 --> 52:26.648
And all the while
doing what I have to do

52:26.774 --> 52:29.776
to satisfy a caIIing
that I can't ignore...

52:31.904 --> 52:33.363
or deny.

52:35.115 --> 52:36.658
l can do this.

52:41.872 --> 52:43.498
Dexter!

52:45.793 --> 52:47.627
You don't need to sleep!

52:50.589 --> 52:53.007
You need to wake up!
