00:02.049 --> 00:03.675
PreviousIy on Dexter.

00:03.801 --> 00:05.051
(Dexter) Dexter Morgan.

00:05.177 --> 00:06.761
Good suburban husband.

00:06.887 --> 00:08.596
Happy father of three.

00:08.722 --> 00:10.306
Living the dream.

00:10.432 --> 00:12.100
Want to know a secret?

00:12.226 --> 00:14.310
Daddy kills people.

00:15.729 --> 00:18.439
I'm halfway through
the CI files you gave me.

00:18.565 --> 00:20.983
Maybe then I'll finally
get some answers.

00:22.403 --> 00:25.405
- Tell me again this isn't crazy.
- Crazy good.

00:26.657 --> 00:28.950
Some guy on his honeymoon
took a shot in the head.

00:29.076 --> 00:31.452
Grave condition.
They're pulling the plug tomorrow.

00:31.578 --> 00:33.413
Last thing our city needs
is dead tourists.

00:33.539 --> 00:35.373
Brought you a copy of my article.

00:35.499 --> 00:37.875
My editor OK'd a follow-up.
You got anything for me?

00:38.001 --> 00:40.420
I'd love to take you out for a drink.

00:40.546 --> 00:42.255
Let's make it dinner.

00:46.135 --> 00:47.468
Dexter.

00:47.594 --> 00:50.138
How's my favorite serial killer hunter?

00:50.264 --> 00:54.142
- Are you here on a case?
- Actually I'm retired now.

00:54.268 --> 00:57.979
Now I have the time to track down
the one twisted son of a bitch who got away.

00:58.772 --> 01:02.483
So who is the twisted son of a bitch?

01:02.609 --> 01:06.320
I call him the Trinity Killer.
Kills in threes.

01:06.447 --> 01:08.781
Been doing it all over
the country for years.

01:08.907 --> 01:10.950
Trinity's in Miami, Dexter,

01:11.076 --> 01:13.035
starting his cycle all over again.

01:13.162 --> 01:16.998
Vicky Noonan, 22,
found in the bathtub.

01:17.124 --> 01:18.875
1979?

01:19.001 --> 01:20.501
But this is the Gomez hearing.

01:20.627 --> 01:22.003
Yes, Mr. Morgan.

01:22.129 --> 01:25.882
- The defendant's name is Benito Gomez.
- I must've brought the wrong notes.

01:26.008 --> 01:28.009
- Wrong notes, wrong blood type...
- Oh, fuck.

01:28.135 --> 01:31.679
..wrong case. That's what you call
a momentary mix-up in a murder trial?

01:31.805 --> 01:33.681
That asshole you let walk?

01:33.807 --> 01:36.642
- Benito Gomez.
- Ah, now you get it right.

01:36.769 --> 01:40.021
Quinn's Iegwork may have shown me
where to find our friend,

01:40.147 --> 01:41.522
but this, Benny -

01:41.648 --> 01:44.984
my bIoodwork is the stuff
that seaIs your fate.

01:45.319 --> 01:47.862
- The fuck you want?
- You.

01:47.988 --> 01:50.114
Shut down for decades.
Way out of town.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.533
A fitting pIace for a punk
Iike Benny Gomez

01:52.659 --> 01:55.244
to go down for the count.

02:01.543 --> 02:04.045
Tonight's the night I finaIIy...

02:04.171 --> 02:05.922
sIeep.

04:06.543 --> 04:08.669
(Man) Hang in there, buddy. We got you.

04:08.795 --> 04:11.297
(Sirens, radio chatter)

04:51.630 --> 04:53.339
(Woman) Do you know where you are?

04:53.465 --> 04:56.384
- Ambulance. What happened?
- You were in an accident.

04:56.510 --> 04:58.386
(Muffled scream)

04:58.512 --> 05:01.430
Benny. Benny. Benny.

05:14.361 --> 05:16.946
Sir, we found something in your car.

05:19.241 --> 05:21.200
Benny Gomez is in there.

05:21.868 --> 05:24.370
- You're OK.
- A bag.

05:25.998 --> 05:27.999
Says, uh, "pediatric" on it.

05:28.125 --> 05:31.293
Thought you might need
to take it with you.

05:32.713 --> 05:36.298
- Where are they taking my car?
- Just relax. They'll take care of it.

05:36.425 --> 05:38.718
I have no idea where it's going.

05:38.844 --> 05:39.760
lf someone...

05:39.886 --> 05:42.430
When someone finds
what's in back...

05:44.349 --> 05:45.599
It's never as bad as it looks.

05:45.726 --> 05:47.768
Oh, I'm pretty sure this is worse.

05:47.894 --> 05:49.895
(Siren wails)

05:55.235 --> 05:57.862
- (Man) What's your name?
- Dexter Morgan.

05:57.988 --> 06:00.114
You know who the president is?

06:00.240 --> 06:01.657
Barack Obama.

06:02.534 --> 06:06.120
Your pupils are dilating normally,
which is the good news.

06:06.246 --> 06:08.789
Bad news is that you've
sustained a concussion.

06:08.915 --> 06:11.125
What's the last thing
you remember?

06:13.920 --> 06:15.463
Working late.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.340
My wife...

06:18.467 --> 06:20.968
asked me to pick up some
medicine for our son.

06:21.094 --> 06:22.887
He's been sick.

06:23.013 --> 06:25.806
I haven't been sleeping well.
I must have dozed off at the wheel.

06:25.932 --> 06:28.976
- So you don't remember the accident?
- No.

06:29.102 --> 06:31.187
I don't even remember getting
in the car.

06:31.313 --> 06:34.273
Short-term memory loss is common
for this type of injury.

06:34.399 --> 06:37.985
Can also affect yourjudgment,
cause confusion, disorientation.

06:38.111 --> 06:40.071
I just need a good night's sleep, I think.

06:40.197 --> 06:41.781
Not for the next 12 hours.

06:41.907 --> 06:44.992
Any type of head trauma,
we want to keep the patient awake.

06:45.118 --> 06:46.619
I'd like to keep you here
for observation.

06:46.745 --> 06:48.704
- Not an option.
- Mmm.

06:48.830 --> 06:51.457
My wife's a registered nurse.
She'll keep an eye on me.

06:51.583 --> 06:54.668
You got whacked pretty good, Mr. Morgan.
You need to be monitored.

06:54.795 --> 06:57.797
I'll get your admission paperwork going.
Be right back.

07:02.010 --> 07:03.761
Dexter! Oh, my God!

07:03.887 --> 07:05.554
- (Grunts)
- Are you all right?

07:05.680 --> 07:07.681
I'm fine. It's just a little fender bender.

07:07.808 --> 07:10.601
The nurse said they brought you
in an ambulance. An ambulance, Dexter.

07:10.727 --> 07:14.188
No, it's just a liability thing.
Doc says I'm good to go.

07:14.314 --> 07:17.691
(Sighs) I raced over here. Look at me.

07:17.818 --> 07:20.027
I'm wearing two different shoes.

07:20.153 --> 07:22.655
Sure you're OK? You look so pale.

07:22.781 --> 07:24.490
(Scoffs) Hospitals.

07:24.616 --> 07:27.910
They give me the creeps,
which is why I want to get out of here.

07:28.787 --> 07:30.329
I was so scared.

07:32.666 --> 07:34.834
It's OK. I'm fine.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.211
Come on. Let's go.

07:37.337 --> 07:40.005
I got to get ready for work.

07:40.132 --> 07:43.050
Aspirin, caffeine,
whatever it takes.

07:43.176 --> 07:45.261
lf l fall asleep, it's over.

07:45.387 --> 07:46.637
And I'm not taIking concussion.

07:46.763 --> 07:50.224
If they find Benny in my car,
it's IethaI injection time.

07:50.350 --> 07:53.727
Cody, you butt-breath,
stay away from my stuff!

07:54.312 --> 07:57.398
If ever there was a reason
to take a personal day, this is it.

07:57.524 --> 07:58.858
I'm OK.

07:58.984 --> 08:00.901
But I love having someone
to worry about me.

08:01.027 --> 08:03.863
Good, 'cause that's exactly
what I'm doing.

08:05.365 --> 08:08.075
- Who else needs a kiss?
- I'm good.

08:08.201 --> 08:09.827
How about a hug?

08:11.204 --> 08:13.998
- Oh!
- What's the matter?

08:14.124 --> 08:16.834
Uh, just a little sore
from the accident still.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.836
You got in an accident?

08:18.962 --> 08:20.171
Anyone die?

08:20.297 --> 08:23.841
Just a little fender bender.
No one died.

08:23.967 --> 08:25.593
(Horn honks)

08:25.719 --> 08:26.927
There's my cab.

08:27.053 --> 08:28.429
Dexter, why can't you just call in?

08:28.555 --> 08:30.431
And what? Take a vacation day?

08:30.557 --> 08:32.892
I'd rather do that
when we can all go to Disney World.

08:33.018 --> 08:34.226
Disney World!

08:35.604 --> 08:36.770
(Horn honks)

08:36.897 --> 08:37.938
I'm fine.

08:38.064 --> 08:39.732
I gotta go to work.

08:41.193 --> 08:44.612
And I need one sIow day at the job
where nobody gets murdered.

08:44.738 --> 08:47.281
I aIready have a kiIIer
to clean up after.

08:47.407 --> 08:49.325
Me.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.619
Hay cafe con leche in the kitchen.

08:51.745 --> 08:53.078
I'll grab some at work.

08:53.205 --> 08:55.956
Got to make sure to get there
before you do.

08:56.082 --> 08:58.334
Don't want to arouse suspicion.

08:58.877 --> 09:00.669
Mmm.

09:01.630 --> 09:04.006
Speaking of arousing...

09:06.676 --> 09:09.803
You keep this up,
there goes your head start.

09:09.930 --> 09:11.680
(Chuckles)

09:11.806 --> 09:14.516
What if we showed up together, hmm?

09:14.643 --> 09:16.769
What's the worst
that could happen?

09:21.233 --> 09:22.483
Better get to the station.

09:22.609 --> 09:25.319
Yeah, I should get in the shower.

09:25.445 --> 09:28.489
- You've got a ten-minute head start.
- Make it 20 just to be safe.

09:28.615 --> 09:30.366
You should...

09:31.034 --> 09:33.035
..leave your hair down.

09:34.412 --> 09:36.205
It's beautiful.

09:42.754 --> 09:45.589
Yes, Ray's Tow Yard, 15th, right?

09:51.846 --> 09:53.806
(Lundy) Dexter?

09:53.932 --> 09:55.266
Car trouble?

09:55.392 --> 09:57.184
Uh, little accident.

09:57.310 --> 09:59.019
It's my fault. I'm a knucklehead.

09:59.145 --> 10:02.731
You got a minute?
I'd like to pick your brain.

10:05.485 --> 10:07.736
I need to get over
to the motor pool

10:07.862 --> 10:10.656
before they run out of loaners,
there's something I need to pick up.

10:10.782 --> 10:12.533
Not a problem. I'll walk with you.

10:12.659 --> 10:14.118
Uh...

10:14.244 --> 10:16.036
Yeah, I do have a minute.

10:16.162 --> 10:20.874
Just want to follow up on that crime scene
investigation from the other day.

10:21.001 --> 10:23.711
Lisa Bell?

10:23.837 --> 10:25.462
The girl in the bathtub.

10:25.588 --> 10:27.506
Right! Uh...of course.

10:27.632 --> 10:29.675
The Trinity Killer's
most recent victim.

10:29.801 --> 10:31.802
If my theory holds.

10:32.929 --> 10:34.179
You sure you're OK?

10:34.306 --> 10:36.890
I'm just, uh, tired. Long night.

10:37.017 --> 10:38.976
What can I tell you
about Lisa Bell?

10:39.102 --> 10:42.229
You run across any hair or fiber
in that second blood sample you found?

10:42.355 --> 10:44.565
Nothing yet.

10:44.691 --> 10:47.526
Really is kismet, you know?

10:48.695 --> 10:50.279
- Kismet?
- Fate.

10:50.405 --> 10:52.740
I mean, if Trinity had struck
in Buffalo instead of Miami,

10:52.866 --> 10:56.702
I wouldn't have access
to a blood guy of your caliber.

10:57.412 --> 10:59.747
Well, thanks...for that.

10:59.873 --> 11:01.957
But the person that you should
really be talking to is my sister.

11:02.083 --> 11:03.417
She's lead on Lisa Bell.

11:03.543 --> 11:07.546
See? Already putting
good ideas in my head.

11:07.672 --> 11:08.756
Kismet.

11:08.882 --> 11:10.257
(Chuckles)

11:12.302 --> 11:13.802
More like self-preservation.

11:13.928 --> 11:16.263
Last thing I need right now
is Frank Lundy,

11:16.389 --> 11:18.098
rock star FBl profiler,

11:18.224 --> 11:20.392
standing between me
and Benny Gomez.

12:13.530 --> 12:17.324
No crime scene tape, no coroner's van.
That bodes well.

12:20.036 --> 12:23.372
UnIess SWAT's Iying in wait for me.

12:27.293 --> 12:28.919
Ah!

12:30.797 --> 12:32.840
The bag's stiII there.

12:32.966 --> 12:36.343
Wait, a bag.
Not the six it takes to hoId a body.

12:40.765 --> 12:42.724
My kiII tooIs.

12:42.851 --> 12:46.645
If they're here and Benny isn't,
he must have been thrown from the car.

12:50.150 --> 12:51.900
I have to get to the crash site.

12:52.026 --> 12:53.986
(Cell phone rings)

12:55.905 --> 12:59.241
Shit!

12:59.367 --> 13:00.451
Morgan.

13:00.577 --> 13:03.871
Dexter, I need you at a crime scene.
Someone found the body.

13:03.997 --> 13:06.540
Oh, you make it sound so easy.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.167
Vizcaya Reef Hotel.

13:08.293 --> 13:11.712
Just one murder-free day, Miami.
That's all l asked for.

13:11.838 --> 13:13.046
On my way.

13:13.173 --> 13:15.966
OK, I need you there ASAP.
This is high priority.

13:16.092 --> 13:18.969
One stop first. Higher priority.

13:21.681 --> 13:24.641
lf that one stop doesn't
give me Benny Gomez,

13:24.767 --> 13:27.478
I'II be running out of options.

13:27.604 --> 13:30.564
All right, let's get moving.
Yale, Soderquist, Morgan, Quinn.

13:30.690 --> 13:33.400
Sarge, I'm working a lead on
the Lisa Bell case. I have to...

13:33.526 --> 13:35.736
- Where the hell's Quinn?
- Here. I'm here.

13:35.862 --> 13:37.362
Not for long.

13:37.489 --> 13:39.490
Another tourist caught a bullet.

13:39.616 --> 13:41.825
You do what you have
to do with the Bell case, but check in,

13:41.951 --> 13:43.410
- we may need you at the hotel.
- OK.

13:43.536 --> 13:45.704
- You came up with something on our case?
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:45.830 --> 13:48.874
While you were looking for your panties
on some chickie-do's floor.

13:50.001 --> 13:52.002
Frances, hey. Deb.

13:52.128 --> 13:53.337
Were you able to pull anything up

13:53.463 --> 13:56.048
on that 30-year-old homicide
I was asking you about?

13:56.174 --> 13:58.091
Perp's name's Eddie Noonan.

13:58.218 --> 14:00.052
Great. Can you bring it up?

14:00.178 --> 14:01.553
Thanks.

14:02.263 --> 14:04.848
(Sniffs) My keen forensic
sense of smell

14:04.974 --> 14:06.892
tells me you're wearing
new perfume.

14:07.018 --> 14:12.814
Anything to do with the return
of one Special Agent Frank Lundy?

14:12.941 --> 14:14.274
I already have a boyfriend

14:14.400 --> 14:16.777
who happens to be coming
back in town tonight.

14:16.903 --> 14:19.696
And if you smell me again,
I'll punch you in the throat.

14:19.822 --> 14:20.906
(Door opens)

14:21.032 --> 14:24.201
So much for keeping these
shootings low profile.

14:25.662 --> 14:28.747
"A string of robberies turned deadly
in what authorities are now calling

14:28.873 --> 14:30.082
"'the Vacation Murder'."

14:30.208 --> 14:32.960
Imagine how thrilled the mayor
is this thing had a brand name.

14:33.086 --> 14:35.379
Wait till he hears it's
Vacations Murders, plural.

14:35.505 --> 14:36.421
Jesus.

14:36.548 --> 14:39.675
Does anyone know this...Christine Hill?

14:42.011 --> 14:44.304
We might have met a few times.

14:44.430 --> 14:47.182
Well, see if you can get her to tone down
the creative writing, OK?

14:47.308 --> 14:49.476
I'm gonna need an arrest here soon.

14:49.602 --> 14:51.895
- Don't worry, I'm on it.
- Actually, I'm on it.

14:52.021 --> 14:54.773
I told the mayor
I'd take lead on this case.

14:56.776 --> 14:59.319
- OK.
- No reflection on you, Sergeant.

14:59.445 --> 15:01.446
It's your call, Lieutenant.

15:04.117 --> 15:05.826
You are so boning this reporter.

15:05.952 --> 15:07.369
Shut the fuck up.

15:07.495 --> 15:10.372
Guys, vamonos,
we got a crime to solve.

15:22.802 --> 15:24.511
You here to lend a hand?

15:24.637 --> 15:26.680
More like find one.

15:26.806 --> 15:29.099
If those body parts
were thrown from the car,

15:29.225 --> 15:31.643
- locating them is a matter of...
- Velocity and trajectory.

15:33.813 --> 15:36.189
Should be right around here.

15:43.990 --> 15:46.533
- Just imagine if Harrison had been...
- He wasn't.

15:46.659 --> 15:49.995
If your ritual hadn't been interrupted
to go pick up meds for Harrison...

15:50.121 --> 15:53.165
- You saying he's to blame for this?
- I'm not.

15:56.002 --> 15:58.003
(Shudders)

16:00.256 --> 16:02.132
Dizzy?

16:02.258 --> 16:03.842
(Sighs)

16:03.968 --> 16:05.385
I'm fine.

16:05.511 --> 16:07.471
Unless you can't find Benny Gomez.

16:08.681 --> 16:10.724
Those bags aren't here, Dexter.

16:11.809 --> 16:13.226
What did you do with his body?

16:13.353 --> 16:16.104
Rita called about Harrison and...

16:17.023 --> 16:19.691
..everything else is just fog.

16:20.693 --> 16:23.070
Come on, Dex. Think.

16:23.196 --> 16:25.030
(Sniffs)

16:27.825 --> 16:29.826
Where is Benny?

16:30.703 --> 16:32.871
I don't know.

16:36.626 --> 16:38.877
(Cell phone rings)

16:41.089 --> 16:43.548
- (Beep)
- Fucking dead people.

16:45.343 --> 16:48.887
Everything we've got on Noonan's
1979 homicide conviction.

16:49.013 --> 16:51.056
Evidence logs,
witness statements.

16:51.182 --> 16:52.432
Plea agreements in there too.

16:52.558 --> 16:54.142
- Frances...
- Mmm?

16:54.268 --> 16:57.896
If I hadn't already gone through
that phase in college, I'd kiss you.

16:58.022 --> 17:01.233
So why are you interested in a murder
that happened while you were in diapers?

17:01.359 --> 17:04.903
A guy kills his wife while
she's taking a bath 30 years ago.

17:05.029 --> 17:08.240
We found a new victim a few days ago
at, get this, his old address.

17:08.366 --> 17:10.117
A coincidence? I think fucking not.

17:10.243 --> 17:11.910
You forgetting something?

17:12.036 --> 17:15.372
Your father's old confidential informant
folders aren't gonna re-file themselves.

17:15.498 --> 17:16.498
Sorry.

17:16.624 --> 17:19.126
Susannah Coffey.
Another blast from the past.

17:19.252 --> 17:20.502
Hmm, was she at least useful?

17:20.628 --> 17:22.462
Only as a reminder to wear sunblock.

17:22.588 --> 17:26.133
But I'm still waiting on a few callbacks
from some other names on the list,

17:26.259 --> 17:28.093
but so far, I'm starting to think

17:28.219 --> 17:30.721
maybe I fucked around more
than my old man did.

17:32.682 --> 17:34.766
Just work the scene. Don't raise flags.

17:34.892 --> 17:36.560
Just work the scene...

17:36.686 --> 17:39.646
then get the heII
to the boxing arena.

17:39.772 --> 17:41.940
(Radio chatter)

17:43.359 --> 17:45.485
Get those news trucks out of here.
I got a coroner's van coming through.

17:45.611 --> 17:47.028
Copy that.

17:50.408 --> 17:53.160
- Hey, Joey.
- This is an active crime scene, ma'am.

17:53.286 --> 17:55.203
I'm gonna need you behind that tape.

17:55.329 --> 17:57.456
"Ma'am"?

17:57.582 --> 17:59.082
Your article, "Vacation Murder"?

17:59.208 --> 18:00.876
"Murders" now, it seems.

18:01.002 --> 18:03.336
See, how am I supposed to talk to you
when I got to watch everything I say?

18:03.463 --> 18:06.590
Which means you do still
want to talk to me?

18:09.260 --> 18:10.677
Yeah, I do.

18:10.803 --> 18:13.305
Good. 'Cause I like talking to you.

18:13.431 --> 18:15.265
Amongst other things.

18:16.434 --> 18:20.312
Those things are good,
but we got to have some ground rules.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.694
Quinn, I need you to run an inventory
on the victim's personal effects.

18:27.820 --> 18:29.529
I'm on it, boss.

18:30.323 --> 18:32.324
Stay back here, ma'am. You know better.

18:33.993 --> 18:37.037
(Sighs) Your timing sucks.

18:37.163 --> 18:38.705
What have we got here?

18:38.831 --> 18:40.999
Shot from behind as he was
coming in the room.

18:41.125 --> 18:43.001
Caught a medium-caliber bullet
in the back of the neck.

18:43.127 --> 18:45.796
Empty wallet, watch missing,
drawer's empty.

18:45.922 --> 18:49.132
Someone figured out it's easier to rob
people who are dead first.

18:49.258 --> 18:53.220
Directional swipe pattern of one of the
assailant's shoes shows he went that way.

18:53.346 --> 18:56.598
OK, Angel, start a canvass.
Guests, employees, security cameras.

18:56.724 --> 18:59.476
- Already handled.
- Next of kin will have to be notified.

18:59.602 --> 19:01.561
Got it, if you're good with that,
Lieutenant.

19:01.687 --> 19:03.605
You got your hands full here.
I'll deal with it.

19:05.024 --> 19:07.943
What's up with the boss lady
taking lead on your case?

19:08.069 --> 19:09.903
Chain of command is there
for a reason, Vince.

19:10.029 --> 19:11.530
Just do your goddamn job.

19:11.656 --> 19:13.031
(Groans)

19:13.157 --> 19:16.034
Dude, your gills are green.
You gonna blow?

19:16.160 --> 19:18.370
Uh, I need to get some air.

19:23.876 --> 19:26.169
(Sighs) Don't have time for this.

19:30.299 --> 19:31.883
Oh.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.220
Are we blood?

19:43.938 --> 19:45.564
(Lundy) Join you?

19:48.359 --> 19:51.319
One o'clock. Some things...

19:51.445 --> 19:53.280
Holy-what-the-fuck is that?

19:53.406 --> 19:54.364
Sushi.

19:54.490 --> 19:56.908
What happened
to the daily cucumber sammy?

19:57.034 --> 19:59.452
It retire along with the rest of you?

19:59.579 --> 20:03.748
All that cream cheese
wasn't exactly helping my cholesterol.

20:03.875 --> 20:05.125
(Chuckles)

20:05.251 --> 20:06.960
I'm sorry.
This is too fucking weird.

20:07.086 --> 20:09.212
I can get a sandwich if it makes you
more comfortable.

20:09.338 --> 20:11.464
No, it's...

20:11.591 --> 20:13.550
..this.

20:13.676 --> 20:15.635
Us.

20:15.761 --> 20:17.929
I haven't seen you, spoken to you,

20:18.055 --> 20:20.015
or exchanged so much as
a fucking Christmas card

20:20.141 --> 20:21.933
with you in two years.

20:22.059 --> 20:23.727
Now all of a sudden
you're in Miami

20:23.853 --> 20:25.604
holding a pair of chopsticks
without so much

20:25.730 --> 20:27.898
as an email saying,
"Hey, remember me?

20:28.024 --> 20:31.443
"We used to fuck. I'm coming to town.
You want to grab lunch?"

20:31.569 --> 20:34.029
I mean, seriously. What the fuck?

20:35.072 --> 20:36.823
I know. Same old mouth.

20:38.618 --> 20:41.161
- Not without its charm.
- Really?

20:41.287 --> 20:43.204
That's all you have to say to me?

20:45.249 --> 20:48.627
I should have let you know
I was coming to Miami.

20:48.753 --> 20:52.005
This task force they're trying
to put together is hush-hush.

20:52.131 --> 20:54.257
Plus I knew you'd be busy,

20:54.383 --> 20:56.092
what with making detective and all.

20:56.218 --> 20:58.929
Yeah, well, tell me about it.

20:59.055 --> 21:00.764
I have a suspect en route.

21:00.890 --> 21:02.599
The Lisa Bell case?

21:02.725 --> 21:05.018
What do you know about Lisa Bell?

21:05.144 --> 21:07.270
Only what your brother's told me.

21:10.232 --> 21:13.526
Well, check this, she brags.

21:13.653 --> 21:15.487
We found another murder.

21:15.613 --> 21:16.655
30 years old.

21:16.781 --> 21:19.991
Same MO, same address,
same fucking bathtub.

21:20.117 --> 21:22.035
A guy was convicted.
He's back out in the world.

21:22.161 --> 21:25.413
So how do I not like him
for slicing up Lisa Bell?

21:25.539 --> 21:27.499
Sounds like he deserves
a good hard look.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.668
I had Patrol pick him up.

21:29.794 --> 21:31.211
Should be here any minute.

21:31.337 --> 21:33.129
Mind if I tag along?

21:34.590 --> 21:35.799
To the interview?

21:35.925 --> 21:39.094
I'd like to see Detective Morgan
in all her glory.

21:40.304 --> 21:43.056
Sounds like someone's bored
with retirement already.

21:43.182 --> 21:47.102
(Woman) Here you go. Thanks very much.
Keep the change.

21:47.228 --> 21:49.813
Come on, guys. Come on, boys.

22:03.327 --> 22:04.744
Oh, sorry, sir.

22:04.870 --> 22:06.413
It was an accident.

22:06.539 --> 22:07.914
It's OK, kiddo.

22:08.040 --> 22:11.001
It happens.
What is that, strawberry?

22:11.127 --> 22:12.544
Uh, bubblegum gelato.

22:12.670 --> 22:16.297
How, uh...repulsive.

22:16.424 --> 22:18.174
(Chuckles)

22:20.386 --> 22:22.429
You better catch up with your mom.

22:24.807 --> 22:26.808
You don't want to lose her.

22:32.064 --> 22:34.441
(Harry) Just had to find blood, didn't you?

22:36.360 --> 22:38.153
It is myjob.

22:38.279 --> 22:40.030
And you've got a family to support

22:40.156 --> 22:42.073
and people to dismember.

22:42.199 --> 22:43.742
You're spinning too many plates, Dexter.

22:43.868 --> 22:47.120
The sooner I wrap this up,
the sooner I get to the boxing arena.

22:47.246 --> 22:48.580
You might want to give some thought

22:48.706 --> 22:51.249
as to what happens
when somebody else finds that body.

22:53.961 --> 22:55.545
(Sighs, clears throat)

22:55.671 --> 22:57.797
Manager's on his way to open the safe.

22:57.923 --> 22:59.841
What's the date of birth
on his passport?

22:59.967 --> 23:01.801
5/5/72.

23:06.432 --> 23:08.433
(Beeping)

23:08.893 --> 23:10.101
(Click)

23:13.105 --> 23:15.607
(Sighs) Jeez.

23:36.337 --> 23:37.921
Don't sweat it, Quinn.

23:38.047 --> 23:40.673
I've got much bigger things
to worry about.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.675
I filled in the lieutenant
on what we found.

23:42.802 --> 23:44.761
We?

23:44.887 --> 23:46.930
Dude, there's no "me" in "team".

23:47.056 --> 23:49.432
Well, technically there is, but...

23:49.558 --> 23:52.102
Blood deposit on the yucca
on the assailant's escape route.

23:52.228 --> 23:54.896
- He probably scraped himself.
- Does that mean we have his DNA?

23:55.022 --> 23:57.023
I'll run it through the database
soon as I get back to the lab.

23:57.149 --> 23:58.191
Go.

23:58.317 --> 24:00.026
You, come with me.

24:00.694 --> 24:03.655
I'm going, just not where you think.

24:04.782 --> 24:07.826
You were convicted of killing
your wife back in '79.

24:07.952 --> 24:11.496
Sliced open her femoral artery.
She bled to death in your bathtub.

24:12.331 --> 24:13.706
Do I need to talk to a lawyer?

24:13.833 --> 24:17.127
At this point, we're interviewing you
to get more or less an expert opinion.

24:17.253 --> 24:19.045
See, your case bears
an uncanny resemblance

24:19.171 --> 24:20.922
to a case we're working on now.

24:21.048 --> 24:24.676
Same MO a la that femoral artery.

24:24.802 --> 24:26.094
Same house.

24:26.637 --> 24:28.054
Same everything.

24:28.180 --> 24:30.140
No fucking way.

24:30.266 --> 24:32.517
Yes fucking way.

24:32.643 --> 24:35.353
Sort of puts you at number one,
person-of-interest-wise.

24:35.479 --> 24:37.564
- I didn't kill my wife.
- Oh, no?

24:37.690 --> 24:40.733
You're just another innocent man
behind bars for no good reason.

24:40.860 --> 24:44.237
The fucking deck was stacked
before I walked into that courtroom

24:44.363 --> 24:46.239
in a death penalty state.

24:46.365 --> 24:49.409
You copped to doing the deed.
You took the deal.

24:49.535 --> 24:51.077
I did my time and I moved on.

24:51.203 --> 24:54.247
- You moved on to Lisa Bell.
- Who is Lisa Bell?

24:54.373 --> 24:58.126
The young lady that you killed
last Monday night in your old house.

24:58.252 --> 25:01.921
Whatever sick fucking poetry
you find in that.

25:04.049 --> 25:06.509
Tell us what you did, Mr. Noonan.

25:08.679 --> 25:12.557
It was muggy for so late at night.

25:13.267 --> 25:16.811
And Vicky, my wife...

25:16.937 --> 25:19.689
wanted to cool off
in the tub, so...

25:21.233 --> 25:25.028
I went out to score some shit
and I came back.

25:26.363 --> 25:28.656
And I found her.

25:34.705 --> 25:37.749
I wish I could buy the tears. I just...

25:37.875 --> 25:40.210
I can't get there.

25:40.336 --> 25:44.464
Monday night I was working a swing shift
at the homeless shelter in Allapattah

25:44.590 --> 25:47.967
hosing piss off the sidewalk
from the folks waiting to get inside

25:48.093 --> 25:50.595
until 8:00-fucking-a.m.

25:53.098 --> 25:56.226
We'll call the homeless shelter.
Verify your story.

26:02.608 --> 26:05.276
One, the guy's a train wreck.

26:05.402 --> 26:07.820
Two, he's a total slob,
he smells like a sewer,

26:07.947 --> 26:10.490
- and his fingernails are disgusting.
- Our killer's meticulous.

26:10.616 --> 26:12.492
Zero DNA left at the crime scene.

26:12.618 --> 26:13.952
Obviously you caught
his case of the shakes.

26:14.078 --> 26:16.329
Given his rehab history,
I'm voting DT's.

26:16.455 --> 26:18.331
And Lisa Bell was cut
with surgical precision.

26:18.457 --> 26:20.833
So, Detective Morgan...

26:22.586 --> 26:25.463
- are we in agreement here?
- Violent agreement...

26:25.589 --> 26:27.674
Retired Special Agent Lundy.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.426
If Noonan didn't kill Lisa Bell,

26:30.552 --> 26:32.512
why is the MO the same
as his wife's murder?

26:32.638 --> 26:35.473
- Copycat?
- Of an obscure 30-year-old crime?

26:35.599 --> 26:38.518
Do we think Noonan's
telling the truth...

26:38.644 --> 26:40.353
that he didn't kill his wife?

26:40.479 --> 26:42.855
- I believe we do.
- Shit.

26:43.983 --> 26:45.900
I have a theory I'd like to run by you.

26:47.152 --> 26:51.781
We could grab dinner, review the case,
maybe catch a bad guy.

26:51.907 --> 26:54.575
I... Uh...

26:57.371 --> 26:58.871
Su... OK, I guess.

26:58.998 --> 27:03.459
Um, I've got to cut Noonan loose
and make sure he talks to a lawyer.

27:03.585 --> 27:06.796
If our side railroaded him
into that plea bargain,

27:06.922 --> 27:09.215
he could have one fuck mother
of a case.

27:09.341 --> 27:11.801
You have a good heart, Debra.

27:11.927 --> 27:13.303
Pick you up around 8:00?

27:13.429 --> 27:15.179
Yeah, so I'll...

27:16.724 --> 27:19.934
Yes. Yes.

27:49.381 --> 27:51.382
The boxing arena's
at the next off-ramp,

27:51.508 --> 27:55.094
but l still have miles
to go before I sIeep.

28:00.059 --> 28:02.727
Bits and pieces.

28:02.853 --> 28:05.605
Memory fragments.

28:05.731 --> 28:07.648
AII I have from Iast night.

28:24.958 --> 28:27.335
Looks Iike I got the job done.

28:28.921 --> 28:30.755
Almost.

28:31.715 --> 28:33.716
Blood.

28:34.843 --> 28:37.178
I was off my game.

28:38.931 --> 28:40.807
SIoppy.

28:40.933 --> 28:45.186
With Harry's code ingrained in me,
cIeaning a kiII room shouId be automatic.

28:45.312 --> 28:49.816
The code. Etched into my memory
to ensure survival.

28:49.942 --> 28:53.569
What would l do if l couldn't
properly dispose of a body?

28:53.695 --> 28:55.530
l'd hide it.

28:59.535 --> 29:02.453
I investigate crime scenes
all the time.

29:05.290 --> 29:06.707
But this one...

29:10.337 --> 29:12.463
it's giving me nothing.

29:15.634 --> 29:17.385
Damn it.

29:18.137 --> 29:20.513
Focus. Track it.

29:20.639 --> 29:22.640
Where did I go from here?

29:22.766 --> 29:24.767
The pharmacy.

29:26.270 --> 29:28.688
Harrison's earache medicine.

29:28.814 --> 29:31.566
The onIy stop I made
before the crash.

29:35.612 --> 29:37.613
The onIy stop I remember.

29:53.088 --> 29:56.299
If you thought you were coming right back,
not a bad hiding place.

29:56.425 --> 29:58.468
Why are you wearing those?

29:58.594 --> 30:01.304
This is the way I was dressed
the first time we met.

30:02.973 --> 30:05.558
Your mother's murder was the last time
your memory was a blank.

30:05.684 --> 30:06.851
Why do you suppose that is?

30:06.977 --> 30:09.145
Not in front of my baby! No!

30:09.271 --> 30:11.481
(Screaming)

30:11.607 --> 30:13.983
Because not remembering saved me.

30:14.109 --> 30:16.861
And now if you want to save yourself,
you have to remember.

30:24.203 --> 30:25.745
If you don't fix this screw-up,

30:25.871 --> 30:28.748
Harrison's only memory of his father
will be of you behind bars.

30:28.874 --> 30:31.792
It's not a screw-up.
I just can't remember.

30:33.462 --> 30:35.755
Got to check today's incident reports.

30:35.881 --> 30:39.258
Make sure Benny's body
hasn't surfaced.

30:39.384 --> 30:41.928
It's in this city somewhere.

30:42.054 --> 30:43.596
Thanks for meeting me here.

30:43.722 --> 30:45.139
The sooner we get an estimate
and file a claim,

30:45.265 --> 30:46.891
the sooner my husband
gets his car back.

30:47.017 --> 30:50.770
Well, that much damage,
I wouldn't even try to talk you into fixing it.

30:53.315 --> 30:55.024
I thought it was a fender bender.

30:55.150 --> 30:58.444
Well, I'm sure there's a bent fender
somewhere in this mess.

30:58.570 --> 30:59.695
Oh, my God.

30:59.821 --> 31:01.948
Everybody got off easy on this one.

31:02.074 --> 31:04.450
Your husband, my company.

31:04.576 --> 31:06.577
He should count his blessings.

31:07.663 --> 31:09.914
Yes, he should.

31:10.040 --> 31:11.832
Hey, buddy. You lose something?

31:11.959 --> 31:14.377
There's an understatement.

31:14.503 --> 31:16.170
Can't find my ID.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.714
Use mine to buzz you in.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.550
All right.

31:21.260 --> 31:22.301
Thanks.

31:22.427 --> 31:23.970
Look, the other day after court,

31:24.096 --> 31:26.347
I was totally out of line
going off on you like that.

31:26.473 --> 31:28.683
Gomez is the criminal, not you.

31:28.809 --> 31:29.767
No, not me.

31:29.893 --> 31:32.979
Plan on having a heart-to-heart
with the prick when I find him.

31:33.105 --> 31:34.480
Benny?

31:34.606 --> 31:37.775
Yeah, want him to know he's still
on my radar, but he's been laying low.

31:37.901 --> 31:39.026
(Door buzzes)

31:39.152 --> 31:41.571
Look, can we do this
another time?

31:58.463 --> 32:00.047
My password.

32:05.137 --> 32:06.762
(Harry) Access denied, Dex.

32:08.098 --> 32:11.100
I can't even remember
my own password.

32:12.144 --> 32:14.395
I'm here to help.

32:14.521 --> 32:16.188
Think.

32:20.485 --> 32:21.944
H-A...

32:22.070 --> 32:23.571
R-R-Y.

32:26.950 --> 32:28.451
Thanks, Dad.

32:31.079 --> 32:32.330
Bank hoId-up.

32:32.456 --> 32:34.165
AIIigator in backyard.

32:34.291 --> 32:36.834
Kidnapped three-year-oId
found safe.

32:37.961 --> 32:39.962
But no body parts turning up.

33:02.027 --> 33:06.906
From boxing arena, to the pharmacy,
to the crash.

33:07.032 --> 33:08.991
What am I missing?

33:12.621 --> 33:15.247
Girl Scout cookie time again?

33:15.374 --> 33:17.958
No, I froze them
in case of emergency.

33:18.085 --> 33:20.836
What's the emergency?

33:20.962 --> 33:22.088
Frank Lundy.

33:22.214 --> 33:24.757
I haven't heard from him
in, like, forever,

33:24.883 --> 33:26.217
and then he shows up out of the blue

33:26.343 --> 33:29.845
for some hush-hush task force
and wants to know all about my case.

33:29.971 --> 33:31.555
Not to drag you into my shit.

33:31.682 --> 33:32.765
Drag away.

33:32.891 --> 33:35.226
In this boys' club,
who else you gonna talk to?

33:35.352 --> 33:37.436
This is about him trying
to get next to me.

33:37.562 --> 33:40.064
Maybe, but you do have a boyfriend.

33:40.190 --> 33:41.982
Hell yeah, I do.

33:42.109 --> 33:44.110
A good one.

33:44.236 --> 33:45.736
And I'm really fucking happy.

33:45.862 --> 33:50.157
Can I make a suggestion
before you eat the box too?

33:50.283 --> 33:54.286
If there is still something, anything,
between you and Lundy...

33:54.413 --> 33:58.374
- There's so not.
- Well, closure will set you free.

34:00.544 --> 34:03.045
Does my hair look better up or down?

34:03.171 --> 34:04.964
Down, definitely.

34:06.091 --> 34:07.591
Thanks.

34:11.638 --> 34:14.390
OK, Benny, I gotta find you
before anyone eIse does.

34:14.516 --> 34:16.475
Better fucking start aII over again.

34:16.601 --> 34:19.270
Nothing on the DNA results
from the blood on the cactus.

34:19.396 --> 34:22.022
No match in the database. Sorry.

34:22.149 --> 34:23.816
Hang on. No one's going anywhere.

34:23.942 --> 34:25.985
- Oh, shit.
- Listen up, guys.

34:26.111 --> 34:27.737
Everyone working
the Vacation Murders,

34:27.863 --> 34:29.947
I'm holding over your shift
until further notice.

34:30.073 --> 34:33.200
Call home, let your people know
they'll see you when they see you.

34:33.326 --> 34:35.578
Quinn, my office.

34:50.177 --> 34:53.345
I'm gonna ask you if we have a problem
and I expect the truth.

34:53.472 --> 34:55.639
Look, Lieutenant,
what happened at the hotel,

34:55.766 --> 34:57.892
it's not what you think.

34:58.018 --> 34:59.894
Detective...

35:00.771 --> 35:03.355
I'm not gonna tell you who to date.
It's none of my business.

35:03.482 --> 35:07.067
But you should know there's no such thing
as off the record with reporters.

35:07.194 --> 35:10.279
So watch the pillow talk
with that woman.

35:10.405 --> 35:11.906
Not a problem, Lieutenant.

35:12.032 --> 35:14.492
Talking isn't what we do best anyway.

35:34.679 --> 35:37.515
Debra. I thought I was picking you up.

35:37.641 --> 35:39.308
I need to clear some things up

35:39.434 --> 35:42.812
and I owe you nothing less
than complete transparency.

35:42.938 --> 35:44.480
Want anything?

35:47.067 --> 35:48.943
Tea? Water?

35:49.069 --> 35:50.986
I don't want to mislead you.

35:51.112 --> 35:54.073
And I certainly don't want to hurt you.

35:54.199 --> 35:57.243
It's just that
what I have with Anton,

35:57.369 --> 36:00.412
it's... it's great.

36:00.539 --> 36:04.166
And it's really fucking great
and we live together.

36:04.292 --> 36:05.793
And...

36:06.711 --> 36:08.754
It's great. And...

36:09.422 --> 36:13.592
for the first time in so long,
I'm actually...

36:14.553 --> 36:15.970
..happy.

36:17.389 --> 36:18.556
No offense.

36:18.682 --> 36:20.850
You sure you don't want
something to drink?

36:20.976 --> 36:22.768
Did you not hear a word I just said?

36:22.894 --> 36:25.729
- Everything's great.
- Exactly.

36:25.856 --> 36:28.816
So if you've come back here to...

36:29.568 --> 36:33.612
rekindle something
between us...

36:33.738 --> 36:35.114
it's not gonna happen.

36:35.240 --> 36:37.950
In the interest of transparency,

36:40.412 --> 36:42.121
Work related.

36:42.247 --> 36:44.081
Cut the shit, Frank. You're retired.

36:44.207 --> 36:46.959
The reason I'm in Miami

36:47.085 --> 36:50.462
is because I'm convinced
that these bathtub murders -

36:50.589 --> 36:52.882
Noonan's wife, Lisa Bell -

36:53.008 --> 36:57.094
are connected to a series of murders
all over the country.

37:07.522 --> 37:08.564
Oh.

37:08.690 --> 37:12.484
It's become something of
an obsession of mine and, uh...

37:14.821 --> 37:16.822
I'm not about to ride off
into the sunset

37:16.948 --> 37:18.782
and dump something this horrific

37:18.909 --> 37:20.826
on whoever gets my office next.

37:20.952 --> 37:22.286
Christ.

37:23.204 --> 37:24.830
I...

37:25.874 --> 37:28.542
(Chuckles) I've got to go. I'm an idiot.

37:28.668 --> 37:30.169
Debra.

37:41.556 --> 37:44.516
- Rita, what are you doing here?
- You lied to me, Dexter.

37:44.643 --> 37:47.811
I saw your car. It wasn't a fender bender.
It was destroyed.

37:47.938 --> 37:49.521
I didn't want you to worry.

37:49.648 --> 37:52.942
Yeah, well, you're not doing a good job.
I'm worried sick about you.

37:53.068 --> 37:54.985
I'm fine.

37:56.279 --> 37:58.322
All right, a little headache
and a stiff neck.

37:58.448 --> 38:00.366
- Get your stuff. I'm gonna take you home.
- I can't.

38:00.492 --> 38:02.076
The lieutenant is holding over the shift

38:02.202 --> 38:04.954
because of these murders
that are in all the papers.

38:06.206 --> 38:07.915
You fell asleep at the wheel.

38:08.041 --> 38:09.708
Almost got killed because of the hours

38:09.834 --> 38:12.044
that they keep you here
night after night after night.

38:12.170 --> 38:14.046
So much for my standard aIibi.

38:14.172 --> 38:15.714
This is a job I signed on for.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.841
I'm sorry. I didn't sign on to be a widow.

38:17.968 --> 38:19.718
You know what? I'll just talk to Maria myself.

38:19.844 --> 38:23.681
Rita, no. Don't do this.
Not here. This is myjob.

38:23.807 --> 38:25.766
It's how I support all of us.

38:26.726 --> 38:29.019
Not if you wind up dead in a ditch.

38:29.980 --> 38:32.898
All these people put in
the same hours that I do.

38:35.485 --> 38:39.405
Yes, but you were in the hospital last night.
They weren't.

38:39.531 --> 38:42.992
And the doctor gave me
a clean bill of health.

38:43.118 --> 38:45.285
You could talk to him yourself.

38:46.871 --> 38:48.706
(Keypad tones)

38:50.917 --> 38:53.794
No. No, I don't... I don't want
to talk to your doctor.

38:53.920 --> 38:55.254
I want you to.

38:55.380 --> 38:57.381
I mean, I guess he wouldn't
have released you

38:57.507 --> 39:00.342
if it was anything serious.

39:00.468 --> 39:04.888
I'm sure they'd all rather be home
with their families, just like me.

39:06.725 --> 39:08.267
I know.

39:08.393 --> 39:10.894
Come on, I'll walk you out.

39:17.569 --> 39:19.486
(Elevator bell dings)

39:24.993 --> 39:26.994
(Sighs)

39:35.211 --> 39:37.963
- You gonna pick that up?
- No, I am not, Vince.

39:38.089 --> 39:40.090
You got a problem with that?

39:41.259 --> 39:43.385
Dude, seriously, 86 the caffeine.

39:43.511 --> 39:44.970
You're freaking me out.

39:45.096 --> 39:46.805
I have someplace I need to be.

39:46.931 --> 39:48.766
I also have places I need to be.

39:48.892 --> 39:51.268
Not good places, but...places.

39:54.773 --> 39:57.024
Come on, blood. Talk to me.

39:59.778 --> 40:02.488
If somebody tested positive
for an STD,

40:02.614 --> 40:06.325
would they have to register
with the Miami health authorities?

40:06.451 --> 40:08.410
And why would you ask me that?

40:08.536 --> 40:10.537
Yes or no, Vince.

40:15.835 --> 40:19.213
Lieutenant. Found your guy.

40:19.339 --> 40:20.839
Name's Johnny Rose.

40:20.965 --> 40:23.342
- You found the suspect?
- All his info's in there.

40:23.468 --> 40:25.010
How?

40:25.136 --> 40:27.763
I reworked the blood sample
looking for other markers

40:27.889 --> 40:31.391
and found a Street 14 strain
of drug-resistant syphilis.

40:31.518 --> 40:33.894
I checked that against
the STD registry

40:34.020 --> 40:37.356
for anyone being treated with
heavy-duty meds over the last week.

40:37.482 --> 40:40.484
Turned up a few prostitutes
and one Johnny Rose.

40:40.610 --> 40:42.319
Good science says he's your guy.

40:42.445 --> 40:45.864
OK, briefing room in five minutes.
Strategy meeting.

40:45.990 --> 40:48.408
Dexter's turned up a lead on our shooter.

40:51.162 --> 40:52.704
Hey, Dex, hold up.

40:52.831 --> 40:54.873
- I need to be somewhere.
- Good work back there.

40:54.999 --> 40:56.959
This Rose guy gets syphilis
and fingered for murder?

40:57.085 --> 41:00.879
- That's burning it at both ends, huh?
- Yeah, I really got to go. Wife, kids.

41:01.005 --> 41:02.714
Come on, Dex.

41:02.841 --> 41:04.258
What do you say we grab
a beer this week,

41:04.384 --> 41:06.051
figure out how to come
at Benny Gomez next?

41:06.177 --> 41:07.302
Quinn!

41:07.428 --> 41:09.096
I have a life. You have a life.

41:09.222 --> 41:11.306
Just leave it alone. All right?

41:19.691 --> 41:21.066
Benny Gomez.

41:21.192 --> 41:25.028
The Iast pIace I'm gonna Iook
is the Iast pIace I saw you.

41:26.447 --> 41:28.448
Moment of your time, Lieutenant?

41:30.285 --> 41:32.077
Escuchame, Maria.

41:34.539 --> 41:35.873
Angel...

41:37.208 --> 41:39.751
..people will think something's up.

41:39.878 --> 41:41.420
Something is.

41:44.841 --> 41:47.467
Angel, if this is about the mayor,
I had no choice.

41:47.594 --> 41:50.345
I'm not angry about
you taking me off the case.

41:50.471 --> 41:51.597
It's how you did it.

41:51.723 --> 41:53.765
Ay, AngeI, por favor.

41:55.810 --> 41:58.395
I don't even know how
to act around you any more.

41:58.521 --> 42:00.397
This isn't easy for me either.

42:05.236 --> 42:07.237
Maybe we need a...

42:07.363 --> 42:08.697
break.

42:10.742 --> 42:12.868
Yeah, you're right.

42:13.703 --> 42:15.245
It's probably for the best.

42:18.249 --> 42:23.503
So that's that.

42:43.691 --> 42:45.442
So?

42:46.110 --> 42:47.611
So.

42:50.573 --> 42:53.408
Why are we thinking ourselves
out of a good thing?

43:03.127 --> 43:05.671
- What do you think's going on in there?
- Who cares?

43:05.797 --> 43:07.756
(Door opens)

43:12.178 --> 43:14.429
I'm so glad you're home.

43:15.640 --> 43:17.015
Hey, it's not my birthday.

43:17.141 --> 43:19.518
Can't a girlfriend be glad
her boyfriend's home?

43:19.644 --> 43:21.853
I was gone for two days.

43:21.980 --> 43:23.814
I fucking love you.

43:24.816 --> 43:27.985
- I love you.
- I love you. I love you.

43:28.111 --> 43:29.486
I love you.

43:36.286 --> 43:37.995
Back to square one.

43:38.871 --> 43:40.872
LiteraIIy.

43:42.250 --> 43:44.084
(Cell phone rings)

43:47.588 --> 43:48.547
Yeah?

43:48.673 --> 43:51.550
Dexter. Frank Lundy here.

43:51.676 --> 43:54.219
The Iast person in the world
l want to hear from.

43:54.345 --> 43:56.054
Glad to hear from you.

43:56.180 --> 43:58.765
I need to talk to you...

43:58.891 --> 43:59.933
about Trinity.

44:06.024 --> 44:10.777
I'm tired of swimming against
the bureaucratic tide by myself.

44:10.903 --> 44:13.113
Can we maybe toss
a few ideas around?

44:13.239 --> 44:15.449
You seem to have
the dot-connecting gift.

44:15.575 --> 44:16.867
More like had.

44:16.993 --> 44:18.368
(Sighs)

44:18.494 --> 44:22.122
I'm glad to help,
but tonight's not really, um...

44:22.248 --> 44:25.625
- optimal.
- I get it. New dad, new family.

44:25.752 --> 44:27.919
Your life has changed
in so many ways.

44:28.046 --> 44:30.589
(Chuckles) Yeah, I see that now.

44:30.715 --> 44:32.841
(Lundy) Trinity is going to kiII again.

44:32.967 --> 44:35.719
Soon. Another woman.

44:35.845 --> 44:37.637
(Lundy) OIder than Lisa BeII this time.

44:39.265 --> 44:42.726
Somewhere out there is a woman
who is going to die...

44:43.728 --> 44:45.520
and she'll have no idea why.

44:46.856 --> 44:49.232
- (Dog whimpers)
- Whoa, whoa!

44:49.359 --> 44:51.234
Watch your step there. (Laughs)

44:51.361 --> 44:52.903
Oh, hey.

44:53.029 --> 44:54.946
How cute are you?

44:55.073 --> 44:57.699
(Chuckles) You smell my puppy, don't you?

44:57.825 --> 44:59.993
- What's his name?
- This is Checkers.

45:00.119 --> 45:01.119
(Chuckles)

45:01.245 --> 45:03.163
My mother was
a lifelong Republican.

45:03.289 --> 45:06.083
- Well, no family's perfect.
- Indeed.

45:07.210 --> 45:08.794
What kind of pup you have?

45:08.920 --> 45:11.963
Um, just a mutt,
but she's great with my children.

45:12.090 --> 45:13.548
So you must live around here, huh?

45:13.674 --> 45:15.801
Yeah, it's such a great neighborhood.
Everyone's so friendly.

45:15.927 --> 45:18.303
Well, in the interest of friendly,
let me help you with these.

45:18.429 --> 45:20.263
Oh, it's really OK. I'm just up there.

45:20.390 --> 45:23.809
So I'll take one, you take the other.
Lighten the load, huh?

45:23.935 --> 45:26.019
I appreciate it. My arms were falling off.

45:26.145 --> 45:27.396
(Chuckles)

45:29.857 --> 45:31.858
My dog won't get your puppy
all riled up?

45:31.984 --> 45:33.777
Molly? Oh, God, no.

45:33.903 --> 45:36.488
She's the calmest little thing
in the world.

45:36.614 --> 45:38.115
How long have you lived around here?

45:38.241 --> 45:39.616
Uh, three years next month.

45:39.742 --> 45:43.161
Surprised we've never
run into each other till now.

45:43.287 --> 45:45.122
I'm Allen, by the way.

45:45.248 --> 45:47.249
- Tarla.
- Tarla.

45:47.375 --> 45:49.835
Um, this is me.
Thank you so much for your help.

45:49.961 --> 45:51.670
Sure.

45:51.796 --> 45:53.130
Great.

45:53.256 --> 45:56.341
Oh, and bye to you too, Checkers.

45:56.467 --> 45:58.385
Until next time.

46:13.693 --> 46:16.695
Off you go, Checkers,
or whatever your name is.

46:20.992 --> 46:23.660
Lundy thinks he can
predict the future,

46:23.786 --> 46:26.621
but I'm more interested in the past.

46:27.707 --> 46:30.000
My past.

46:31.335 --> 46:33.545
I aIready cIeaned this.

46:33.671 --> 46:35.630
That l remember.

46:42.221 --> 46:44.222
Now it makes sense.

46:44.974 --> 46:48.059
Harry was reminding me
the whole time.

46:51.856 --> 46:54.816
I was reminding myseIf
the whole time.

47:09.999 --> 47:11.708
Hello, Benny.

47:13.461 --> 47:15.253
(Splash)

47:15.379 --> 47:17.380
Goodbye, Benny.

47:39.570 --> 47:42.864
Got to admit...
pretty clever.

47:44.617 --> 47:48.119
Hiding Benny Gomez like that
until I could come back and get him.

47:48.246 --> 47:49.913
You turned to the code.

47:51.123 --> 47:53.124
A core memory.

47:54.544 --> 47:56.378
I taught you well.

47:58.047 --> 48:01.091
Finding Gomez was a band-aid.

48:01.217 --> 48:03.510
You're juggling family, work...

48:04.595 --> 48:07.722
and a dark passenger who's always got
one hand on the steering wheel.

48:08.975 --> 48:10.684
I can do it.

48:12.103 --> 48:14.104
I can manage...

48:14.939 --> 48:16.940
all these moving parts.

48:19.235 --> 48:21.319
Until you can't.

48:21.445 --> 48:23.405
Then what?

48:27.618 --> 48:29.452
Night, Dad.

48:30.621 --> 48:32.581
Sleep.

48:32.707 --> 48:35.125
Just one beautifuI night's sIeep

48:35.251 --> 48:39.129
wiII make everything better...again.

48:40.256 --> 48:42.549
(Snoring)

48:49.223 --> 48:51.224
(Harrison crying)

48:52.143 --> 48:53.143
Fuck.
