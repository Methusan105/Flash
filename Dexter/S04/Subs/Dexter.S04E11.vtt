WEBVTT

00:02.049 --> 00:03.591
Previously on Dexter...

00:03.717 --> 00:05.593
Lundy misread the pattern.

00:06.178 --> 00:09.681
lt's not three victims
he leaves behind, it's four.

00:09.807 --> 00:13.101
Oh, my God.
The boys begin the cycIe.

00:13.852 --> 00:15.311
We broke up. Officially.

00:15.437 --> 00:18.106
If I find out this is bullshit,
there will be consequences.

00:18.232 --> 00:21.484
Severe, career-ending consequences.

00:23.070 --> 00:24.112
I'm married.

00:24.238 --> 00:26.197
- We have this connection.
- I have Dexter.

00:28.158 --> 00:29.450
Hey!

00:29.576 --> 00:31.452
- Kyle Butler.
- Remembered my name.

00:31.578 --> 00:34.080
Oh, I'm like an elephant.
I never forget.

00:34.581 --> 00:36.582
You sure got to the crime scene fast.

00:36.709 --> 00:38.459
There's no traffic at 5 a.m.

00:38.585 --> 00:41.254
But dispatch didn't put out the call till 5:05.

00:41.380 --> 00:44.132
You were the first reporter
on scene at 5:20.

00:44.258 --> 00:47.176
I'm telling you, she knows more
than she's letting on.

00:47.302 --> 00:49.762
(Batista) Suspicious,
but it doesn't prove a thing.

00:49.888 --> 00:53.266
How's this for outside the box?
Christine's the same height as the shooter.

00:53.767 --> 00:55.476
You out of your fuckin' mind?

00:55.602 --> 00:58.479
No way Christine had anything to do
with shooting you or Lundy!

00:58.605 --> 01:01.691
You've been dating her for, what, two
months? How well do you even know her?

01:01.817 --> 01:03.568
(Masuka) The DNA results on Christine Hill
are back.

01:03.694 --> 01:05.570
She's fucking related to Trinity.

01:05.946 --> 01:09.449
I went back and I looked through all the
postcards you sent me over the years.

01:09.575 --> 01:13.327
Every trip you took,
in every city you went,

01:13.454 --> 01:14.954
a woman died in a bathtub.

01:15.080 --> 01:19.667
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- It's all right. I protected you.

01:19.793 --> 01:23.171
That FBI agent, Lundy, I shot him.

01:23.297 --> 01:24.297
You what?

01:29.511 --> 01:30.511
No!

03:32.551 --> 03:36.971
I'm gonna ask you again.
How are you related to the Trinity Killer?

03:37.097 --> 03:40.141
And I'm gonna tell you again.
I don't know.

03:40.267 --> 03:44.729
- Your DNA matches his.
- I don't know anything about that.

03:44.855 --> 03:47.899
Which raises one huge question...

03:48.025 --> 03:49.358
Who are you?

03:50.611 --> 03:52.612
(Dexter) Who are any of us, reaIIy?

03:52.738 --> 03:54.906
We all have our public life,

03:55.032 --> 03:56.741
our private life...

03:56.867 --> 04:00.328
And your secret life.
The one that defines you.

04:01.288 --> 04:05.333
Your mother is listed as Lorraine Hill.

04:05.459 --> 04:08.169
- Where is she?
- Dead.

04:08.295 --> 04:09.503
Five years now.

04:09.630 --> 04:12.798
Your father seems to be...

04:14.217 --> 04:16.177
unknown.

04:17.304 --> 04:18.596
Why is that?

04:18.722 --> 04:22.683
I told you, my mother got pregnant.

04:22.809 --> 04:25.561
It happens. I never met my father.

04:33.612 --> 04:35.488
I think you're lying.

04:36.448 --> 04:40.701
So do I.
I think Christine has her own secret life.

04:40.827 --> 04:43.412
She's got to be Arthur's daughter.

04:43.538 --> 04:48.250
Because of your relationship
with our department,

04:48.377 --> 04:51.504
we've been treating you
with the greatest of civility.

04:51.630 --> 04:57.468
Please...don't let that hide the fact
that you could be in real trouble here.

04:59.638 --> 05:01.514
Give us a name.

05:02.182 --> 05:04.392
If she says the name Arthur Mitchell, then...

05:04.518 --> 05:05.810
Nationwide manhunt.

05:05.936 --> 05:08.229
He's lost to you forever.

05:08.355 --> 05:13.192
Give us a name.

05:17.030 --> 05:18.280
So what will you do?

05:18.407 --> 05:20.700
He wants a name.

05:20.826 --> 05:22.576
I'll give him a name.

05:22.703 --> 05:23.703
A decoy.

05:23.829 --> 05:29.208
Exactly. If I can make the police
think the Trinity Killer is someone else,

05:29.334 --> 05:31.377
Arthur's all mine.

05:31.503 --> 05:34.171
(Phone rings)

05:36.550 --> 05:39.593
(Recorded voice) You've reached
Christine HiII. PIease Ieave a message.

05:40.429 --> 05:44.223
Which brings us to our next story.
In a very happy turn of events,

05:44.349 --> 05:47.977
ten-year-oId Scott Smith was reunited
with his parents earlier today.

05:48.103 --> 05:50.771
AIthough poIice have no Ieads
as to who abducted the boy

05:50.897 --> 05:52.773
or how he came to be returned,

05:52.899 --> 05:55.609
his famiIy is simpIy happy he's home.

05:55.736 --> 05:57.653
Interesting.

05:57.779 --> 06:00.948
Authorities say they wiII
continue their investigation.

06:03.243 --> 06:05.911
(Dexter) With aII the DNA sampIes
from my sister's sweep,

06:06.038 --> 06:11.375
there shouId be one bad guy
I can cast in the roIe of Trinity.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.294
But I'm striking out.

06:13.420 --> 06:15.421
(Cell phone rings)

06:22.345 --> 06:23.262
Hello.

06:23.388 --> 06:25.639
Let me ask you a question.

06:25.766 --> 06:28.476
What kind of a man
witnesses a child abduction

06:28.602 --> 06:30.811
and doesn't call the police?

06:30.937 --> 06:34.273
Who are you, Kyle?
What is it you want?

06:41.073 --> 06:43.574
- Money.
- Money?

06:43.992 --> 06:45.576
Is that what all this is about?

06:45.702 --> 06:47.328
I want $50,000,

06:47.454 --> 06:50.998
or I'll tell the whole world
that Arthur Mitchell, family man,

06:51.124 --> 06:53.918
schoolteacher, church deacon,

06:54.044 --> 06:55.169
is a pedophile.

06:55.295 --> 06:57.171
I am most certainly not a pedophile.

06:57.297 --> 06:58.839
50,000. Right now.

06:58.965 --> 07:00.841
I'm a schoolteacher.
I don't have that kind of money.

07:00.967 --> 07:04.053
Take a loan out on your house.
Sell your car. I really don't care.

07:04.179 --> 07:06.013
I want the money today.

07:06.139 --> 07:09.225
That's not possible.
I'm not even in Miami.

07:10.602 --> 07:12.311
Where are you?

07:12.437 --> 07:15.314
Well, I'm not gonna
tell you that, am I, Kyle?

07:17.150 --> 07:21.153
It doesn't matter.
You have 24 hours to get me the money.

07:21.279 --> 07:25.116
I'll, uh... I'll be in touch.

07:29.955 --> 07:32.373
But I don't know anything.

07:32.499 --> 07:35.084
You know about
Morgan and Lundy's shooting.

07:36.044 --> 07:37.920
More than you should.

07:39.464 --> 07:41.841
And you share Trinity's DNA.

07:45.178 --> 07:47.471
I can play this game all day long.

07:49.099 --> 07:52.935
But you're in here
until you tell us what we need to know.

07:55.272 --> 07:57.481
You can't do that.

07:58.066 --> 08:01.068
You can only hold me for 48 hours.

08:01.194 --> 08:03.571
If you were under arrest.

08:03.697 --> 08:05.823
But we're holding you
as a material witness.

08:07.492 --> 08:10.035
So you can keep me as long as you want.

08:10.162 --> 08:13.539
That's right,
so you better start talking, bitch.

08:14.624 --> 08:17.001
She says she doesn't know anything.

08:17.127 --> 08:18.711
And, what, you believe her?

08:18.837 --> 08:21.922
I know this sucks for you,
but she's in there because she's involved,

08:22.048 --> 08:24.842
- so get your fuckin' head on straight.
- We don't have any proof.

08:24.968 --> 08:28.429
Come on, Quinn. You're a detective.
What does your gut say?

08:30.348 --> 08:32.016
I don't know.

08:33.393 --> 08:34.977
You're too close to this.

08:35.103 --> 08:37.396
I'm not the only one too close.

08:40.066 --> 08:42.109
She say anything yet?

08:42.235 --> 08:44.570
Nope. And she won't.

08:44.696 --> 08:47.364
Let's hope not.

08:48.074 --> 08:49.783
- For Quinn's sake.
- Fuck you!

08:49.910 --> 08:51.785
Huh!

08:51.912 --> 08:54.622
And you.
Keep me posted.

08:54.748 --> 08:56.957
Whoa, where you going, half day?

08:57.083 --> 09:00.794
To find a Trinity decoy before Christine
says the magic words.

09:00.921 --> 09:03.464
Lunch with Rita, my wife.

09:03.590 --> 09:05.925
- Sure you are.
- I'm sorry?

09:06.051 --> 09:08.761
Where is it you really go every day?

09:09.596 --> 09:11.764
Cut him some slack.
His girlfriend's a psycho.

09:11.890 --> 09:15.184
- Say hi to Rita and Harrison for me.
- Will do.

09:16.770 --> 09:20.356
Warrant came through on Christine Hill's
apartment. Let's get a team over there.

09:20.482 --> 09:21.774
- Shit.
- Great. I'll drive.

09:21.900 --> 09:23.734
If she won't talk, maybe her apartment will.

09:23.860 --> 09:26.070
- I'll ride with you.
- No, absolutely not.

09:26.196 --> 09:28.906
You're not searching your own girlfriend's
apartment. Take Batista.

09:29.032 --> 09:30.616
Send him my way first.

09:30.742 --> 09:33.786
I want both of you.
In your office. Now.

09:39.459 --> 09:43.837
This is security footage of a robbery
in Coconut Grove last night.

09:43.964 --> 09:48.133
Fortunately, our detectives were able to ID
the suspect and make an arrest.

09:48.260 --> 09:51.720
But they sent this up to me
for a whole other reason.

09:51.846 --> 09:56.642
A half-hour before,
the security cameras recorded this.

10:02.148 --> 10:04.400
Chief, we were off duty, and...

10:04.526 --> 10:08.028
Two of my senior people who had signed
sworn affidavits with the department

10:08.154 --> 10:10.781
stating that there was no romantic
involvement between them.

10:10.907 --> 10:13.367
- If you'd just let me explain...
- There's nothing to explain.

10:13.493 --> 10:17.037
You both lied under oath.
You committed perjury, and that's a felony.

10:17.163 --> 10:19.206
Look, I understand
that we made a mistake,

10:19.332 --> 10:22.459
and if necessary, we're willing
to accept the consequences...

10:22.585 --> 10:25.754
You went back on your word
and then you rubbed my face in it.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.715
Your board of review hearing
is the day after tomorrow.

10:27.841 --> 10:31.593
I suggest you call your union reps
and start looking into career alternatives.

10:33.346 --> 10:34.847
Wait a s... Hang on.

10:34.973 --> 10:38.559
This isn't the first time
that you and I have squared off,

10:38.685 --> 10:41.228
so what exactly is your beef with me?

10:41.354 --> 10:43.981
My gender? My race? What?

10:45.191 --> 10:46.775
Your arrogance.

11:00.999 --> 11:02.833
Lundy's Trinity books.

11:02.959 --> 11:07.212
Lundy ran down lots of suspects over the
years who looked like they might be Trinity.

11:10.675 --> 11:12.176
Here.

11:12.302 --> 11:14.136
Stan Beaudry.

11:15.388 --> 11:17.848
A long-haul trucker
based right here in Miami.

11:17.974 --> 11:20.642
Travels all over the country.

11:21.770 --> 11:25.230
Arrested for killing
a prostitute with a crowbar,

11:25.357 --> 11:26.982
left her on the side of the highway.

11:27.108 --> 11:30.611
The chain of custody on the crowbar
was contaminated. They dropped the case.

11:30.737 --> 11:31.945
So he's ours.

11:36.368 --> 11:38.077
Rita.

11:49.339 --> 11:50.297
Hey!

11:50.423 --> 11:51.965
What the fuck?

11:52.842 --> 11:54.593
Oh. (Laughs)

11:54.719 --> 11:57.429
I'm sorry, is, uh, is this your house?

11:57.555 --> 11:58.764
Fuck, yeah! This is my house.

11:58.890 --> 12:00.808
I made a mistake.
I thought it was my friend's place.

12:00.934 --> 12:03.018
So you're breaking
into your friend's place?

12:03.144 --> 12:05.521
- No.
- You were gonna steal my shit.

12:05.647 --> 12:09.608
I assure you, I was not
going to steal your shit.

12:10.610 --> 12:13.987
Uh-uh. No, you ain't going anywhere,
old man.

12:14.114 --> 12:17.408
All right? I got your license plate number.
I'm gonna call the cops.

12:25.625 --> 12:28.335
(Sighs)
Sorry I'm late. It's just one of those days.

12:28.461 --> 12:30.170
Oh, it's OK. You're here now, so...

12:30.296 --> 12:33.799
- (Cell phone rings)
- Uh, sorry.

12:33.925 --> 12:35.300
It's work. One sec.

12:35.427 --> 12:39.179
- All right.
- Morgan.

12:39.305 --> 12:41.140
Uh, can it wait?

12:41.266 --> 12:42.766
I'm kind of in...

12:42.892 --> 12:44.309
OK.

12:44.436 --> 12:46.019
Yeah, no, I'll be there.

12:47.647 --> 12:48.939
Let me guess. Crime scene?

12:49.983 --> 12:51.483
Dexter, we have an appointment.

12:51.609 --> 12:53.110
I know, but it's an emergency.

12:53.236 --> 12:55.028
- So is this.
- Why?

12:56.656 --> 12:58.657
We're doing better. I'm...

12:58.783 --> 13:01.410
being all open, and...

13:02.495 --> 13:03.912
I kissed Elliot.

13:06.541 --> 13:07.458
What?

13:07.584 --> 13:11.462
Well, actually, uh, he kissed me, mostly.

13:13.089 --> 13:15.549
Look, I was waiting to tell you.

13:15.675 --> 13:17.009
In therapy.

13:17.135 --> 13:19.011
So let's just go to our session, so...

13:19.137 --> 13:21.805
- No, I told you, I can't.
- Dexter, please.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.557
(Sighs)

13:23.683 --> 13:25.184
I gotta get to work.

13:27.020 --> 13:29.104
(Radio) 10-4. This has been reconfirmed.

13:30.523 --> 13:32.357
I came over to borrow his lawn mower.

13:32.484 --> 13:34.776
I-I saw him through the window.
The door was unlocked.

13:34.903 --> 13:38.113
Bruising around the neck.
Our guy was choked.

13:39.157 --> 13:41.408
Hey, uh, how was, uh,

13:41.534 --> 13:43.869
lunch/therapy with Rita?

13:45.538 --> 13:46.747
Fine.

13:46.873 --> 13:48.790
Vince, stop reading
my desktop calendar.

13:48.917 --> 13:50.542
Impact marks here on the floor.

13:52.003 --> 13:57.007
- You can talk to me, you know.
- Actually, multiple impact marks.

13:58.259 --> 14:00.844
Somebody smashed his head
against the floor.

14:00.970 --> 14:04.723
I saw Rita kissing another dude
at Thanksgiving, OK?

14:04.849 --> 14:06.225
I know. She told me.

14:06.351 --> 14:07.601
Oh, thank Christ.

14:07.727 --> 14:10.103
We've lived next door five, six years.

14:10.230 --> 14:11.522
And what's his name?

14:11.648 --> 14:14.233
Kyle. Uh, Kyle Butler.

14:16.819 --> 14:18.904
Arthur Mitchell's in Miami,

14:19.030 --> 14:20.781
and he's Iooking for me.

14:24.160 --> 14:28.747
Another death of an innocent man
that l'm responsible for.

14:35.713 --> 14:38.215
(Debra) Shoes. And more shoes.

14:38.341 --> 14:40.133
Man, Christine has a lot of shoes.

14:40.260 --> 14:42.844
Shoes. Shoes.

14:44.472 --> 14:46.348
- Shoes.
- Not shoes.

14:49.769 --> 14:53.814
Des Moines, Denver, San Francisco.

14:55.358 --> 14:57.526
Let me see.

14:58.278 --> 15:00.487
These are all cities in Lundy's books...

15:01.489 --> 15:03.282
where Trinity killed.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.621
- Look how it's signed.
- "Love, Daddy."

15:09.747 --> 15:12.624
- Trinity is...
- Christine's fucking father.

15:12.750 --> 15:14.793
She's been in contact
with him the whole time.

15:14.919 --> 15:17.129
I knew it. I fuckin' knew
something was off with her.

15:17.255 --> 15:18.755
It still doesn't give us Trinity.

15:18.881 --> 15:20.257
No.

15:20.383 --> 15:23.260
But it gives us something
to make the bitch talk.

15:24.178 --> 15:25.804
(Bell rings)

15:25.930 --> 15:27.806
(Overlapping voices)

15:48.411 --> 15:50.704
(Dog barks)

15:54.000 --> 15:54.958
(Door closes)

15:55.084 --> 15:58.503
Arthur will come here next...

15:58.630 --> 16:00.631
and I'II be waiting.

16:13.227 --> 16:17.105
(Brakes screech, door closes)

16:26.741 --> 16:30.535
(Door opens)

16:38.044 --> 16:41.088
As soon as that door closes, it's over.

16:41.214 --> 16:43.590
(Door closes)

16:43.716 --> 16:45.842
What the fuck?

16:45.968 --> 16:47.803
(Distant voices)

16:47.929 --> 16:50.972
- (Woman) Good night.
- See you later.

16:51.849 --> 16:52.766
Shit!

16:52.892 --> 16:54.643
(Car drives off)

16:56.771 --> 16:59.064
Fuck.

17:03.236 --> 17:05.612
Not much of a resemblance.

17:05.738 --> 17:08.073
At least he's not looking
for Kyle Butler anymore.

17:08.199 --> 17:10.701
San Francisco, 1996.

17:10.827 --> 17:12.911
Same cycle.

17:13.037 --> 17:15.038
A girl dies in a bathtub.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.541
A woman jumps off a building.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.918
A man gets bludgeoned outside of a bar.

17:21.671 --> 17:25.215
There were Trinity killings
in every single one of these cities.

17:30.096 --> 17:31.638
"Wish you were here.

17:31.764 --> 17:34.099
"Love, Daddy."

17:41.983 --> 17:44.276
I've never seen those before.

17:46.612 --> 17:49.406
- You planted them.
- Are you trying to piss me off more?

17:51.200 --> 17:56.413
'Cause I'm sure that Detective Quinn
will be displeased

17:56.539 --> 18:00.834
when he finds out this is why
you cozied up to him,

18:00.960 --> 18:02.753
To keep tabs on Daddy.

18:02.879 --> 18:04.963
I didn't.

18:05.089 --> 18:06.673
I don't know who my father is.

18:06.799 --> 18:08.341
He is the Trinity Killer.

18:10.303 --> 18:14.097
And he's been sending you
postcards from hell.

18:15.224 --> 18:17.267
You've been drafting on us,

18:17.393 --> 18:21.938
and when you heard Lundy
was on to your father, you shot him.

18:24.484 --> 18:26.860
(Exhales)

18:31.908 --> 18:33.784
I want to talk to my lawyer.

18:33.910 --> 18:35.994
First smart thing you've said all day.

18:37.663 --> 18:40.373
- She lied.
- Fuck yeah, she lied.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.877
Just fucking admit it.
You shot me and you killed Lundy.

18:44.003 --> 18:45.879
She fucking used me.

18:46.005 --> 18:47.881
And I fell for it.

18:48.007 --> 18:50.300
For her.

18:50.426 --> 18:52.052
I'm a fuckin' asshole.

18:52.178 --> 18:53.970
Don't... Don't do that.

18:54.096 --> 18:56.056
- What?
- Beat yourself up like that.

18:56.182 --> 18:58.266
Why the fuck not?

18:59.519 --> 19:02.187
Because I know where it gets you.

19:02.313 --> 19:05.232
I was engaged to
the Ice Truck Killer. Hello!

19:06.526 --> 19:09.027
He cut people up,
drained their blood,

19:09.153 --> 19:12.489
wrapped 'em up like
bloody fuckin' Christmas.

19:12.615 --> 19:14.741
Engaged.

19:14.867 --> 19:17.536
As in ready to spend the rest of my life.

19:18.538 --> 19:19.412
Yeah.

19:19.539 --> 19:24.292
So we can play who's a bigger asshole,
but I guarantee you I'll win.

19:25.002 --> 19:27.087
We're keeping Christine overnight again.

19:27.213 --> 19:29.422
Good. Let her fuckin' rot.

19:38.724 --> 19:41.601
Stan Beaudry Iives off the grid.

19:41.727 --> 19:43.979
A shack in the middle of nowhere.

19:47.108 --> 19:49.568
Lone wolf personified.

19:49.694 --> 19:51.611
He's not home.

19:52.405 --> 19:53.864
(Indistinct voice)

19:53.990 --> 19:55.448
Or is he?

19:56.951 --> 19:59.327
(Voice continues)

20:03.666 --> 20:07.294
(Radio) Look out for an 1 8-wheeler with
a tackle box on the driver's side door...

20:07.420 --> 20:08.545
(Switches off radio)

20:17.138 --> 20:19.890
Where are you, Mr. Beaudry?

20:27.440 --> 20:31.401
Making a deIivery in JacksonviIIe,
due back late tomorrow.

20:31.527 --> 20:34.112
Or if l leave now,
I can be in JacksonviIIe by midnight,

20:34.238 --> 20:36.781
and cut the time...and him...in half.

20:36.908 --> 20:39.492
You can't just disappear
all night, Dexter.

20:39.619 --> 20:41.411
Got to get home to your family.

20:48.085 --> 20:49.210
Hey.

20:49.337 --> 20:51.254
It's late.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.381
You can't sleep?

20:53.507 --> 20:56.343
I stayed up, so we could finish our talk.

20:56.469 --> 20:59.846
(Sighs) Can it wait?
I have a huge day tomorrow.

20:59.972 --> 21:02.515
No, it can't.

21:03.434 --> 21:04.851
Are the two of you...?

21:04.977 --> 21:07.520
No. No, of course not.

21:07.647 --> 21:09.940
It's just a huge mistake,

21:10.066 --> 21:12.192
and I am so, so sorry.

21:12.318 --> 21:13.860
Well, OK then.

21:13.986 --> 21:15.987
Apology accepted.

21:17.907 --> 21:19.824
Shouldn't we talk about this?

21:19.951 --> 21:22.452
I thought we just did.

21:23.746 --> 21:26.539
You didn't say anything.

21:26.666 --> 21:30.377
I'm putting it behind me.
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?

21:30.503 --> 21:32.128
I mean, I'm glad,

21:32.254 --> 21:38.718
but if I were you, I would be hurt, angry,
disgusted even.

21:40.638 --> 21:42.305
Is that how you want me to feel?

21:44.976 --> 21:46.643
No.

21:46.769 --> 21:49.688
Well, good. See?

21:50.314 --> 21:52.065
Everything is OK.

21:59.865 --> 22:01.533
(Ringing tone)

22:04.036 --> 22:05.870
(Ringing continues)

22:08.833 --> 22:13.044
(Recorded voice) You've reached
Christine HiII. PIease Ieave a message.

22:28.019 --> 22:30.729
Mom's at work, kids are at school,

22:30.855 --> 22:35.108
and for aII I know, Trinity's out there doing
exactIy what I'm doing at his house -

22:35.234 --> 22:36.818
prepping for a kiII.

22:36.944 --> 22:38.653
Arthur's DNA.

22:38.779 --> 22:41.948
If the police search Stan Beaudry's house
and find those,

22:42.074 --> 22:44.492
they'll think he's the Trinity Killer.

22:44.618 --> 22:46.494
For a while, anyway.

22:47.913 --> 22:50.457
Long enough for me to kill the real Trinity.

22:50.583 --> 22:52.333
(Cell phone rings)

22:54.086 --> 22:55.086
Morgan.

22:55.212 --> 22:57.464
Dexter, I need you at the station.

22:57.590 --> 23:00.967
Wow. I, um... Kind of right in the middle
of doing some stuff.

23:01.093 --> 23:02.677
Any chance Masuka can cover for me?

23:02.803 --> 23:04.512
No chance at all. Be here.

23:04.638 --> 23:07.098
(Sighs) Shit.

23:09.018 --> 23:11.227
You're juggling too many people, Dexter.

23:11.353 --> 23:17.984
I know. Arthur, Beaudry,
Rita, now Batista...

23:18.110 --> 23:20.153
I'm not talking about them.

23:20.279 --> 23:21.988
I mean Dexter Morgan.

23:22.114 --> 23:25.158
Blood tech, husband, father,

23:25.284 --> 23:28.203
serial killer, and now
Kyle Butler, extortionist?

23:28.329 --> 23:29.704
Which one are you?

23:31.415 --> 23:33.249
All of them.

23:37.671 --> 23:39.881
You still playing "Who's your daddy?"
with Christine?

23:40.007 --> 23:43.676
I thought she'd come clean after
spending a night in a cell. No such luck.

23:43.803 --> 23:48.223
Tell you what. Before her lawyer gets here,
let me take a shot at her.

23:51.602 --> 23:53.478
I thought you might want to refuel.

23:55.314 --> 23:56.314
Breakfast burrito.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.191
No, I don't eat that shit.

23:58.317 --> 24:00.443
I figured. That's for me.

24:01.987 --> 24:04.531
You put some kind of drug
in there to make me talk?

24:04.657 --> 24:07.450
You watch way too much TV.

24:09.245 --> 24:12.038
I get it, why you did what you did.

24:14.625 --> 24:16.793
To protect your dad.

24:18.045 --> 24:20.713
I would have done the same thing.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.383
My dad and I were close too.

24:27.638 --> 24:29.139
Actually, we weren't.

24:31.225 --> 24:33.852
I wanted us to be, but he never noticed.

24:33.978 --> 24:36.688
He was always too busy
with my brother and work.

24:36.814 --> 24:38.982
- Is that why you became a cop?
- Yes, actually.

24:39.108 --> 24:41.025
Hmm.

24:41.402 --> 24:43.069
You thought that maybe,

24:43.195 --> 24:46.322
just maybe, if you became a cop like him,

24:46.448 --> 24:49.450
he'd give you that approval
you'd been so hungry for?

24:50.870 --> 24:53.746
Well, when you say it like that,
it sounds like a giant cliche.

24:53.873 --> 24:55.331
That's because it is.

24:57.376 --> 25:00.086
I don't want to talk about
your daddy issues, OK?

25:00.212 --> 25:02.130
Fine.

25:03.048 --> 25:06.092
- Let's talk about yours.
- Hmm.

25:06.594 --> 25:08.511
Oh, you don't know anything about me.

25:08.637 --> 25:10.638
I know you can still do the right thing.

25:15.227 --> 25:17.061
One day, I grew up.

25:18.439 --> 25:20.648
And I realized my father wasn't the end-all,

25:20.774 --> 25:22.901
and it didn't matter
what he thought of me,

25:23.027 --> 25:25.945
because I realized I didn't think that much
of him anymore either.

25:33.412 --> 25:36.539
You think just because you shared,
I'm gonna open up?

25:39.585 --> 25:41.753
You watch too much TV.

25:47.968 --> 25:49.469
How'd it go?

25:49.595 --> 25:51.804
It didn't. Now what?

25:51.931 --> 25:54.349
Well, her lawyer's insisting
that we let her go.

25:54.475 --> 25:57.310
Let who go?

25:57.436 --> 25:58.686
Christine.

25:58.812 --> 26:01.940
Well, if she cares enough about her father
to lie for him...

26:02.066 --> 26:04.984
- He could be her first stop.
- Lead us right to him.

26:05.110 --> 26:06.778
You take care of this? I got a meeting.

26:10.950 --> 26:12.784
I'm here.

26:12.910 --> 26:14.452
This is our witness?

26:14.578 --> 26:16.829
Uh, Dexter Morgan,
say hello to Judge Belford.

26:16.956 --> 26:19.040
I need you to sign here and here.

26:22.294 --> 26:24.379
And can I see some I.D.?

26:29.176 --> 26:32.428
Well, these are the kind of life sentences
I like to hand out.

26:32.554 --> 26:35.014
Angel, you may kiss the bride.

26:35.140 --> 26:37.308
Excuse me, Dex.

26:41.480 --> 26:43.690
And I'm late for my tee time.

26:45.150 --> 26:46.776
- Enjoy your life together.
- Thank you.

26:46.902 --> 26:48.861
Thank you. Thanks.

26:48.988 --> 26:50.905
Thank you.

26:53.534 --> 26:54.701
(They laugh)

26:54.827 --> 26:57.203
Did you two just get married?

26:57.329 --> 27:01.541
According to that piece of paper, we did.
You can be the first to congratulate us.

27:01.667 --> 27:02.959
Mazel tov.

27:03.085 --> 27:04.919
That's what I got called in for?

27:05.045 --> 27:08.339
- You're the only one that knows about us.
- Yeah, so keep it to yourself.

27:08.465 --> 27:10.758
Come here.

27:14.221 --> 27:15.847
(Knock)

27:15.973 --> 27:17.223
Patrol just called in.

27:17.349 --> 27:19.684
Surveillance is up and running
on Christine Hill's apartment.

27:19.810 --> 27:22.186
Good. OK. Thanks.

27:24.189 --> 27:26.691
Shit. I've got work to do.

27:28.027 --> 27:30.194
Beaudry.

27:30.321 --> 27:34.741
Breaker 1-9, this is Little Chopper
heading north on the 95 big road

27:34.867 --> 27:36.284
just north of Miami.

27:36.410 --> 27:41.039
Looking for the 10-20
on one Stan "the man" Beaudry,

27:41.165 --> 27:44.417
driving a black Peter car out of J-town.

27:47.546 --> 27:49.255
(Radio) Uh, copy, LittIe Chopper.

27:49.381 --> 27:52.133
Just saw him puIIing into
Freddy's truck stop off the 91 exit.

27:52.259 --> 27:54.177
Thank you, driver.

27:54.762 --> 27:57.180
(Cell phone rings)

27:59.892 --> 28:00.808
Arthur.

28:00.934 --> 28:03.353
I'm standing in front of your house, Kyle.

28:05.147 --> 28:06.272
What?

28:06.398 --> 28:08.858
I called the Four Walls office
for your home address.

28:08.984 --> 28:12.612
Seems to be Johnny's Jet Skis.

28:12.738 --> 28:15.114
They're fun. You should try one.

28:15.240 --> 28:19.035
(Arthur) What this teIIs me is you've been
Iying to me from the very beginning.

28:19.161 --> 28:23.539
Well, in the big scheme of things, being a
liar isn't nearly as bad as being a pedophile.

28:23.665 --> 28:27.251
- Do not call me that!
- l want my $50,000.

28:27.378 --> 28:31.130
(Sighs) Why should I trust you to be silent
after I've given you the money?

28:31.256 --> 28:33.633
Here's what you can trust.
If you don't meet me with the money,

28:33.759 --> 28:36.761
I'll call your family, your school,
and then the police.

28:36.887 --> 28:38.596
Give me until tomorrow.

28:38.722 --> 28:41.307
How do I know I can trust you?

28:41.433 --> 28:44.352
I guess that's just the world we live in, Kyle.

28:49.274 --> 28:51.776
(Rock music)

29:23.183 --> 29:27.937
You don't let me out of here,
I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass!

29:28.772 --> 29:31.023
Aah! You fuck!

29:31.150 --> 29:32.442
(Groaning)

29:33.777 --> 29:35.361
What the fuck are you doing?

29:35.487 --> 29:39.323
Normally, we'd have a little chat.
I'd show you the error of your ways.

29:40.325 --> 29:44.704
- But I'm kind of in a hurry here.
- Oh, I am gonna fuck you up!

29:44.830 --> 29:48.040
- Uh-huh?
- I'm gonna rip your heart out!

29:48.167 --> 29:50.376
- (Whirs)
- Yeah, I heard.

29:51.003 --> 29:55.548
I'm gonna gut you like a fuckin' pig!
You'll be sorry that you ever crossed me!

29:55.674 --> 29:57.175
Aah!

30:08.854 --> 30:12.607
I just need to make sure
the police find Arthur's DNA.

30:16.695 --> 30:20.448
When they see this picture of Christine,
they'll think she's Beaudry's daughter.

30:28.373 --> 30:30.541
Lundy's Trinity books.

30:42.054 --> 30:43.721
Ah, thanks.

30:43.847 --> 30:46.140
Only be a minute. Mine's dead.

30:46.266 --> 30:47.558
Don't have a land line.

30:47.684 --> 30:49.477
(Dialing)

30:51.688 --> 30:53.689
(Ringing tone)

30:59.780 --> 31:02.448
- Hello.
- Daddy.

31:02.574 --> 31:06.452
It's me. I'm sorry I haven't
returned your calls. I've been...

31:06.578 --> 31:08.913
I know where you've been. Don't call me
anymore. You understand?

31:09.039 --> 31:10.206
D-Daddy, I just...

31:10.332 --> 31:12.583
(Phone beeps)

31:33.939 --> 31:37.275
It's sIightIy unbeIievabIe that Beaudry
would even own a toothbrush,

31:37.401 --> 31:39.902
but I'm gonna go for it.

31:48.996 --> 31:51.789
And now, the final piece of the puzzle.

31:56.128 --> 31:58.045
l think l'm done.

31:58.922 --> 32:01.716
Stan Beaudry is now the Trinity KiIIer.

32:09.850 --> 32:11.684
Love thy neighbor.

32:11.810 --> 32:13.185
Bullshit.

32:14.438 --> 32:16.105
(Car door closes)

32:20.277 --> 32:23.029
l should leave it alone.
Go inside.

32:23.155 --> 32:25.406
Watch the History ChanneI.

32:32.414 --> 32:33.831
Hey, Elliot.

32:37.753 --> 32:39.629
Dex.

32:42.549 --> 32:44.508
Stay the hell away from my wife.

32:45.010 --> 32:46.802
Jesus. Dex...

32:47.262 --> 32:49.263
Aah!

32:49.389 --> 32:52.141
Wow. OK. Uh, I guess I deserved that.

32:52.267 --> 32:55.227
Now, now wait. I know I'm an asshole,
but just wait a minute.

32:55.354 --> 32:57.563
I got caught up in a moment.

32:58.732 --> 33:00.733
- Rita's amazing.
- You think I don't know that?

33:00.859 --> 33:04.612
And I'm an idiot. And if I were you,
I would want to kill me too.

33:04.738 --> 33:07.531
Don't ever touch her again.

33:15.290 --> 33:17.166
Your hand.

33:17.959 --> 33:20.044
You...saw?

33:20.170 --> 33:22.546
- I saw.
- (Sighs)

33:27.719 --> 33:30.388
- You're not mad?
- No.

33:30.514 --> 33:32.223
I'm not mad.

33:32.349 --> 33:34.058
What are you?

33:37.020 --> 33:40.314
Glad. That you cared that much.

33:50.242 --> 33:52.034
- Can't believe you hit him, though.
- I know.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.286
- I didn't see that coming.
- I didn't either.

34:04.089 --> 34:06.173
(Door opens)

34:10.804 --> 34:13.472
Professional courtesy dictates
we give you a heads-up.

34:13.598 --> 34:14.640
Mm-hm.

34:14.766 --> 34:17.435
- We're married.
- As in man and wife.

34:19.479 --> 34:21.731
I don't see how that
changes the facts of the matter.

34:21.857 --> 34:24.108
It's certainly gonna change
the context of your accusation.

34:24.234 --> 34:26.652
Do you really want to go
in front of the board of review

34:26.778 --> 34:28.738
and attack the sacrament
of holy matrimony?

34:28.864 --> 34:30.573
The issue here is perjury.

34:30.699 --> 34:33.576
Alleging an affair is one thing,
but now you'd be going after us

34:33.702 --> 34:35.411
for embracing the bedrock
of family values.

34:35.537 --> 34:39.331
In heavily Catholic
and heavily Latino Miami.

34:39.458 --> 34:44.003
You'll come across as a soulless,
anti-family schmuck.

34:44.129 --> 34:47.381
But if that's what you want to do,
we'll take the fight.

34:47.507 --> 34:51.677
It's also worth noting that the chief of police
met his now wife on the job as well.

34:51.803 --> 34:55.598
You can lecture him on how he is
in violation of department protocol.

34:58.810 --> 35:02.396
I can only marvel at the level of cynicism.

35:03.190 --> 35:06.817
Using the institution of marriage
as a cheap political ploy.

35:06.943 --> 35:09.445
You must be very proud of yourselves
for being so clever.

35:10.655 --> 35:13.449
You didn't give us a lot of options.

35:13.575 --> 35:17.495
I hope that your life together will not be
as empty and as amoral

35:17.621 --> 35:20.498
as your decision to get married was.

35:27.422 --> 35:28.964
We did the right thing.

35:31.676 --> 35:33.552
Of course we did.

35:33.678 --> 35:35.387
(Cell phone rings)

35:37.140 --> 35:38.808
Batista.

35:39.184 --> 35:40.810
OK.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.687
We just got a lead on the Trinity Killer.

35:45.106 --> 35:49.109
According to this, he had a delivery
two days ago in Jacksonville,

35:49.236 --> 35:52.071
and due back here last night.

35:52.197 --> 35:55.616
Yeah, well, I'm guessing Christine
found a way to warn him off.

36:05.377 --> 36:07.503
Well, hello, Mr. Toothbrush.

36:07.629 --> 36:09.255
(Laughs)

36:09.381 --> 36:11.131
Don't forget Mr. Comb.

36:12.217 --> 36:15.386
Oh, yeah.
We've got some DNA going on in here.

36:16.471 --> 36:18.264
Great.

36:29.067 --> 36:33.237
Dex, that guy that was bludgeoned,
you remember the kind of hammer?

36:33.363 --> 36:35.281
Uh, it was a Grant...

36:35.407 --> 36:36.907
24-ounce framing hammer?

36:38.368 --> 36:40.244
We got him.

36:40.370 --> 36:45.249
It's a little hard to believe this is the same
guy that never made a mistake in 30 years.

36:45.375 --> 36:47.793
Ah, I'm sure he made mistakes.

36:47.919 --> 36:49.628
We just weren't looking.

36:51.923 --> 36:55.593
A truck stop employee noticed
Stan Beaudry's truck during the night.

36:55.719 --> 36:59.471
PreIiminary investigations reveaIs evidence
pertinent to the Trinity kiIIings.

36:59.598 --> 37:03.017
At this point, we're trying to Iocate
Mr. Stan Beaudry.

37:03.143 --> 37:04.727
He's become our number one suspect.

37:04.853 --> 37:06.812
Stan Beaudry?

37:06.938 --> 37:08.772
(Cell phone rings)

37:13.987 --> 37:15.821
- Kyle?
- Daddy.

37:15.947 --> 37:18.824
- I told you not to call me.
- I'm in trouble, Daddy.

37:18.950 --> 37:21.118
- The police are...
- You're putting us both at risk.

37:21.244 --> 37:22.494
It isn't safe for us to talk.

37:22.621 --> 37:26.165
I'm on a neighbor's phone. I would never
do anything to put you in danger.

37:26.291 --> 37:30.169
You already have. You're a stupid girl!
Always getting in the way.

37:30.295 --> 37:31.629
I was protecting you.

37:31.755 --> 37:33.088
You've ruined everything.

37:33.214 --> 37:36.300
I... I did it because I love you.

37:42.891 --> 37:44.516
Just, uh...

37:44.643 --> 37:48.354
Just, um...meet me.

37:48.480 --> 37:50.856
Please. I can get past the cops.

37:50.982 --> 37:54.944
- I don't care. It's not my problem.
- But I need your help.

37:55.070 --> 37:57.112
You did this to yourself. You're on your own.

37:58.782 --> 38:00.783
How can you say that?

38:02.827 --> 38:05.204
- I'm your daughter.
- I'm sorry, Christine.

38:05.330 --> 38:08.374
I'm sorry... I'm sorry too.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.501
I'm sorry you were ever born.

38:14.381 --> 38:19.426
- Dad... (Sobs)
- Do not call me again ever.

38:23.181 --> 38:25.182
(Sobbing)

38:25.642 --> 38:29.853
No electric, no water.
Can't track him through his utilities.

38:29.980 --> 38:31.897
Someone needs
to take a look in here for...

38:32.023 --> 38:36.443
Detective Morgan? We just got word that
Christine Hill would like to speak with you.

38:36.569 --> 38:37.861
Only you.

38:37.988 --> 38:39.530
Fuckin'-A. She wants to confess.

38:39.656 --> 38:41.073
- I'm coming with you.
- Joey, come on.

38:41.199 --> 38:42.741
I'll stay outside.
She won't even know I'm there.

38:42.867 --> 38:44.910
Let's go.

38:47.497 --> 38:49.331
(Cell phone rings)

38:52.711 --> 38:55.212
- (   Carousel music)
- It hasn't been easy,

38:55.338 --> 38:58.257
but I was able to pull together
the funds you are demanding, Kyle.

38:58.383 --> 39:02.261
Well, that's good news.
That'll make both our lives a lot easier.

39:02.387 --> 39:04.763
I'll have the money at 7:00.

39:06.725 --> 39:10.769
I'll drop it in the trash container
nearest the lighthouse at Cape Florida.

39:10.895 --> 39:12.938
That location doesn't work for me, Arthur.

39:13.064 --> 39:15.983
The Palmetto Marina on the Miami river,

39:16.109 --> 39:20.362
leave it at the entrance to dock C,
and make it 8:00.

39:20.488 --> 39:22.656
You're the boss, KyIe.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.034
Glad you understand.

39:25.160 --> 39:27.494
I'll see you at 8:00.

39:28.913 --> 39:30.956
(Dexter) I'II see you in 1 5 minutes,

39:31.082 --> 39:33.542
because I know exactIy where
that music is coming from,

39:33.668 --> 39:35.210
and why you're there.

39:35.336 --> 39:37.254
Unfinished business.

39:37.380 --> 39:39.089
(Knocking)

39:39.215 --> 39:42.760
Christine, it's Detective Morgan.
Open up.

39:50.060 --> 39:51.685
Over there.

40:06.117 --> 40:07.951
Is there something you want to tell me?

40:09.829 --> 40:11.288
That motherfucker.

40:11.414 --> 40:14.374
Who? Quinn?
Because he had nothing to do...

40:14.501 --> 40:16.919
No, not Quinn. My dad.

40:20.256 --> 40:22.508
Christine, you can stop protecting him.

40:24.135 --> 40:27.012
We have his name.

40:27.138 --> 40:28.430
That's bullshit.

40:29.390 --> 40:30.766
We know he's Stan Beaudry.

40:32.185 --> 40:33.393
(Laughs)

40:35.230 --> 40:37.231
Oh, wow.

40:40.110 --> 40:41.944
Just tell me where he is.

40:44.030 --> 40:46.156
I tried to be a good daughter.

40:46.950 --> 40:49.159
You know...

40:50.203 --> 40:52.287
Make him love me.

40:54.582 --> 40:56.125
But he hates me.

40:58.545 --> 41:00.170
You don't need him to love you.

41:00.296 --> 41:01.588
Mm-hm.

41:02.966 --> 41:03.966
He's a killer.

41:04.092 --> 41:06.051
He is. He is.

41:06.177 --> 41:07.886
He's a killer.

41:08.012 --> 41:11.098
- He made his own choices...
- And I'm just like him.

41:12.725 --> 41:14.601
- You're not.
- I am.

41:18.773 --> 41:20.858
Your dad was a cop, right?

41:22.819 --> 41:24.027
Mm-hm.

41:24.779 --> 41:28.407
So you said, "Hey, I'll be a cop too.

41:28.533 --> 41:30.284
"Maybe then he'll love me."

41:35.498 --> 41:36.832
You know what I did?

41:39.419 --> 41:40.752
I shot you.

41:45.175 --> 41:46.758
I killed Lundy.

41:46.885 --> 41:48.552
(Inhales sharply)

41:54.267 --> 41:55.559
OK.

41:57.562 --> 41:59.563
I'm so sorry.

42:05.612 --> 42:07.279
Let's just get you to the station.

42:09.449 --> 42:10.866
Can you forgive me?

42:10.992 --> 42:12.868
Oh...

42:18.166 --> 42:20.167
Are you kidding me?

42:25.590 --> 42:27.633
I came here to do a job.

42:27.759 --> 42:30.802
I came here to take you in
and to get justice for Lundy,

42:30.929 --> 42:32.930
but forgive you?

42:33.056 --> 42:34.973
Fuck you.

42:39.103 --> 42:41.104
Let's just get to the station.

42:41.231 --> 42:42.898
Wait. No, don't! Don't!

42:43.024 --> 42:44.650
(Gunshot)

42:45.777 --> 42:48.403
- What happened?
- Quinn, don't.

43:00.375 --> 43:01.875
(Child screams)

43:09.425 --> 43:12.302
I've searched the entire fucking arcade.

43:12.428 --> 43:14.429
Where are you, Arthur?

43:14.555 --> 43:16.306
(Cell phone rings)

43:18.101 --> 43:19.977
- Hey, Deb.
- Where are you?

43:20.103 --> 43:23.313
Just taking care of business.
What's up?

43:23.439 --> 43:26.316
Trinity's daughter
just confessed to everything...

43:27.944 --> 43:30.153
and then killed herself.

43:30.655 --> 43:32.781
In front of me.

43:33.408 --> 43:36.159
- Are you OK?
- I'm in one piece.

43:37.287 --> 43:40.497
Could really use some family
right about now, and you're it.

43:40.623 --> 43:43.542
(Dexter) Who am I right now?
Dexter Morgan, seriaI kiIIer,

43:43.668 --> 43:45.961
or Dexter Morgan, brother?

43:48.172 --> 43:50.215
I'm on my way.

44:22.123 --> 44:23.749
I need to be a good brother now

44:23.875 --> 44:26.376
so that I can be a good seriaI kiIIer Iater.

44:49.817 --> 44:51.234
Excuse me.

44:51.361 --> 44:54.112
Could you tell me if there's
a Kyle Butler working here?

44:54.238 --> 44:56.073
Sure.

45:00.745 --> 45:02.954
Mm, sorry.
There's no one by that name.

45:03.081 --> 45:05.415
My mistake.

45:21.933 --> 45:23.433
Excuse me, sir.

45:23.559 --> 45:25.310
You're good.

45:33.569 --> 45:35.487
Hey.

45:47.583 --> 45:49.876
I'm afraid to erase his name.

45:55.842 --> 45:57.801
Why?

45:59.720 --> 46:01.805
'Cause then this is all over.

46:03.808 --> 46:05.142
I guess it is.

46:08.980 --> 46:10.856
And Frank's still dead.

46:10.982 --> 46:13.483
Yeah. He is.

46:18.156 --> 46:19.489
I mean...

46:20.783 --> 46:22.492
I'm not stupid.

46:25.580 --> 46:28.707
I knew finding his killer
wouldn't bring him back, but...

46:35.006 --> 46:37.299
I thought it would bring something.

46:48.019 --> 46:49.519
You want me to do it?

46:52.064 --> 46:53.940
Yeah.

46:59.030 --> 47:00.363
No.

47:07.413 --> 47:09.414
I've got it.

47:56.003 --> 47:58.964
Hey, hang tough, hermano.

48:06.889 --> 48:08.723
(Elevator bell dings)

48:54.604 --> 48:56.521
My, my.

49:01.777 --> 49:03.653
(Laughs)

49:13.289 --> 49:15.457
Why, Mr. Beaudry...

49:16.959 --> 49:19.085
you've done me a kindness.

49:36.187 --> 49:37.228
No.

50:03.839 --> 50:05.131
Hello...

50:06.550 --> 50:08.551
Dexter Morgan.
