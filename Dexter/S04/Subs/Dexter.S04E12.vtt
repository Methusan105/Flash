00:02.049 --> 00:03.549
PreviousIy on Dexter...

00:03.676 --> 00:06.219
Dexter Morgan,
good suburban husband,

00:06.345 --> 00:07.762
happy father of three.

00:07.888 --> 00:09.263
Living the dream.

00:09.390 --> 00:10.682
(Whispers) Daddy kills people.

00:10.808 --> 00:12.975
It's always the same
three kills with Trinity -

00:13.102 --> 00:14.602
a young woman in a bathtub

00:14.728 --> 00:16.771
followed by a mother
falling to her death

00:16.897 --> 00:18.648
and ending with
a man getting bludgeoned.

00:20.401 --> 00:23.986
Trinity... He doesn't beIong here.
lt doesn't make sense.

00:24.113 --> 00:26.489
- Hi, honey.
- Trinity's a husband.

00:26.615 --> 00:28.616
A father. He's...

00:28.742 --> 00:30.076
like me.

00:31.412 --> 00:34.038
Lundy came to Miami to hunt this guy.

00:34.164 --> 00:36.916
I think he got too close,
and I think it got him killed.

00:37.042 --> 00:38.167
(Gunshot)

00:38.293 --> 00:40.795
I need a partner, Dexter.
Someone I can trust.

00:40.921 --> 00:43.089
Unless you can be
completely honest with me,

00:43.215 --> 00:46.134
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:46.260 --> 00:47.301
I'm married.

00:47.428 --> 00:49.721
Stay the hell away from my wife.

00:49.847 --> 00:51.764
There's onIy one person
who can heIp me.

00:51.890 --> 00:53.307
- Arthur Mitchell.
- Kyle Butler.

00:53.434 --> 00:56.018
Four Walls, One Heart.
We build homes for the homeless.

00:56.145 --> 00:59.814
Still so much to learn
about handIing the kids and the wife.

00:59.940 --> 01:02.608
- Choose your weapon.
- Or maybe not.

01:03.402 --> 01:05.528
(Motor revving)

01:05.654 --> 01:07.321
Kill him now.

01:07.448 --> 01:09.824
No more confessions,
no more good deeds,

01:09.950 --> 01:12.452
and no more fucking remorse.

01:12.578 --> 01:13.786
This isn't how you die.

01:13.912 --> 01:15.621
(Jonah) It's been my dad's baby for years.

01:15.748 --> 01:18.332
Fucking hate you!
Fucking asshole!

01:18.459 --> 01:20.334
(Grunting)

01:20.461 --> 01:21.669
Get the fuck...

01:21.795 --> 01:23.421
off of him!

01:24.465 --> 01:28.134
I should have fucking killed you
when I had the chance.

01:28.886 --> 01:32.138
Did you and my father
have a romantic relationship?

01:32.264 --> 01:35.391
I was one of his girlfriends,
if that's what you're asking.

01:35.517 --> 01:36.476
There were others?

01:36.602 --> 01:38.728
Laura Moser, my mother.

01:38.854 --> 01:40.980
- You remember now?
- l have a brother.

01:41.106 --> 01:43.149
Watching mom die...

01:43.275 --> 01:45.777
(Harry) It's all right, little guy.
You're safe now.

01:45.903 --> 01:46.986
(Boy grunting)

01:47.112 --> 01:48.154
Arthur!

01:50.866 --> 01:53.242
Oh, my God.
The boys begin the cycIe.

01:53.368 --> 01:57.413
If I can make the poIice think the Trinity
Killer is someone else, Arthur's all mine.

01:57.539 --> 01:59.248
Stan Beaudry.

01:59.374 --> 02:01.375
(Harry) A decoy.

02:01.502 --> 02:05.296
I just need to make sure
the police find Arthur's DNA.

02:05.422 --> 02:08.216
Stan Beaudry
is now the Trinity KiIIer.

02:08.342 --> 02:11.677
- I killed Lundy.
- Wait, no! Don't, don't!

02:11.804 --> 02:13.596
(Gunshot)

02:13.722 --> 02:15.890
(Arthur) Who are you, KyIe?

02:16.809 --> 02:18.810
What is it you want?

02:28.904 --> 02:31.614
Hello...Dexter Morgan.

04:25.437 --> 04:28.105
He knows my name, occupation.

04:28.231 --> 04:30.566
He can find out about my famiIy.

04:30.692 --> 04:33.027
My famiIy.

04:33.153 --> 04:35.154
What the hell have l done?

04:40.160 --> 04:42.078
I'm sorry, sir.
You're on the wrong floor.

04:42.204 --> 04:45.164
No, it's exactly the right floor.

04:53.006 --> 04:54.757
We should talk somewhere else.

04:54.883 --> 04:57.051
Somewhere private...

04:57.177 --> 05:00.763
so you can extort money
from the Trinity Killer?

05:05.477 --> 05:08.062
So what do you want?

05:08.188 --> 05:11.023
I want you to disappear from my life.

05:12.734 --> 05:14.026
Like a ghost.

05:14.152 --> 05:16.862
A really annoying ghost.

05:16.989 --> 05:18.864
And you'll disappear from my life?

05:18.991 --> 05:22.076
I couldn't care less about your life.

05:22.202 --> 05:24.203
Or death.

05:25.038 --> 05:27.039
Unless you get in my way.

05:38.010 --> 05:40.136
If I were you, I'd give up vigilanteism.

05:40.262 --> 05:42.430
You're not very good at it.

05:44.599 --> 05:46.142
Goodbye...

05:47.102 --> 05:49.020
Dexter Morgan.

05:52.107 --> 05:55.192
He's right. I screwed up.
l let it come to this.

06:03.410 --> 06:05.202
But no more.

06:10.625 --> 06:12.543
No fucking more.

06:32.814 --> 06:34.106
Morgan.

06:34.232 --> 06:35.733
Come on, Quinn. Not today.

06:35.859 --> 06:38.152
Jesus, Morgan, middle of the day,
you're out again?

06:38.278 --> 06:40.821
Yeah, I have some
secondary analysis to do

06:40.947 --> 06:42.698
- on the Kyle Butler case.
- There's a spatter report

06:42.824 --> 06:45.284
on Christine Hill's suicide sitting
on your desk - you even look at it?

06:45.410 --> 06:46.952
I don't need to.
It's a cut-and-dry suicide.

06:47.079 --> 06:48.788
Yeah, but you have to sign off on it.

06:48.914 --> 06:51.499
That's how it works - you sign off,
case closed. It gets put in a file cabinet

06:51.625 --> 06:53.709
so I don't have to think about it
or hear about it

06:53.835 --> 06:55.753
- or be fucking reminded of it...
- I'll get to it.

06:55.879 --> 06:57.296
What, when you're done chasing tail?

06:57.422 --> 07:00.007
You do not want to question
my loyalty to my family, Quinn.

07:00.133 --> 07:01.342
Not today.

07:01.468 --> 07:04.095
Do your fucking job!

07:09.309 --> 07:12.478
Great. Fucking mess.

07:13.522 --> 07:15.064
(Tires squealing)

07:17.109 --> 07:18.692
Do you even have a plan here?

07:18.819 --> 07:20.653
Follow him and look
for an opportunity.

07:20.779 --> 07:22.655
What if he keeps on driving?

07:24.533 --> 07:27.701
- Then I keep on driving.
- (Cell phone rings)

07:27.828 --> 07:29.912
- It's Rita.
- Don't answer it.

07:30.038 --> 07:32.206
Could be important, about the baby
or something. Hey, you.

07:32.332 --> 07:35.334
(Rita) I have something
very important to say.

07:35.460 --> 07:36.377
Everything OK?

07:36.503 --> 07:38.587
(Car honking)

07:38.713 --> 07:40.381
I want my honeymoon

07:40.507 --> 07:42.424
with you this weekend.

07:44.928 --> 07:47.054
Uh, it's not really a good time.

07:48.849 --> 07:51.851
It's a perfect time. Astor and Cody
will be in Disney World.

07:53.395 --> 07:56.272
With Paul's parents.
I know, I remember.

07:56.898 --> 07:59.608
And Harrison will be with us,
but it'll still be romantic.

07:59.734 --> 08:02.194
I think it's...fantastic.

08:02.320 --> 08:05.447
Great. I'll start booking
flights and a hotel and...

08:06.032 --> 08:07.867
- (Man) Hey!
- Gotta go.

08:09.202 --> 08:11.078
What the...fuck, man!

08:11.204 --> 08:13.873
(Sighs) Told you not to answer it.

08:13.999 --> 08:15.749
I'll deal with it later.

08:15.876 --> 08:17.960
The messes are piling up.

09:04.674 --> 09:07.927
IsoIated. No security. Perfect.

09:11.264 --> 09:12.556
Gotta risk it.

09:12.682 --> 09:14.600
May be the onIy opportunity I get.

09:31.743 --> 09:33.786
Three postcards
don't have a match.

09:33.912 --> 09:35.496
Trinity sent these
to Christine from Cheyenne,

09:35.622 --> 09:37.331
Topeka, and Bloomington, Illinois.

09:37.457 --> 09:39.083
- Morgan...
- Lundy never uncovered

09:39.209 --> 09:41.126
Trinity killings in these cities...

09:41.253 --> 09:43.337
which means there could be
as many more as nine murders.

09:43.463 --> 09:45.214
- Go home.
- I'm gonna call Homicide

09:45.340 --> 09:46.465
in each of these cities.

09:46.591 --> 09:49.218
Christine Hill just committed suicide.

09:49.344 --> 09:51.011
In front of you.

09:51.137 --> 09:52.554
Four hours ago.

09:52.681 --> 09:55.182
Now, take a personal day.
Get some closure.

09:55.308 --> 09:56.976
- That's an order.
- These cities...

09:57.102 --> 10:00.020
I'll call their Homicide departments.

10:00.146 --> 10:03.691
- Stan Beaudry is...
- Is our number one Trinity suspect.

10:03.817 --> 10:05.651
We're on it.

10:06.403 --> 10:08.696
What's she still doing here?

10:08.822 --> 10:10.823
She's going.

10:12.951 --> 10:15.244
Closure, huh?

10:18.915 --> 10:22.418
Some of the cities
on these postcards...

10:25.588 --> 10:26.880
What?

10:27.007 --> 10:28.716
You're my husband.

10:28.842 --> 10:31.218
And I have a wife.

10:31.344 --> 10:33.679
So...what do we do now?

10:34.806 --> 10:36.724
We find the Trinity Killer.

10:36.850 --> 10:38.726
No. I mean, do we...

10:38.852 --> 10:40.352
move in together?

10:40.478 --> 10:41.895
Married people do that.

10:42.022 --> 10:44.189
My house?

10:44.316 --> 10:46.358
Your house sounds fine.

10:47.652 --> 10:50.070
Valerie? Debra Morgan.

10:50.989 --> 10:52.614
Yeah, fine.

10:52.741 --> 10:54.908
You said my dad left you
for another CI?

10:55.035 --> 10:56.535
You followed him to her house?

10:56.661 --> 10:59.538
Any chance you remember
where she lives?

11:00.790 --> 11:02.416
Really? Great.

11:02.542 --> 11:05.377
My dayjust got wide open.
You up for a road trip?

11:11.843 --> 11:13.510
(Car alarm chirps)

11:17.223 --> 11:18.891
(Grunting)

11:29.402 --> 11:31.779
(Exhales)

11:31.905 --> 11:34.031
Finally, it's over.

11:48.254 --> 11:51.590
Savings account closed.
Checking account closed.

11:55.428 --> 11:57.971
You were gonna leave town,
weren't you?

11:58.098 --> 12:00.974
And probably leave
your family destitute too.

12:01.101 --> 12:03.977
Eventually the police
will see through Stan Beaudry,

12:04.104 --> 12:06.105
and they'll get on to you.

12:09.943 --> 12:11.902
But you'll be missing
with all your money,

12:12.028 --> 12:14.655
and everyone will assume...

12:14.781 --> 12:16.949
that you skipped the country.

12:17.742 --> 12:20.202
Luck is finally working with me.

12:21.621 --> 12:23.205
(Chatter)

12:23.331 --> 12:26.125
(Man) That's the car right there
that swiped me over on Riverside.

12:26.251 --> 12:27.918
Seriously? Fuck!

12:42.267 --> 12:43.392
(Chatter)

12:43.518 --> 12:46.145
Hey, that's him! That's the prick.

12:46.271 --> 12:48.355
- Who, me?
- You fucking hit my car!

12:48.481 --> 12:50.524
Learn how to drive, you idiot.

12:50.650 --> 12:53.527
'Cause being rude always helps
in a tense situation, right?

12:53.653 --> 12:55.529
- Calm down.
- Look, I'm sorry.

12:55.655 --> 12:57.698
I was on my way
to a crime scene.

12:57.824 --> 12:59.199
Miami Metro, Forensics.

12:59.325 --> 13:01.368
Come on, he's working
the whole cop brotherhood angle?

13:01.494 --> 13:02.995
No one's above the law, pal.

13:03.121 --> 13:05.038
OK. Be cool.

13:05.165 --> 13:06.874
DipIomatic.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.543
Look, obviously, I'll pay
for whatever the damage is.

13:09.669 --> 13:12.713
- You fled the scene of an accident.
- I didn't flee. I was in a hurry.

13:12.839 --> 13:14.715
- To solve a crime.
- So you stop at a bank?

13:14.841 --> 13:15.757
That's bullshit!

13:15.884 --> 13:19.178
I'm just asking for a little
professional courtesy here.

13:19.304 --> 13:20.679
You might pull that shit
down at Miami Metro,

13:20.805 --> 13:22.890
but here at the Sheriff's Department,
we don't put up with that shit.

13:23.016 --> 13:24.099
- Come on!
- Caught on tape, asshole.

13:24.225 --> 13:26.185
Don't fucking point that thing at me.

13:26.311 --> 13:27.561
All right, come here.

13:27.687 --> 13:30.063
OK, buddy, we're taking you in.

13:30.190 --> 13:32.316
So much for dipIomacy.

13:38.573 --> 13:41.325
- You sure this is the right block?
- Pretty sure.

13:44.704 --> 13:46.413
- Want one?
- Quit.

13:46.539 --> 13:49.416
Ugh. I remember when
your dad stopped, cold turkey.

13:49.542 --> 13:51.418
If Harry said he was gonna
do something, he did it.

13:51.544 --> 13:53.587
- He was a good man.
- He was a man-whore.

13:53.713 --> 13:55.464
Yeah, but he was a lot
of other things too.

13:55.590 --> 13:57.299
Like he always made me feel safe.

13:57.425 --> 13:59.301
And the crowd I ran with -
that meant a lot.

13:59.427 --> 14:01.178
Here it is.

14:04.766 --> 14:06.600
What's wrong?

14:06.726 --> 14:09.102
- Fucking can't be.
- No. This is it.

14:09.229 --> 14:11.396
I remember the porch.

14:11.523 --> 14:13.232
Why, what is it?

14:14.859 --> 14:16.485
I've been here before.

14:18.571 --> 14:19.780
(Grunting)

14:19.906 --> 14:21.573
Aah!

14:21.699 --> 14:22.991
Oh, God!

14:23.117 --> 14:24.785
He brought me here.

14:24.911 --> 14:26.578
Who did?

14:31.084 --> 14:33.752
The Ice Truck Killer. Brian Moser.

14:33.878 --> 14:35.128
That was her name!

14:35.255 --> 14:38.715
Laura Moser.
She had two little boys.

14:43.805 --> 14:45.847
Dad, who the hell were you?

14:55.608 --> 14:56.733
(Exhales)

14:56.859 --> 14:58.819
I don't have time for this shit.

14:58.945 --> 15:00.612
Why are you even in here?

15:00.738 --> 15:02.823
Because of Arthur fucking Mitchell.

15:02.949 --> 15:04.783
Wrong.

15:05.535 --> 15:09.538
All right, I'm here because
I didn't follow the code.

15:09.664 --> 15:13.458
Everything you taught me
was to keep me out of here.

15:13.585 --> 15:15.294
- What else?
- What do you want me to say?

15:15.420 --> 15:17.588
I'm here because I lost it?
Yes. I fucking lost it.

15:17.714 --> 15:19.756
On a fucking cop!

15:19.882 --> 15:21.967
- Like a fucking amateur.
- Fuck you!

15:22.093 --> 15:24.177
It's your number one rule -
don't get caught.

15:24.304 --> 15:25.512
They were gonna find him.

15:25.638 --> 15:27.973
They were gonna find me
with an unconscious man.

15:28.099 --> 15:30.142
That's not why you lost it.

15:30.268 --> 15:32.394
That's not why you're in here.

15:32.520 --> 15:35.314
I couldn't just let them
find him, God damn it.

15:35.440 --> 15:38.233
I have to be the one to kill him.

15:40.194 --> 15:42.279
I have to know he's gone.

15:44.032 --> 15:46.033
For my family.

15:46.159 --> 15:47.659
Exactly.

15:48.661 --> 15:51.246
You can't think clearly
because of them.

15:52.665 --> 15:54.583
They've done this to you.

15:56.461 --> 15:58.879
No, my dark passenger
has done this to me.

15:59.005 --> 16:01.131
It's ruining my life.

16:02.050 --> 16:03.759
It is your life.

16:07.180 --> 16:09.139
I don't want it to be.

16:12.018 --> 16:14.019
I don't want it.

16:17.857 --> 16:19.650
- You said you had something?
- Nothing good.

16:19.776 --> 16:21.777
Been back-checking
Stan Beaudry's trucking routes,

16:21.903 --> 16:23.570
dug up a couple of past employers.

16:23.696 --> 16:26.365
They put him 3,000 miles away
from Pittsburgh in '89

16:26.491 --> 16:27.783
and Sacramento in '92.

16:27.909 --> 16:30.202
And Beaudry's only been
connected to a prostitute kill.

16:30.328 --> 16:31.745
Nothing ritualized about it.

16:31.871 --> 16:35.290
I told Matthews it was too soon
to release Beaudry to the press.

16:35.416 --> 16:37.876
If he's not our guy,
we're gonna look like fools.

16:38.002 --> 16:39.878
I knew it wasn't Beaudry.

16:40.922 --> 16:42.964
What? I'm smarter
than the rest of you.

16:43.091 --> 16:45.801
Then how do you explain
Trinity's DNA showing up

16:45.927 --> 16:48.053
- in Beaudry's rig and shack?
- Yeah, smart man.

16:48.179 --> 16:50.138
Well, I can't...yet.

16:50.264 --> 16:52.683
(LaGuerta) Sergeant, you find something?

16:53.559 --> 16:55.727
I spoke with Bloomington Homicide.

16:55.853 --> 16:57.562
I asked about the dates
on this postmark.

16:57.689 --> 17:00.607
Summer of '92,
there was a bathtub murder,

17:00.733 --> 17:02.442
a jumper, and a bludgeoning.

17:02.568 --> 17:05.237
I see a big "but" on your face.

17:05.363 --> 17:06.279
What?

17:06.406 --> 17:09.241
Guy said it was
the worst month of his life.

17:09.367 --> 17:12.160
In addition to those murders,
there was a ten-year-old boy missing

17:12.286 --> 17:14.579
five days prior to the bathtub kill.

17:15.581 --> 17:18.500
Last week, that ten-year-old boy
went missing here.

17:18.626 --> 17:20.627
- Scott Smith.
- Exactly.

17:20.753 --> 17:22.421
So I called a few cities.

17:23.589 --> 17:25.173
Ten-year-old boys missing?

17:25.299 --> 17:27.300
Every time.

17:27.427 --> 17:30.137
Five days before
each cycle began.

17:30.263 --> 17:33.849
And Lundy was only looking
at homicides, not missing persons.

17:33.975 --> 17:35.183
Get Scott Smith down here.

17:35.309 --> 17:38.854
Let's check every Trinity city
for missing ten-year-olds.

17:38.980 --> 17:41.773
We may be looking
at a whole new pattern.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.530
(Computer beeps)

17:54.620 --> 17:56.538
"Brian and...

17:56.664 --> 17:59.124
"Dexter Moser"?

18:05.465 --> 18:07.466
Dexter Morgan?

18:07.592 --> 18:08.508
Yeah.

18:08.634 --> 18:10.343
It's your lucky day.

18:10.470 --> 18:11.511
Yeah. It feels like it.

18:11.637 --> 18:13.555
We're outta bunks for the night.

18:15.933 --> 18:17.851
There's a shot
Arthur's still unconscious.

18:17.977 --> 18:19.060
Bummer.

18:19.187 --> 18:21.646
Yeah, well, budget cuts
are gettin' worse and worse.

18:21.773 --> 18:23.190
But since you're Miami Metro,

18:23.316 --> 18:26.651
we figured we could at least
do you the favor of calling your wife,

18:26.778 --> 18:29.654
- have her come pick you up.
- My wife?

18:35.995 --> 18:39.247
How is it I can kiII peopIe
and feeI no regret...

18:41.000 --> 18:44.836
but disappointing Rita makes me feeI
like the scum of the earth?

18:45.671 --> 18:47.798
I'm sorry.

18:47.924 --> 18:49.132
I know.

18:50.968 --> 18:53.094
I just had a...

18:54.096 --> 18:56.181
bad day and...

18:56.307 --> 18:57.557
let it get to me, I guess.

18:57.683 --> 19:01.186
First it was smashing that light,
which was...weird.

19:01.312 --> 19:04.022
And then you punched Elliot,
which I actually liked.

19:04.148 --> 19:07.275
But now you...
pick a fight with a sheriff?

19:09.028 --> 19:11.112
I don't understand.
I want to, but...

19:11.239 --> 19:13.114
I wish I could explain.

19:13.241 --> 19:15.575
Try. Please.

19:19.455 --> 19:21.915
Sometimes I'm just goin' along,

19:22.041 --> 19:25.210
and everything seems OK,
and then this...

19:26.712 --> 19:29.339
darkness creeps in,
and it takes over.

19:31.217 --> 19:33.385
Makes you sound crazy.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.389
Maybe I am.

19:37.515 --> 19:39.432
No.

19:39.559 --> 19:41.309
No, I don't believe that.

19:47.733 --> 19:49.943
I'll be right behind you.

20:14.260 --> 20:15.552
Shit.

20:21.601 --> 20:25.061
Well, you actually think Dad'll let you
go to the winter prom?

20:25.187 --> 20:28.648
- He doesn't have to know.
- We can figure something out.

20:28.774 --> 20:30.525
(Thud)

20:32.361 --> 20:34.863
Arthur! We didn't know
when to expect you.

20:34.989 --> 20:37.657
Bring me yourjewelry -
gold, silver, anything with a stone in it.

20:37.783 --> 20:39.451
And all the cash in your purse.

20:39.577 --> 20:42.662
- Why? What's wrong?
- And your wedding ring.

20:42.788 --> 20:44.164
No. This is mine.

20:44.290 --> 20:45.498
- Arthur!
- Hey!

20:45.625 --> 20:46.625
Don't, Jonah, no!

20:46.751 --> 20:48.168
- OK.
- Daddy, what's happening?

20:48.294 --> 20:50.670
I need the money you keep
behind your headboard.

20:50.796 --> 20:52.339
Don't pretend. I know it's there!

20:52.465 --> 20:54.382
- No, Daddy! Daddy, why...
- The silver pendant I gave you.

20:54.508 --> 20:56.676
- Now!
- What the hell is goin' on?

20:56.802 --> 20:59.512
- What did you do?
- Arthur, please, no!

21:00.181 --> 21:02.515
You're lucky I don't pull
the fillings out of your teeth!

21:02.642 --> 21:05.810
Don't ever question me!
I gave you everything you have.

21:05.937 --> 21:08.313
I will take it all away!

21:09.273 --> 21:12.525
Collect your things.
I've got some business to attend to.

21:12.652 --> 21:14.861
Other than stealing
from your family?

21:14.987 --> 21:16.237
Jonah.

21:16.948 --> 21:19.240
Someone stole something from me.

21:20.451 --> 21:22.452
And I'm gonna find him.

21:24.622 --> 21:26.915
We... We should just go.

21:27.041 --> 21:29.000
Leave and never come back.

21:29.126 --> 21:30.710
He'll find us.

21:30.836 --> 21:32.504
This... This is our chance.

21:32.630 --> 21:35.215
He's... He's in trouble. He's insane.

21:35.341 --> 21:37.008
- Mom!
- What?

21:37.134 --> 21:38.551
Please.

21:38.678 --> 21:41.096
We'll live in fear.

21:41.222 --> 21:43.974
We already do.

21:53.859 --> 21:56.152
Debra. Oh, sorry.

21:56.278 --> 21:58.071
Detective Morgan.
Have a seat.

21:58.197 --> 22:00.240
Thanks for your time,
Deputy Chief.

22:00.366 --> 22:01.950
I know you're busy.

22:02.076 --> 22:04.285
I need to talk to you about a case.

22:04.412 --> 22:07.455
It was one of my father's
old cases from a long time ago.

22:07.581 --> 22:10.417
And you're the only one
still around from those days.

22:10.543 --> 22:13.253
Suddenly I feel ancient.

22:13.379 --> 22:16.506
Look, it was a quadruple homicide...

22:16.632 --> 22:18.633
out at the ports.

22:19.802 --> 22:21.761
In a shipping container.

22:21.887 --> 22:24.597
- You were there?
- No. Wasn't my case.

22:24.724 --> 22:27.767
But I remember Harry's face
when he came back from it.

22:27.893 --> 22:30.729
Said he'd never seen
so much blood.

22:30.855 --> 22:33.023
- (Cell phone vibrates)
- Sorry.

22:40.406 --> 22:43.992
My dad said Dexter's parents
died in a car accident.

22:46.203 --> 22:48.371
That's not true, is it?

22:49.874 --> 22:51.291
No.

22:51.417 --> 22:55.503
My father's CI, Laura Moser,

22:55.629 --> 22:58.465
was murdered
in that shipping container.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.843
She had two boys.

23:03.637 --> 23:06.056
One of those boys was Dexter?

23:08.642 --> 23:10.769
Please tell me the truth.

23:14.774 --> 23:16.274
Harry adopted him.

23:17.443 --> 23:19.652
The other boy was too damaged
by the incident.

23:19.779 --> 23:21.780
(Whispers) No shit.

23:22.364 --> 23:24.365
He grew up to be the Ice Truck Killer.

23:26.160 --> 23:28.036
You knew.

23:28.162 --> 23:29.871
(Cell phone vibrates)

23:30.790 --> 23:33.333
Debra, your father
wanted to protect you.

23:33.459 --> 23:36.211
He didn't want either
one of you to ever know.

23:36.337 --> 23:39.005
And you both turned out
pretty damn well.

23:39.131 --> 23:41.007
So I think he made the right call.

23:41.133 --> 23:42.842
Yeah?

23:43.594 --> 23:45.970
Well, I know now.

23:46.639 --> 23:49.557
What the hell am I supposed
to do with this?

23:49.683 --> 23:51.434
You keep it to yourself.

23:52.478 --> 23:53.686
(Cell phone vibrates)

23:53.813 --> 23:55.355
Oh, fuck! Jesus!

23:55.481 --> 23:57.649
Quinn, what?

23:57.775 --> 23:59.776
I'll be right there.

24:09.370 --> 24:10.912
(Click)

24:23.592 --> 24:25.593
(Chuckles)

24:35.062 --> 24:37.939
We should go
to the Keys tomorrow.

24:38.858 --> 24:40.525
For our honeymoon.

24:40.651 --> 24:42.861
No, I'm not sure that's...

24:42.987 --> 24:45.071
You can fly down in the morning.
I'll follow you after work.

24:45.197 --> 24:47.740
Have a spa day. Indulge.

24:47.867 --> 24:49.742
Please?

24:51.745 --> 24:54.998
- Dexter, uh...
- Look, I know you're upset.

24:56.250 --> 24:57.876
You have every right to be.

25:00.212 --> 25:03.548
Having to pick up
another husband from jail.

25:05.551 --> 25:08.386
You... You think I'm upset
because you're like Paul?

25:09.388 --> 25:11.389
I'm worse.

25:11.515 --> 25:13.808
- I know.
- Dexter.

25:14.852 --> 25:18.146
Whenever they picked up Paul,
it was a relief.

25:19.064 --> 25:20.982
And life got easier.

25:22.234 --> 25:24.402
Without you...

25:28.115 --> 25:30.575
You're the most important
person in our lives.

25:33.120 --> 25:35.914
What's upsetting me
is the idea of losing you.

25:39.168 --> 25:40.793
You have your demons.

25:40.920 --> 25:42.879
I accept that.

25:43.005 --> 25:46.007
Because I know that you don't
have to be a slave to them.

25:46.133 --> 25:48.426
I wish that were true.

25:48.552 --> 25:50.303
It is.

25:50.429 --> 25:52.639
(Chuckles) I know you.

25:52.765 --> 25:55.266
Better than you know yourself.

25:56.477 --> 25:59.979
You can conquer
whatever darkness there is in you.

26:00.105 --> 26:02.065
I know you can.

26:08.239 --> 26:10.365
I want to be that man.

26:13.619 --> 26:15.495
You already are.

26:15.621 --> 26:17.664
Please.

26:17.790 --> 26:20.750
Please fly to the Keys
tomorrow morning.

26:21.460 --> 26:23.336
I wanna meet you.

26:26.507 --> 26:28.925
Truly, there's nowhere
I'd rather be.

26:43.399 --> 26:45.316
Trinity sure went to a lot of effort

26:45.442 --> 26:47.610
to make us think that
Beaudry was our guy.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.530
Planting DNA.
Planting Lundy's murder books.

26:50.656 --> 26:53.157
Have we heard back from
any more Homicide departments?

26:53.284 --> 26:56.244
Almost every town. Ten-year-old boys
missing in all of them.

26:56.370 --> 26:58.037
Quinn is talking
to Scott Smith now.

26:58.163 --> 26:59.122
No, I'm not.

26:59.248 --> 27:01.666
I called in someone who knows
about being kidnapped.

27:02.459 --> 27:05.712
Someone took me once too.

27:05.838 --> 27:07.046
Without my permission.

27:07.172 --> 27:10.383
- Were you scared?
- Most scared I've ever been in my life.

27:13.262 --> 27:15.930
And...as much as I want to forget,

27:16.056 --> 27:19.684
there are all these
little things I remember.

27:21.186 --> 27:24.188
The way his breath
smelled like medicine.

27:24.315 --> 27:26.274
The bad man.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.401
Used medicine on me.

27:29.486 --> 27:31.112
When I was getting in the van.

27:32.364 --> 27:34.240
Do you remember any
little things about the van?

27:34.366 --> 27:37.660
It was empty.
Except for some papers.

27:39.204 --> 27:40.705
There was a picture on it.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.916
Do you remember what it looked like?

27:45.210 --> 27:47.378
Uh...

28:01.643 --> 28:03.644
We're looking for this logo.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.819
(Police radio chatter)

28:15.783 --> 28:16.908
We've got something.

28:17.034 --> 28:19.535
We walked cadaver dogs
over the whole area.

28:19.661 --> 28:22.663
They led us to this spot,
and the guys started digging.

28:22.790 --> 28:25.416
(Quinn) They found something
buried under the patio.

28:29.296 --> 28:31.422
All right, hold up.

28:47.398 --> 28:49.607
(Coughs)

28:50.609 --> 28:52.193
Male victim.

28:52.319 --> 28:54.987
Approximate age...
ten years old.

28:55.114 --> 28:56.697
Badly decomposed.

28:56.824 --> 28:58.366
Looks to be wearing pajamas.

28:58.492 --> 29:00.493
They found Scott Smith
wearing pajamas.

29:00.619 --> 29:04.163
I'll call Judge Morales at home,
have her get a warrant started.

29:04.289 --> 29:06.999
(Debra) I'll get the names of everyone
who volunteered on this build.

29:07.126 --> 29:10.711
(Batista) Make it everyone who volunteered
for Four Walls nationwide.

29:10.838 --> 29:12.505
Cross-check 'em
with Trinity's cities.

29:12.631 --> 29:16.259
We'll find Trinity's real name,
then we'll take this motherfucker down.

29:43.412 --> 29:45.872
You're a little piggy, Dexter Morgan.

29:54.506 --> 29:56.340
"Debra Morgan."

29:58.093 --> 29:59.760
Debra Morgan!

30:00.846 --> 30:02.346
Fucking Debra!

30:03.432 --> 30:06.017
Astor and Cody,
Disney World awaits.

30:06.977 --> 30:09.562
They'II be safe there
with Mickey, Minnie,

30:09.688 --> 30:11.856
and their goofy grandparents.

30:18.197 --> 30:20.198
Now for the rest of my famiIy.

30:20.657 --> 30:22.450
Found it!

30:22.576 --> 30:24.577
(Rita) Oh.

30:24.703 --> 30:26.913
(Chuckles)

30:27.039 --> 30:29.040
Wish I could go with you right now.

30:29.166 --> 30:30.917
Me too.

30:31.043 --> 30:33.794
I just got a few loose ends to tie up at work,
and I'll see you tonight.

30:33.921 --> 30:35.671
Can't wait.

30:37.216 --> 30:38.716
Me either.

30:39.426 --> 30:41.719
Can't wait to be with my famiIy.

30:43.388 --> 30:46.390
Can't wait to be done
with Arthur Mitchell.

30:49.228 --> 30:51.521
I just need a cIue where he's headed.

30:54.191 --> 30:55.775
Receipts.

30:55.901 --> 30:57.944
Drug store.
Auto shop estimate.

30:58.070 --> 31:00.404
Dry-cIeaner, groceries, gas.

31:00.531 --> 31:03.574
No bus, train, or pIane tickets.

31:05.035 --> 31:07.787
OnIy one other pIace I can check.

31:09.581 --> 31:11.582
(Ringing doorbell)

31:12.668 --> 31:14.335
(Knocking)

31:16.505 --> 31:18.881
- Mr. Butler, what...
- Jonah, have you seen your father?

31:19.007 --> 31:22.510
Yeah, he blew through here last night
looking for anything he could sell.

31:22.636 --> 31:24.971
Jonah! Who is...

31:25.097 --> 31:27.139
- Kyle.
- He's asking about Dad.

31:27.266 --> 31:29.475
Can you tell me
what's going on?

31:29.601 --> 31:31.310
(Sighs) I'm not sure.

31:31.436 --> 31:33.271
I hope he stays gone this time.

31:33.397 --> 31:35.690
He took...everything.

31:35.816 --> 31:39.151
It's gonna be OK. I promise.

31:39.278 --> 31:41.153
I'II make sure you get Arthur's money.

31:41.280 --> 31:43.030
Did he say where
he was headed?

31:43.156 --> 31:45.658
- He never does.
- Did he take his tools?

31:45.784 --> 31:47.660
Pack a bag?
Does he have a passport?

31:47.786 --> 31:50.830
I don't know. When we got up
this morning, he was gone.

31:50.956 --> 31:53.082
(Helicopter overhead)

31:59.673 --> 32:01.966
Shit.

32:03.760 --> 32:05.136
Aah!

32:05.929 --> 32:08.139
Get down! Down on the ground!

32:08.265 --> 32:10.224
(Overlapping yelling)

32:12.978 --> 32:16.856
We create our own destiny
every day we Iive.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.119
- Freeze! Hands up.
- Forensics.

32:30.245 --> 32:31.662
All right.

32:36.668 --> 32:38.919
(Sirens)

32:39.963 --> 32:41.672
Dexter.

32:44.384 --> 32:45.926
Where's your flak jacket?

32:46.053 --> 32:49.263
I left it in the car.
Do you see this?

32:49.389 --> 32:51.265
Cabron .

32:51.767 --> 32:53.809
And over here...
(Breathing heavily)

32:53.935 --> 32:57.021
Look. It's a framing hammer.

32:57.147 --> 33:00.232
I'll get Masuka in here,
get some DNA.

33:01.693 --> 33:02.985
(Dexter sighs)

33:06.657 --> 33:09.867
- What?
- How'd you get here so fast?

33:11.495 --> 33:13.454
Word's everywhere.

33:14.373 --> 33:15.748
You found Trinity.

33:15.874 --> 33:19.043
Yeah, the Four Walls national database
led us to Arthur Mitchell.

33:19.169 --> 33:22.672
Can you believe that fucking
monster had a family?

33:22.798 --> 33:24.757
And he abandoned them?

33:26.009 --> 33:26.926
He's gone?

33:27.052 --> 33:29.220
Yeah, he emptied out his bank accounts
and disappeared.

33:29.346 --> 33:31.389
He's probably halfway
around the world by now.

33:32.557 --> 33:34.183
Probably.

33:36.395 --> 33:37.770
Deb, what's...

33:37.896 --> 33:41.732
Why don't you get your fucking flak jacket
so everyone knows you're one of us?

33:46.238 --> 33:49.198
Hey. It's the fucking Karate Kid.

33:49.324 --> 33:50.825
Yeah, about that, uh...

33:50.951 --> 33:54.495
You pull that shit again, next time
I won't be the one who's on my ass.

34:05.340 --> 34:06.924
(Sobbing)

34:32.784 --> 34:34.827
This is their future, Dexter.

34:34.953 --> 34:36.537
We both know it's inevitable.

34:36.663 --> 34:40.791
No. Arthur abandoned his family.

34:40.917 --> 34:43.002
I would never do that.

34:43.503 --> 34:46.505
Arthur left his family too late.
The damage was already done.

34:46.631 --> 34:48.799
You can still save your family.

34:53.013 --> 34:54.305
By leaving them?

34:54.431 --> 34:56.640
You'll always need
someone on your table.

34:56.767 --> 34:59.351
If you stay,
sooner or later you'll be caught,

34:59.478 --> 35:02.688
and they'll pay a terrible price
for what you've done.

35:06.610 --> 35:08.986
Because long after
you're executed...

35:09.112 --> 35:10.529
they'll still have to go through life

35:10.655 --> 35:12.990
with your name branded
across their foreheads.

35:14.201 --> 35:15.826
(Debra) Dex.

35:26.338 --> 35:28.214
I have something to tell you.

35:28.340 --> 35:30.925
- And maybe I shouldn't. I don't know.
- OK.

35:32.427 --> 35:35.930
I found another CI
Dad was sleeping with.

35:36.056 --> 35:37.890
A woman named Laura Moser.

35:38.016 --> 35:40.559
Harry was right. This is it.

35:40.685 --> 35:43.729
Does that name
mean anything to you?

35:43.855 --> 35:46.607
- Should it?
- It doesn't?

35:47.484 --> 35:49.276
Look, she died,

35:49.402 --> 35:51.862
but she left behind two little boys.

35:54.032 --> 35:56.617
And one of those
little boys was you.

35:59.371 --> 36:02.081
Laura Moser
is your biological mother.

36:02.207 --> 36:04.416
Don't say the rest. Don't know it.

36:04.543 --> 36:07.461
The other little boy, your brother,

36:07.587 --> 36:09.547
was named Brian.

36:11.216 --> 36:13.217
Brian Moser.

36:15.303 --> 36:17.179
The Ice Truck Killer.

36:17.889 --> 36:20.808
She knows who I reaIIy am. It's over.

36:20.934 --> 36:23.602
I wasn't gonna tell you,
but then I saw Trinity's family,

36:23.728 --> 36:26.689
and I thought that it's better
for you to know the truth.

36:28.066 --> 36:29.859
The truth?

36:30.902 --> 36:32.528
The truth...

36:43.748 --> 36:45.833
That's a lot to take in.

36:45.959 --> 36:47.001
I know.

36:47.127 --> 36:49.670
And that's all she knows?

36:49.796 --> 36:52.089
Do you think Brian knew about me?

36:52.215 --> 36:54.425
I don't know.

36:54.551 --> 36:57.678
He must have glommed
onto you as a way to...

36:57.804 --> 36:58.929
get to me.

37:00.765 --> 37:03.434
Don't you see, it wasn't your fault.
He wasn't your fault.

37:05.770 --> 37:07.354
If I'd never been in your life...

37:07.480 --> 37:09.315
Fuck you.

37:09.441 --> 37:10.649
Fuck me?

37:10.775 --> 37:14.486
If you hadn't been in my life,
I wouldn't be who I am.

37:17.824 --> 37:20.159
You've given me confidence...

37:21.286 --> 37:23.162
and support.

37:24.789 --> 37:26.373
And...

37:26.499 --> 37:28.626
you've been the one constant.

37:30.921 --> 37:34.506
The one constantly good thing
in my life.

37:34.633 --> 37:37.092
I've been good for her.

37:37.218 --> 37:40.012
And Rita says I'm good
for her and the kids.

37:40.138 --> 37:43.057
No one wouId ever say that
about Arthur.

37:43.183 --> 37:44.767
Maybe Harry's wrong.

37:44.893 --> 37:47.102
Maybe things couId turn out
differentIy for me.

37:47.228 --> 37:48.479
Morgan.

37:48.605 --> 37:50.731
Debra Morgan. Need you inside.

37:50.857 --> 37:52.775
I'll be right there.

37:57.614 --> 37:59.573
I love you.

38:02.327 --> 38:03.994
I'm so thankful.

38:21.638 --> 38:23.681
The Mustang.

38:25.684 --> 38:27.893
Arthur brought it in two days ago.

38:28.019 --> 38:29.895
Should have known
he wouldn't leave it behind.

38:30.021 --> 38:32.439
Here. Take the rest of this.

38:32.565 --> 38:34.066
Mr. Mitchell, this gonna be nice.

38:34.192 --> 38:36.276
Ah, it's beautiful work, Julio.

38:36.403 --> 38:39.738
Especially on such short notice.

38:39.864 --> 38:41.615
(Engine starts)

38:41.741 --> 38:44.076
Porfavor, the paint.

38:44.202 --> 38:48.664
The paint. It needs more dry!
iTres horas mas!

38:50.542 --> 38:51.834
(Julio) Shit.

39:38.131 --> 39:41.008
(Batista) The wife had no clue
what the husband was up to.

39:41.134 --> 39:42.051
Do we believe her?

39:42.177 --> 39:44.678
She threw up when I showed them
the pictures of what he did.

39:44.804 --> 39:46.638
That can be faked.

39:47.432 --> 39:49.808
This is the team
that broke the case.

39:49.934 --> 39:50.976
Lieutenant LaGuerta,

39:51.102 --> 39:53.520
Special Agent Davis of the FBI.

39:53.646 --> 39:56.023
First-rate job. Congratulations.

39:56.149 --> 39:57.441
It was Detective Morgan

39:57.567 --> 39:59.777
who brought these killings
to the department's attention.

39:59.903 --> 40:02.780
- Building on the work of one of your own.
- Special Agent Lundy.

40:02.906 --> 40:05.657
Fuck yes, Special Agent Lundy.

40:05.784 --> 40:07.826
- He told you guys...
- It's been a long day.

40:07.952 --> 40:10.496
No disrespect, but she's right.

40:10.622 --> 40:15.167
I agree. In retrospect, the Bureau
should have proceeded differently.

40:15.293 --> 40:18.087
Well, your retrospect
cost a man his life.

40:19.172 --> 40:20.672
We'll be taking over from here.

40:20.799 --> 40:22.841
So after we do all the heavy lifting...

40:22.967 --> 40:24.343
You get all the credit.

40:24.469 --> 40:27.346
I'm sure they're grateful
for all your hard work.

40:27.472 --> 40:28.764
We are.

40:33.019 --> 40:34.645
(Whispers) Motherfuck.

40:35.688 --> 40:37.022
I know.

40:37.148 --> 40:39.650
But it is what it is.

41:03.007 --> 41:05.008
(   Music plays on car radio)

41:13.685 --> 41:15.060
(Bang)

41:15.186 --> 41:16.770
(Engine chugging)

41:17.647 --> 41:18.981
Damn it to hell.

41:26.489 --> 41:28.073
(Hissing)

41:29.200 --> 41:30.701
(Groans)

41:38.209 --> 41:40.210
Where's my fucking oil cap?

41:42.755 --> 41:44.381
(Grunts)

41:47.218 --> 41:49.219
Hello, Arthur Mitchell.

41:49.762 --> 41:51.430
(Grunts)

41:51.556 --> 41:53.140
Ah!

41:53.266 --> 41:55.309
(Grunting)

42:08.907 --> 42:11.408
Guess you were picturing
a different scenario.

42:18.750 --> 42:20.751
I was following my path.

42:23.671 --> 42:24.796
So was I.

42:24.923 --> 42:26.924
God led you to me.

42:31.429 --> 42:33.055
Hardly.

42:33.181 --> 42:34.264
(Metal clinks)

42:35.642 --> 42:37.100
(Whimpers)

42:53.785 --> 42:55.702
Is this who you are?

42:56.579 --> 42:57.788
Ta-da!

42:57.914 --> 43:00.958
Oh, look at you.
I never took pride in what I did.

43:01.084 --> 43:04.127
No, you're a very special
kind of monster.

43:04.254 --> 43:05.837
You destroyed your own family.

43:05.964 --> 43:09.549
- I gave them everything!
- No, you took everything.

43:09.676 --> 43:12.344
Their future. Their dignity.

43:12.470 --> 43:14.346
Their hope.

43:14.472 --> 43:16.014
Christine...

43:16.140 --> 43:18.350
even killed herself.

43:18.476 --> 43:19.977
No!

43:22.480 --> 43:23.897
Because of you.

43:28.152 --> 43:29.486
She was weak.

43:29.612 --> 43:30.821
I can't believe there was a time

43:30.947 --> 43:34.032
when I actually thought I could
learn something from you.

43:34.158 --> 43:35.534
You think you're better than I am?

43:35.660 --> 43:36.785
No.

43:39.163 --> 43:41.331
But I want to be.

43:43.835 --> 43:46.044
You can't control
the demon inside of you

43:46.170 --> 43:48.255
any more than I can control mine.

43:52.385 --> 43:53.719
Did you ever actually try?

43:53.845 --> 43:55.554
(Chuckles) Oh, my God, yes.

43:55.680 --> 43:58.223
I prayed to be changed.

43:58.349 --> 44:00.684
To be made...different.

44:00.810 --> 44:03.603
That's not trying.
That's waiting to be stopped.

44:03.730 --> 44:06.440
It worked, didn't it?

44:08.026 --> 44:09.735
Case in point.

44:09.861 --> 44:12.612
So what's the alternative, Arthur?

44:13.698 --> 44:16.408
Leave? Disappear?

44:16.534 --> 44:19.202
Fake my own death
and start over again?

44:19.329 --> 44:21.079
No.

44:22.540 --> 44:24.041
You'll still be you.

44:24.167 --> 44:26.209
I have a family too, Arthur.

44:28.004 --> 44:31.548
And I'm good...for them.

44:31.674 --> 44:33.675
(Chuckles)

44:35.553 --> 44:37.220
You're like a child.

44:37.347 --> 44:40.140
Mm, a child with a big knife.

44:40.266 --> 44:42.601
You dream of a heaven
you'll never see.

44:42.727 --> 44:46.104
- I don't believe in heaven.
- Oh, but you do.

44:46.230 --> 44:48.523
This isn't your doing.

44:48.649 --> 44:50.609
This is God's plan.

44:50.735 --> 44:52.986
I accept that now.

44:54.364 --> 44:55.906
You have to do the same.

44:57.075 --> 44:59.951
I accept...nothing.

45:00.078 --> 45:02.120
Nothing is inevitable.

45:02.246 --> 45:09.753
It's already over.

45:15.426 --> 45:17.636
Could you...

45:26.479 --> 45:27.687
Thank you.

45:34.946 --> 45:37.614
(   Frankie Avalon: Venus playing)

45:39.534 --> 45:42.994
I'll give her all the love
I have to give

45:43.121 --> 45:46.081
As long as we both shall live

45:57.510 --> 45:59.511
Now it's over.

46:06.144 --> 46:07.477
(Crunch)

46:17.155 --> 46:18.155
(Splash)

46:28.249 --> 46:30.750
I wonder if Rita's Iooking
at this same moon

46:30.877 --> 46:32.919
at this same moment.

46:33.045 --> 46:34.629
l like that -

46:34.755 --> 46:36.506
connected by Iight.

46:37.633 --> 46:40.093
The dark passenger's
been fighting against it,

46:40.219 --> 46:42.429
trying to keep me aII to himseIf.

46:42.555 --> 46:44.598
But it's my turn now...

46:44.724 --> 46:46.725
to get what I want.

46:48.186 --> 46:50.187
To embrace my famiIy.

46:54.901 --> 46:57.944
And maybe one day
not so Iong from now...

47:00.072 --> 47:02.741
I'II be rid of the dark passenger.

47:07.788 --> 47:09.789
It aII begins with a getaway.

47:11.876 --> 47:14.044
Time away from the oId me.

47:20.551 --> 47:22.010
(Sighs)

47:38.569 --> 47:40.320
lt's OK.

47:40.446 --> 47:42.447
Life doesn't have to be perfect.

47:44.784 --> 47:46.785
Itjust has to be Iived.

47:52.375 --> 47:54.417
(Cell phone beeping)

48:00.591 --> 48:02.300
- Unheard message.
- (Beep)

48:02.426 --> 48:04.469
(Rita) Hey, sweetie, I'm a dope.

48:04.595 --> 48:06.471
l was in such a rush
to get Harrison organized

48:06.597 --> 48:09.140
I forgot my ID for the pIane,
so I'm zooming home for it.

48:09.267 --> 48:11.184
Means I'II be on a Iater puddIe jumper,

48:11.310 --> 48:13.186
but we'II stiII be there waiting for you.

48:13.312 --> 48:16.147
Oh, and I know you're not
into this stuff, but...

48:16.274 --> 48:18.525
the moon tonight
is gonna be amazing.

48:18.651 --> 48:20.735
So take a moment.
You deserve it.

48:20.861 --> 48:23.196
We Iove you. Bye.

48:25.283 --> 48:27.200
(Ringing tone)

48:28.494 --> 48:32.664
(Cell phone ringing)

48:37.044 --> 48:38.628
(Ringing)

48:40.798 --> 48:43.216
(Harrison crying)

48:56.772 --> 48:58.815
(Crying)

49:05.656 --> 49:07.324
Rita?

49:12.455 --> 49:13.830
No.

49:37.647 --> 49:39.439
(Harrison crying)

49:42.360 --> 49:44.361
Born in blood...

49:45.863 --> 49:47.697
both of us.

49:48.866 --> 49:50.909
Harry was right.

49:51.035 --> 49:52.911
I thought I couId
change what I am,

49:53.037 --> 49:55.288
keep my famiIy safe.

49:55.414 --> 49:57.832
(Harrison crying)

50:04.590 --> 50:06.883
But it doesn't matter what l do,

50:08.052 --> 50:09.928
what l choose.

50:10.054 --> 50:12.055
I'm what's wrong.

50:15.851 --> 50:17.852
This is fate.
