WEBVTT

00:02.049 --> 00:03.383
PreviousIy on Dexter...

00:03.509 --> 00:06.594
Judging from the spray, we're looking
at somebody tall. Over six feet.

00:06.720 --> 00:09.263
(Dexter) He moved the arm.
For a reason.

00:09.390 --> 00:13.309
The killer leaves the ash as his signature,
making his vics point at it.

00:13.435 --> 00:15.561
Lundy came to Miami to hunt this guy.

00:15.688 --> 00:19.482
I think he got too close
and I think it got him killed and me shot.

00:19.608 --> 00:23.277
It's been my dad's baby for years.
A few days ago, he hands me the keys.

00:23.404 --> 00:27.115
No, no. Smooth circular motions, son.

00:27.241 --> 00:29.450
- I got it, Dad.
- If you got it, I wouldn't have to remind you.

00:29.576 --> 00:31.744
SmaII cracks in the perfect famiIy.

00:31.870 --> 00:33.996
(Christine) I can lose myjob.
Not like I'm the only one.

00:34.123 --> 00:37.208
Being a journalist these days is like
a straight ticket to the unemployment line.

00:37.334 --> 00:39.460
Either I get a lead that bleeds

00:39.586 --> 00:42.422
or basically...I'm done.

00:42.548 --> 00:44.590
Are the sweeps connected
to the shootings of Agent Lundy?

00:44.717 --> 00:47.009
I know it's really tough for reporters
right now.

00:47.136 --> 00:48.636
So maybe instead of this one,

00:48.762 --> 00:51.514
I can give you that interview
you've been wanting from me.

00:51.640 --> 00:55.226
Mother shit fuck.
How tall was my shooter?

00:57.312 --> 00:58.312
My height.

00:58.439 --> 01:00.148
- Then it wasn't Trinity?
- Nope.

01:00.274 --> 01:02.859
I was a "dress over the head" party girl.

01:02.985 --> 01:05.403
- You must think I'm...
- Totally charming.

01:06.488 --> 01:08.197
We broke up. Officially.

01:08.323 --> 01:13.619
If I find out this is bullshit, there will
be severe, career-ending consequences.

01:13.746 --> 01:15.496
Fuck it.

01:15.622 --> 01:17.957
(Dexter) No more confessions,
no more good deeds,

01:18.083 --> 01:20.293
and no more fucking remorse.

01:21.670 --> 01:23.296
No, you're mine.

01:27.634 --> 01:30.428
Arthur MitcheII, you just got a reprieve.

03:34.094 --> 03:35.761
This'll do the job.

03:37.931 --> 03:41.058
Cut you into exactly the right size pieces.

03:42.769 --> 03:44.270
You got one more day.

03:53.488 --> 03:55.156
(Laughter)

03:56.074 --> 03:58.326
(Dexter) Happy families are all alike.

03:58.452 --> 04:01.495
They never leave you by yourself
on holidays.

04:03.457 --> 04:06.542
(Arthur) I got some interesting Thanksgiving
greetings from your Coach Davis.

04:06.668 --> 04:09.754
If you're not gonna play baseball anymore,
I suppose you aren't gonna need this.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.672
- No, D-Dad...
- All right?

04:13.634 --> 04:16.052
How about this?
Oh, you're full of awards.

04:16.178 --> 04:19.472
Once the turkey's gone...
so is Arthur.

04:19.598 --> 04:21.140
How about this one?

04:21.266 --> 04:23.267
This one's for Most Valuable Player.

04:29.733 --> 04:31.567
(Door slams, engine starts)

04:35.948 --> 04:37.031
Fuck you, Dad.

04:37.157 --> 04:39.158
(Engine revs, tires screech)

04:40.452 --> 04:41.911
Family business.

04:42.037 --> 04:43.663
It's my business too.

05:00.013 --> 05:02.932
OK. HeaIthy way to bIow off steam.

05:04.685 --> 05:05.685
(Grunts)

05:05.811 --> 05:08.145
- What the hell?
- (Roars)

05:08.271 --> 05:10.898
Jonah? Hey, it's just me.

05:12.567 --> 05:15.695
- Mr. Butler, what are you doing here?
- I stopped by your house.

05:15.821 --> 05:17.905
I saw you arguing with your father.

05:18.031 --> 05:19.407
No, I don't argue.

05:19.533 --> 05:22.535
- I never argue.
- Still, it looked like a bad one.

05:23.704 --> 05:26.497
Man, you have no idea what he's like.

05:26.623 --> 05:28.749
How he treats my mother and Rebecca.

05:29.710 --> 05:31.544
You don't know what he's capable of.

05:32.879 --> 05:34.630
- Well, actually...
- He hits me.

05:35.507 --> 05:36.757
That's not right.

05:39.302 --> 05:42.888
You know, I'm running out of cliches
to tell the coaches.

05:43.015 --> 05:47.101
You know, "Hey, I fell down some stairs.
I walked into a door."

05:51.356 --> 05:53.607
I know it looks like we have
the perfect fucking family,

05:53.734 --> 05:55.484
but in that house...

05:55.610 --> 05:59.280
when he's there,
it's not a life; it's a tour of duty.

06:03.618 --> 06:04.994
Shit. I...

06:05.871 --> 06:09.457
- He'd kill me if he knew I was telling you.
- I won't say a word.

06:14.254 --> 06:16.338
You should have just let him die.

06:22.387 --> 06:25.264
- Where you going?
- Anywhere away from here.

06:26.099 --> 06:27.683
I can't go back.

06:27.809 --> 06:29.769
Not to him.
Not with the car like this.

06:29.895 --> 06:32.688
So I'll go with you.
I'll be there when you tell him.

06:34.274 --> 06:37.610
- Why?
- You're not the only one with father issues.

06:40.363 --> 06:42.198
Well, you know, maybe...

06:44.076 --> 06:47.661
I mean, I guess if you came
to Thanksgiving tomorrow,

06:47.788 --> 06:49.747
- Dad would be on his best.
- Thanksgiving?

06:49.873 --> 06:53.584
Dinner's at one.
I can stay at Luke's house until then.

06:54.336 --> 06:57.129
Guess I'm having two turkey dinners
this year.

07:02.636 --> 07:06.514
The DNA sweep didn't
give them Trinity.

07:06.640 --> 07:09.183
But it did bring in
a cornucopia of criminals.

07:09.309 --> 07:13.312
That shouId keep Miami Metro
off the Trinity case through the hoIiday.

07:13.438 --> 07:15.856
Deb won't be anywhere near as easy.

07:15.982 --> 07:19.401
Sorry, Dex, but I'm spending Thanksgiving
with 90 or so of my newest friends.

07:19.528 --> 07:22.613
Look at these victims.
It looks like a family portrait.

07:22.739 --> 07:27.243
The bathtub women, they're always
young and single. A first girlfriend maybe.

07:27.369 --> 07:31.205
The jumper's always a mother of two.
Maybe that represents his mom or his wife.

07:31.331 --> 07:34.166
But I don't think this guy's married.
The bludgeonee's always a father...

07:34.292 --> 07:36.877
You used to love Thanksgiving
when we were kids.

07:37.003 --> 07:39.463
You wore the little Indian headdresses.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.757
Picked the pearl onions
out of the green beans.

07:41.883 --> 07:43.342
Yeah.

07:43.468 --> 07:45.177
Mom's green beans.

07:45.303 --> 07:47.054
And then she died.

07:47.180 --> 07:49.348
And it was you and me
and Dad and football

07:49.474 --> 07:51.934
and TV dinners in aluminum trays.

07:52.060 --> 07:55.521
- Talk about your lonely.
- Well, you won't be lonely at our house.

07:55.647 --> 07:57.481
You'll never get the chance.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.191
Dexter...

07:59.317 --> 08:02.069
I am lead detective
on the biggest case of my career.

08:02.195 --> 08:05.239
- This is where I belong.
- I thought Batista was lead.

08:05.365 --> 08:08.242
He's the lead on Lundy now.
Once we figured out Trinity didn't shoot me,

08:08.368 --> 08:10.661
- there was no conflict for me...
- What? Wait.

08:10.787 --> 08:12.955
Trinity didn't shoot you?

08:13.081 --> 08:14.874
While you were at
your Rain Man convention,

08:15.000 --> 08:18.294
Masuka and I put it together
form the bullet's trajectory.

08:20.547 --> 08:22.715
- How did I not see that?
- We were too close.

08:22.841 --> 08:24.925
That's what happens
when you make it personal.

08:25.051 --> 08:27.511
(Sighs) So I've heard.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.722
So...who shot you?

08:31.391 --> 08:34.810
Maybe Trinity knows.
I'll ask him when I haul his ass in here.

08:36.021 --> 08:39.440
Deb, you really, really need
to come to Thanksgiving.

08:40.525 --> 08:42.902
Tell the family I said "hi".

08:43.028 --> 08:46.530
(Batista) Heads up, everybody.
This DNA sweep has been like Christmas.

08:46.656 --> 08:50.075
We got hits on three open rape cases
and one open burglary case,

08:50.202 --> 08:52.953
but best of all,
hits on two homicides.

08:54.581 --> 08:55.956
Merry Thanksgiving, Soderquist.

08:56.082 --> 08:58.250
This one is mine.
Keep up the good work, guys.

08:59.502 --> 09:03.631
- Sarge...any news on any other cases?
- We'll find the fucker who shot you.

09:03.757 --> 09:07.092
You know that.
Focus on what you can control.

09:08.094 --> 09:10.596
- Catching Trinity.
- Catching Trinity.

09:14.976 --> 09:16.352
(Knocks on door)

09:18.188 --> 09:21.315
I heard the ACLU's
filing suit on the sweeps.

09:21.441 --> 09:25.819
We've got maybe 72 hours
till we're shut down for good.

09:25.946 --> 09:28.989
- We'll just have to keep pushing harder.
- The holidays may slow us down.

09:29.115 --> 09:31.659
- We'll have a skeleton crew.
- I'll be here.

09:32.452 --> 09:35.287
Never been much
for family holidays anyway.

09:35.413 --> 09:38.374
Particularly when they're all still in Cuba.

09:40.126 --> 09:41.460
Particularly.

09:43.463 --> 09:45.297
Are you with Auri tomorrow?

09:45.423 --> 09:47.341
- She's with her moms this year.
- Hmm.

09:47.467 --> 09:50.386
Plus I have a chance to close
an old case of mine, so...

09:51.638 --> 09:55.099
So I guess we'll both
be working Thanksgiving.

09:55.809 --> 09:57.309
Together.

09:58.603 --> 10:00.020
How unfortunate.

10:07.696 --> 10:09.780
(Cody) Put it up higher, Mom.
(Rita) No, I want it lower.

10:09.906 --> 10:12.574
Are happy famiIies aII aIike?

10:12.701 --> 10:14.326
(Rita) Much better.

10:14.452 --> 10:17.663
- (Cody) Dexter's home!
- Oh, good. They didn't run out of pies.

10:17.789 --> 10:19.999
- Here you go.
- (Giggles)

10:21.710 --> 10:23.669
OK, bird, confess.

10:24.504 --> 10:27.464
- How big are you?
- 22 pounds.

10:28.466 --> 10:31.427
- That's a lot of bird.
- Better too much than not enough.

10:31.553 --> 10:34.346
I mean, that's what the holiday's about.
That and family.

10:37.058 --> 10:39.226
- About tomorrow...
- Uh-oh.

10:39.352 --> 10:42.479
It's not a big deal,
but the Monroe County PD

10:42.605 --> 10:45.566
needs a spatter interpretation on a bar fight

10:45.692 --> 10:47.526
and their blood guy's in the Bahamas.

10:47.652 --> 10:49.445
(Sighs)

10:49.571 --> 10:51.572
Should just take a few hours.

10:51.698 --> 10:54.908
- Does it have to be tomorrow?
- That's when the reconstruction is.

10:55.035 --> 10:58.245
- Mm.
- Plus I'll be making triple overtime.

10:58.371 --> 11:01.623
Sure, that's a plus...
but you'll be missing all the fun.

11:01.750 --> 11:03.125
Yeah.

11:03.251 --> 11:06.086
Poor you. Poor us.

11:06.212 --> 11:09.798
- At least Elliot will be here.
- Yeah, good old Elliot.

11:09.924 --> 11:11.925
So is Deb coming?

11:12.052 --> 11:14.178
She's on the fence. (Sighs)

11:15.847 --> 11:18.349
No, tell her that this is
our first family Thanksgiving

11:18.475 --> 11:20.934
and that we're establishing traditions
that will shape our kids

11:21.061 --> 11:23.520
and that they'll pass on to their kids
and that she's a part of that.

11:23.646 --> 11:25.731
An important part of that. (Grunts)

11:27.067 --> 11:28.400
(Sighs)

11:28.526 --> 11:30.277
Rather than me tell her all that...

11:30.403 --> 11:34.239
(Dexter) OK, guys, now look real sad,
I mean, really miserable.

11:34.366 --> 11:37.659
And...action.

11:37.786 --> 11:41.663
Hi, Aunt Deb. We just heard that you
might not come to Thanksgiving dinner,

11:41.790 --> 11:44.083
- and, well...
- We really want you to come.

11:44.918 --> 11:47.753
- Look sad, retard.
- All right, all right. Just...

11:48.463 --> 11:49.421
Take two.

11:49.547 --> 11:51.965
Will you please come over?

11:52.092 --> 11:53.926
Fuck me.

11:56.721 --> 11:57.930
(Sighs)

12:08.108 --> 12:09.483
You're here late.

12:09.609 --> 12:11.318
Ah, didn't even notice.

12:11.444 --> 12:15.155
- Big plans tomorrow?
- (Chuckles) You're looking at them.

12:15.281 --> 12:16.824
Whatever about tomorrow, right?

12:16.950 --> 12:19.576
It's just another day
where people eat turkey.

12:19.702 --> 12:21.453
I can eat turkey any day of the year.

12:23.123 --> 12:25.290
Dexter's having people over.

12:26.709 --> 12:28.710
Well, me.
He invited me over.

12:29.754 --> 12:31.588
Have a good time.

12:33.883 --> 12:35.634
You know... (Sighs)

12:38.096 --> 12:39.680
- I could use a wingman...
- Yes.

12:39.806 --> 12:41.682
I can't promise it'll be any fun.

12:41.808 --> 12:45.102
Well, I could be your thigh man.
(Chuckles)

12:46.146 --> 12:47.729
Don't press your luck.

12:47.856 --> 12:49.606
I'll let Rita know.

12:58.408 --> 13:00.701
(Exhales) What time do you want
to eat tomorrow?

13:00.827 --> 13:03.120
Oh, bad news, babe. I got to work.

13:04.330 --> 13:05.539
Oh.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.917
Well, what time do you get off?

13:09.043 --> 13:10.210
Uh...

13:10.336 --> 13:13.964
You do want to spend
the holiday together, don't you?

13:14.090 --> 13:16.925
- It's a holiday.
- (Chuckles) Exactly.

13:17.051 --> 13:21.221
Spending it together makes things all...
serious.

13:22.348 --> 13:25.851
Oh, it's just a casual Thanksgiving
with your girlfriend.

13:25.977 --> 13:27.853
Girlfriend?

13:27.979 --> 13:30.731
That sounds...really serious.

13:32.567 --> 13:33.817
Joey...

13:34.819 --> 13:36.820
I don't want to spend it alone.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.700
(Chuckles)

13:41.826 --> 13:43.160
Plus, uh...

13:43.912 --> 13:47.706
I make the best pecan pie
in the state of Florida.

13:50.376 --> 13:53.337
I guess I could, you know...
come by for dessert.

13:53.463 --> 13:57.841
Oh, so you just want to eat my pie.
Is that it?

13:57.967 --> 13:59.718
(Chuckles)

14:13.399 --> 14:17.736
- Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Mitchell.
- Happy Thanksgiving!

14:35.255 --> 14:38.298
I'II be at Arthur's by one, home by four.

14:38.424 --> 14:41.301
A seriaI kiIIer's Thanksgiving recipe
for success.

14:41.427 --> 14:44.763
- How can none of these be big enough?
- Well, maybe if we, um...

14:44.889 --> 14:46.932
(Mimics Julia Child)
Turn the bird on its side...

14:47.058 --> 14:49.351
- (All laugh)
- Hey, Dex.

14:50.353 --> 14:51.353
Howdy, pilgrim.

14:51.479 --> 14:55.899
Did you hear that the pilgrims
didn't eat turkey on the first Thanksgiving?

14:56.025 --> 14:58.443
- Really?
- They ate corn and eel,

14:58.570 --> 15:01.780
which the Native Americans
taught them to plant and fish.

15:01.906 --> 15:04.491
Then the pilgrims slaughtered them all,
took their food,

15:04.617 --> 15:07.911
and went to church the next day
to thank God for all their good luck.

15:10.790 --> 15:13.208
Mm, it's a phase.
Don't worry about it.

15:13.334 --> 15:17.504
What you said about traditions
shaping our kids...

15:17.630 --> 15:21.091
My not going to work, will that...
misshape them?

15:21.217 --> 15:24.177
Look, I wish it was otherwise,
but you'll be home soon, right?

15:24.304 --> 15:26.430
Right. I just...

15:28.808 --> 15:30.309
I don't want to do any damage.

15:30.435 --> 15:31.852
(Chuckles)

15:31.978 --> 15:34.605
You're a parent.
Parents do damage.

15:34.731 --> 15:38.233
Hopefully we'll do enough
of the good stuff to balance it out.

15:38.359 --> 15:39.693
Hopefully.

15:41.487 --> 15:42.821
Thanks.

15:45.658 --> 15:48.952
- "Ashes to ashes..."
- Doughnut to doughnut.

15:50.330 --> 15:53.206
- It's all the store had left.
- What are you doing here?

15:53.333 --> 15:56.418
Avoiding Christine.
She can be a little intense.

15:57.253 --> 16:00.547
Tell me about it. She keeps calling
to set that interview with me.

16:00.673 --> 16:03.759
- You said you'd do it.
- Little busy here.

16:04.844 --> 16:06.470
Look at the timing of the Trinity kills.

16:06.596 --> 16:10.140
15 in December,
40 in July and August...

16:10.892 --> 16:14.353
20 or so in the spring.
What's the pattern?

16:15.855 --> 16:17.648
Long-haul truck driver?

16:17.774 --> 16:20.942
Migrant worker?
Some kind of salesman.

16:21.861 --> 16:22.944
Yeah.

16:23.071 --> 16:24.196
Gobble, gobble.

16:25.323 --> 16:29.201
- She's nothing if not persistent.
- Hey, babe. What are you doing here?

16:29.827 --> 16:32.120
I thought I'd bring Thanksgiving to you.

16:32.246 --> 16:33.997
How sweet.

16:34.666 --> 16:37.626
- There's enough for both of you.
- Oh, thanks, but I'm heading out.

16:37.752 --> 16:41.755
- Debra's taking the day off.
- Fuck that. I'll be multitasking.

16:41.881 --> 16:45.550
- Well, I guess you can take the day off too.
- Sure he can.

16:48.846 --> 16:52.474
Yeah, let me just...check with the boss.
We'll go eat.

16:55.603 --> 16:58.397
So, Debra...how are you feeling?

16:59.232 --> 17:02.234
Do you mind if we put off that interview
until after the holiday?

17:02.360 --> 17:07.239
I'm not here as a reporter;
I'm here as Joey's...girlfriend.

17:08.241 --> 17:11.368
- My condolences.
- (Chuckles)

17:11.494 --> 17:13.745
You know, he really cares about you.

17:14.747 --> 17:17.374
After you got shot,
you were all he could talk about.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.794
- Really messed him up.
- Well, that makes two of us.

17:22.130 --> 17:24.464
I just... I just wanted to say...

17:25.466 --> 17:26.717
Um...

17:27.635 --> 17:28.969
I'm really sorry...

17:29.804 --> 17:31.430
about what happened to you.

17:33.099 --> 17:34.933
I can't even imagine...

17:35.810 --> 17:38.687
looking into the eyes
of the person you love...

17:39.939 --> 17:41.940
watching as he takes his last breath.

17:47.155 --> 17:49.239
Let's hope you never have to.

17:54.537 --> 17:55.954
(Muffled chatter)

18:00.042 --> 18:02.586
You got Lloyd Paulson to confess?

18:02.712 --> 18:05.213
Been waiting ten years to close this one.

18:05.339 --> 18:08.425
I promised the victim's husband
I'd find the man who killed his wife.

18:08.551 --> 18:10.010
Finally lived up to that promise.

18:10.136 --> 18:13.722
You should go tell the husband.
Give him something to be thankful for.

18:13.848 --> 18:17.267
As soon as I process that pendejo.
Do you want to come with?

18:18.311 --> 18:20.604
To a next-of-kin notification?

18:20.730 --> 18:22.856
It is official business.

18:28.279 --> 18:29.946
(Doorbell rings)

18:31.824 --> 18:33.950
- Kyle!
- Happy Thanksgiving.

18:34.702 --> 18:35.994
To you too.

18:36.829 --> 18:39.664
Kyle. What a nice surprise.

18:39.791 --> 18:41.875
ApparentIy Jonah
didn't mention inviting me.

18:42.001 --> 18:45.003
I just wanted to drop by and say hi.

18:46.589 --> 18:50.133
It's my first Thanksgiving
without my family and I...

18:51.719 --> 18:53.762
didn't know what to do with myself.

18:55.848 --> 18:58.350
I suppose you should eat with us.

18:59.185 --> 19:00.769
Full tables, full hearts.

19:01.562 --> 19:03.355
Full bellies. Come on in.

19:05.316 --> 19:06.608
(Knocking)

19:07.527 --> 19:11.238
- Aunt Deb's here!
- Happy Thanksgiving, turkeys.

19:11.906 --> 19:13.615
Thanks for the video.

19:14.826 --> 19:16.868
- Hi, Deb.
- Hi, Deb.

19:16.994 --> 19:18.286
Hi.

19:19.163 --> 19:21.206
- (Hushed) Who's that?
- Danny and Grace's dad.

19:21.332 --> 19:23.083
Danny, let me help.

19:23.209 --> 19:26.086
Ah. Where's Dexter?

19:26.212 --> 19:29.256
(Sighs) He's at some crime thing
in Monroe County.

19:29.382 --> 19:32.843
- Said he'd be back for dinner.
- He's more like Dad every day.

19:32.969 --> 19:35.387
Come look at our puzzle.
We've already got the corners.

19:35.513 --> 19:37.222
Cody, leave her alone.

19:37.348 --> 19:40.767
- You don't want to help?
- Sorry, little man, but I've got work to do.

19:40.893 --> 19:42.561
Oh.

19:44.689 --> 19:46.064
(Chuckles)

19:47.024 --> 19:49.109
You are good.

19:49.235 --> 19:51.319
Another three hours to go.

19:51.445 --> 19:53.822
When do you want to put in
the broccoli-cheese casserole?

19:53.948 --> 19:55.156
About an hour before.

19:55.283 --> 19:58.285
The sweet potatoes need an hour and
the corn pudding needs about 30 minutes.

19:58.411 --> 19:59.744
Is it all gonna fit?

20:01.080 --> 20:03.957
(Sighs) No. None of it's gonna fit.

20:04.083 --> 20:05.625
What was I thinking?

20:05.751 --> 20:09.421
You were thinking, "My fabulous neighbor
has not one, but two ovens."

20:09.547 --> 20:12.465
(Sighs) You know, you really are a lifesaver.

20:12.592 --> 20:14.926
You should just wear a red cross
on your forehead.

20:16.304 --> 20:18.138
- (Laughter)
- (Elliot) Oven crisis.

20:18.264 --> 20:20.515
Deb, can you watch the kids?
Harrison's asleep.

20:20.641 --> 20:22.642
Actually, I was gonna try to get some...

20:22.768 --> 20:24.019
Oh!

20:24.145 --> 20:25.812
..work done.

20:25.938 --> 20:28.690
Vince, hi!
Vince, Elliot. Elliot, Vince.

20:28.816 --> 20:30.525
Hi. Uh, bye.

20:30.651 --> 20:33.111
- Uh...bye.
- Bye.

20:34.614 --> 20:36.656
- They're using his oven.
- Oh.

20:36.782 --> 20:39.200
Well...guess I'll be using his oven too.

20:39.327 --> 20:41.578
Chocolate lava cakes.
My specialty.

20:41.704 --> 20:43.163
You have a specialty?

20:43.289 --> 20:45.832
A river of chocolate love
that melts in your mouth.

20:45.958 --> 20:48.835
Wow. You can make
anything sound perverted.

20:48.961 --> 20:50.712
It's a gift.

20:57.803 --> 21:02.057
Arthur seems to be in a decent mood.
Maybe I'II be abIe to sIip out early.

21:02.183 --> 21:04.643
It's almost one.
You want me to set the table?

21:04.769 --> 21:07.020
No, we've got to watch the game first.

21:07.146 --> 21:09.689
- The game?
- Yeah, it's tradition, Kyle.

21:09.815 --> 21:13.234
Ah! Will the kids be joining us?

21:14.779 --> 21:19.950
That too would be tradition,
but apparently Jonah has forgotten.

21:20.076 --> 21:22.327
I'm sure he's on his way.

21:22.453 --> 21:24.955
He knows how important
holidays are to you.

21:29.669 --> 21:32.462
Not such a decent mood after all.

21:34.674 --> 21:36.675
Do you think Rebecca could come out now?

21:38.344 --> 21:39.761
I suppose.

21:39.887 --> 21:41.638
I'll go get her.

21:45.101 --> 21:48.061
- She grounded or something?
- Oh, no.

21:48.187 --> 21:49.854
No, nothing like that.

22:01.117 --> 22:02.867
This is Carl Haas?

22:02.994 --> 22:06.705
He's been in a persistent vegetative state
for several years.

22:06.831 --> 22:10.166
Stepped off a sidewalk,
got hit by a bus.

22:12.044 --> 22:14.004
I didn't know.

22:15.047 --> 22:17.132
It's been a long time.

22:17.258 --> 22:19.968
Would it be possible
to have a moment alone with him?

22:20.970 --> 22:22.554
Have a good Turkey Day.

22:29.061 --> 22:30.979
Tell him.

22:31.105 --> 22:33.148
Like he can hear me.

22:33.274 --> 22:34.899
He'll hear you.

22:44.326 --> 22:48.621
Mr. Haas...
I'm the one who told you about your wife.

22:51.709 --> 22:53.668
I also promised that I'd fi...

22:54.628 --> 22:56.087
This is pointless.

22:57.673 --> 23:03.303
Mr. Haas, Angel knows how much
your wife meant to you...

23:04.847 --> 23:06.848
and he wants you to know...

23:14.523 --> 23:16.274
I want you to know...

23:18.235 --> 23:20.528
that we found the guy who killed her.

23:23.115 --> 23:24.657
I wish...

23:24.784 --> 23:26.785
I wish we would have found him sooner.

23:27.787 --> 23:30.955
Really, I wish he would have
never killed your wife,

23:31.082 --> 23:32.957
but I can't change that.

23:37.213 --> 23:39.506
Can't change anything.

23:39.632 --> 23:41.257
But we got the guy.

23:42.093 --> 23:43.426
We got him.

23:48.224 --> 23:51.226
- Hello, Mr. Butler. How are you?
- Well, I'm fine, Rebecca.

23:51.352 --> 23:53.686
Kyle, you up for
a little pre-game football toss?

23:53.813 --> 23:55.772
I suppose.

23:55.898 --> 23:57.941
I'll go help Mom in the kitchen.

24:02.488 --> 24:04.155
At least I have one perfect child.

24:05.491 --> 24:06.908
Yeah, so it would appear.

24:07.952 --> 24:09.410
Come on.

24:13.332 --> 24:16.709
Normally, Jonah supplies the football.

24:16.836 --> 24:20.547
- How about a baseball?
- No. We throw the baseball in spring.

24:20.673 --> 24:24.175
Thanksgiving, we throw the football.
Traditions matter, Kyle.

24:25.511 --> 24:27.887
Yes, they...shape people.

24:28.013 --> 24:31.558
Yeah, and give children
a sense of history, tradition.

24:31.684 --> 24:33.977
Teaches them who they are
and what's expected of them.

24:34.103 --> 24:35.728
And what is expected of them?

24:35.855 --> 24:39.357
Generosity, common sense, obedience.

24:39.483 --> 24:42.193
It's a father's responsibility
to set the boundaries,

24:42.319 --> 24:44.445
child's duty to honor them.

24:46.699 --> 24:49.951
No, there's nothing down there.
Stop! Kyle, no!

24:54.957 --> 24:56.291
I made that...

24:57.293 --> 24:59.294
when I was still confused.

25:02.923 --> 25:05.049
Well, it's beautiful.

25:08.804 --> 25:10.847
Which is why I haven't torn it apart.

25:12.308 --> 25:14.893
Probably donate it to the needy.

25:15.019 --> 25:17.103
Obviously, I won't be needing it.

25:17.229 --> 25:19.397
No, you'II be buried at sea.

25:19.523 --> 25:21.816
I have a new lease on life.

25:22.902 --> 25:24.652
- Thanks to you.
- (Chuckles)

25:25.738 --> 25:27.071
Hey.

25:28.574 --> 25:30.909
Oh. The best laid plans...

25:31.911 --> 25:33.494
It's Jonah's.

25:34.538 --> 25:38.958
What's the point of giving him the better
things in life if he can't take care of them?

25:47.009 --> 25:49.886
What kind of father
keeps a coffin in his garage?

25:50.804 --> 25:53.890
What kind of father
keeps blood slides in his shed?

25:55.684 --> 25:57.060
(Sighs)

26:01.482 --> 26:03.024
Hey, we can still get some...

26:06.779 --> 26:08.571
Here we go.

26:10.074 --> 26:14.994
Dad, I don't know what happened. The car
was parked in Luke's driveway all night.

26:15.120 --> 26:20.041
I came out this morning and, you know,
someone had just gone all mental on it.

26:21.335 --> 26:23.336
Dad, I am so sorry.

26:23.462 --> 26:27.757
(Sighs) That's why God
invented car insurance, right?

26:39.937 --> 26:41.604
It'll be OK.

26:59.665 --> 27:01.332
There!

27:02.626 --> 27:05.295
Now it's drivable
till we can get her fixed.

27:06.547 --> 27:07.672
Well...

27:08.966 --> 27:11.676
Game's about to start.
Shall we?

27:19.184 --> 27:22.103
(Cody) Come on, Danny. Throw it here.

27:22.229 --> 27:25.189
- Oh, good one.
- Hey, you two. No wiffle ball in the house.

27:27.151 --> 27:29.694
I don't know how you do it.
All these kids at home at the same time.

27:29.820 --> 27:32.071
(Chuckles) Thanksgiving's only four days.

27:32.197 --> 27:34.699
You should try keeping them entertained
for three months in the summer.

27:34.825 --> 27:37.076
Yeah, plus spring break
and Christmas break.

27:37.202 --> 27:39.537
That's when you're really climbing the walls.

27:39.663 --> 27:41.748
June, July, August...

27:43.917 --> 27:45.251
December.

27:46.670 --> 27:47.837
Oh...

27:47.963 --> 27:49.589
fu-u-udge!

27:50.466 --> 27:52.091
Trinity's in the school system.

27:52.217 --> 27:54.093
- (TV commentary)
- Quinn.

27:54.219 --> 27:57.263
Joey, it's Deb.
His kiII scheduIe matches the schooI year.

27:57.389 --> 27:58.723
Trinity couId be a janitor.

27:58.849 --> 28:02.935
He could be a cafeteria worker,
a bus driver, a teacher, a principaI.

28:03.062 --> 28:05.605
- We got to get to the station.
- I haven't eaten yet.

28:05.731 --> 28:07.607
Jesus, grab a drumstick to go.

28:07.733 --> 28:09.359
Deb, no one's working today

28:09.485 --> 28:12.070
and we're gonna need a warrant
to access any school databases.

28:12.196 --> 28:13.613
We can find a judge.

28:13.739 --> 28:16.282
Yeah, who's gonna love us
for tearing him away from his family.

28:16.408 --> 28:18.076
Come on, we're not gonna
get anywhere today.

28:19.453 --> 28:21.120
(Sighs) Fu...

28:22.456 --> 28:23.706
Fudge.

28:25.834 --> 28:28.086
- Break in a case?
- We'll see.

28:28.962 --> 28:30.254
(Sighs)

28:32.758 --> 28:34.884
Not a horrible Thanksgiving, right?

28:35.677 --> 28:37.595
No, actually it's kinda nice.

28:38.597 --> 28:40.139
You sound surprised.

28:40.265 --> 28:42.308
I am a little.

28:42.434 --> 28:43.810
Hmm.

28:43.936 --> 28:46.521
So having a girlfriend isn't so bad after all?

28:47.564 --> 28:49.941
- You with the labels.
- (Sighs)

28:50.067 --> 28:51.567
Why does it matter?

28:52.361 --> 28:54.112
I just...

28:55.572 --> 28:57.657
I care about you.

28:57.783 --> 29:00.118
I'd kinda like to have it returned.

29:02.955 --> 29:04.580
Come here.

29:09.503 --> 29:11.462
(Whispers) I have a better idea.

29:13.799 --> 29:15.591
Aw!

29:15.717 --> 29:18.386
- You are so my girlfriend.
- (Laughs)

29:23.475 --> 29:26.144
Get...get...get him!
Get him!

29:26.270 --> 29:27.854
Get...get...get...get him!

29:27.980 --> 29:28.980
Ah!

29:29.106 --> 29:33.025
- It's OK, they didn't get the first down.
- (Sighs)

29:33.152 --> 29:35.153
Jonah seems safe for the moment.

29:35.279 --> 29:39.532
I'm not a big football fan.
I think I'll go see if I can help Sally.

29:39.658 --> 29:42.910
Oh, that's very nice of you.

29:45.330 --> 29:47.540
Look at that.
There's three men on him.

29:48.876 --> 29:50.668
(Jonah) Yeah, I know.

29:54.047 --> 29:56.674
This room's kinda young for a teenager.

30:02.181 --> 30:04.223
Are those to keep someone out...

30:04.349 --> 30:06.350
or keep someone in?

30:16.820 --> 30:19.530
My God.
He locks his daughter in here.

30:31.210 --> 30:33.336
You need any help?

30:33.462 --> 30:36.422
I'm completely useless in the kitchen.

30:37.382 --> 30:38.758
Sure. Uh...

30:38.884 --> 30:41.010
something for the centerpiece.

30:41.136 --> 30:43.763
Roses.
Dad always likes these.

30:43.889 --> 30:45.806
Everything for Dad, huh?

30:49.394 --> 30:51.354
Those locks on your door for him too?

30:58.070 --> 31:01.864
- He says they're there to protect me.
- And do they?

31:06.578 --> 31:10.248
- (TV commentary)
- He's open. He's open! Go, go!

31:10.374 --> 31:12.833
Touchdown! What a play!

31:21.927 --> 31:23.427
No, no. No, Dad.

31:26.807 --> 31:29.183
- (Crunching)
- Ow! (Muffled scream)

31:31.812 --> 31:33.271
(Grunts)

31:36.608 --> 31:38.651
And that's for my windshield.

31:42.281 --> 31:44.782
Things of beauty need to be honored.

31:57.796 --> 31:59.839
I ran away once.

31:59.965 --> 32:01.632
He caught me and...

32:03.135 --> 32:06.304
- it was bad.
- It's not always gonna be like this.

32:06.430 --> 32:07.805
(Scoffs)

32:10.642 --> 32:15.521
- Jonah told me that you're helping him.
- Yeah, if you can call it that.

32:16.315 --> 32:19.817
You can help me too.
Get me out of here.

32:20.819 --> 32:24.989
You just need to wait a while.
You're too young to be on your own.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.328
I don't have to be on my own.

32:31.330 --> 32:32.663
I could be with you.

32:34.041 --> 32:37.460
- With me?
- Jonah also says you're nice.

32:40.005 --> 32:41.339
I try to be.

32:42.090 --> 32:45.343
If you're nice to me,
I can be nice to you.

32:46.928 --> 32:48.888
I'll do anything you want.

32:49.514 --> 32:51.057
Whoa... I don't...

32:51.892 --> 32:53.517
Rebecca, you're 15.

32:54.728 --> 32:56.687
I don't want anything from you.

32:57.189 --> 32:58.856
I don't believe you.

32:59.775 --> 33:01.525
- Look, I know what guys like.
- No.

33:01.818 --> 33:03.069
Rebecca?

33:04.071 --> 33:05.655
Go inside.

33:08.450 --> 33:12.036
- (Exhales) Sally, it's not...
- Shh!

33:13.538 --> 33:16.582
I am so sorry about Rebecca's behavior.

33:16.708 --> 33:18.250
Oh.

33:18.377 --> 33:23.297
Just...please...
don't say anything to Arthur.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.094
Kyle, you can't.

33:28.220 --> 33:30.554
- Whatever you did with Rebecca...
- I didn't.

33:30.681 --> 33:33.099
Whatever you're going to do,
I don't care.

33:33.225 --> 33:37.436
Just, please, I'm begging you...
don't tell him.

33:37.562 --> 33:40.731
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't. I-I won't.

33:40.857 --> 33:42.191
Please.

33:44.111 --> 33:45.444
Yeah, I promise.

33:45.570 --> 33:47.279
Thank you.

33:56.039 --> 33:58.082
What the hell is he doing to these people?

33:58.959 --> 34:00.543
(Phone rings)

34:04.339 --> 34:06.966
- Rita, hi.
- Hey. How far away are you?

34:07.092 --> 34:10.177
Uh... Probably about an hour or so.

34:10.303 --> 34:12.972
All right, well, I don't want you
to be surprised when you get home.

34:13.098 --> 34:15.182
- About what?
- Cody fell into your shed.

34:15.308 --> 34:18.144
- What? Is he OK? What happened?
- Well, he's fine.

34:18.270 --> 34:20.521
He hit a wiffle ball
onto the top of the shed,

34:20.647 --> 34:23.691
climbed up to get it,
the skylight cracked...

34:23.817 --> 34:27.653
and he fell through. Elliot was
gonna push in the air conditioner...

34:27.779 --> 34:31.323
- No, don't!
- Uh, he didn't.

34:31.450 --> 34:35.703
- He took off the door with an axe.
- So my shed has no door?

34:35.829 --> 34:37.830
Dexter, Cody was scared and crying.

34:37.956 --> 34:39.915
I told Elliot to get him out
however he could.

34:40.041 --> 34:42.293
Yeah, of course, of course. I'll...

34:43.336 --> 34:44.962
..thank Elliot when I get home.

34:45.088 --> 34:46.839
Well, I'll see you soon, OK?

34:46.965 --> 34:48.174
(Sighs)

34:50.135 --> 34:52.845
No one can get into
the trunk's false bottom.

34:52.971 --> 34:55.681
You didn't think anyone
could get into your shed either.

34:55.807 --> 34:58.017
I gotta get home. Now.

35:00.687 --> 35:01.854
(Jonah groans)

35:01.980 --> 35:04.982
Arthur, I just got a call and I think I have to...

35:05.108 --> 35:07.026
(Groans, inhales sharply)

35:09.821 --> 35:11.781
Jonah, what happened?

35:11.907 --> 35:15.743
- I whacked it on the coffee table.
- My son, the klutz.

35:15.869 --> 35:19.663
This team hasn't been the same
since they traded Johnson.

35:20.499 --> 35:23.167
What else will he do to Jonah if l leave?

35:35.347 --> 35:38.140
Turkey wraps, ICEEs...

35:38.850 --> 35:40.518
And Cuervo Silver.

35:40.644 --> 35:43.312
- Only the best for you.
- (Giggles)

35:49.694 --> 35:51.445
You know, I was thinking...

35:53.532 --> 35:56.659
Carl Haas's wife gets mugged.
Boom. She's dead.

35:57.536 --> 36:00.162
Carl gets hit by a bus.
Boom. He's a vegetable.

36:04.209 --> 36:06.377
You never know when you
wake up in the morning

36:06.503 --> 36:08.629
- what the day will bring...
- I love you.

36:12.843 --> 36:14.343
I love you.

36:20.183 --> 36:22.268
Are you saying that because
you're afraid you'll get hit by a bus?

36:22.394 --> 36:25.312
No.
Well...yes, but...

36:29.067 --> 36:33.696
I just want you to know what I know
before I don't know it anymore.

36:37.075 --> 36:38.826
And I love you.

36:40.203 --> 36:42.413
- I love you!
- Shh! I can hear you.

36:42.539 --> 36:46.500
- I love Maria Esperanza del Alma La...
- Shh! (Laughs)

36:55.260 --> 36:57.177
I'm not gonna say it.

37:01.308 --> 37:02.975
You don't love me?

37:03.977 --> 37:06.604
I'm afraid if I say it...

37:08.440 --> 37:11.108
something will happen,
like you'll get hit by a bus.

37:26.124 --> 37:28.459
So watch out for moving buses.

37:28.585 --> 37:29.960
(Chuckles)

37:30.086 --> 37:32.463
'Cause I love...

37:33.131 --> 37:36.133
Angel Juan Marcos Batista.

37:48.980 --> 37:52.149
- Oh! Ah! Rats! Ow!
- Uh-oh. Come here, come here.

37:54.486 --> 37:57.655
- Ooh!
- There you go. Isn't Thanksgiving fun?

37:57.781 --> 38:00.699
Thank God it's only once a year.
Do you have any ice?

38:00.825 --> 38:02.326
No. Peas are better.

38:03.495 --> 38:06.413
- Come on, Rita. Give peas a chance.
- (Chuckles)

38:06.539 --> 38:08.540
- Now, come on. Take a seat.
- Oh.

38:08.667 --> 38:11.460
All right. OK.

38:13.088 --> 38:14.380
(Rita sighs)

38:15.757 --> 38:16.924
There.

38:18.677 --> 38:19.927
Did you say "rats"?

38:20.053 --> 38:23.389
(Chuckles) I guess I've been spending
too much time with the kids.

38:23.515 --> 38:24.640
(Both chuckle)

38:25.850 --> 38:27.726
Thanks for this.

38:28.937 --> 38:30.896
I like taking care of you.

38:43.410 --> 38:45.911
I am so sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.

38:46.037 --> 38:47.913
Yeah, I don't either.

38:48.039 --> 38:51.917
It's just we have this connection,
and it's not just because we're both lonely...

38:52.043 --> 38:54.753
No, I'm not lonely.
I have Dexter.

38:54.879 --> 38:57.131
The guy who's never home?

39:15.191 --> 39:19.611
- (TV) Thanksgiving Day parade...
- Hey, uh...Deb, I'm gonna take off.

39:19.738 --> 39:21.905
- Not feeling so hot.
- Oh, no, you don't.

39:23.241 --> 39:24.616
Here.

39:26.077 --> 39:28.328
- You're my wingman.
- This family doesn't need me around.

39:28.455 --> 39:29.830
- I'll see you at the...
- No, no, shh!

39:29.956 --> 39:32.249
You belong here as much as anyone does.

39:32.375 --> 39:35.127
And if you go,
I'll be the one single person here.

39:35.253 --> 39:38.547
I really don't feel like remembering
why that is, you know?

39:39.758 --> 39:41.550
Why Frank's gone.

39:42.218 --> 39:43.761
- Why I'm here.
- Yeah.

39:43.887 --> 39:46.513
Hey...
Yeah. I'll stay.

39:48.308 --> 39:50.559
(Sighs) But I need booze.

39:51.311 --> 39:53.062
You and me both.

40:01.696 --> 40:02.821
Hi!

40:05.366 --> 40:07.493
Are you the one
my mom told me not to talk to?

40:08.495 --> 40:09.828
Awkward.

40:10.622 --> 40:13.582
..and for this bounty before us,
we thank you and look to you, O Lord,

40:13.708 --> 40:17.211
to strengthen our resolve
to strive, to seek, to find,

40:17.337 --> 40:20.464
- and not to yield. Amen.
- Amen.

40:21.508 --> 40:25.094
- Looks marvelous, Sally.
- Thank you, Arthur.

40:25.804 --> 40:32.017
We, uh...
We have a little...family tradition, Kyle,

40:32.143 --> 40:34.269
before we start...

40:35.271 --> 40:37.856
of saying what we're thankful for.

40:39.317 --> 40:42.861
I'll start.
I'm thankful for this family.

40:42.987 --> 40:45.531
Pass your plates. Sally?

40:45.657 --> 40:50.494
I'm... I'm thankful for this lovely home...

40:53.957 --> 40:56.834
and for my son,
who I am so proud of.

40:58.169 --> 41:01.338
- Me too.
- Is that all?

41:04.092 --> 41:06.218
And for my beautiful daughter...

41:07.137 --> 41:09.930
who is growing up...so quickly.

41:11.850 --> 41:13.934
I am so blessed.

41:16.938 --> 41:20.524
I'm thankful that Mrs. Wilder
gave us an extra two days

41:20.650 --> 41:22.734
to finish our report on Aeschylus.

41:22.861 --> 41:24.236
(Laughter)

41:25.196 --> 41:28.657
And I'm also thankful
for this nice home.

41:30.368 --> 41:32.703
ls this what it takes to survive with him?

41:36.374 --> 41:39.376
Um, I'm thankful for this house too...

41:42.463 --> 41:44.131
..and for God.

41:45.049 --> 41:47.050
(Arthur) You know what I'm thankful for?

41:48.595 --> 41:50.053
My car.

41:59.731 --> 42:02.524
- I'm thankful for yams.
- Yams?

42:03.735 --> 42:05.611
Comfort food.

42:06.404 --> 42:08.697
Thank you all for the comfort
of your home.

42:08.823 --> 42:11.825
Where no one said
they were thankful for me.

42:13.119 --> 42:16.038
(Chuckles) Did you, Jonah?

42:18.291 --> 42:20.209
Did you say you were
thankful for me, Jonah?

42:22.170 --> 42:25.255
- What's that?
- I did not say I was thankful for you.

42:27.050 --> 42:28.884
Because I'm not.

42:30.970 --> 42:34.598
- I am so thankful for you, Arthur.
- Shut up, cunt.

42:35.391 --> 42:38.727
- Whoa, Arthur...
- Kyle, perhaps it's time for you to go.

42:39.646 --> 42:43.482
- I think I should stay.
- Yeah, sure. Stay. Watch the show.

42:43.608 --> 42:46.318
- I'm thankful for you, Daddy.
- Go to your room, Vera.

42:46.444 --> 42:48.028
No! She's not Vera!

42:48.154 --> 42:51.990
And she's not your goddamn prisoner
and she's not eight anymore!

42:52.116 --> 42:55.661
This whole life...
Your life is a lie!

42:55.787 --> 42:57.955
These are lies!

42:58.957 --> 43:00.666
Fucking community hero?

43:00.792 --> 43:02.626
- Jonah, this isn't the way.
- (Grunts)

43:03.962 --> 43:06.129
- (Gasps)
- I know who you really are!

43:06.256 --> 43:08.465
- Oh, who am I?
- You're a killer.

43:11.636 --> 43:15.264
Sucking the fucking life out of all of us!

43:15.390 --> 43:16.682
Mom, Becca, me!

43:16.808 --> 43:19.518
- Fucking little...
- No, Daddy! Don't! Daddy, no!

43:19.644 --> 43:21.561
- (Screams)
- (Jonah) You're killing us!

43:23.314 --> 43:26.650
- Put her down.
- Fuck you and fuck Vera.

43:26.776 --> 43:28.318
- Don't!
- (Grunts)

43:32.282 --> 43:33.699
(Choking) Fuck you!

43:33.825 --> 43:35.450
(Gasping)

43:39.622 --> 43:42.332
Get the fuck off him!

43:45.128 --> 43:47.671
- (Sally) Oh, my God! No! No!
- No, Daddy! No!

43:47.797 --> 43:49.172
(Both grunt)

43:51.009 --> 43:54.303
(Rebecca) No, you don't have to kill him!
No! Dad! Dad!

43:57.640 --> 44:00.017
I should have fucking killed you
when I had the chance.

44:03.354 --> 44:07.858
- (Screams) Oh, my God! Arthur!
- Daddy!

44:09.694 --> 44:12.029
(Whimpers) Sally!

44:12.989 --> 44:15.073
(Grunting)

44:15.199 --> 44:17.492
I'm thankful to be out of that fucking house!

44:17.618 --> 44:21.371
You showed Trinity the monster in you.
He'll see you coming now.

44:21.497 --> 44:23.332
I don't know.
Seeing them like that...

44:23.458 --> 44:25.584
He's destroyed everyone in that family.

44:25.710 --> 44:28.045
That's what happens to people
who live with a monster.

44:28.171 --> 44:30.047
I am nothing like him!

44:31.215 --> 44:32.758
My family is nothing like that.

44:32.884 --> 44:35.635
What's 18 more years of being with you
gonna do to them?

44:35.762 --> 44:38.305
Arthur's terrorized them
into maintaining his cover.

44:38.431 --> 44:40.432
They're nothing but human shields.

44:42.018 --> 44:45.103
The only reason you started dating Rita
was for cover.

44:45.229 --> 44:48.065
(Sighs) She's much more than that now.

44:48.191 --> 44:50.317
She and the kids. Much more.

44:55.573 --> 44:57.574
My family is nothing like that.

45:02.830 --> 45:04.247
- Hey.
- Hey.

45:04.374 --> 45:06.625
- (Cody) Dexter's home!
- Who's hungry?

45:06.751 --> 45:08.377
- Me.
- I am.

45:08.503 --> 45:11.963
I am so happy you're home!

45:12.090 --> 45:16.009
- Oh! Me too.
- Mm! Mm!

45:18.638 --> 45:19.971
(Chuckles) All right, uh...

45:20.098 --> 45:22.766
Cody, why don't you help
your Aunt Deb set the table?

45:22.892 --> 45:25.560
Astor, I can use your help in the kitchen.

45:27.271 --> 45:29.773
Sorry about your shed, Dexter.

45:30.900 --> 45:32.609
Hey!

45:32.735 --> 45:37.364
Well, as long as you're OK,
that's all that matters.

45:40.910 --> 45:44.788
(Sighs) I'm gonna go check on the shed,
make sure it's safe in there.

45:44.914 --> 45:46.540
Miss us?

45:48.292 --> 45:49.793
You have no idea.

45:59.178 --> 46:01.138
God, I miss my apartment.

46:07.645 --> 46:09.896
(Sighs) They're safe.

46:11.607 --> 46:12.899
So's my trunk.

46:17.071 --> 46:21.158
Is anything really safe here?
The kids, Rita?

46:24.287 --> 46:27.664
- You?
- I'll find an alternative.

46:31.669 --> 46:34.796
Trinity was supposed to be
the alternative.

46:41.762 --> 46:44.723
Uh, spoons go inside or outside the knives?

46:45.725 --> 46:46.933
Um...

46:47.643 --> 46:49.019
Surprise us.

46:50.313 --> 46:53.773
- Ouch.
- Can I see your scars, Aunt Deb?

46:57.236 --> 46:58.653
Sure.

47:01.324 --> 47:03.200
Does it still hurt?

47:03.868 --> 47:05.076
Um...

47:07.079 --> 47:08.413
Sometimes.

47:10.333 --> 47:11.500
Here.

47:12.376 --> 47:14.252
Did you see that guy die?

47:16.672 --> 47:17.923
I did.

47:19.217 --> 47:22.385
- I looked right in his eyes.
- Were his eyes open?

47:23.429 --> 47:24.513
Yeah.

47:25.973 --> 47:28.141
Watched him take his last breath.

47:33.314 --> 47:36.483
- How did she know that?
- How did who know what?

47:37.652 --> 47:39.277
Nobody but me...

47:40.363 --> 47:42.614
(Debra) How much did you teII Christine
about the Lundy shooting?

47:42.740 --> 47:45.534
- Nothing.
- Maybe you Ieft Lundy's fiIe

47:45.660 --> 47:47.786
- Iying around accidentaIIy...
- No.

47:47.912 --> 47:50.247
..and maybe Christine
saw some of the pictures.

47:50.373 --> 47:52.874
She saw how he was lying on his side,
how he fell in front of me,

47:53.000 --> 47:54.793
so that I could see him take his last...

47:54.919 --> 47:57.754
Morgan, I'm telling you,
I learned my lesson.

47:57.880 --> 47:59.965
I never even took the Lundy files
out of the station.

48:00.091 --> 48:01.716
There's no way she could have seen it.

48:05.304 --> 48:07.097
(Rita) Dinner's ready.

48:10.101 --> 48:12.477
(Dexter) Not aII happy famiIies are aIike.

48:14.397 --> 48:16.356
They are happy...

48:16.482 --> 48:17.774
aren't they?

48:19.235 --> 48:20.986
Are they normaI kids?

48:22.280 --> 48:25.490
How can you teII a Ioving wife
from a frightened one?

48:28.035 --> 48:29.744
A friendIy neighbor...

48:29.870 --> 48:31.663
..co-worker...

48:31.789 --> 48:33.498
..sister...

48:33.624 --> 48:35.375
..son.

48:36.752 --> 48:39.629
Are any of them what they seem?

48:39.755 --> 48:42.757
Or are they IittIe bombs
waiting to expIode?

48:42.883 --> 48:44.009
(Sighs)

48:44.135 --> 48:45.594
Happy Thanksgiving, son.

48:48.806 --> 48:51.224
Dexter? Everything OK?

48:51.350 --> 48:52.809
Yeah.

48:53.978 --> 48:55.687
It is, isn't it? (Sighs)

48:56.897 --> 49:00.525
Yes, everything is exactly
the way it should be.

49:01.402 --> 49:02.652
Perfect.

49:05.031 --> 49:06.364
Yeah, you're right.

49:06.490 --> 49:08.950
Why don't we go around the table and
everybody say what they're thankful for?

49:09.076 --> 49:10.577
No!

49:11.454 --> 49:13.955
I don't want this yummy food to get cold.

49:14.665 --> 49:16.416
I'm thankful for Dexter.

49:21.672 --> 49:23.006
Let's eat.

49:27.595 --> 49:31.348
- Sure you don't want to stay?
- I'm too tired to spend the night.

49:31.474 --> 49:33.642
- You made sure of that.
- (Chuckles)

49:35.770 --> 49:37.354
See you tomorrow?

49:37.480 --> 49:39.272
And the day after that...

49:39.398 --> 49:40.857
and after that.

49:43.194 --> 49:46.112
- I'm here if you change your mind.
- Good night.

49:46.822 --> 49:48.156
Good night.

49:59.335 --> 50:00.543
(Sighs)

50:02.880 --> 50:04.214
(Knocking)

50:06.217 --> 50:07.509
Joey!

50:13.432 --> 50:14.933
Hi, Dad.
