-  <i>Previously on</i> You:

00:20.562 --> 00:23.815
I am not some cold-blooded psycho.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.443
Two tablespoons of peanut oil.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.486
- Stop. Stop!

00:29.028 --> 00:31.573
You were trying to tell yourself
you were saving them

00:31.573 --> 00:33.783
from some shadow killer, you?

00:33.783 --> 00:35.368
Tell me where she is!

00:35.368 --> 00:39.039
You poured all that darkness
you hated into this vessel you admired,

00:39.039 --> 00:41.916
all the worst bits in a little package
you don't mind having a pint with.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.960
-  Surprise!
- Surprise! We're engaged!

00:43.960 --> 00:45.503
You're not stable.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.672
My father is the worst man alive.

00:47.672 --> 00:50.759
We've been estranged since I was 20.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.762
I'm not Joe.

00:53.762 --> 00:58.141
I'm just keeping you here
until he finally comes back to kill Dexter.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.064
Attaboy.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.302
You haven't seen the best bit yet.

01:36.679 --> 01:37.680
Go on.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.809
It's nowhere you haven't been before.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.116
Yes, yes, okay.

01:56.866 --> 01:59.244
I'll be back as soon as I can. Okay.

02:03.957 --> 02:04.958
Over here.

02:34.112 --> 02:34.946
I'm sorry.

02:38.741 --> 02:39.576
Fuck.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.661
I'm s-- Here.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.288
Yeah, yeah, here.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.205
Here.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.040
Um...

02:54.716 --> 02:58.595
You have every right to be mad,
but I'm gonna get you out of here.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.847
Don't make promises you can't keep.

03:05.101 --> 03:05.935
Joe.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.901
You know you can trust me, right?

03:14.235 --> 03:15.862
- You can let me out.
-  I--

03:15.862 --> 03:17.238
I will. I will.

03:18.197 --> 03:21.534
- This is delicate.
- Joe, I won't tell a soul, I promise.

03:22.201 --> 03:24.162
All I wanna do is be with my daughter.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.498
Juliette's safety is
the only collateral you could need.

03:27.498 --> 03:30.627
You will be with her.
I never wanted this to happen.

03:30.627 --> 03:34.047
Something is happening to me,
but I'm gonna fix it. Gonna fix it all.

03:41.137 --> 03:41.971
Joe.

03:43.598 --> 03:44.599
Please.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.560
Just let me out.

03:50.146 --> 03:53.858
Now we've had our secrets revealed,
we have a wedding to get to.

03:54.359 --> 03:58.738
You did just kill Montrose. Best not
to skip things so you have a plan, eh?

04:03.409 --> 04:06.204
I have to go. I don't think
I can be back until morning.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.831
Maybe a sandwich isn't enough,
but I might--

04:10.124 --> 04:11.125
Fuck.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.126
Um...

04:12.961 --> 04:13.962
Um...

04:16.839 --> 04:20.426
- I-- Maybe I can--
- Hey, hey, nothing's there.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.639
It's all gone.

04:24.639 --> 04:28.142
Trust me,
the sandwich will hold me over. Thanks.

04:36.150 --> 04:39.070
Okay, well,
I know this seems silly, but...

04:44.284 --> 04:46.202
Until I get back in the morning.

04:47.078 --> 04:47.954
First thing.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.622
With a plan.

04:52.583 --> 04:53.418
I promise.

05:05.471 --> 05:06.889
Holy fuck.

05:08.224 --> 05:12.228
Marienne, are you sure we can't call
the police? What if we hide you?

05:12.228 --> 05:15.523
As long as he's alive,
he will come after me. I just--

05:16.441 --> 05:17.692
I just need to think.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.654
What if he wasn't?

05:23.448 --> 05:24.490
Wasn't what?

05:24.490 --> 05:25.408
Alive.

05:27.827 --> 05:30.455
It's you or him, isn't it?
That's what you're saying to me.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.999
- Have you ever killed someone?
- Of course I haven't.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.668
- What makes you think you can?
- Because he's a monster.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.171
- Who is bigger and is crazy. No.
- I...

05:40.715 --> 05:41.632
Um...

05:43.426 --> 05:44.510
I'll do it.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.140
My child is out there.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.351
- I will not blink. If you could just--
- Knock him out.

05:54.270 --> 05:57.106
Do you remember
that serial killer in L.A.?

05:57.106 --> 06:01.778
You know, the failed-actor one. I know
that he used ketamine on his victims.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.489
He jabbed them from the back
so they didn't see it coming.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.532
- Okay.
- Well, my boyfriend can get ketamine.

06:07.283 --> 06:08.117
And...

06:10.203 --> 06:12.830
I'll come back with a drill
for the door. That's that.

06:12.830 --> 06:13.915
And a knife.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.292
A knife for me.

06:18.086 --> 06:18.920
Fuck.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.257
Hey, Nadia. Nadia.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.177
You don't have to, okay?

06:26.177 --> 06:28.763
I am a stranger to Dexter.

06:30.014 --> 06:32.433
Marienne, you're a person.

06:34.435 --> 06:36.938
And you're a mom. It's not right. I can't.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.273

07:17.770 --> 07:20.148
Last we spoke, you were not exactly flush.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.860
An engagement party is promising
if you manage to get her to the altar.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.488
If? Steve, this party is it. Okay?

07:27.488 --> 07:30.074
Here comes the bride tonight.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.868
 You clever, little man-whore.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.829
Is the lady aware
you're spending her millions?

07:34.829 --> 07:36.622
 It was practically her idea.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.624
- To Lady Phoebe.
- To Lady Phoebe.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.067
 Shoo. Shoo, shoo.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.946
I'll be at the bar. Naturally.

08:10.072 --> 08:12.366
Now, look, don't fret.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.784
Family is meaningless.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.079
I learned that after Sime died.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.337
 Don't fret? Why?

08:25.838 --> 08:29.926
Mama found out that it's a wedding.
So they're all boycotting.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.011
It's fine.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.932
I told the cleaning ladies to put salt
in the mop water to protect us.

08:35.932 --> 08:40.645
Kate, do you think Diana ate on the day
of her wedding? She looked so pure.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.856
Sharon Tate was more of an
eye-shadow girl. Think I need more blush?

08:44.690 --> 08:47.527
- Have you eaten today?
- Why are you so serious?

08:48.486 --> 08:50.530
I heard Adam talking.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.990
Do you know he's planning
to aggressively franchise

08:52.990 --> 08:55.451
and he's telling the investors
you're bankrolling it?

08:58.079 --> 09:01.040
You know how he is.
Always thinking one step ahead.

09:02.041 --> 09:02.875
Phoebe.

09:03.834 --> 09:04.669
Hey.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.170
Phoebe, listen.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.091
Don't marry him.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.720
Did my mother get to you?

09:14.720 --> 09:17.598
No, I'm just your friend
saying just call it off

09:17.598 --> 09:19.350
- for now.
- Bit late for that.

09:19.350 --> 09:22.144
- My hair took three hours.
- This is serious.

09:22.144 --> 09:25.231
Your kindness and ability
to see the good in people,

09:25.231 --> 09:27.858
it's the best thing about Dexter.
But people take advantage.

09:27.858 --> 09:31.195
- Are you calling me stupid?
- No, I'm saying you were brought up

09:31.195 --> 09:34.907
to go along, and he capitalizes on that.
It's not right.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.784
You're saying I don't know my own mind.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.245
Right now, I don't think you do.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.247
You should go downstairs, Kate.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.958
- I'm trying to protect Dexter.
- No, I'm not a fairy princess

09:43.958 --> 09:46.252
who needs soft speech and coddling.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.754
You said yourself
you've never experienced true love.

09:48.754 --> 09:53.259
So I have to think that you're confused.
I'll see you downstairs, Kate.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.095
- Phoebe, listen.
- No, go away. Go away. Now!

09:56.095 --> 09:57.430
All right, I'm going.

You are a manifestation of some dark part
of myself, and I accept that,

10:31.130 --> 10:35.217
but I would love for you to shut up
so I can fix my fuckup in peace.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.730
- What are you doing? Kate needs Dexter.
- Marienne needs me more.

10:47.730 --> 10:51.150
British Invasion. You know
what that means. It's Kate in a minidress.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.615
Maybe slip off for a cheeky finger-bang
during the ceremony.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.952
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like some pearls

I had a whole thing planned,
but if you insist on ignoring me,

11:09.877 --> 11:13.339
I suppose I'll spoil the surprise.
Have you checked your freezer lately?

11:27.311 --> 11:28.312
Remember Vic?

11:28.312 --> 11:30.856
Took that before you squeezed him
into Simon's grave.

11:30.856 --> 11:34.610
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- What do you think? Kill Marienne.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.904
She doesn't deserve to suffer.

No.

11:44.120 --> 11:44.954
No.

Gonna see Kate one last time.
Marienne's not dying.

do anything because you don't exist!

- The plan?
- Yeah, to stop this wedding.

13:03.991 --> 13:04.992
I don't know.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.705
Honestly, Phoebe's having
some sort of manic episode.

13:09.705 --> 13:12.791
I found these on the floor.
Serious tranquilizers.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.920
She's on so many meds. They're literally
scattered around the building.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.964
It's bad, but I overstepped
and she pushed me away.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.967
So I don't know.
I have to think for a moment.

13:21.967 --> 13:22.885
Tipsy.

and get your dick wet.

- Maybe I could talk to Phoebe.
- Adam won't make that easy.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.899
Then this is an opportunity
to tackle this as a team.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.655
- You think you can keep him distracted?
- With pleasure.

13:49.537 --> 13:52.873
- Phoebe, Phoebe, hey.
- No, it's okay. You can let him in.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.550
- I'm so glad you came.
- Thank Dexter.

14:02.550 --> 14:06.178
Listen, darling,
do slip off and give Kate one.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.472
She needs it tonight. She's uptight.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.475
Well, maybe I will.
I wanna say congratulations.

14:11.475 --> 14:14.311
I heard this isn't just a party.

14:14.311 --> 14:17.231
Don't worry.
Don't worry, but I'm happy for Dexter.

14:18.107 --> 14:21.318
You know, I was thinking
that I hope one day Kate and I

14:21.944 --> 14:24.655
maybe could have
what you two have. Eventually.

14:24.655 --> 14:25.739
Aw.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.659
Yes, yes, I mean, I wish that too.

14:28.659 --> 14:32.246

what you mean by what we have?

14:32.246 --> 14:33.455

14:33.455 --> 14:34.623
<i>There's my in.</i>

14:34.623 --> 14:38.544
It's just I know, of course.
I'm just wondering what you perceive.

14:39.044 --> 14:43.132
Well, when I got married,
yeah, well, I mean, I think we just rushed

14:43.132 --> 14:45.634
to the altar and it cursed us.

14:45.634 --> 14:50.222
In retrospect, I wanted to want
to marry her, and that was the disaster.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.643
It's not anything
like you two here, you know.

14:56.854 --> 14:57.688
Quite.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.398
Quite, quite so.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.403
Tell me the truth as you always have.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.742
Are you saying this
because you think I'm making a mistake?

15:10.409 --> 15:11.911
Trying to steal my girl, Moore?

15:14.663 --> 15:15.748
Wouldn't dream of it.

15:16.540 --> 15:17.541
Hey, butternut.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.501
Butternut, are you okay?

15:19.501 --> 15:21.128
Yes, yes, yes.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.630
- Yes.
- What did you say?

15:22.630 --> 15:25.049
- I didn't say any--
- She's upset. What did you say?

15:25.049 --> 15:28.427
- I didn't say anything.
- You should leave. Both of Dexter.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.763
-  No.
- Zbyshek. Show them to the door.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.932
- Phoebe, look at me.
-  Just get them out of here.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.434
Sir?

15:42.566 --> 15:45.069
<i>We failed spectacularly.</i>

15:45.903 --> 15:49.323
<i>At least
I get to walk you home one last time.</i>

15:49.323 --> 15:52.409
I'm still advocating strongly
for that shag.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.996
Ugh. Don't know why I bother trying
to help Dexter.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.290
You could be tasting her right now...

15:59.333 --> 16:02.336
if you weren't determined
to be so miserable.

16:02.336 --> 16:06.799
What was that thing you said to Phoebe
that first night at Sundry House

16:06.799 --> 16:08.884
that changed her life?

16:11.345 --> 16:12.721
Honestly, I don't know.

16:13.430 --> 16:16.725
- Seriously?
- No, I don't remember. I wish I could.

16:16.725 --> 16:21.271
- It might be advice I could use.
- Same. I'm really disappointed.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.695
I really fucked things up
with her tonight, didn't I?

16:29.697 --> 16:33.534
I'm not giving up. Henry VIII didn't
give us divorce for nothing.

16:34.034 --> 16:36.829
<i>I wish we could just keep walking forever.</i>

16:41.000 --> 16:43.210
That was nice... tonight.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.004
The teamwork.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.507
Despite my abject failure.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.635
<i>What do I leave you with?
What matters the most?</i>

16:51.635 --> 16:53.345
Kate, you're a good person.

16:54.471 --> 16:57.307
Not-- No, I don't care
if it's hard to hear.

17:00.769 --> 17:04.440
- If I never see you again--
- Why would you never see me again?

17:06.442 --> 17:09.236
A comet could annihilate the planet.
Yeah, yeah.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.905
- Okay.
- You're good.

17:12.865 --> 17:16.160
And being with you
makes me feel like I could be good.

17:18.245 --> 17:21.165
- I don't do well with compliments.
- But the comet.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.084
- So just--
- With that comet-- Okay. All right.

17:24.084 --> 17:28.255
The world isn't kind or fair,
so I need you to know

17:28.255 --> 17:30.424
that you have changed me the way...

17:32.468 --> 17:35.179
opening a window changes a dark room.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.935
That is the most beautiful thing
anyone's ever said to me.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.357
And here we are.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.571
<i>At our end.</i>

17:57.451 --> 17:58.535
Hold on.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.374
Mrs. Moolvi is not going to like that.

18:04.374 --> 18:09.546
She'll understand once I explain to her
the most incredible woman on this block,

18:09.546 --> 18:14.593
apart from Mrs. Moolvi of course,
is about to invite me

18:15.427 --> 18:17.137
up to her flat.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.057
But you're going to say no.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.601
<i>I can't say goodbye.</i>

18:22.601 --> 18:23.519
<i>How do I--?</i>

18:40.619 --> 18:45.541
I just have a few things
I gotta take care of, you know?

18:46.458 --> 18:47.292
I'll call Dexter.

18:49.670 --> 18:50.838
You promise?

19:04.935 --> 19:06.061
Sweet dreams, Kate.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.022

19:47.477 --> 19:50.939
Phoebe and I, we are a team.

19:50.939 --> 19:55.777
I happen to be the brains of the operation
and she's my beautiful fairy princess

19:55.777 --> 19:57.446
who deserves to be worshiped.

Yes. Yes, I understand
what it means to be sectioned.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.070
I just need to know
where she's been admitted.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.576
I-- I'm gonna have to call you back.

20:45.577 --> 20:46.662
That about Phoebe?

20:48.455 --> 20:49.873
All over the news.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.921
Of course. The people that saw her
wandering the streets confused

20:55.921 --> 20:59.007
thought it was more appropriate
to take a photo of a psychotic break

20:59.007 --> 21:02.344
- than to help her.
- I'm so sorry. Anything I can do?

21:02.344 --> 21:05.264
No, I'm well-versed in psychiatry,
thanks to Mum.

21:05.264 --> 21:09.476
As for Phoebe, there's not much to do,
as her husband is in charge of everything.

21:09.476 --> 21:13.146
Her medication, accommodation,
everything she owns.

21:13.146 --> 21:14.940
He's a pig in shit, I'm sure.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.613
Let's change the subject.
Why are you here?

21:22.823 --> 21:27.160
What? Can't a dad show up,
bring his daughter a cup of coffee?

21:29.955 --> 21:31.748
Okay, since you ask,

21:32.416 --> 21:34.418
I'm here because I need Dexter.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.629
- Can you give the museum a rest?
- To take over the company.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.091
Okay.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.346
What skeletons are going
to fall out of what closet?

21:46.346 --> 21:48.348
- Not about that.
- I don't believe Dexter.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.518
How many children are dead this time?

21:53.979 --> 21:57.357
Honey, you've got to forgive yourself.

21:57.357 --> 21:59.860
Every job has a learning curve.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.571
You are not your mistakes.

22:02.571 --> 22:05.615
And you've been proving that
every single day since you left us.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.617
I couldn't be more proud of Dexter.

22:07.617 --> 22:10.787
I need you here
when I'm firing on all cylinders,

22:10.787 --> 22:12.622
when we can do great things together.

22:12.622 --> 22:16.126
I want it to be us,
and then I want it to be Dexter.

22:19.546 --> 22:23.216
What do you want me to do?
You want me to get down on my knees?

22:23.216 --> 22:26.219
- I will beg you right here.
- No. Stop. Get up.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.015
What I want you to understand is that...

22:31.558 --> 22:33.602
I think about what I did...

22:34.603 --> 22:36.063
and I hate myself.

22:36.063 --> 22:39.983
Come save 10,000 kids
for every one you hurt.

22:39.983 --> 22:41.526
Can you do that? Here?

22:41.526 --> 22:45.864
With this-- This silly gallery,
this little professor kid?

22:45.864 --> 22:47.741
- That's not fair.
- Not much is.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.701
But this life, Katherine,

22:50.494 --> 22:52.204
it's too small for Dexter.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.331
Accept what I'm offering.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.749
Come be somebody real.

23:07.135 --> 23:10.347
I remembered you like sweet things
in the morning.

23:22.901 --> 23:23.902
I have a plan.

23:25.320 --> 23:28.115
I'm working out the kinks,
but you're gonna see Juliette soon.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.157
Liar.

23:29.157 --> 23:31.201
Do you know how Juliette's doing?

23:32.077 --> 23:34.079
- Have you checked or...?
-  I--

23:34.079 --> 23:36.832
I can't remember.
I'm filling in some blanks.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.042
- Could you?
-  Of course.

23:39.042 --> 23:41.086
Um, I...

23:41.086 --> 23:43.839
- I don't remember where I--
- My phone, it's under the tarp.

23:48.009 --> 23:50.345
She's staying with my friend, Beatrice.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.360
 <i>Oh, no.</i>

24:08.488 --> 24:09.781
Uh-oh.

24:10.782 --> 24:11.783
 <i>Oh, shit.</i>

24:14.744 --> 24:16.830
-  What?
-  <i>This will destroy her.</i>

24:20.041 --> 24:21.042
Joe.

24:21.626 --> 24:22.460
Um...

24:24.087 --> 24:25.547
It's Juliette's grandmother.

24:26.131 --> 24:30.260
I guess she's taking custody.
She's taking Juliette back to the States.

24:31.845 --> 24:34.848
- I can fix this too. I swear--
- I can't. She'll win.

24:34.848 --> 24:38.310
I took Juliette and then I abandoned her.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.728
- They--
-  <i>What have I done?</i>

24:39.728 --> 24:45.358
They think I relapsed, Joe.
I'll never see my daughter again.

24:45.358 --> 24:48.987
You might as well kill me, Joe.
Might as well kill me!

24:49.779 --> 24:51.656
<i>How do I fix this?</i>

24:51.656 --> 24:53.450
She is literally begging Dexter.

24:55.368 --> 24:59.497
Wouldn't you be relieved if you ended
her suffering once and for all?

25:08.006 --> 25:11.384
No, injectables, like liquid injectables.

25:12.719 --> 25:13.803
Yes, I am serious.

25:15.388 --> 25:17.641
I'll explain later.
Can you get them or not?

25:17.641 --> 25:20.769
Thank you, Edward.
You're amazing. All right, bye.

25:25.565 --> 25:26.608
Fuck.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.703
- Fuck.
-  Oi. Stop where you are.

25:38.703 --> 25:42.457
- I wouldn't usually, this is an emergency.
-  It's always an emergency.

25:42.457 --> 25:45.460
No. That's my auntie's diabetes kit.
I left it at my mum's.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.754
I need to get them back to her.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.384
What's that in your jumper?

25:53.510 --> 25:54.970
No, no, no.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.056
Okay, step aside now.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.937
-  Why are you packing?
- Timeline's sped up.

26:03.937 --> 26:04.854
Why?

26:05.355 --> 26:08.275
Because you must let
Marienne race to Juliette, or kill her

26:08.275 --> 26:10.568
and have a leisurely bagel.
Honestly, the drama.

26:10.568 --> 26:14.239
I can't even tell you
how much I don't care what you think.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.158
Wind your neck in and listen to reason.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.786
You think you're getting far
with some rubbish passport

26:19.786 --> 26:21.538
you bought off a tween in Peckham?

26:21.538 --> 26:22.664
And for what?

26:22.664 --> 26:25.917
To save a junkie who shagged you
while your wife and child waited at home.

26:25.917 --> 26:29.462
- Shut up.
- Who was not the slightest bit grateful

26:29.462 --> 26:31.464
- you got rid of her ex-husband.
- Stop it.

26:31.464 --> 26:35.885
Who is such a casual mother, she left her
child to go wander in a foreign country.

26:35.885 --> 26:37.637
Of course she got kidnapped.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.641
Serious tranquilizers.

26:42.434 --> 26:46.354
Remind me why you're giving up everything
for some pathetic woman who hates you?

26:49.524 --> 26:50.525
Oh, please.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.528
- What are you doing?
- Shutting you up until morning.

26:59.868 --> 27:02.037
<i>Thank you, Phoebe's pills.</i>

27:03.079 --> 27:04.414
<i>Shit, what time is it?</i>

27:06.750 --> 27:09.252
<i>Okay, the train's in two hours.
Time to go.</i>

27:15.800 --> 27:16.634
Okay.

27:18.345 --> 27:21.723
So I've made all the arrangements.

27:23.767 --> 27:27.687
And there's a lot I can't fix,
but I can make this one thing right.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.279
You're free.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.131
One second.

27:55.131 --> 27:57.384
One, two, one, three, eight, nine.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.680
Sorry. Hang on. Eight, nine.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.599
- Joe, what--?
- What's wrong?

28:04.599 --> 28:06.059
What did you do?

28:07.310 --> 28:08.353
I didn't do anything.

28:10.522 --> 28:14.192
- Peanut oil? I...
- No, I wouldn't. You're not allergic.

28:14.192 --> 28:17.153
I would know if you're allergic.
What do you mean? What's wrong?

28:17.862 --> 28:18.822
- Marienne.

28:20.448 --> 28:21.825
Marienne.

28:22.784 --> 28:23.827
No.

28:24.744 --> 28:25.745
Hold on.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.625
Fuck!

28:31.376 --> 28:32.377
Come on!

28:36.464 --> 28:38.216
Fuck. Come on!

28:49.811 --> 28:52.063
Jonathan, you absolute perv.

28:53.022 --> 28:54.691
Are you looking for this?

28:57.277 --> 28:58.111
Gemma?

29:00.071 --> 29:02.282
- You're dead.
- Don't I bloody know it?

29:03.283 --> 29:07.162
Looking to escape by sea,
or is it another fun weekend at Hampsie?

29:07.162 --> 29:08.079
Listen.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.999
I need that key.

29:10.999 --> 29:13.543
Well, I need an apology.

29:13.543 --> 29:16.045
She's in anaphylactic sh-- Okay.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.256
I'm sorry.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.967
- I'm sorry for what happened to you, but--
- Happened to me?

29:21.551 --> 29:24.387
Jonathan. Sorry. Well, sorry.

29:24.387 --> 29:25.430
Joe...

29:26.639 --> 29:28.475
- you killed me.
- I know.

29:28.475 --> 29:31.686
Didn't even have the decency to give me
a good rogering first. How dare Dexter.

29:31.686 --> 29:34.564
- Please, Gemma. Please.
- Or what? Spit it out.

29:34.564 --> 29:38.151
Oh, you were-- You were disassociating,
so it doesn't count.

29:38.151 --> 29:41.237
- Please, please, just try to understand.
- No, I do.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.530
You had to.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.491
I was on to Dexter.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.577
Self-preservation and whatnot,
but the scary fact is...

29:50.538 --> 29:53.416
I could never have conceived
of what you actually are.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.960
I know what I am.

29:55.960 --> 30:00.006
Yes, you've made that very clear
to yourself these past few days.

30:00.006 --> 30:01.591
Question is,

30:01.591 --> 30:04.135
what are you going to do about it?

30:04.844 --> 30:06.513
Fix my mistake

30:07.138 --> 30:08.556
and save Marienne.

30:09.849 --> 30:12.352
You won't save that poor woman.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.145
You can't.

30:15.104 --> 30:19.025
You're not willing to do
what needs to be done.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.615
<i>He killed her. He strangled her.</i>

30:26.366 --> 30:29.118
<i>- He killed her.
- Can you believe he killed her?</i>

30:29.118 --> 30:31.913
<i>- He killed her.
- Can you believe what happened?</i>

30:44.801 --> 30:46.803
Thank you all so much for coming.

30:46.803 --> 30:51.015
I'll start tonight's reading
with <i>Bluebeard's Castle</i>.

30:53.852 --> 30:54.853
Dexter.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.815
Everyone, this is Joe.

30:59.899 --> 31:02.652
He finished writing my book
after I died in his arms.

31:09.158 --> 31:11.035
Don't look at me.
It's your dream.

31:12.328 --> 31:13.913
What did you do this time?

31:15.623 --> 31:17.166
I put Marienne in...

31:18.585 --> 31:21.379
- I've made a mistake. I need the key.
- You're pathetic.

31:22.213 --> 31:25.633
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings?

31:26.509 --> 31:29.137
Well, I'm fucking dead, Joe.

31:29.637 --> 31:31.139
What do you want from me?

31:31.139 --> 31:33.725
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to change my past mistakes.

31:33.725 --> 31:34.767
You really don't get it.

31:34.767 --> 31:36.686
- Then tell me.
- I am trying to.

31:36.686 --> 31:39.355
You're taunting me
while I try to save a woman.

31:39.355 --> 31:41.566
You don't save, Joe.

31:43.860 --> 31:44.861
No, please! No, wait!

31:50.825 --> 31:52.577
You should be thanking her.

32:03.463 --> 32:04.505
Hi, Joe.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.718
- What the fuck is happening to me?
-  You're going through it.

32:09.344 --> 32:12.138
It's hard, but you'll get there.

32:12.138 --> 32:15.141
Love, do you have the key?

32:16.809 --> 32:18.353
Why do you need the key so badly?

32:20.146 --> 32:20.980
Well...

32:22.065 --> 32:25.902
- I understand if you're angry.
- I can't be angry, Joe.

32:25.902 --> 32:28.154
- You made sure of that.
- I'm sorry.

32:28.154 --> 32:29.822
- You are?
- I never wanted you to die.

32:29.822 --> 32:32.992
- You left me no other way.
- Of course, of course.

32:34.744 --> 32:38.331
I was emotional and unfaithful.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.211
Impulse...

32:44.170 --> 32:47.215
- control issues.
- No, I'm not-- I'm not blaming Dexter.

32:47.215 --> 32:48.633
- I'm not doing that.
- Really?

32:48.633 --> 32:51.594
- That's new.
- I'm-- I'm saying, I think we both--

32:51.594 --> 32:53.554
Right. Amazing point.

32:54.806 --> 32:55.640
We.

32:56.849 --> 32:57.934
Us.

32:57.934 --> 33:01.938
Our love language.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.106
Not Dexter.

33:03.106 --> 33:05.984
Not a pattern. Not your pattern.

33:09.946 --> 33:12.615
So is this a coincidence?

33:16.244 --> 33:17.245
Oh, fuck.

33:17.245 --> 33:19.205
Please. Please.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.166
What is love, Joe?

33:23.418 --> 33:24.252
Lower-case.

33:26.129 --> 33:28.673
Tell me and I'll give you the key.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.175
I...

33:32.093 --> 33:34.887
I'm trying to--
I really did love you once.

33:34.887 --> 33:36.014
Is that love?

33:38.057 --> 33:42.353
- The thing you do that always ends in--
- What do you want me to say?

33:42.353 --> 33:45.565
- I never-- I never want that!
- It's just what you are.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.987
Jesus, Joe. Think-- Think harder.

33:52.697 --> 33:53.740
Here.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.244
It's not the key.

33:58.828 --> 33:59.954
What do you mean?

34:08.337 --> 34:10.715
Somebody does need to die
for this to end for good.

34:22.894 --> 34:25.354
Morning, professor.

34:34.447 --> 34:35.948
I know what I need to do.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.495
Must've been some dream.

34:44.582 --> 34:45.583
You were right.

34:47.126 --> 34:50.963
Freeing Marienne and then running
isn't gonna fix the problem.

34:52.298 --> 34:53.549
I'm gonna free her...

34:55.384 --> 34:58.179
and then I'm ending this cycle
once and for all.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.641
You're not suicidal.

35:02.266 --> 35:04.685
You don't want to die.

35:04.685 --> 35:08.397
All you ever wanted is to be seen,
to be loved,

35:08.397 --> 35:10.900
and you've been willing
to earn it the hard way.

35:10.900 --> 35:15.613
If some selfish bitch wants to reject you
after everything you do for her,

35:16.114 --> 35:18.116
then she never bloody saw Dexter.

35:18.116 --> 35:22.703
After everything,
you deserve all you've earned.

35:23.412 --> 35:26.874
She needs to understand
there is only one way.

35:26.874 --> 35:32.797
She needs to look into your eyes once
and see the raw, passionate depths of Dexter.

35:34.423 --> 35:37.009
And then never see anything again.

35:41.472 --> 35:43.933
This is why I cut you out of me,

35:43.933 --> 35:45.476
you egomaniac, animal.

35:45.476 --> 35:48.271
This will never be me, ever.
I am making good and sure of it.

35:48.271 --> 35:50.189
Now get the fuck out of my way!

35:58.948 --> 36:01.409
Phoebe wasn't maximizing her money, okay?

36:01.409 --> 36:03.995
That is why I am making moves.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.998
It's what my dad-- He never got, okay?

36:06.998 --> 36:09.292
You can't cut a person off and just--

36:09.292 --> 36:12.587
And just expect doors
to just swing open, you know?

36:13.504 --> 36:14.338
But now...

36:16.215 --> 36:19.677
fate has put me in the driver's seat.

36:19.677 --> 36:23.347
You know? It's my money.
It's my life, and I'm--

36:24.182 --> 36:28.769
I'm in control now, you know?
I've got everything under control.

36:28.769 --> 36:30.271
Ow. Ow.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.231
All right.

36:33.482 --> 36:39.113
I'm just so glad that my wife is getting
the help that she so desperately needs.

36:40.072 --> 36:42.325
God, I love saying that. My wife!

36:42.950 --> 36:46.495
That's so nice. Congratulations.
Shall I call the boys in?

36:47.330 --> 36:48.164
Oh.

36:48.706 --> 36:49.540
Yeah.

36:49.540 --> 36:52.668
- Yeah, the more, the merrier.
- Lads!

36:55.463 --> 36:56.380
Oh.

36:57.006 --> 37:01.135
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Hello, boys. Who ordered you?

37:01.135 --> 37:04.597
Um, assuming that you do have both,
I do prefer a water-based lube.

37:05.348 --> 37:08.100
- We won't need lube for this.
- No lube?

37:09.727 --> 37:10.770
Gravy.

37:14.690 --> 37:17.652
Hey, can you--?
Can you turn that down a hair, bro?

37:20.613 --> 37:21.948
What the fuck is that?

37:23.199 --> 37:24.242
What is he doing?

37:25.660 --> 37:28.329
Hey. Can you chill him out for a second?

37:28.329 --> 37:30.081
Whoa, okay. Sweet potato.

37:30.081 --> 37:35.294
Sweet potato, sweet potato,
sweet potato. That is the safe word.

37:37.838 --> 37:39.006
Okay. Fuck.

37:40.132 --> 37:41.133
Who sent you?

37:41.133 --> 37:43.427
What are you getting paid?
Okay, I can triple it.

37:43.427 --> 37:44.804
I can set you up for life.

37:44.804 --> 37:48.224
I'm married
to Lady Phoebe Borehall-Blaxworth, okay?

37:50.059 --> 37:54.272
The problem here is that
you think money can save Dexter.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.440
This isn't about money.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.318
It's always about money.
It's never not about money. Please.

37:59.318 --> 38:01.070
Wait, wait, wait! No!

38:16.544 --> 38:20.381
Hey, guys, I'm gonna need a few minutes.
Why don't you take lunch?

38:20.381 --> 38:22.675
- Sure thing, Mr. Lockwood.
- You too. You go.

38:22.675 --> 38:25.678
- Katherine, to what do we owe--?
- What did you do?

38:28.097 --> 38:31.267
- You care to comment?
- Little rough for your friend.

38:32.518 --> 38:35.938
- Not sure I'd call it a tragedy.
- You did have him killed?

38:36.480 --> 38:39.025
- I did what you asked.
- I never asked Dexter.

38:39.025 --> 38:42.111
Hmm. Frantic call to the NHS,
invoking your mother,

38:42.111 --> 38:44.155
making sure I knew
that little shit was involved.

38:44.155 --> 38:47.908
- I didn't want Adam dead.
- Then why mention him in my presence?

38:49.827 --> 38:50.661
You are--

38:51.954 --> 38:56.584
Of course you respond like this,
like I'm stupid to mention it.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.919
I have no idea why I came here, Dexter...

39:00.296 --> 39:03.716
This place is pathetic.
You'll never see me again. Goodbye.

39:05.259 --> 39:06.260
Katherine!

39:11.223 --> 39:14.101
I want you to take a few days
and wrap things up,

39:14.101 --> 39:16.437
and then come home to New York City.

39:16.979 --> 39:19.273
- That's delusional.
- I'll ease you into the museum,

39:19.273 --> 39:20.983
then teach you the company reins.

39:20.983 --> 39:23.527
No. There was a reason why I left.

39:23.527 --> 39:26.405
I know, I'm sure
you've enjoyed this adventure,

39:26.405 --> 39:28.240
but it's time to come home.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.160
You seem completely incapable
of understanding

39:31.160 --> 39:33.162
me building an entire life here,

39:33.162 --> 39:35.915
one that I am proud of,
one that mirrors who I am,

39:35.915 --> 39:38.167
and one that I would like
to continue living

39:38.167 --> 39:40.461
without your constant
fucking interference!

39:42.046 --> 39:46.050
So what? You just think you created
an independent life for yourself?

39:46.050 --> 39:49.345
- What would you call it?
- You're as smart as they come.

39:50.221 --> 39:53.557
Do you really think
that I'd just let you go?

39:54.600 --> 39:57.395
That internship at the Gagosian
kind of got the ball rolling.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.231
- What are you talking about?
- I called Larry myself.

40:01.315 --> 40:04.402
- Fine. An internship.
- Every job, all of it.

40:04.402 --> 40:09.490
Profile in <i>Artforum</i>, that-- That flat that
you just had to win in the bidding war,

40:09.490 --> 40:12.993
or the lawsuit against your gallery
that just went away,

40:12.993 --> 40:15.913
or the exposé <i>The Times</i> didn't write
on your client, Simon Soo,

40:15.913 --> 40:19.625
and how in the arrogant MeToo fuck
do you think your boy-toy Malcolm

40:19.625 --> 40:22.211
just had his sexual harassment
charge dismissed?

40:22.211 --> 40:25.131
- His wit?
- Malcolm didn't have-- He didn't have--

40:25.131 --> 40:27.049
Oh, no, not as far as you know!

40:27.049 --> 40:29.009
Because he made you happy.

40:29.009 --> 40:30.469
I keep you happy.

40:30.469 --> 40:31.595
I keep you safe.

40:31.595 --> 40:34.765
As I would any investment
of this magnitude.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.152
You have seven children.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.238
- Why--?
- Because you're the one.

40:50.030 --> 40:52.741
The others are too greedy
or stupid or screwed up in the head,

40:52.741 --> 40:54.034
and I love you most.

40:54.034 --> 40:55.035
How about that?

40:56.287 --> 40:57.788
Let's cut the crap, okay?

40:57.788 --> 41:00.833
You've had your process,
but I am done pretending.

41:01.459 --> 41:05.087
I own everything in this world I want,
including Dexter.

41:09.967 --> 41:13.137
I'll give you a call later this week.
We'll set it up.

41:13.679 --> 41:15.764
I want you to drive careful though, okay?

41:33.824 --> 41:35.659
- Hi, hi.
- Hey.

41:35.659 --> 41:37.369
Can't believe they kept me in there.

41:37.369 --> 41:40.706
Thank you so, so much
for helping me pay the penalty.

41:40.706 --> 41:43.375
- Um, have you got--?
- What did you say this was for?

41:43.375 --> 41:46.837
- Can we talk about that later? I gotta go.
- I get that you're in a rush.

41:46.837 --> 41:50.633
Sorry, can I just quickly point out
I spent my entire morning

41:50.633 --> 41:53.636
sitting outside a police station
with a backpack full of ketamine?

41:53.636 --> 41:55.638
- And you won't tell me why.
- No, I will.

41:55.638 --> 41:58.807
Am I completely deluded
to think we're together?

42:00.309 --> 42:02.603
We should talk about this.
We should sometime soon.

42:02.603 --> 42:03.854
- But not when--
- That's fine.

42:06.232 --> 42:07.316
Message received.

42:08.275 --> 42:09.401
Forget it.

42:10.903 --> 42:13.155
- Here. Good luck with that.
- Thank Dexter.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.409
<i>Move! Excuse me!</i>

42:24.792 --> 42:29.171
Stop! Don't destroy your future with Kate
over some unworthy, broken woman.

42:29.171 --> 42:31.840
<i>That's exactly what I'm going to do.</i>

42:33.801 --> 42:36.512
I broke her. This is my fault.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.350
<i>So I'm setting her free</i>

42:41.350 --> 42:44.645
<i>and then making sure
I never hurt another person again.</i>

42:47.356 --> 42:48.357
Oh.

43:02.913 --> 43:03.914
Marienne...?

43:06.000 --> 43:07.585
Oh, no, no, no.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.713
Come on. Come on.

43:14.383 --> 43:15.551
Will you look at that?

43:17.469 --> 43:19.138
She took care of it for Dexter.

43:19.138 --> 43:22.016
To be expected if you leave
a bottle of pills in here with her.

43:22.016 --> 43:24.184
Maybe I should have reminded Dexter.

43:26.061 --> 43:30.774
You could have ended her suffering, Joe,
if only you'd just listened to me.

43:30.774 --> 43:34.320
Maybe from now on,
you do exactly as I say.
