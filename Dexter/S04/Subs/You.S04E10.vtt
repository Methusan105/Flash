00:18.017 --> 00:19.644
<i>Previously on</i> You:

00:19.644 --> 00:22.731
Well, isn't this a pickle?

00:23.481 --> 00:24.983
I'm hallucinating, right?

00:24.983 --> 00:29.320
Killed me? Yes.
He wasn't lying, Joe. He didn't know Dexter.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.949
- Marienne is really in a cage.
- Tell me where she is.

00:32.949 --> 00:36.286
You know where
because you and I are the same person.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.621
Something's happening to me,
but I'm gonna fix it.

00:38.621 --> 00:41.750
- I'm gonna fix it all.
- As long as he's alive,

00:41.750 --> 00:44.753
- he will come after me.
- But what if he wasn't?

00:45.378 --> 00:48.006
I spent my morning
outside a police station

00:48.006 --> 00:49.591
with a backpack full of ketamine

00:49.591 --> 00:51.342
- and you won't tell me why.
- I will.

00:51.342 --> 00:52.761
-  Forget it.
- Thank Dexter.

00:52.761 --> 00:53.970
Good luck with that.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.306
Your friends were killed.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.726
Phoebe, you were bloody kidnapped.
You need rest.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.353
My father is the worst man alive.

01:02.353 --> 01:04.439
I just want to make my own way.

01:04.439 --> 01:07.692
Well, I believe
you can be the person you wanna be.

01:07.692 --> 01:11.029
I own everything in this world I want,
including Dexter.

01:11.654 --> 01:15.116
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- What do you think? Kill Marienne.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.744
Somebody does need to die
for this to end for good.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.621
-  I know what I need to do.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.290
You're not suicidal. You don't wanna die.

01:22.290 --> 01:25.126
- Get the fuck out of my way!
-  Will you look at that?

01:25.126 --> 01:29.547
You could have ended her suffering,
Joe, if only you'd just listened to me.

01:29.547 --> 01:33.301
Maybe from now on you do exactly as I say.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.988
<i>In Tobias Wolff's story
"Bullet in the Brain,"</i>

01:53.988 --> 01:56.699
<i>the hero is going to die.</i>

01:57.242 --> 01:59.035
<i>That part isn't up for debate.</i>

02:07.836 --> 02:12.006
With respect, probably best
to dump her in that lumberyard.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.091
Do her a Malcolm.

02:14.425 --> 02:18.596
<i>It's only a question of how
he's going to spend his final moments.</i>

02:20.807 --> 02:22.433
She wants Juliette to know.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.730
So she doesn't wait for her mom forever.

02:52.547 --> 02:57.218
<i>The story seems to contend
that dying this way is a fitting end.</i>

02:57.218 --> 02:58.803
<i>Wait, so are you saying,</i>

02:58.803 --> 03:00.305
he wants to die?

03:01.014 --> 03:02.098
What do you think?

03:02.098 --> 03:04.392
<i>I could've done this job for decades,</i>

03:04.392 --> 03:08.730
<i>but today,
I retire from this and everything.</i>

03:08.730 --> 03:11.691
<i>It's not a good feeling, turns out,
to know you're going to die.</i>

03:11.691 --> 03:14.611
I think it's a case
of wrong place, wrong time.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.279
No, I think it's grace.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.031
Say more.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.617
To die thinking
of what you most love is...

03:21.534 --> 03:22.702
It's a gift.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.413
What the fuck?

03:25.413 --> 03:27.123
Victoria, please. Phones.

03:27.123 --> 03:30.960
I'm sorry, but Rhys Montrose
was found dead in the woods.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.629
Wait, what?

03:41.512 --> 03:43.014
You've lost them all now.

03:43.681 --> 03:46.017
- You might as well--
- Class dismissed.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.777
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.404
Thanks for coming.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.156
I take it you heard about Montrose.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.243
Mm.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.332
Nadia, be honest.

04:10.124 --> 04:13.336
Was I just
a fling slash occasional dealer?

04:13.336 --> 04:14.254
No.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.339
No, the opposite.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.757
Then what is going on?

04:23.972 --> 04:26.224
I wanna tell Dexter. I really, really do.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.520
I feel like I'm going crazy and...

04:34.148 --> 04:36.734
You are the only person that I trust.

04:40.655 --> 04:44.909
Also, I don't wanna lose you,
and I'm sorry that I pushed you away.

04:51.666 --> 04:55.086
Now, I'm scared you might not believe me,
but here it goes.

04:56.421 --> 05:00.174
Read this.
And then I'm gonna show you something.

05:07.807 --> 05:08.641
Read it.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.021
It's just down here.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.066
No, no. How--?

05:18.234 --> 05:22.613
No, no, no. There was a cage.
There was a glass cage. What the fuck?

05:22.613 --> 05:24.657
What? Like what Love Quinn did?

05:24.657 --> 05:28.077
No, I don't think it was Love Quinn.
I think it was him this whole time.

05:28.745 --> 05:33.374
- I think he came here and he killed her.
- Nadia, Nadia. What's going on?

05:33.958 --> 05:37.420
Oh, my God, I broke into his flat.
And I found this key.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.466
When I got here, there was this cage
and there was a woman inside it.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.218
- Like, locked in the cage?
- I am not lying.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.971
And I'm not crazy.
I wouldn't even write stories this dark.

05:46.971 --> 05:50.391
He had her in the cage and went to class.
You can believe me or you don't.

05:51.059 --> 05:51.893
I believe Dexter.

05:53.144 --> 05:57.023
- One question. Why no police?
- Well, because they'll poke.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.151
They'll ask questions and then he'll
just get on to them and then he'll run.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.910
We need him dead to rights or not at all.

06:09.786 --> 06:10.620
We?

06:12.163 --> 06:12.997
Who else?

06:19.295 --> 06:22.757
 <i>Mr. Ernest Foy, 62,
a keen bird-watcher...</i>

06:22.757 --> 06:25.343
Bloody bird-watcher.
You must be having a laugh.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.845
No way that old fart just stumbles
over the body.

06:27.845 --> 06:31.474
- What'd you do, kick leaves over him?
<i>- ...have reportedly taken DNA samples</i>

06:31.474 --> 06:34.894
<i>-from the site.</i>
- We need to talk about this.

06:34.894 --> 06:39.107
<i>-The discovery of the body...</i>
- What the fuck are you doing? Oh, God.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.733
Tell me it's not a note.

06:40.733 --> 06:45.113
<i>I doomed Juliette to a life
of believing her mother died a junkie.</i>

06:45.113 --> 06:46.405
<i>Love was right.</i>

06:46.405 --> 06:49.117
<i>If I stick around, I'll only do worse.</i>

06:51.953 --> 06:53.621
You are not suicidal.

06:53.621 --> 06:56.707
You're guilty
and you're being epistolary about it.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.209
Wallow later.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.044
Tom Lockwood set us up.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.924
He's coming for you, Joe.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.259
You don't know that.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.219
He sent you to kill
because he knew you could.

07:08.219 --> 07:11.222
The only thing that doesn't line up
is his sanguine attitude

07:11.222 --> 07:13.474
towards a wife stabber
who's dating his daughter.

07:15.476 --> 07:21.023
Oh. Unless he got you
to flay his nemesis and set yourself up.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.109
That would be a move
worthy of Tom Lockwood.

07:39.709 --> 07:43.546
Please go see what's wrong
before you off yourself. I'm curious.

07:54.974 --> 07:55.808
Kate?

08:01.272 --> 08:02.106
Are you okay?

08:03.691 --> 08:05.610
I had to drink a lot to do this.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.699
- What's wrong?
- I visited Phoebe at the hospital.

08:16.370 --> 08:22.210
I was so worried after Adam that Rhys
would simply break her. Did you see--?

08:22.210 --> 08:24.045
Rhys. I did, yeah.

08:25.463 --> 08:28.299
I'd say my father had a hand in it,
but his bodies aren't found

08:28.299 --> 08:30.051
unless he wants it that way.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.014
Anyway, um...

08:38.100 --> 08:41.729
Phoebe figured it out.
She's leaving London when she's better.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.356
Be free.

08:45.107 --> 08:45.942
That's it.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.195
Be free.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.118
You had to drink a lot to do what?

08:58.746 --> 09:03.751
I was going to leave town
and just cut you off by text.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.087
I thought it would be easier.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.924
Because I suppose I've been falling
a little bit in love with Dexter.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.761
- Kate.
- How much do you know about...

09:14.887 --> 09:16.305
stalkers, Jonathan?

09:17.640 --> 09:19.016
Not any more than most.

09:20.768 --> 09:24.146
As you know, when I was 18, 19,
I was working with my dad,

09:24.146 --> 09:25.523
learning the ropes.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.858
I was quite boy crazy.

09:27.858 --> 09:30.486
I liked them tortured and dark.

09:31.988 --> 09:32.822
What happened?

09:34.240 --> 09:35.324
They kept leaving.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.451
Stopped calling.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.454
Or got in trouble with the law. I--

09:42.331 --> 09:45.626
I started to feel I must be cursed.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.712
Someone was interfering?

09:49.964 --> 09:56.012
One day I overheard my father
hiring someone to follow me.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.640
I broke into his office
and there was this file,

09:59.640 --> 10:05.354
phone records, who I'd given a blowjob to,
even my fucking menstrual cycle. It was--

10:05.354 --> 10:07.315
A horrifying violation.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.192
And I confronted him and he simply said:

10:11.193 --> 10:12.320
"I'm your father.

10:13.362 --> 10:16.449
The world isn't safe
and I need to protect Dexter."

10:16.449 --> 10:20.620
Yesterday, he informed me
he's behind everything I've accomplished

10:20.620 --> 10:22.788
from the day I cut him out.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.541
- That can't be true.
- He simply never stopped.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.794
I went to confront him
at his stupid workshop.

10:28.794 --> 10:32.048
He's refurbishing a plane.

10:32.048 --> 10:37.136
Why is it every wealthy man-child
becomes obsessed with flying?

10:38.846 --> 10:41.557
Told me he'd created my life.

10:42.099 --> 10:45.436
Everything I've achieved is not mine.

10:48.564 --> 10:51.567
My entire existence is illusory.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.866
Are you even real or did he send you too?

11:00.076 --> 11:00.910
Kate, no.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.287
No.

11:03.287 --> 11:04.372
This is real.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.456
This is me.

11:07.583 --> 11:08.584
This is Dexter.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.674
He owns me.

11:17.551 --> 11:18.761
He owns me.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.315
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

11:47.957 --> 11:50.084
You'll hate this
because you're no fun, but...

11:51.168 --> 11:53.838
I really do believe
Tom Lockwood needs to die.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.217
I agree.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.135
What?

11:59.969 --> 12:01.345
- Oh, Joe, you thrill--
- Stop.

12:03.347 --> 12:06.392
He has to die. Doesn't make it right.
Doesn't mean that we enjoy it.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.895
- So much easier if we did.
- Rhys. I get it.

12:10.729 --> 12:11.730
I was in denial.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.650
I broke you
right off the darkest part of me

12:14.650 --> 12:16.986
and you've been trying
to get me to see the truth.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.154
Spot-on.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.238
So fine.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.823
I can accept you're me.

12:20.823 --> 12:24.743
I decide if the line gets crossed,
when and why.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.164
I never took you as a top.

12:29.540 --> 12:33.169
Oh, look. Joe, do you think I want
to stand here yabbering on

12:33.169 --> 12:35.296
like some separate bloody person?

12:37.214 --> 12:39.550
Let's stop bickering and come together.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.011
Integrate.

12:43.304 --> 12:48.392
You'll never have to see me again.
It'll just be you firing on all cylinders.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.811
Pure, whole, unburdened Dexter.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.273
We need duct tape,
a box cutter and a quick stop

12:54.273 --> 12:56.859
at that sex-positive toy store
near Bayswater.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.154
We're gonna kill
a near Illuminati-level billionaire.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.364
That requires a pinch of creativity.

13:02.364 --> 13:05.159
That workshop that Kate mentioned
is probably an airplane hangar.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.160
Mm.

13:09.830 --> 13:13.626
Oh, her code is 2-5-0-9-0-3.
Rothko's birthday.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.299
Thank Dexter.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.846
Ah. I'm assuming
he'll be with a bodyguard.

13:25.846 --> 13:28.599
Well, we can do stealth. Whatever.

13:41.237 --> 13:44.198
Tokyo is eight hours ahead.
We have until midnight.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.830
-  Hey.
- Took you four hours to grab dinner?

13:52.540 --> 13:56.043
Well, detoured to my dad's office
at the newspaper for...

13:57.294 --> 13:58.128
this.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.298
If he finds out, add me to the murdered.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.510
Everything on Montrose,
everything on Eat The Rich.

14:05.219 --> 14:08.472
Hopefully, all we need to build a case
against Professor Goldberg.

14:10.641 --> 14:13.519
Pick up some champagne.
I'll be about an hour.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.603
Very good, sir.

14:32.496 --> 14:36.041
I'll dangle the baby over the cliff.
They'll know we're serious.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.380
No, no, no, we could do that.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.551
Sure.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.305
You can also try this.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.015
Get it done.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.392
Yeah. Thanks.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.774
Now's the moment. Go, go, go. Hurry!

15:11.952 --> 15:12.786
Hey, Tom.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.248
I wasn't sure I had the right place.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.375
Keep talking. Don't let him think.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.586
The text was me. Kate doesn't know.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.422
I'm hoping we can talk.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.549
- The DNA.
- The DNA on Rhys's body.

15:25.549 --> 15:27.968
It was a little bit of a surprise.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.891
Looked dramatic, right?
I don't like an ambush.

15:33.891 --> 15:37.144
Neither do I, but I wasn't really sure
how to phrase it to your admin.

15:37.144 --> 15:43.067
"Hey, I need a quick chat with Tom
about the guy I killed for him."

15:43.067 --> 15:45.569
Yeah, about that,
nothing to worry about with the DNA.

15:45.569 --> 15:48.280
- Why is that?
- Christ, just jump this tosser

15:48.280 --> 15:50.366
and put that cloth right down his gullet.

15:50.366 --> 15:54.536
All that was
was me controlling the news cycle.

15:55.537 --> 15:57.206
Didn't have anything to do with Dexter.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.583
And my private counsel,
Cynthia, she's all over it.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.003
- I'd call her and have her bury--
- And ruin the plan?

16:03.003 --> 16:06.632
- Sorry, what plan?
- I take care of Rhys, you take care of me.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.093
Joe.

16:10.552 --> 16:14.723
You're going crazy on me.
Tell you what, I'm gonna call Cynthia now.

16:14.723 --> 16:17.643
I'm gonna make sure
that she knows we're okay.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.627
Good job on the cuffs.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.254
Coroner won't see a mark.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.924
I'm a tad concerned about the force
to push his hand to his own head

16:48.924 --> 16:50.009
with the gun.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.596
Might have
to bundle his arm up a little bit,

16:54.596 --> 16:56.849
but otherwise
it's gonna be very convincing.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.684
I am pleased.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.769
This necessary?

17:03.439 --> 17:06.233
Okay. This isn't only about DNA.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.153
Katherine's upset with me
about our conversation.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.780
I'd harken a guess
she told you what I said?

17:11.780 --> 17:12.865
Said.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.993
And spied, controlled her life.

17:15.993 --> 17:22.041
Do you really believe
that my daughter cares about you?

17:22.916 --> 17:25.919
- Don't take the bait.
- Don't talk about Kate.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.839
She only cares about proving
she doesn't need me.

17:28.839 --> 17:32.843
I mean, the shit she's done
to spite me, but I protect her.

17:32.843 --> 17:37.056
- By chasing away her boyfriends?
- Oh, no, no, she does that on her own.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.392
What else she tell you I do?

17:40.392 --> 17:45.147
Do I seem like the type
who would wanna hurt his own daughter?

17:46.607 --> 17:48.609
But you do hurt her, Tom.

17:50.944 --> 17:51.779
Okay.

17:52.905 --> 17:53.989
I'm done with her.

17:54.990 --> 17:58.243
That's it. I was putting more into it
than I was ever getting out of it.

17:58.243 --> 18:03.332
I mean, listen, you wanna take over
the job of saving Katherine from herself,

18:03.332 --> 18:04.666
be my guest.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.965
- Hugo!
- Joe, hide! Hurry! Hurry!

18:11.965 --> 18:14.218
- Quick!
-  I'm sorry, but the chief justice

18:14.218 --> 18:17.554
- has been trying Dexter.
- Hugo, over here! Right now.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.932
- Hurry up! No, no, behind you!
-  Shit.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.226
Carotid!

18:25.979 --> 18:27.481
That's it. Marvelous!

18:39.326 --> 18:43.872
Okay. I did like suicide for Tom,
but rather difficult now, isn't it?

18:44.706 --> 18:48.127
We can make our friend here
look like a murderer, can't we?

18:58.887 --> 18:59.888
Tell me what you want.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.099
It's yours.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.937
How'd you like to go home again?

19:07.896 --> 19:09.481
As Joe Goldberg.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.899
I can do that for Dexter.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.819
Could scrub you so clean, you whistle.

19:14.736 --> 19:18.282
Won't be a room you can't walk into
and command respect, Joe.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.992
And this? This is nothing.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.035
Business, eggs get broken.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.705
Everybody just walks away, Joe.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.875
Don't be foolish. I want you
to grab that phone and hand it to me.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.918
You're gonna be very rich
in a couple of seconds.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.389
You think you can buy me?

19:42.389 --> 19:43.849
I think I can save Dexter.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.310
That's what money can do.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.022
So you can go back to your life as Joe.

19:58.822 --> 20:03.035
Okay, I hurt Katherine. You love her.
I understand that you're angry.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.621
My methods aren't gentle, but I--

20:07.789 --> 20:09.249
Joe, you got to understand, I...

20:10.500 --> 20:11.501
I came from...

20:12.461 --> 20:13.670
I came from nothing.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.256
Worse.

20:16.256 --> 20:19.301
- So did a lot of people.
- Yeah, I did bad things.

20:21.303 --> 20:25.641
The fuck am I doing? Is this--?
Is it begging you want? Bullshit.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.690
I didn't make the world, Joe.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.567
Neither did Dexter.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.486
You gonna kill me now? Why?

20:38.278 --> 20:39.780
Because I'm a survivor?

20:40.322 --> 20:43.325
Because I had what it takes
to not get eaten alive?

20:43.325 --> 20:48.914
Katherine gets to say, "Daddy's bad,"
because I bubble wrapped her entire world.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.332
You think that worked?

20:51.500 --> 20:55.879
What are you doing for her right now, Joe?
The same goddamn thing.

20:55.879 --> 20:58.048
Don't you let him get in your head.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.925
You don't even see it, do you?

21:01.051 --> 21:02.761
You do this for her,

21:03.679 --> 21:05.430
you become the problem.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.224
You and I are the same, Joe.

21:07.224 --> 21:10.060
We do what has to be done
because that's what being a man is.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.872
This was a good kill.

21:36.837 --> 21:40.007
<i>Even the most curated online
presence gives certain truths.</i>

21:40.007 --> 21:45.470
<i>Tom is into great men, wars,
vintage planes, analog books, intel,</i>

Oh, go back.

22:02.988 --> 22:03.822

Certainly earned a leisurely stroll.

23:32.702 --> 23:33.745
See a few sights.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.249
Joe.

23:40.585 --> 23:41.419
Why am I here?

23:41.419 --> 23:45.298
<i>Because my crazy, dead wife
told me the truth. You're not safe, Kate.</i>

23:45.298 --> 23:47.092
Okay, why are we still...?

23:47.884 --> 23:48.885
So forgive me.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.263
Separate, Joe?

23:51.263 --> 23:53.056
<i>Not yet. Not while I'm alive.</i>

23:53.640 --> 23:56.351
Joe, just precisely what the fuck
have you got planned here?

23:58.687 --> 24:00.105
For fuck's sake, enough!

24:11.158 --> 24:11.992
You won't.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.413
I know you won't.

24:17.664 --> 24:22.294
- And why is that?
- You wage war with your own nature.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.753
That is what you do.

24:24.296 --> 24:27.674
You have this notion
that you're an especially bad person.

24:28.717 --> 24:29.968
Join the bloody club.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.513
What do you think everyone else sees
in the mirror?

24:33.513 --> 24:35.932
I think I've killed a lot more people.

24:35.932 --> 24:39.311
You are a stellar example
of the human condition.

24:39.311 --> 24:43.523
A traumatized brain
constantly trying to shame us.

24:43.523 --> 24:46.568
That's what you need to fight, the shame.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.028
I should be ashamed.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.780
No, that's why I'm fucking standing here,

24:50.780 --> 24:52.908
trying to untwist you
before you kill us both.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.834
Well, go on. Answer.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.628
She probably heard about Tom.

25:05.128 --> 25:06.129
She needs Dexter.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.341
<i>Goodbye, Kate.</i>

25:12.844 --> 25:15.472
I don't understand Dexter.
You and Kate have a future.

25:15.472 --> 25:17.974
- No, we don't.
- Of course you do. Why not?

25:17.974 --> 25:19.100
Because I will--

25:20.560 --> 25:21.561
I'll kill her.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.274
Will you?

25:27.776 --> 25:29.527
Every time I try...

25:30.862 --> 25:32.280
I made it perfect.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.740
It's never enough.

25:33.740 --> 25:39.537
There's no amount of loving or supporting
or killing the assholes holding them back.

25:42.290 --> 25:45.585
I want this time to be different.
It's not gonna be different with Kate.

25:45.585 --> 25:47.879
No, no, no. Stop, stop.

25:47.879 --> 25:50.173
I just helped Dexter.
I can help you with this.

25:50.173 --> 25:55.387
Very sweet of you to offer, Rhys,
but we both know that you're full of shit.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.481
It's not about Kate, is it?

26:09.651 --> 26:10.485
It's us.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.489
Despite all I've ever done for Dexter...

26:20.787 --> 26:21.621
Dexter...

26:24.374 --> 26:25.375
despise me.

26:28.878 --> 26:30.880
All I ever wanted was to make you happy.

26:30.880 --> 26:35.302
And it ends with a corpse
in the trunk of my car over and over.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.554
I can't do that again.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.141
We did what we did for Kate...

26:44.269 --> 26:45.520
- I'm done.
- No.

26:46.896 --> 26:48.523
We can figure this out, you and me.

26:49.941 --> 26:52.861
You and I, we can do anything together.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.864
I'm alive for Dexter.

26:58.533 --> 27:01.911
Why can't you see that?
Why can't you see me the way I see you?

27:05.290 --> 27:06.291
I love you!

27:08.293 --> 27:11.671
<i>Lockwood was right about one thing.</i>

27:12.339 --> 27:13.965
<i>We didn't make the world.</i>

27:13.965 --> 27:16.301
<i>And it fucked us up deeply.</i>

27:16.301 --> 27:21.222
<i>But one thing we can do is decide
whether we're gonna continue the cycle...</i>

27:22.724 --> 27:23.558
<i>or break it.</i>

27:24.142 --> 27:25.852
- Thank Dexter.

28:10.730 --> 28:13.358
<i>They say
everyone who jumps instantly regrets it.</i>

28:15.568 --> 28:18.530
<i>Turns out it's true.</i>

28:24.953 --> 28:28.456
<i>I was trying to protect you,
but what I did was give up.</i>

28:31.543 --> 28:34.003
<i>I should have tried harder,
but now it's too late.</i>

28:34.796 --> 28:36.589
<i>And it means no more walks,</i>

28:37.173 --> 28:39.050
<i>or picking you a rose,</i>

28:39.050 --> 28:40.718
<i>or hearing you laugh,</i>

28:41.428 --> 28:44.180
<i>or kissing you so softly
it's like we're whispering.</i>

28:45.640 --> 28:51.563
<i>All I've ever wanted is to love
and to be loved completely.</i>

28:52.313 --> 28:54.482
<i>I should have fought harder.</i>

28:55.108 --> 28:59.154
<i>I was born to give you that.
That's all that matters.</i>

28:59.696 --> 29:00.530
<i>Dexter.</i>

29:01.489 --> 29:04.033
<i>Just Dexter.</i>

29:29.225 --> 29:31.144
We fell asleep. Oh.

29:34.898 --> 29:35.732
Hey, um...

29:37.817 --> 29:40.737
Let me know when you're awake enough
for me to ask you something.

29:42.489 --> 29:46.534
Oh. I'm quite the morning person, so go.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.920
- Does he know you're on to him?
- I hope not.

30:01.508 --> 30:02.759
What aren't you telling me?

30:10.975 --> 30:14.771
I'm sorry, I've--
I've just realized that this is...

30:17.148 --> 30:19.317
This is really, really dangerous for Dexter.

30:22.737 --> 30:24.823
And you're only doing it
because you care about me.

30:30.578 --> 30:31.412
Okay.

30:39.546 --> 30:42.215
You must never tell anyone this.

30:49.889 --> 30:52.725
Why I need to nail him down
before he slips away.

30:53.810 --> 30:57.355
As long as he's alive,
he will come after me. I just--

30:58.231 --> 30:59.482
I just need to think.

31:01.025 --> 31:02.110
What if he wasn't?

31:03.862 --> 31:04.946
Wasn't what?

31:04.946 --> 31:06.030
Alive.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.533
I'll do it.

31:10.702 --> 31:14.080
My child is out there. I will not blink.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.957
- If you could--
- Knock him out.

31:16.624 --> 31:18.710
My boyfriend can get ketamine.

31:18.710 --> 31:21.462
And a knife. A knife for me.

31:23.715 --> 31:24.549
Fuck.

31:24.549 --> 31:27.719
So I'd asked you for the ketamine.
I'd got a knife.

31:29.762 --> 31:30.763
But, also,

31:31.431 --> 31:34.976
<i>I had this even crazier plan, plan B.</i>

31:34.976 --> 31:36.603
<i>We figured so much could go wrong,</i>

31:36.603 --> 31:40.315
<i>- we should prepare both of them in case.</i>
-  He knows I live for Juliette.

31:40.315 --> 31:44.068
So first step is taking her away,
so I have nothing to live for.

31:44.068 --> 31:47.238
My phone's under the tarp
back there in the backpack.

31:53.161 --> 31:57.165
<i>If we didn't manage to kill Joe,
we were gonna have to kill Marienne.</i>

32:07.008 --> 32:10.178
He didn't know it,
but he was actually texting me.

32:11.930 --> 32:15.058
<i>The real Juliette was safe in Paris
with the real Beatrice.</i>

32:15.058 --> 32:16.559
You might as well kill me!

32:16.559 --> 32:18.728
<i>I don't think it required
much acting</i>

32:18.728 --> 32:20.563
<i>for Marienne to hit rock bottom.</i>

32:20.563 --> 32:22.982
I was terrified
of her taking those beta blockers.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.486
Take enough and it will slow
your heart rate down enough

32:26.486 --> 32:28.571
that you seem like you're dead.

32:28.571 --> 32:32.992
A tiny bit more and it was just too easy
to go wrong, you know.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.203
I wanted to kill him.

32:35.912 --> 32:39.165
It was a much simpler plan
and simpler was better, but--

32:40.625 --> 32:42.085
But plus he deserved it.

32:44.003 --> 32:46.214
But... And you know...

32:48.716 --> 32:50.134
I fucked up.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.223
<i>So Marienne had to enact plan B.</i>

33:14.283 --> 33:16.077
<i>When you bailed me out, I was terrified</i>

33:16.077 --> 33:18.329
<i>I wouldn't get there in time
to follow him.</i>

33:53.865 --> 33:56.367
Come on, come on, come on. Please wake up.

33:57.035 --> 33:57.869
Wake up.

33:58.786 --> 33:59.620
Come on.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.998
Oh, my God. Oh, thank fucking God.

34:01.998 --> 34:03.583
Hey, Marienne, it's me.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.044
You're okay. You're okay.

34:07.211 --> 34:08.046
It's fine.

34:12.884 --> 34:16.137
You are an actual superhero.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.559
I don't know, it wasn't all that.

34:22.351 --> 34:26.105
And it's still not over yet.
I feel like we've hit a wall.

34:26.105 --> 34:27.523
You got her to safety.

34:27.523 --> 34:29.317
He has no idea she's alive.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.944
You didn't tell anyone,
I won't tell a soul.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.156
The more I learn who he is...

34:37.492 --> 34:39.202
I don't trust it was enough.

34:42.497 --> 34:44.916
The way she described him, it's like he--

34:45.583 --> 34:49.045
He fundamentally--
He doesn't let things go.

34:51.589 --> 34:52.423
He can't.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.929
He can't because he's an obsessive.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.100
Oh, my God,
we need to go back to the flat.

35:02.100 --> 35:06.646
Because he would have kept something
from his victims as a souvenir, right?

35:06.646 --> 35:07.563
Exactly.

35:23.246 --> 35:24.080
<i>What?</i>

35:25.540 --> 35:26.541
<i>I'm alive?</i>

35:26.541 --> 35:28.126
Happy birthday.

35:28.709 --> 35:31.337
You died for a bit in the water.

35:31.337 --> 35:34.757
Police boat pulled you out
and revived Dexter. You're very lucky.

35:34.757 --> 35:39.637
They patrol for falls.
I'll tell your friend that you're awake.

35:44.350 --> 35:45.893
<i>If I'm alive, then...</i>

35:56.237 --> 35:57.989
<i>Just me.</i>

36:09.083 --> 36:10.918
You absolute twat.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.465
If you had died,
I would never have forgiven Dexter.

36:21.429 --> 36:22.638
Did you really fall?

36:23.139 --> 36:27.018
<i>If I've gotten another chance,
I can't start by lying.</i>

36:27.602 --> 36:28.436
No.

36:29.812 --> 36:31.022
Oh, fuck, Jonathan.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.575
You should have told me.

36:43.117 --> 36:44.827
I didn't wanna hurt Dexter.

36:45.828 --> 36:46.662
It was...

36:47.163 --> 36:49.248
<i>I guess I say it by just saying it.</i>

36:51.876 --> 36:54.003
I've done terrible things, Kate.

36:54.921 --> 36:55.755
Such as?

36:56.631 --> 36:58.049
<i>Just got you back,</i>

36:58.049 --> 37:00.927
<i>now I tell you the thing
that'll make you leave.</i>

37:00.927 --> 37:02.470
I've killed people.

37:07.808 --> 37:12.021
- And this drove you to the bridge?
- I've been the worst kind of man.

37:13.606 --> 37:18.945
You can ask me anything and I'll tell you,
but you're gonna leave when you hear it.

37:21.489 --> 37:24.450
He's dead, you know. My father.

37:25.701 --> 37:27.119
Murdered for money.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.249
Some might call it karmic.

37:31.249 --> 37:35.586
Still, it's about as simple
as string theory, emotionally speaking.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.091
He made you do something.

37:41.509 --> 37:42.760
Made's a strong word.

37:43.552 --> 37:47.890
His lieutenant, Cynthia, told me about
some DNA they found on Rhys's body.

37:48.891 --> 37:50.643
She felt I might know the perpetrator.

37:52.478 --> 37:53.479
You do.

37:55.022 --> 38:00.236
Sadly, the tests are inconclusive,
so we'll never know who killed Rhys.

38:02.905 --> 38:06.242
No. No, I don't want that. I don't want
you having to cover up what I've--

38:06.242 --> 38:07.159
It's done.

38:08.035 --> 38:09.745
He's left me everything.

38:09.745 --> 38:11.414
The company, empire.

38:12.790 --> 38:15.126
Everything the bloody light
bloody touches.

38:15.751 --> 38:17.461
I told them I'd sleep on it.

38:17.461 --> 38:19.547
Uh, but if you'd asked me
three months ago,

38:19.547 --> 38:21.424
I'd have said no, but then I met Dexter.

38:21.424 --> 38:22.550
You don't understand.

38:22.550 --> 38:27.138
No, listen, you have made it possible
to even conceive of that type of future

38:27.138 --> 38:30.266
because you've gone
and made me believe in myself.

38:30.266 --> 38:36.647
You've been quite insistent
that I'm not a bad person and everything.

38:36.647 --> 38:37.565
So...

38:43.237 --> 38:45.865
In my soul, I know you are good.

38:48.451 --> 38:50.119
Though I have a proposition for Dexter.

38:50.870 --> 38:51.871
You ready?

38:54.457 --> 38:56.250
We keep each other good.

38:57.293 --> 38:58.753
We keep each other good?

39:00.963 --> 39:03.299
Yeah, I-- I do actually mean that.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.301
I think you just said...

39:07.219 --> 39:09.138
the thing I've needed to hear...

39:11.599 --> 39:14.018
someone say to me for a really long time.

39:17.563 --> 39:23.110
We are capable of terrible things,
but I also know that we'd rather die.

39:23.110 --> 39:26.364
- So...
- Yeah, we're in this together.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.782
<i>Am I still dreaming?</i>

39:29.575 --> 39:31.285
I will say yes to everything,

39:31.285 --> 39:35.498
but I need you to help me through
the hard times without losing myself.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.377
If you do this for me,
I'll do the same for Dexter.

39:44.507 --> 39:46.050
When I was in the water...

39:47.885 --> 39:49.637
I thought of you the entire time.

39:52.098 --> 39:53.099
Oh, God, Dexter...

39:54.225 --> 39:56.310
You Americans are so emotional.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.191
I love you too.

40:05.027 --> 40:05.861
So...

40:10.866 --> 40:14.328
what do I need to know about your past?

40:17.248 --> 40:18.249
To start...

40:21.627 --> 40:22.795
my name...

40:26.632 --> 40:27.466
is Joe...

40:28.884 --> 40:29.718
Goldberg.

40:34.723 --> 40:36.809
<i>I am really not sure
this is such a good idea.</i>

40:36.809 --> 40:39.854
Just keep your eyes on the street
and say the word if you see him.

40:39.854 --> 40:42.940
Wait, word? Did we have a word?

40:44.400 --> 40:49.071
<i>"Words," as in, you know, words that add
up to, "He's coming, get the fuck out."</i>

40:50.156 --> 40:52.533
He's an obsessive. He's an obsessive.

40:52.533 --> 40:55.828
- What else?
<i>- Well, he has to be a narcissist, right?</i>

40:56.495 --> 41:00.708
Had to get a thrill out of killing
by night, teaching Ted Chiang by day.

41:00.708 --> 41:05.963
Well, maybe teaching's part of his game.
Maybe he gives his students clues.

41:05.963 --> 41:08.257
"The Man of the Crowd."

41:09.216 --> 41:11.886
It's a nameless man
stalking people of London.

41:11.886 --> 41:16.015
<i>Remember that poet
he was quoting, Robert Lowell?</i>

41:16.015 --> 41:20.936
And that Ouija board stuff, connecting it
to controlling death and life?

41:20.936 --> 41:22.688
<i>James Merrill, you mean.</i>

41:22.688 --> 41:26.692
Uh, no, Merrill did
<i>Changing Light at Sandover.</i>

41:26.692 --> 41:29.278
<i>- Trust me, it-- It was Lowell.</i>
- Trust me, you're wrong.

41:29.278 --> 41:30.946
I'm-- I'm pretty positive.

41:30.946 --> 41:34.992
Well, I'm looking
at his collected works now and...

41:36.994 --> 41:38.204
zero Ouija shit.

41:48.297 --> 41:49.715
Oh, my God.

41:56.722 --> 41:58.057
Oh, we got him, Eddie.

41:58.057 --> 42:00.518
<i>Got him? What does that mean?</i>

42:00.518 --> 42:01.894
- A box.
-  <i>Box?</i>

42:01.894 --> 42:05.022
<i>Of Rhys Montrose's things,
articles, his mail...</i>

42:05.022 --> 42:07.858
<i>Oh, God,
there's really personal shit in here.</i>

42:08.526 --> 42:10.694
Okay, okay, take pictures, right?

42:11.320 --> 42:14.406
Leave it there and get out.
I'll meet you at the car.

42:15.366 --> 42:16.534
<i>- Nadia.</i>
- Yeah?

42:18.369 --> 42:19.620
Nice detecting.

42:42.893 --> 42:44.061
Where are you?

42:49.608 --> 42:50.859
Where the hell is he?

42:53.654 --> 42:55.739
- Oh, shit, fucking hell!
-  Oh, sorry.

42:57.157 --> 42:59.702
- You scared the life out of me.
- It's okay.

42:59.702 --> 43:03.163
Did I see you coming from my flat?
Are you looking for me?

43:04.915 --> 43:06.166
No, I was, um...

43:06.709 --> 43:09.128
No. I was looking for Eddie.

43:09.128 --> 43:12.673
Um, he's been at a mate's.
He should be here now.

43:19.430 --> 43:20.931
What's the code for your phone?

43:26.687 --> 43:27.521
Thank Dexter.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.985
Let's delete these.

43:38.282 --> 43:41.118
Figures that you'd be the one.

43:43.037 --> 43:44.663
Don't be nervous. I wouldn't hurt Dexter.

43:45.331 --> 43:48.709
My circumstances have changed.

43:48.709 --> 43:52.630
I now have access
to substantial resources--

43:52.630 --> 43:57.468
- Don't give me anything. I'll go away.
- You work, what, two, three jobs?

43:57.468 --> 44:00.929
- Sleep's for the rich, right?
- I'm not gonna say anything to anyone.

44:02.598 --> 44:05.309

Your story is incredible.
You must be tired of talking about it.

People are curious, I understand,
but it's-- It is pretty simple.

46:50.557 --> 46:54.436
Many people have lived
through violent partners.

46:54.436 --> 46:57.189
My late wife, Love, was deeply troubled.

46:57.189 --> 46:59.358
I just did my best.

46:59.942 --> 47:03.487
<i>Public consensus is, I made the sensible
choice to put my son in safe hands.</i>

47:03.487 --> 47:08.325
Well, not to blow smoke, but you're sort
of a quiet hero here and back in the UK.

47:08.325 --> 47:10.410
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

47:10.410 --> 47:12.955

47:27.010 --> 47:29.763
As you're grieving your dad,
you've stepped into his shoes,

47:29.763 --> 47:33.350
- kept the company running smoothly.
- I've had help.

47:33.350 --> 47:35.727
Is that how you see your role, Joe?
Supportive boyfriend?

47:35.727 --> 47:38.689

to convince her to elope yet.

47:38.689 --> 47:40.607
Shocker, this woman is busy.

bought a book shop, darling.

47:43.402 --> 47:45.529
It was closing down.

47:45.529 --> 47:49.449
Books are a passion of mine.
We should be talking about the foundation.

47:49.449 --> 47:51.577
It's what this is all for,
after all.

47:51.577 --> 47:55.622

here and London, and by year's end?

47:55.622 --> 47:57.624
Well, I don't mind pushing hard.

47:58.375 --> 48:00.711
If you're looking for the core

48:01.545 --> 48:02.921
She's a fighter.

48:02.921 --> 48:04.423
Oh, I think we both are.

48:07.968 --> 48:09.636

48:20.981 --> 48:21.982
I'm not proud.

48:23.817 --> 48:26.528
But the important part is,
I've been given a chance to redeem myself

48:26.528 --> 48:28.071
and make up for what I've done.

48:28.071 --> 48:34.202
And I can only imagine
how that must sound to you, really.

48:34.202 --> 48:35.203

48:45.464 --> 48:47.633
- No, no, no!

<i>I got a second chance.</i>

48:51.011 --> 48:54.097
<i>And this time, I'm utilizing all of me.</i>

48:56.183 --> 48:57.684
Give me your hand.

49:00.020 --> 49:01.104
Give me your hand.

49:07.444 --> 49:08.278
Nadia.

49:10.405 --> 49:14.242
Tell them all about me.
No one's gonna believe Dexter.

49:14.242 --> 49:15.994
So you'll live.

49:15.994 --> 49:18.622
You're right, I want that for Dexter.

49:18.622 --> 49:22.834
Honestly, my greatest pride as a teacher
is that I could help you grow.

49:25.921 --> 49:29.966
And there's gonna be a box
found in your bedroom by the police.

49:31.176 --> 49:33.345
Rhys Montrose's things. Anonymous tipster.

49:35.055 --> 49:36.306
They'll realize it was Eddie.

49:37.766 --> 49:38.850
That's why you killed him.

49:42.104 --> 49:43.772
You have so many gifts.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.609
I'm looking forward
to watch what you do next.

49:55.992 --> 49:58.370
<i>She refused to speak in her own defense.</i>

49:58.995 --> 50:01.039
<i>Still hasn't spoken from prison.</i>

50:02.124 --> 50:04.668
<i>Like I said, smart.</i>

50:18.515 --> 50:20.225
See, I'm simply very lucky.

50:20.851 --> 50:24.020
Don't give me points for coffee. That's
insulting, not in front of a journalist.

50:25.439 --> 50:26.982
<i>I get it now.</i>

50:26.982 --> 50:29.651
<i>Love can be real, complete.</i>

50:30.902 --> 50:34.197
<i>- If you are.</i>
- So, what's next for the power couple?

50:34.865 --> 50:38.201
Well, at the risk
of sounding terribly sincere,

50:38.827 --> 50:41.371
we're largely focused
on changing the world.

50:41.371 --> 50:43.832
<i>So many ways to do that.</i>

50:43.832 --> 50:45.959
- Hmm.
-  <i>I have so many tools now.</i>

50:45.959 --> 50:50.213
<i>Sure, killing's one of many,
but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution.</i>

50:51.131 --> 50:53.884
She's here to change the world.

50:53.884 --> 50:58.180
<i>Though the killing part
is also much easier now.</i>

50:59.014 --> 51:01.141
<i>But I'm honest with myself about it.</i>

51:01.141 --> 51:03.226
I'm just here to help.
