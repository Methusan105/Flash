00:10.517 --> 00:12.268
<i>Previously on Dexter:</i>

00:13.728 --> 00:16.356
This blood
is from a defensive wound.

00:16.564 --> 00:20.568
So you got arrested, there'll be a trial,
you'll go to prison for a long time.

00:20.777 --> 00:23.863
- Does that mean this is over?
- No.

00:24.447 --> 00:25.573
These men are dangerous.

00:25.782 --> 00:28.410
You should not get involved
with the Koshka Brotherhood.

00:28.618 --> 00:32.163
Don't be scared. I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

00:32.372 --> 00:33.415
Where's Nadia?

00:33.623 --> 00:37.585
Sirko wants you to lose the evidence
linking him to the Colombian murders.

00:37.794 --> 00:41.172
- If I do this, Nadia is a free woman.
- Deal.

00:41.798 --> 00:43.299
What was Price doing here?

00:43.508 --> 00:45.760
He heard we dug up more
Wayne Randall victims...

00:45.969 --> 00:47.637
...asked if he could see the files.

00:47.846 --> 00:50.890
- I fudged the blood report.
- The void pattern on this body...

00:51.099 --> 00:53.601
...indicates a killer much smaller
than Wayne Randall.

00:54.519 --> 00:58.314
- Smaller, like Hannah McKay?
- And I think she kept right on killing.

00:58.523 --> 01:01.234
If that's true, we're totally fucked.
We gave her immunity.

01:01.443 --> 01:03.194
So how'd he die? Your husband?

01:04.654 --> 01:05.697
Heart attack.

01:05.905 --> 01:07.866
She killed her husband, I can feel it.

01:08.074 --> 01:11.494
"Aconite."
ingesting it causes heart attack.

01:16.124 --> 01:17.542
Do what you gotta do.

01:26.384 --> 01:27.677
Dexter...

03:27.797 --> 03:31.759
<i>Chemistry.
I've heard some people have it.</i>

03:32.552 --> 03:35.930
<i>An attraction that can't be quantified
or explained.</i>

03:36.139 --> 03:38.892
<i>Is that the reason behind this?</i>

03:39.475 --> 03:41.895
<i>Loss of control?</i>

03:42.103 --> 03:44.856
<i>Maybe the desire to get Hannah
on my table was just</i> a way...

03:45.064 --> 03:47.483
<i>...to deny the effect she has on me.</i>

03:48.735 --> 03:50.653
<i>So now what?</i>

04:02.415 --> 04:05.627
- How do you like it?
- Not much.

04:06.586 --> 04:09.839
You do this to all the girls
that you go outwith?

04:10.048 --> 04:13.843
- Wrap them up in plastic?
- I don't actually go out.

04:14.052 --> 04:19.349
So, what, this whole date thing was just
to get me alone so you can kill me?

04:24.520 --> 04:26.064
Why?

04:28.942 --> 04:30.443
It's what I do.

04:32.362 --> 04:34.614
You kill people.

04:35.365 --> 04:37.158
Bad people.

04:39.035 --> 04:41.371
So you think I'm bad.

04:43.331 --> 04:45.208
You...

04:46.376 --> 04:48.795
You fit the general description.

04:49.921 --> 04:51.005
You have no idea.

05:16.531 --> 05:20.284
I didn't plan to spend the whole evening
talking about Hannah McKay.

05:20.493 --> 05:23.579
Well, what do you wanna talk about?
The economy?

05:24.914 --> 05:27.959
I don't know.
What kind of music you like?

05:32.255 --> 05:35.133
A jailhouse door slamming shut.
That's my idea of music.

05:38.428 --> 05:41.597
I don't know what's driving me crazier,
Hannah McKay getting away...

05:41.806 --> 05:44.726
...with a shitload of murder,
or you chewing on that straw.

05:44.934 --> 05:46.310
Old habits die hard.

05:47.729 --> 05:51.482
You know, it's gonna be a real downer
for your book if Hannah gets away.

05:51.691 --> 05:57.113
People who buy true crime stuff tend
to like it when the bad guy gets caught.

05:57.321 --> 05:59.323
Maybe I can help you
rewrite the ending.

05:59.532 --> 06:04.912
- So now you're an editor.
- I'm thinking about Hannah's husband.

06:05.121 --> 06:07.832
Forty year olds don't just drop dead
of a heart attack.

06:08.041 --> 06:10.460
I could have the body exhumed,
test it for aconite.

06:10.668 --> 06:11.794
It's been 10 years.

06:12.003 --> 06:15.882
If it's there, the tox screen will find it.
The hard part is getting permission.

06:16.090 --> 06:19.135
Hannah's the next of kin,
and I doubt she's gonna sign off on it.

06:19.343 --> 06:22.638
She's not the only next of kin.
Hannah's husband had a sister.

06:22.847 --> 06:24.932
Well, aren't you
a goddamn know-it-all?

06:27.477 --> 06:30.772
-It's not my only virtue.
- That remains to be seen.

06:35.985 --> 06:38.321
Thank you for dinner.

06:52.210 --> 06:55.379
- We should do it again.
- Yeah, why not?

07:03.554 --> 07:06.849
I'll check my notes on the sister
and get back to you.

07:27.912 --> 07:32.333
<i>Chemistry deals with the reactions
between elementary forms of matter.</i>

07:33.042 --> 07:36.212
<i>Separate the elements,
and you negate the reaction.</i>

07:36.420 --> 07:38.464
- This can't happen again.
- Which part?

07:38.673 --> 07:40.675
- The horse tranquilizer?
- The sex part.

07:40.883 --> 07:43.094
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

07:44.679 --> 07:47.265
- Why?
- We both know it wouldn't end well.

07:49.183 --> 07:50.643
- Just tell me something.
- What?

07:50.810 --> 07:53.855
You're not gonna try and kill me, right.
I have the right to know.

07:54.021 --> 07:56.315
If I was, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

07:56.482 --> 08:00.027
Let's just think of it
as a misunderstanding.

08:00.236 --> 08:01.279
One way to put it.

08:03.906 --> 08:06.826
You know, you don't really seem
that shaken up.

08:07.034 --> 08:09.871
You know, for someone
who thought she was gonna die.

08:10.079 --> 08:14.500
Yeah, you're right, I suppose
I should be a little more freaked out.

08:16.169 --> 08:20.006
Maybe I never really believed
that you were gonna do it.

08:28.055 --> 08:30.558
Boy, did he pick the wrong car.

08:45.823 --> 08:46.908
Oh, don't, don't.

08:58.419 --> 09:02.298
- It was an interesting night.
- That's one way to put it.

09:06.802 --> 09:11.057
You know, you never really asked me
why I kill people.

09:12.850 --> 09:13.976
I don't need to.

09:40.086 --> 09:41.629
<i>Price.</i>

09:42.505 --> 09:46.634
<i>The man thrives on stories,
and I've just given him a great twist.</i>

09:47.301 --> 09:50.513
<i>If he writes about Hannah and me
my career is a memory.</i>

09:50.721 --> 09:54.267
Clouds parted,
and much was revealed.

09:54.475 --> 09:55.518
And that would be?

09:55.726 --> 09:59.021
Now I know why the blood work on the
Wayne Randall spree was so spotty.

09:59.230 --> 10:00.564
You were protecting someone.

10:00.773 --> 10:03.901
<i>As far as Price knows, I'm an innocent
lab geek in over his head.</i>

10:04.110 --> 10:08.406
- How long have you been seeing her?
- What do you want to keep quiet?

10:08.614 --> 10:10.950
It's not in my nature
to keep quiet about anything.

10:11.158 --> 10:13.536
- You can't write about this.
-It's nothing personal.

10:13.744 --> 10:16.163
- I'm just doing my job.
- You'll destroy my job.

10:16.372 --> 10:18.499
Sorry. No way around that.

10:20.334 --> 10:23.504
You could always go on the record,
help me get my facts straight.

10:23.713 --> 10:26.632
I love writing about crimes
from the inside.

10:28.092 --> 10:29.844
What if I give you something better?

10:30.052 --> 10:33.848
What better than
"Lab tech seduced by femme fatale?"

10:34.056 --> 10:36.225
I was the last one to speak
with Wayne Randall.

10:36.434 --> 10:39.186
I could tell you
what his last words were.

10:39.395 --> 10:41.147
How he really felt about Hannah.

10:41.355 --> 10:44.567
How do I know you wouldn't be making
something up to save your ass?

10:44.775 --> 10:47.528
I wouldn't be,
but you'd have to judge for yourself.

10:47.737 --> 10:49.780
Either way, I'd be on the record.

10:51.741 --> 10:52.950
I'll give it some thought.

10:54.452 --> 10:57.246
In the meantime, I'll keep quiet
about you and Hannah McKay.

10:57.455 --> 10:58.998
Show of good faith.

11:00.041 --> 11:03.919
Between you and me,
I'd watch what I eat around her.

11:05.838 --> 11:07.423
I'll be in touch.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.811
<i>As if I needed another reason
to stay away from Hannah.</i>

11:21.020 --> 11:23.814
<i>At least
I've bought myself some time.</i>

11:28.819 --> 11:31.155
- This a good time?
- Yes.

11:33.199 --> 11:36.744
My theory on the barrel girl killers
went nowhere.

11:36.952 --> 11:38.788
I'm on a dead end
on Bay Harbor Butcher.

11:38.996 --> 11:41.165
- Shit.
- I was thinking we could brainstorm.

11:41.374 --> 11:43.709
I keep wondering
if we haven't missed something.

11:43.918 --> 11:46.629
You know, some angle, or--

11:46.837 --> 11:49.757
You know,
maybe we haven't missed anything.

11:50.633 --> 11:53.010
- What do you mean?
- Maybe we've been sidetracked...

11:53.219 --> 11:55.846
...by our feelings
about Sergeant Doakes.

11:56.055 --> 11:58.140
I think we've been objective.

11:58.349 --> 12:00.309
Well, I guess I'm just not sure,
you know?

12:00.518 --> 12:03.813
I know what it's like to hold
on to an idea of someone, you know?

12:04.021 --> 12:07.691
To refuse to believe
that they have a dark side...

12:07.900 --> 12:10.152
...but everything we've done,
all the evidence...

12:10.361 --> 12:12.780
...it still points to Sergeant Doakes.

12:13.531 --> 12:16.158
At some point, we have to face facts.

12:16.367 --> 12:19.954
It's possible
that we've been reaching for leads.

12:20.162 --> 12:22.706
So should we rethink
what we're doing here?

12:23.541 --> 12:26.377
I mean, I just...
I don't know if it's worth it.

12:28.337 --> 12:30.297
Maybe you're right.

12:42.518 --> 12:44.186
I'm fucking going to hell.

12:46.188 --> 12:49.608
<i>Sal Price made his living writing
about the dark things people</i> do...

12:49.817 --> 12:52.736
<i>...but he doesn't seem
to have a dark side of his own.</i>

12:52.945 --> 12:55.573
<i>At least nothing I can use.</i>

13:00.578 --> 13:03.372
- You have a minute?
- Sure.

13:04.915 --> 13:05.958
What's this?

13:06.167 --> 13:08.210
It's your report
on the Randall victims.

13:08.419 --> 13:09.462
What about it?

13:09.670 --> 13:11.422
There's something weird.

13:11.630 --> 13:16.177
This blood spatter points
to a killer other than Wayne Randall.

13:16.385 --> 13:18.637
Someone smaller.

13:20.806 --> 13:21.849
How'd you come to that?

13:22.057 --> 13:25.019
Sal Price had an outside lab
run an analysis.

13:25.853 --> 13:27.313
They found the discrepancies.

13:27.980 --> 13:30.691
<i>- Did you</i> miss <i>this?
- Price strikes again.</i>

13:30.900 --> 13:32.276
<i>Where will he show up next?</i>

13:32.485 --> 13:36.363
Deb, I didn't miss anything.
I considered the same scenario.

13:36.572 --> 13:38.032
And?

13:38.240 --> 13:41.494
Blood spatter is largely a matter
of interpretation...

13:41.702 --> 13:43.954
...but I'm convinced Wayne
was the sole killer.

13:44.163 --> 13:46.248
These blood drops
came from the killer.

13:46.457 --> 13:49.668
You could've tested them to see if
they matched Wayne Randall's DNA...

13:49.877 --> 13:51.045
...just to be sure.

13:51.253 --> 13:54.840
But I was sure. I didn't think the test
was worth the time or the money.

13:55.049 --> 13:58.177
Especially since the case
had been solved.

14:00.846 --> 14:02.348
Just say what you wanna say.

14:02.556 --> 14:05.017
Hannah McKay killed this woman
and you're covering.

14:05.226 --> 14:08.062
- Why would I wanna do that?
- To save her for your table.

14:10.898 --> 14:13.817
You're wrong, Deb.
If you want, I'll have the blood tested.

14:14.026 --> 14:16.403
Just say the word,
we can spend the money.

14:16.612 --> 14:18.322
I'll think about it.

14:26.789 --> 14:28.499
You smell that?

14:28.707 --> 14:30.709
- What?
- Sulphur, mixed with shit.

14:31.335 --> 14:33.504
Means Isaak Sirko's attorney
is on his way.

14:34.046 --> 14:38.551
They wanna run their own analysis
on the samples we took from Mateo's.

14:38.759 --> 14:41.470
Confirm that it's his client's blood
we found.

14:41.679 --> 14:44.265
- Masuka's grabbing it now.
<i>- I'll</i> have it ready for them.

14:44.473 --> 14:47.393
That evidence should keep Isaak
locked up for a long time.

14:47.601 --> 14:49.186
<i>One less killer to worry about.</i>

14:49.395 --> 14:53.774
I just checked the freezer.
The evidence on Sirko is gone.

14:53.983 --> 14:55.818
<i>Or not.</i>

14:56.986 --> 14:59.655
How in the hell does the most
crucial piece of evidence...

14:59.863 --> 15:04.285
...against Isaak Sirko just disappear
from our own police station?

15:04.493 --> 15:05.536
I don't know.

15:05.744 --> 15:07.955
I logged the blood samples
into evidence myself.

15:08.163 --> 15:09.498
There's only one explanation.

15:09.707 --> 15:11.709
The Koshka Brotherhood
has a mole inside.

15:11.917 --> 15:13.586
A mole?
You read too many spy novels.

15:13.794 --> 15:15.713
Maybe the evidence
just got misplaced.

15:15.921 --> 15:19.258
Hey, we do not misplace evidence.
And who reads anymore?

15:19.466 --> 15:21.885
- Simmer down, tiger mom.
- Masuka's right.

15:22.094 --> 15:24.471
This is why Sirko's attorney
asked for discovery.

15:24.680 --> 15:27.349
Evidence would be missing,
we'd be left holding our dicks.

15:27.516 --> 15:29.184
We can find who's responsible later.

15:29.393 --> 15:31.562
We have 24 hours
to find those blood samples...

15:31.729 --> 15:35.024
...or to come up with new evidence.
And if we don't, Sirko walks.

15:35.941 --> 15:37.860
I'm gonna go
check the evidence room log.

15:38.402 --> 15:40.654
See who's been there
in the last couple of days.

15:40.863 --> 15:42.823
The crime scene
hasn't been released yet.

15:43.032 --> 15:45.618
Maybe we could re-collect a sample
of Sirko's blood.

15:45.826 --> 15:48.704
Fucking haul your ass over there.
Masuka, Quinn, go with him.

15:52.958 --> 15:56.170
We let a fish this big slip
through our net...

15:56.629 --> 15:58.881
...I'm gonna be very unhappy.

16:02.926 --> 16:04.470
You and me both.

16:04.678 --> 16:08.098
- What's going on with the restaurant?
- I've been approved to take over...

16:08.307 --> 16:11.143
...but I still need a few thousand
to keep the place running.

16:11.352 --> 16:13.020
- What are you gonna do?
- Turn over cushions...

16:13.228 --> 16:16.440
...stand in the corner with a tin cup,
I don't know.

16:22.738 --> 16:23.989
Holy shit.

16:24.198 --> 16:27.326
I don't know about the holy,
but there's no denying the shit part.

16:27.534 --> 16:29.328
Fucking Koshkas.

16:29.536 --> 16:33.248
They fucked up the sewage line
to contaminate the crime scene.

16:33.457 --> 16:35.542
Which means Sirko
will be free soon.

16:36.126 --> 16:38.462
<i>And I'll have to kill him
before he comes after me.</i>

16:38.671 --> 16:40.506
Need any more proof
that there's a mole?

16:40.714 --> 16:43.467
I hate to ask, but would you guys
take a look around...

16:43.676 --> 16:46.637
...see if there's any blood anywhere
that's not mixed with crap'?

16:46.845 --> 16:49.932
- I wouldn't get my hopes up.
- They do not pay us enough for this.

16:50.140 --> 16:52.393
Quinn, can I talk to you outside?

16:52.601 --> 16:55.437
Why don't you guys wait outside
while we're in here vomiting?

17:03.779 --> 17:07.700
The list of visitors of the evidence
lock-up in the last 72 hours.

17:07.908 --> 17:09.118
- Your name's on it.
- So?

17:09.326 --> 17:12.287
- So, what were you doing in there?
- I don't know, my job, maybe?

17:12.496 --> 17:14.039
I'm a detective,
I go to Evidence.

17:14.248 --> 17:16.083
- What was the case?
- The Dixon murders.

17:16.291 --> 17:17.501
I gotta testify next week.

17:17.710 --> 17:19.712
Wanted to make sure
I had my ducks in a row.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.922
- What you insinuating?
- You're dating a stripper...

17:22.131 --> 17:24.007
...that works at a club owned
by the Koshka Brotherhood.

17:24.216 --> 17:26.343
So you think I stole evidence
for the Koshkas?

17:26.552 --> 17:28.262
- Doesn't look good.
- Fuck you.

17:28.470 --> 17:32.224
Hold on. You're no choirboy,
but I know you wouldn't sink that low.

17:32.433 --> 17:36.729
- Then why are we talking about this?
- Because I'm doing my job...

17:36.937 --> 17:38.605
...and I needed to hear it from you.

17:49.908 --> 17:51.952
No, it looks like
it was deliberate, Deb.

17:52.161 --> 17:54.913
We're not gonna find any
new evidence, at least not here.

17:55.122 --> 17:58.417
We're halfway through another sweep
and so far we've got fucking zip.

17:58.625 --> 18:01.253
- I don't think you're gonna find anything.
- Neither do I.

18:01.795 --> 18:04.131
Dexter, if this case falls apart
and Isaak walks...

18:04.339 --> 18:06.675
-...he could be on the street tonight.
- I know.

18:06.884 --> 18:10.512
- Just have to take care of him myself.
- Stay the fuck away from him.

18:10.721 --> 18:13.056
I don't think ignoring Isaak
is the right approach.

18:13.265 --> 18:14.433
I'm not gonna ignore him.

18:14.641 --> 18:18.353
I'm gonna put a tail on him 24/7
until his travel visa expires.

18:18.562 --> 18:21.440
<i>He's not gonna pick crust
out of his eye without us knowing.</i>

18:21.607 --> 18:23.984
So don't fucking do anything.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.862
I won't.

18:27.905 --> 18:31.283
<i>Except use the time
to get Sal Price off my back.</i>

18:35.120 --> 18:38.624
The address for the sister
of Hannah's late husband.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.044
Her name's Lori.

18:42.252 --> 18:46.381
- Have you ever heard of e-mail?
- I like interacting face-to-face.

18:46.590 --> 18:49.551
Especially when their face
looks like yours.

18:50.093 --> 18:51.804
You can cancel that shit right now.

18:52.012 --> 18:55.432
- You got a problem with compliments?
- Yes, when they're slightly cheesy...

18:55.641 --> 18:57.476
...and they come out of the blue,
yeah.

18:57.684 --> 19:01.146
I'll try to contact Lori
and get permission for the exhumation.

19:01.355 --> 19:04.191
- Can I tag along, for the interview?
- No.

19:04.399 --> 19:08.403
It's gonna be awkward enough without
some goofy writer hovering over us.

19:08.612 --> 19:10.656
Maybe we can meet later
and you fill me in.

19:10.864 --> 19:15.494
I did get you the info. Come on.
It'll be totally off the record.

19:18.205 --> 19:19.957
Fair enough.

19:21.208 --> 19:23.293
But I'm buying.

19:31.385 --> 19:34.513
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

19:34.721 --> 19:37.140
I thought
I wasn't going to see you again.

19:37.349 --> 19:39.309
- They hurt you?
- No.

19:39.518 --> 19:42.187
They sent me to their club
in Fort Myers. I was so scared.

19:42.396 --> 19:44.982
I thought for sure they were gonna
send me back to Kiev.

19:45.190 --> 19:50.529
I'd burn down every one of their
fucking clubs before I let that happen.

19:51.738 --> 19:52.781
Oh, my God, Joey.

19:52.990 --> 19:55.367
Did you promise them something
to keep me here?

19:55.576 --> 19:59.121
- Don't worry about it.
- I warned you about the Koshkas.

19:59.329 --> 20:02.583
I can take care of myself.
And I can take care of the both of us.

20:03.458 --> 20:04.793
Look at me.

20:05.002 --> 20:08.547
Very soon, you're never gonna have
to work for any of those people again.

20:08.755 --> 20:09.798
I don't understand.

20:10.007 --> 20:12.384
- What have you done?
- You're gonna be free.

20:12.593 --> 20:13.677
Trust me.

20:24.688 --> 20:27.816
I'm touched you wanted to be part
of my welcome back committee.

20:28.317 --> 20:30.360
More like a parade.

20:30.569 --> 20:34.406
Heat like that's gotta make
a flight home to Kiev feel pretty good.

20:34.615 --> 20:36.033
Not yet, George.

20:36.241 --> 20:39.411
Miami is still overcrowded, by one.

20:41.371 --> 20:43.874
So you said this
was about my brother Jake?

20:44.082 --> 20:45.292
Yes.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.587
This may be a little upsetting...

20:48.795 --> 20:51.173
...but we need your permission
to exhume his body.

20:51.381 --> 20:54.009
Exhume his body? Why?

20:54.217 --> 20:57.304
Evidence has come to light
that your brother's death...

20:57.512 --> 20:59.056
...may not have been an accident.

20:59.264 --> 21:00.766
But Jake died of a heart attack.

21:00.974 --> 21:03.143
We believe
he may have been poisoned...

21:03.352 --> 21:05.270
...and that his wife was responsible.

21:05.479 --> 21:07.397
Oh, my God. Hannah?

21:07.606 --> 21:09.816
That's what we're thinking.

21:09.983 --> 21:12.069
Did she and your brother get along?

21:12.277 --> 21:14.613
Yeah, they seemed
to have a great relationship.

21:15.113 --> 21:17.407
Looked like they were totally in love.

21:17.616 --> 21:20.035
Especially after they found out
she was expecting.

21:20.994 --> 21:24.289
- She was pregnant?
- Yeah, she told me in confidence.

21:24.498 --> 21:27.376
I was surprised.
I didn't think Hannah wanted kids.

21:27.584 --> 21:30.462
- What happened to the baby?
- She lost it.

21:30.671 --> 21:34.508
Right after Jake's death.
It was a miscarriage.

21:35.634 --> 21:38.929
You know, after the funeral,
Hannah cut everyone off.

21:39.137 --> 21:41.765
It was like my whole side of the family
never existed.

21:42.516 --> 21:44.393
No matter how many times
I reached out...

21:44.601 --> 21:47.104
...she just wouldn't reciprocate.

21:47.646 --> 21:49.898
Ms. Kirkwood, I think
we can find out for sure...

21:50.107 --> 21:51.817
...what happened to your brother.

21:52.734 --> 21:53.902
We just need your help.

21:59.491 --> 22:02.536
- That looks heavy. Need a hand?
- I need you out of my life.

22:02.744 --> 22:05.247
That can be arranged.
All you have to do is talk to me.

22:05.455 --> 22:08.375
Everything I have to say to you
can be summed up in two words--

22:08.583 --> 22:11.753
- Let me guess, "fuck off."
- Glad we got that straight.

22:11.962 --> 22:14.631
I want to write the authorised
biography of Hannah McKay.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.717
It'll go through the roof.

22:16.925 --> 22:19.302
God knows I haven't
had a decent seller in years.

22:19.511 --> 22:21.179
- I need this, Hannah.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

22:21.388 --> 22:24.141
I missed the last part over the sound
of my heart breaking.

22:24.349 --> 22:26.935
You don't talk to me,
you'll force me to speculate.

22:27.144 --> 22:30.439
- Maybe even get creative.
- It takes brains to be creative.

22:30.647 --> 22:33.775
"Hannah McKay
never lost her taste for killing.

22:33.984 --> 22:38.321
She just updated her technique
from knives to poison."

22:40.240 --> 22:41.992
Just an excerpt from the preface.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.870
Along with some material
on one Dexter Morgan--

22:45.078 --> 22:46.872
Who's a fan of my work, by the way.

22:47.080 --> 22:51.543
--And how he manipulated evidence
to help the woman he loved.

22:52.002 --> 22:55.922
<i>- I'll</i> deny everything.
- Which will be great publicity.

22:58.133 --> 23:01.595
Okay. Fine, we'll talk.

23:01.803 --> 23:04.431
Just keep Dexter out of this.

23:05.932 --> 23:08.143
Depends on what you give me.

23:08.852 --> 23:12.647
My house, tomorrow, 4 p.m.

23:24.284 --> 23:26.620
<i>- Hello?
- It's your favourite author.</i>

23:26.828 --> 23:29.414
Decided to take you up
on your Wayne Randall offer.

23:29.581 --> 23:31.833
<i>- You won't be sorry.
- I'll come to your place.</i>

23:32.042 --> 23:34.377
How's tomorrow night sound?
Seven p.m.?

23:34.586 --> 23:35.754
Seven it is.

23:40.759 --> 23:43.136
Price covered
a lot of murders during his career.

23:45.263 --> 23:47.557
The bloodier, the better.

23:47.766 --> 23:50.268
He likes getting at his cases
from the inside.

23:53.355 --> 23:56.024
You can't get more inside
than becoming a suspect.

23:59.111 --> 24:02.489
Christy Lawson.
Her killer was never found.

24:02.697 --> 24:07.327
Price wrote a book about her case.
One of his best sellers.

24:08.453 --> 24:12.124
All I need is Price's DNA
to link him to the crime.

24:21.424 --> 24:23.885
You should throw that away, Dex.

24:26.388 --> 24:28.181
Hannah needs to know
what's going on.

24:28.390 --> 24:30.392
You're looking for an excuse
to see her.

24:30.600 --> 24:33.103
You could just pick up the phone.

24:42.612 --> 24:45.699
Christ, Joey. You're here so often,
we gotta get you your own spot.

24:45.907 --> 24:48.577
I did what you wanted.
The evidence against Sirko is gone.

24:48.785 --> 24:49.911
I want Nadia's passport.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.706
She's done with you,
and your whole shitty organisation.

24:52.914 --> 24:54.499
Is she?

24:59.379 --> 25:02.215
- Yeah, and so am I.
- We've been working well together.

25:02.382 --> 25:04.801
- Why kill a good thing?
- Who do you think you're fucking with?

25:04.968 --> 25:07.596
Think I'm some fucking asshole,
one of your bag men?

25:07.804 --> 25:09.472
- Take it easy.
- I could fuck you up.

25:09.681 --> 25:12.392
It goes two ways, detective.
You destroyed police evidence.

25:12.601 --> 25:15.770
That'll get you thrown off the force.
Hell, you'd probably do time.

25:15.979 --> 25:18.732
- Stay the fuck away from me.
- That's not gonna happen, Joey.

25:18.940 --> 25:21.067
So you think real hard
about your next move...

25:21.276 --> 25:23.486
...and what it means for your future.

25:23.695 --> 25:25.614
And Nadia's.

25:45.342 --> 25:48.803
You managed to stay away from me
for one whole day.

25:49.554 --> 25:51.056
What happened to our plan?

25:51.723 --> 25:52.974
Sal Price happened.

25:53.183 --> 25:54.726
- Price?
- He saw us together...

25:54.935 --> 25:56.144
...when I dropped you off.

25:56.353 --> 25:59.439
He threatened to put me in his book.

25:59.648 --> 26:01.024
I can't let that happen.

26:02.359 --> 26:03.401
There's more.

26:03.610 --> 26:05.111
He showed up at the Flower Mart.

26:05.320 --> 26:08.448
He wants me to go on record
about my time with Wayne...

26:08.657 --> 26:10.575
...or he'll say that I'm a murderer.

26:12.285 --> 26:13.620
I'm gonna handle Price.

26:13.828 --> 26:15.455
Like the way you handled me?

26:17.165 --> 26:19.960
Not exactly. I only go after killers.

26:21.169 --> 26:24.339
- Like me.
-It's the code I live by.

26:27.425 --> 26:28.760
Code, huh?

26:30.845 --> 26:35.267
Sometimes life just has to be taken.
There's no need to dress it up.

26:36.935 --> 26:37.978
It's more than that.

26:38.186 --> 26:41.690
I think you're just afraid to admit
that you enjoy killing.

26:43.650 --> 26:45.485
And you don't?

26:46.861 --> 26:48.029
No.

26:48.989 --> 26:52.117
Killing for me is just surrendering
to nature's way.

26:52.325 --> 26:54.035
Nature adds and subtracts.

26:55.787 --> 26:57.872
Survival of the fittest.

26:59.249 --> 27:00.834
So you're the fittest.

27:01.042 --> 27:02.544
So far.

27:07.257 --> 27:11.011
You ever wonder what it would be like
if you didn't have all these rules?

27:17.017 --> 27:18.768
Price doesn't have to die.

27:20.937 --> 27:23.023
I can get him to back off for good.

27:23.231 --> 27:26.609
I'm used to dealing with things
on my own. I don't need somebody.

27:26.818 --> 27:28.028
I know you don't.

27:29.738 --> 27:31.239
But I have this covered.

27:32.866 --> 27:34.784
Consider it a good-bye present.

27:36.828 --> 27:38.413
Okay.

27:39.122 --> 27:42.042
I suppose we're going for a record.

27:43.251 --> 27:44.294
A record?

27:44.502 --> 27:48.131
How many times
we can say goodbye for good.

27:51.343 --> 27:53.053
Good bye.

28:06.191 --> 28:10.111
<i>She isn't drawn to my darkness
like Lila, or blind to it like Rita...</i>

28:10.320 --> 28:12.238
<i>...and she doesn't need it
like Lumen.</i>

28:12.447 --> 28:15.158
<i>She accepts both sides of me.</i>

28:15.367 --> 28:17.410
<i>The whole Dexter.</i>

28:19.287 --> 28:21.748
<i>So why am I walking away
from this?</i>

28:22.832 --> 28:27.545
<i>Because when some chemicals mix
they combust and explode.</i>

28:30.090 --> 28:33.468
- You don't have to be here.
- He's my brother.

28:33.676 --> 28:35.595
I understand.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.933
- You okay?
- Yeah.

28:49.901 --> 28:51.361
What the fuck?

28:52.821 --> 28:54.155
There's no tissue.

28:54.364 --> 28:57.283
- That normal?
- It is if the body wasn't embalmed.

28:57.867 --> 28:59.244
Isn't that standard procedure?

28:59.452 --> 29:01.913
Unless the next of kin
specifies otherwise.

29:04.290 --> 29:07.168
- Can we do the tests?
- Not on bones, lieutenant.

29:07.377 --> 29:09.587
There's nothing I can do here.

29:15.552 --> 29:16.594
What is it?

29:17.137 --> 29:19.389
Your brother's remains...

29:22.517 --> 29:23.977
He wasn't embalmed.

29:24.811 --> 29:27.230
- I don't understand.
- We can't run the tests.

29:27.439 --> 29:29.566
So you're saying this was all
for nothing?

29:30.400 --> 29:32.777
I'm gonna find out
what happened, Lori.

29:32.986 --> 29:35.071
I'm not gonna give up.

29:49.377 --> 29:51.713
I can see this was a good idea.

29:51.921 --> 29:55.842
- You look like you need a drink.
- Yeah, or five.

29:56.050 --> 29:58.845
Excuse me.
Bottled brew for the lady.

29:59.053 --> 30:02.849
Actually, can I get a double scotch,
neat, please?

30:03.850 --> 30:06.060
When do you get the results
for the exhumation?

30:06.269 --> 30:07.312
We won't.

30:07.520 --> 30:10.231
The body was more like a pile
of bones. Nothing to test.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.442
- Shit. He wasn't embalmed.
- Yeah.

30:12.650 --> 30:14.652
And surprise,
it was at the discretion of...

30:14.819 --> 30:16.488
-...Hannah.
- Hannah.

30:16.696 --> 30:18.323
Thank you.

30:24.037 --> 30:26.748
That poor woman had to watch her
dead brother be dug up.

30:28.333 --> 30:30.585
And for what?
I put her through fucking hell.

30:30.793 --> 30:33.379
You couldn't anticipate this.
It's not your fault.

30:33.588 --> 30:35.256
Well, it doesn't make it any better.

30:36.090 --> 30:39.260
Sometimes my job
really fucking sucks.

30:40.011 --> 30:41.429
Actually, it always sucks.

30:41.846 --> 30:42.889
Why do you do it?

30:43.097 --> 30:44.933
I don't know
how to do fuck-all else.

30:45.141 --> 30:46.851
- I'm sure that's not true.
- Oh, God...

30:47.060 --> 30:50.396
...if you are building up to a compliment,
now is not the time.

30:50.605 --> 30:52.190
Look.

30:53.233 --> 30:54.776
I'm gonna interview Hannah later.

30:54.984 --> 30:57.654
- Maybe I can pull something out.
- Gross.

30:59.489 --> 31:01.616
Well, you can tell me
how it went over dinner.

31:02.408 --> 31:05.078
I might even let you pay.

31:10.583 --> 31:12.126
Lemonade?

31:15.672 --> 31:16.714
I'll pass.

31:20.843 --> 31:22.303
Should we get started?

31:22.512 --> 31:25.181
I just wanna make sure
that we're clear.

31:26.391 --> 31:28.893
You're going to forget
about Dexter Morgan.

31:29.102 --> 31:32.146
- He got under your skin, didn't he?
- Tell me that you understand.

31:32.355 --> 31:34.065
Never heard of him.

31:38.903 --> 31:41.489
We'll start with the couple
from the motel.

31:57.630 --> 32:02.010
<i>I just need enough of Price's DNA
to plant at a crime scene.</i>

32:06.764 --> 32:08.016
<i>Traces of blood.</i>

32:08.224 --> 32:11.477
<i>Good for me, bad for his gums.</i>

32:43.092 --> 32:45.845
The more you linger, the greater
the chance of being caught.

32:46.054 --> 32:48.264
Crime scene data, audio interviews.

32:48.473 --> 32:51.309
It's Price's research on Hannah.

32:51.517 --> 32:53.853
If I get rid of it, it'll cripple his book.

32:54.062 --> 32:56.814
- Maybe kill it.
- You didn't come here to protect Hannah.

32:57.023 --> 32:59.901
You need to think
about yourself right now.

33:16.334 --> 33:19.921
Wayne gave me the knife
and told me to guard the woman.

33:22.423 --> 33:26.552
I figured it'd be easy,
seeing as how scared she was.

33:28.763 --> 33:30.515
What was Wayne doing?

33:30.723 --> 33:33.142
He started to stab the husband.

33:33.351 --> 33:35.895
Over and over and over.

33:37.980 --> 33:41.192
The woman
was screaming like crazy.

33:42.402 --> 33:45.113
The man she loved
was getting knifed in front of her eyes.

33:47.573 --> 33:49.409
But he...

33:49.617 --> 33:51.327
He didn't give up.

33:52.203 --> 33:55.289
He grabbed Wayne
and he pulled him toward him.

33:55.498 --> 33:58.418
And then the woman jumped
on Wayne.

33:58.626 --> 34:02.130
- The woman you were guarding.
- Yeah, she was protecting her husband.

34:02.338 --> 34:07.009
I don't blame her,
I would've done the same thing.

34:10.263 --> 34:11.597
Keep going.

34:13.725 --> 34:16.894
Wayne was yelling for me
to get her off him...

34:17.103 --> 34:19.939
...so I grabbed her by the hair
and I pulled her to the bed...

34:20.148 --> 34:25.987
...and she just kept screaming
and screaming.

34:26.821 --> 34:31.367
So I stabbed her.

34:32.577 --> 34:39.041
And she just kept screaming.
And there was so much blood.

34:43.129 --> 34:45.214
What did you do?

34:46.841 --> 34:52.221
I stabbed her
until the screaming stopped.

35:09.155 --> 35:11.073
Take a second.

35:25.087 --> 35:27.006
Looks tasty.

35:29.008 --> 35:32.804
Certainly better
than the swill I've choked on of late.

35:34.639 --> 35:37.517
Don't worry, I haven't come down here
to cause you harm.

35:37.725 --> 35:39.393
Not yet.

35:39.602 --> 35:43.481
Not with Miami Metro's finest
shadowing my every move.

35:44.690 --> 35:46.901
Yes, I certainly hope
they are the finest.

35:47.109 --> 35:49.237
For your sake.

35:51.739 --> 35:53.282
What do you want'?

35:53.491 --> 35:55.493
So long as I'm waiting around
to kill you...

35:55.701 --> 35:57.620
...I thought we might have
a little chat.

36:01.290 --> 36:03.042
Good chips.

36:04.794 --> 36:06.337
While I was incarcerated...

36:07.338 --> 36:12.218
...I found myself plagued
with a nagging question.

36:12.760 --> 36:15.596
I mean, I will move heaven and earth
to snuff out your life...

36:15.805 --> 36:17.139
...because you killed Viktor.

36:17.348 --> 36:21.185
In fact, I was so blinded
by my desire for vengeance...

36:21.394 --> 36:24.063
...that you were able to lead me
into a trap.

36:24.897 --> 36:27.149
A mistake I assure you
won't happen again.

36:29.777 --> 36:32.196
We have a cartoon in America
about a Coyote...

36:32.405 --> 36:34.240
...who chases after a Road Runner.

36:34.448 --> 36:35.533
He keeps thinking that.

36:35.741 --> 36:38.119
He keeps rocket-skating
right off the cliff.

36:40.788 --> 36:42.498
You see, I know what motivates me.

36:43.541 --> 36:46.669
But what I don't know
is what drove you to kill my friend.

36:46.878 --> 36:48.462
He killed Mike Anderson.

36:48.671 --> 36:52.008
A man you barely knew for what,
less than three months?

36:52.216 --> 36:53.384
It's all public record.

36:54.302 --> 36:55.803
No.

36:56.554 --> 36:59.432
You didn't kill Viktor
out of vengeance.

37:00.683 --> 37:05.313
I have a feeling
that you're a different kind of animal.

37:05.521 --> 37:07.773
The question is...

37:07.982 --> 37:10.484
What kind are you, Dexter Morgan?

37:12.945 --> 37:16.032
The kind who hunted your friend down
and strapped him to a board...

37:16.240 --> 37:18.451
...and put a plastic bag on his head...

37:18.659 --> 37:21.454
...and crushed his skull
with a fire extinguisher.

37:24.874 --> 37:28.586
The kind who's gonna do the same to
you, give or take the fire extinguisher.

37:35.384 --> 37:37.219
You're gonna regret
sharing that with me.

37:46.395 --> 37:48.022
For the chip.

37:59.116 --> 38:03.037
- This is the last load.
- Thanks, Jamie.

38:06.248 --> 38:08.584
You know, you're an interesting guy.

38:16.717 --> 38:18.636
Have a seat.

38:19.011 --> 38:21.430
I should do my next book on you.

38:21.639 --> 38:24.976
Believe me, I know a good story
when I hear one.

38:27.061 --> 38:32.149
You know, as a blood spatter analyst,
I'm kind of a storyteller myself.

38:32.358 --> 38:35.277
Only difference is your medium's ink,
and mine's blood.

38:35.486 --> 38:36.904
Interesting observation.

38:37.113 --> 38:41.909
Before we talk about Wayne,
I have a story idea of my own.

38:42.118 --> 38:44.495
Mostly non-fiction.
I wanted to get your take.

38:46.122 --> 38:47.957
I'm all ears.

38:48.499 --> 38:50.626
So new DNA evidence pops up...

38:50.835 --> 38:54.463
...in the unsolved murder
of Christy Lawson.

38:54.672 --> 38:58.509
You know, the jogger
who was killed near Matheson Park.

38:58.718 --> 39:02.888
It turns out that the DNA
belongs to a true crime writer.

39:03.639 --> 39:07.059
You said it was mostly non-fiction.
Sounds like it's all bullshit.

39:07.268 --> 39:09.520
Well, the anonymous tip
is real enough.

39:09.729 --> 39:11.605
The one that mentions Sal Price.

39:12.481 --> 39:16.569
It seems he wrote a very successful
book about the same case.

39:16.777 --> 39:18.612
Now it turns out he was her killer.

39:20.072 --> 39:21.907
You have to appreciate the irony.

39:23.617 --> 39:25.953
How do you plan
to make this happen, exactly?

39:27.830 --> 39:30.541
Let's just say you're gonna need
a new electric toothbrush.

39:32.251 --> 39:35.421
- You broke into my apartment?
- No, I very carefully picked your lock.

39:35.629 --> 39:37.423
It's time to visit the dentist.

39:37.631 --> 39:39.884
- You son of a bitch.
- Hey, it's nothing personal.

39:40.092 --> 39:42.595
- I can't have you messing with my life.
- Fuck you!

39:44.930 --> 39:46.724
You're not gonna get away with this.

39:47.391 --> 39:48.893
I'm gonna ruin your--

39:54.231 --> 39:55.858
Hannah.

39:56.067 --> 39:57.985
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- Call 911.

40:06.285 --> 40:07.453
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

40:07.661 --> 40:09.872
I need an ambulance
at 8240 Palm Terrace.

40:10.081 --> 40:12.333
Apartment 10B. Please hurry.

40:21.926 --> 40:26.305
So I came in to see if Dexter was okay,
and I saw that guy on the floor.

40:27.098 --> 40:30.768
Dexter told me to call 911,
and he started CPR.

40:30.976 --> 40:33.687
- Hear anything before the crash?
- There was some shouting.

40:33.896 --> 40:35.106
Kind of like an argument.

40:35.314 --> 40:38.234
- Dexter's voice?
- I didn't recognise the voice.

40:39.318 --> 40:42.696
I administered CPR
until the paramedics showed up...

40:42.905 --> 40:44.156
...but he was unresponsive.

40:44.365 --> 40:45.908
Okay, Dex. I think it's all here.

40:46.117 --> 40:49.870
Hey, were you and Price
arguing before he collapsed?

40:50.788 --> 40:52.957
The interview
might have gotten a little heated.

40:53.165 --> 40:54.416
How heated?

40:54.625 --> 40:59.004
He accused me of sloppy work
on the Wayne Randall case.

40:59.213 --> 41:02.258
I might have raised my voice a little,
that's all.

41:03.676 --> 41:06.345
A contusion to the head.
The source of all the blood.

41:06.512 --> 41:08.013
That's not enough to kill a man.

41:08.180 --> 41:11.809
Okay, wait for the medical examiner
to get here, okay?

41:29.535 --> 41:32.913
- Why all the blood, Dex?
- His head struck the table as he fell.

41:33.122 --> 41:34.790
Jesus.

41:34.999 --> 41:36.750
You Okay?

41:37.751 --> 41:39.670
No, I'm not okay.

41:40.588 --> 41:42.631
I can't even have a drink
with someone.

41:42.840 --> 41:45.217
- You had a drink with him?
- Yeah.

41:45.426 --> 41:47.219
He was nice, you know? I liked him.

41:47.845 --> 41:50.598
<i>Did Price tell Deb about me
and Hannah?</i>

41:50.806 --> 41:53.142
<i>Doubtful. Deb would
have already brought it up.</i>

41:53.350 --> 41:54.685
- I can't believe--
- I'm sorry.

41:54.894 --> 41:57.938
- I wish I could tell you what happened.
- I know what happened.

41:58.147 --> 41:59.940
Hannah McKay.

42:00.482 --> 42:01.817
She killed Price.

42:02.359 --> 42:03.569
What makes you think that?

42:03.777 --> 42:06.322
He was convinced she stabbed
one of the victims.

42:06.530 --> 42:09.283
And that she kept on killing.
Her husband, other people.

42:09.491 --> 42:12.536
All with poison.
He was gonna put it in his book.

42:12.745 --> 42:16.081
She poisoned Price.
It's not a coincidence.

42:17.875 --> 42:20.628
- How would she pull that off?
- I don't know.

42:21.337 --> 42:25.925
I'm gonna pick her up for questioning.
I'm gonna run a tox screen on his body.

42:27.259 --> 42:29.595
She's not gonna get away with it.
Not this time.

42:43.108 --> 42:47.238
<i>Hannah must know that Price's body
will be tested for poison.</i>

42:47.446 --> 42:49.823
<i>So why isn't she concerned?</i>

42:50.032 --> 42:51.825
<i>Or is she just that good at hiding it?</i>

43:03.420 --> 43:05.673
<i>Mrs. McKay, I'm Lieutenant Morgan.</i>

43:05.881 --> 43:08.634
Do you want anything before
we get started? A water? Coffee?

43:08.842 --> 43:11.303
Just wanna know
what I'm doing here.

43:11.512 --> 43:13.013
Okay.

43:13.681 --> 43:16.976
- Sal Price is dead.
- Oh, my God.

43:17.184 --> 43:18.936
<i>She is that good.</i>

43:19.144 --> 43:20.354
<i>What happened?</i>

43:20.562 --> 43:24.733
- I was hoping you could tell me that.
- How can I do that?

43:24.942 --> 43:27.861
Ms. McKay, I was hoping
that we could cut through the crap.

43:28.070 --> 43:31.657
Sal Price was writing a book on you.
You didn't like it, so you poisoned him.

43:32.741 --> 43:34.118
That's crazy.

43:35.411 --> 43:36.704
You're a killer, Ms. McKay.

43:37.454 --> 43:39.581
You're a fucking good one,
I'll give you that.

43:39.790 --> 43:41.959
You've gotten away with it
for a long time.

43:42.167 --> 43:44.545
But I have a blood report
on Beverly Grey...

43:44.753 --> 43:48.757
...that proves she was killed by a plant
that grows on your property.

43:48.966 --> 43:51.802
And I have a forensics report
on the Wayne Randall bodies...

43:52.011 --> 43:55.931
...that prove that you stabbed
one of their victims to death.

43:56.515 --> 43:58.684
I'm not even sure
why we're talking about that.

43:58.892 --> 44:01.562
I have immunity
for the Wayne Randall killings.

44:01.770 --> 44:05.524
Right, and the Beverly Grey evidence
is circumstantial.

44:05.733 --> 44:09.194
Unless I can tie it to the poisons
that I'm gonna find in the tox screen...

44:09.403 --> 44:11.905
...that I just ordered for Sal Price.

44:12.114 --> 44:14.450
That is gonna nail your fucking ass
to the floor.

44:14.658 --> 44:17.995
- I didn't do anything to Sal.
- No. He just dropped dead.

44:18.162 --> 44:20.539
People die.
It doesn't mean they were poisoned.

44:20.748 --> 44:23.334
Is that what happened to your
husband?

44:23.542 --> 44:25.044
Did he just die?

44:25.252 --> 44:26.920
Along with your unborn baby?

44:27.546 --> 44:29.089
What the fuck happened,
Ms. McKay?

44:29.298 --> 44:31.133
Was he pressuring you
to have a family?

44:31.342 --> 44:33.344
Was it making you feel trapped?

44:35.471 --> 44:37.431
<i>She's not acting.</i>

44:38.140 --> 44:40.684
Charge me with something,
or let me go.

44:40.893 --> 44:45.314
I am trying to give you an opportunity
to come clean about Sal Price.

44:45.481 --> 44:49.109
You'll be doing yourself a big favour
when your case comes to trial.

44:49.318 --> 44:52.404
- Am I done here?
- Yeah. You're done. Trust me.

44:54.740 --> 44:57.117
You know,
my grandma has this saying.

44:57.993 --> 44:59.995
"Trust those who seek the truth...

45:00.204 --> 45:03.374
...but doubt those
who say that they have found it."

45:05.042 --> 45:07.378
My grandma wasn't ever wrong.

45:21.350 --> 45:23.018
<i>Hannah survived Deb's questioning...</i>

45:23.227 --> 45:26.438
<i>...but she might not make it
through mine.</i>

45:34.405 --> 45:37.324
Price was going to destroy my life.
I had to do something.

45:37.533 --> 45:39.326
I told you I would take care of it.

45:39.535 --> 45:41.703
You weren't exactly giving me
progress reports.

45:41.912 --> 45:43.872
I saw a chance and I took it.

45:45.958 --> 45:48.544
- I was doing it for you too.
- For me?

45:48.752 --> 45:50.003
He died in my apartment!

45:51.797 --> 45:54.049
My living room is a crime scene.

45:54.258 --> 45:56.802
You know who I am, what that means
to someone like me.

45:57.010 --> 46:01.598
I figured it would kick in while Price was
on the road, a convenient auto accident.

46:04.476 --> 46:06.395
How'd you do it?

46:06.603 --> 46:07.688
Is it really important?

46:07.896 --> 46:10.858
- Is life in prison important?
- I'm never going to prison.

46:14.945 --> 46:17.156
Price liked to chew on his pens.

46:17.364 --> 46:20.451
The last one had a little something
on it, completely undetectable.

46:20.659 --> 46:22.744
- You better hope so.
- I know so.

46:24.371 --> 46:27.708
Just wish I could've destroyed
Price's book along with him.

46:32.129 --> 46:34.173
Actually, I took care of Price's book.

46:35.299 --> 46:36.508
You what?

46:38.510 --> 46:40.304
How?

46:40.721 --> 46:44.558
I was at his apartment
collecting DNA samples...

46:44.766 --> 46:48.353
...for my now-defunct plan
to get him to shut up...

46:49.229 --> 46:51.523
...and I erased his research on you.

46:55.235 --> 46:56.361
Thanks.

46:56.904 --> 46:58.864
It only took a minute.

47:00.824 --> 47:04.995
I could feel you watching me
while I was being interrogated.

47:06.497 --> 47:10.584
- You saw the whole thing, didn't you?
- Is it true about your husband?

47:10.792 --> 47:13.128
Did you kill him
because he didn't want a family?

47:13.337 --> 47:15.422
It was the opposite.

47:15.964 --> 47:18.634
I wanted a family and he didn't.

47:18.842 --> 47:22.179
He threatened to leave me
unless I got an abortion.

47:25.682 --> 47:29.144
- What happened to the baby?
- It was a miscarriage.

47:32.189 --> 47:33.774
Sometimes life subtracts.

47:37.861 --> 47:39.613
Sometimes it adds.

47:41.698 --> 47:43.450
Do you realise what happened?

47:44.368 --> 47:46.453
We were looking out for each other.

47:48.372 --> 47:53.585
That's big for people like us,
maybe even historic.

48:43.719 --> 48:44.845
What's this?

48:45.053 --> 48:46.847
- For your restaurant.
-It's 10 grand.

48:47.014 --> 48:49.057
You know I got that inheritance
a while back.

48:49.224 --> 48:52.185
- I've been looking to invest.
- I can't take this. Are you crazy?

48:52.394 --> 48:54.062
You too good for my fucking money?

48:54.271 --> 48:57.357
- No, this is way too generous.
- Bullshit. It's family money.

48:57.566 --> 48:59.192
- You're family to me.
- Quinn.

49:00.027 --> 49:04.156
Look, you're stuck with it.
I'm not taking it back.

49:05.365 --> 49:07.242
I do expect a few free meals, though.

49:11.580 --> 49:14.291
This is a loan, you asshole.
I'm gonna pay you back.

49:14.791 --> 49:17.461
Okay, big guy. We're good.

49:31.683 --> 49:35.062
Report's back on the tox screen
on Sal Price.

49:36.897 --> 49:38.732
- This can't be right.
- M.E. ran it twice.

49:38.940 --> 49:40.817
Negative both times.

49:45.155 --> 49:48.116
That fucking bitch
is gonna get away with it again.

50:18.438 --> 50:20.565
<i>Wayne was yelling
for me to get her off him...</i>

50:20.774 --> 50:24.027
<i>...so I grabbed her by the hair
and I pulled her to the bed...</i>

50:24.236 --> 50:29.658
<i>...and she just kept screaming
and screaming.</i>

50:29.866 --> 50:35.205
<i>So I stabbed her,
and she just kept screaming...</i>

50:35.414 --> 50:38.417
<i>...and there was so much blood.</i>

50:38.625 --> 50:40.168
<i>What did you do?</i>

50:40.377 --> 50:45.132
<i>I stabbed her
until the screaming stopped.</i>

50:54.933 --> 50:57.769
<i>Not only can't I kill her,
I can't seem to stay away from her.</i>

50:57.978 --> 51:02.774
<i>Even when I'm not with Hannah,
she's there, in my head.</i>

51:02.983 --> 51:05.694
<i>When some elements come together,
they create a reaction...</i>

51:05.902 --> 51:07.404
<i>...that can't be reversed.</i>

51:07.612 --> 51:10.240
<i>They transcend chemistry.</i>

51:11.616 --> 51:13.910
<i>Is this what love feels like?</i>

51:14.995 --> 51:17.414
<i>Is this how it begins?</i>

51:17.622 --> 51:19.541
<i>Am I even capable of this?</i>

51:28.759 --> 51:29.801
Hello?

51:30.010 --> 51:35.182
Hannah McKay killed Sal Price,
and she's gonna walk.

51:36.308 --> 51:38.518
She's gonna get away with it...

51:38.727 --> 51:41.188
...and we both know
she's gonna kill again.

51:44.316 --> 51:46.693
Deb, can we talk
about this in the morning?

51:46.902 --> 51:49.404
<i>He didn't deserve to die.</i>

51:51.156 --> 51:52.866
<i>I can't let this happen.</i>

51:54.493 --> 51:57.621
There has to be some fucking justice.

52:00.373 --> 52:02.250
It's you, Dex.

52:03.502 --> 52:05.170
Me?

52:06.004 --> 52:07.881
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

52:09.966 --> 52:11.843
She deserves it.

52:13.678 --> 52:15.305
I want you to make it right.

52:17.933 --> 52:20.018
Do what you do.
