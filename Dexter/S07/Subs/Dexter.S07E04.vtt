00:10.308 --> 00:11.810
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

00:12.018 --> 00:13.436
Who is Dexter Morgan?

00:13.645 --> 00:16.231
He's just a jerk who works
for Miami Metro Homicide.

00:18.191 --> 00:20.151
Now can I please go?

00:20.318 --> 00:21.778
Yes.

00:23.530 --> 00:26.366
So you're not interested in alcohol
or looking at naked women.

00:26.533 --> 00:28.243
You may be in the wrong place.

00:28.451 --> 00:32.163
I'm taking out the trash that would
otherwise be left to putrefy.

00:32.372 --> 00:34.290
There is a legal system for that.

00:34.499 --> 00:38.086
If it worked as well as you think
it does, I wouldn't be so busy.

00:38.294 --> 00:40.088
Just gonna get a swab
from your cheek.

00:45.218 --> 00:46.594
You do this for a living?

00:49.639 --> 00:52.809
Well, I hate it, but I get it,
what you do.

00:53.017 --> 00:56.312
But what I don't understand
are the blood slides.

00:57.147 --> 00:59.858
They're trophies.
They're like Speltzer's earrings.

01:00.066 --> 01:01.985
I'm nothing like Speltzer.

01:06.656 --> 01:10.577
My bosses at the club,
they ordered me to get close to you.

01:10.785 --> 01:15.331
These men are dangerous.
I can't go back to them with nothing.

01:15.540 --> 01:18.668
I'm not gonna let anything happen
to you.

01:28.303 --> 01:31.014
- He's gone.
- Motherfucker. He has a girl in here.

01:31.222 --> 01:32.599
We have to find her.

01:34.184 --> 01:35.685
She's dead.

03:32.010 --> 03:34.596
<i>Just when it seems like Deb and I
are making progress...</i>

03:34.762 --> 03:37.056
...we <i>take</i> a <i>left turn.</i>

03:37.265 --> 03:40.059
<i>I showed her a monster,
Ray Speltzer...</i>

03:40.268 --> 03:43.771
<i>...a killer who chased his victim
through</i> a maze.

03:44.147 --> 03:48.151
<i>I could have prevented that murder,
and Deb accepts that.</i>

03:49.777 --> 03:51.946
<i>But she hasn't accepted me...</i>

03:52.488 --> 03:53.865
...what <i>I</i> am.

03:56.534 --> 03:58.745
<i>And I'm not sure she ever will.</i>

04:22.769 --> 04:24.020
I'm getting nothing.

04:24.646 --> 04:26.856
- You?
- No.

04:27.065 --> 04:29.943
That maze man, he's good.

04:30.693 --> 04:32.528
He knows what he's doing.

04:32.695 --> 04:35.615
My hat's off to any killer good enough
not to leave any DNA...

04:35.823 --> 04:36.866
...at a murder scene.

04:37.033 --> 04:38.993
Plenty of his DNA
in this place though.

04:39.202 --> 04:44.248
Well, if this cemetery was his office,
it's like this place was his break room.

04:47.126 --> 04:48.836
Something was here.

04:49.045 --> 04:51.923
Something special.
Like a trophy maybe?

04:52.882 --> 04:54.550
From one of his victims.

04:54.759 --> 04:57.261
Killers hate
to leave their trophies behind.

04:57.470 --> 05:00.473
That means Speltzer stopped
by here after he killed that girl.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.267
But there's none of her DNA here.

05:03.935 --> 05:06.896
No blood, no fibres, no hair.

05:07.105 --> 05:09.148
No reception.

05:17.699 --> 05:20.243
<i>Speltzer is loose in the world...</i>

05:20.451 --> 05:23.413
<i>...and Deb will do everything
in her power to find him.</i>

05:23.621 --> 05:27.625
<i>But will she and I be able
to find our way back to each other?</i>

05:44.892 --> 05:46.310
Deb.

05:47.437 --> 05:48.479
Will you?

05:53.609 --> 05:55.361
Will you be mine?

07:01.177 --> 07:03.763
- Morning.
- Coffee. Now.

07:15.233 --> 07:17.568
<i>- Rita.
- Another left turn.</i>

07:17.777 --> 07:20.947
- Trinity killed her.
- Yes.

07:23.908 --> 07:25.076
- Yes.
- Why?

07:25.284 --> 07:27.912
She didn't fit the pattern at all.

07:28.412 --> 07:30.123
Because I was coming after him.

07:31.916 --> 07:35.044
So while we were hunting Trinity,
you were too.

07:35.253 --> 07:37.797
I figured out who he was
before you did.

07:38.005 --> 07:39.465
And you didn't help us get him?

07:39.674 --> 07:43.094
He knew who I was, where I lived,
that I had a family.

07:44.595 --> 07:48.224
- I was trying to protect them.
- You wanted to fucking kill him.

07:48.558 --> 07:50.184
And I did.

07:51.227 --> 07:52.687
When?

07:54.021 --> 07:56.482
- He's dead. That's what matters.
- When?

07:56.691 --> 07:58.901
I took care of him.

08:00.361 --> 08:02.321
- Did you love her?
- Why would you ask that?

08:02.488 --> 08:05.575
Because I have no idea what's
the truth and what's a lie with you.

08:08.411 --> 08:10.788
- I loved her.
- If you were concerned about family...

08:10.955 --> 08:12.790
...then why were you going
after Trinity?

08:12.957 --> 08:15.042
Is that what a loving husband does?

08:15.209 --> 08:18.337
- Are you even capable of love?
- I love you.

08:21.090 --> 08:22.633
How?

08:23.384 --> 08:25.595
How can you love me
and also love to--?

08:25.803 --> 08:27.555
It's how I've lived my whole life.

08:29.390 --> 08:31.100
Before you walked into that church...

08:31.267 --> 08:34.187
...did you ever question the way
I felt about you?

08:35.521 --> 08:37.523
- Why is it any different now?
- Why?

08:39.525 --> 08:41.110
Jesus, Dexter.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.197
Morgan.

08:46.782 --> 08:48.618
Okay.

08:48.826 --> 08:51.329
That was Batista.
They found Speltzer.

08:54.665 --> 08:56.959
A security guard spotted him
at the scrap yard.

08:57.168 --> 08:59.170
And he had the good sense
not to be a hero.

08:59.337 --> 09:02.423
- It took four officers to take Speltzer.
- He put up a fight.

09:02.590 --> 09:05.551
Came close to shooting. If Speltzer
had a weapon, they would've.

09:05.760 --> 09:08.054
<i>- Speltzer is</i> a <i>weapon.
- He was mine.</i>

09:08.262 --> 09:10.765
He hasn't asked for a lawyer.
This is your one shot.

09:10.973 --> 09:12.516
A confession is our only shot.

09:12.683 --> 09:15.645
He was wearing a mask so I couldn't
make an ID that would stick.

09:15.853 --> 09:17.563
Can't believe DNA
wasn't at the scene.

09:17.730 --> 09:19.273
Masuka and I went over it twice.

09:19.440 --> 09:22.401
Yeah, Dexter and I, we checked
Speltzer's mausoleum man cave...

09:22.610 --> 09:25.279
...for evidence of his victim there,
but no luck.

09:26.197 --> 09:28.199
Dexter and I can't make
the evidence appear.

09:28.407 --> 09:30.910
If you don't get a confession,
you won't get Speltzer.

09:31.118 --> 09:32.662
Are you two ready?

09:32.828 --> 09:33.871
Fuck,yes.

09:38.751 --> 09:42.338
- That's Dexter Morgan.
- His face. It looks familiar.

09:42.546 --> 09:45.216
I put everything Jurg dug up
on Morgan in there.

09:45.424 --> 09:47.885
He's not a cop. He's a lab rat.

09:48.094 --> 09:50.221
- Blood splatter.
-It's spatter.

09:50.846 --> 09:51.973
Blood spatter.

09:52.139 --> 09:54.475
Whatever. He's from Miami.
Normal guy.

09:54.642 --> 09:58.813
Except his wife was murdered
by a serial killer a few years back.

09:58.980 --> 10:00.690
The man we killed on the boat?

10:01.232 --> 10:02.984
Louis Greene.

10:03.776 --> 10:06.946
He was an intern for Miami Metro.

10:07.655 --> 10:10.908
The boat's owner, this Dexter Morgan.

10:13.244 --> 10:15.454
He works for Miami Metro too.

10:18.291 --> 10:19.917
Viktor's death.

10:20.126 --> 10:22.128
Is it payback
for killing that detective?

10:22.336 --> 10:23.838
Viktor fucked us real good here.

10:24.338 --> 10:27.258
Of all the people he could've shot,
it had to be a fucking cop.

10:28.217 --> 10:32.346
- So it's Viktor's fault he's dead?
- Yeah. He was a loose cannon.

10:32.555 --> 10:34.473
Never listened. At least not to me.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.476
Everything was going great
until he showed up in Miami.

10:37.643 --> 10:39.645
Viktor was a good man.

10:40.771 --> 10:44.442
He was loyal. He was committed.

10:44.650 --> 10:47.945
And he was here
to do what you couldn't.

10:48.154 --> 10:51.574
Keep the Colombians
from taking over our traffic!

10:57.330 --> 11:00.458
- Fuck.
- Gentlemen. Let's go. Get up.

11:00.666 --> 11:02.084
And here we go again.

11:05.713 --> 11:07.298
- Why?
- Come over here, please.

11:10.134 --> 11:12.386
Good afternoon, everyone.
I'm Detective Quinn.

11:12.595 --> 11:14.513
I'll be your pain in the ass
for the day.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.390
Can we get that music turned off?

11:16.599 --> 11:19.143
Ladies to the left,
customers to the right.

11:19.352 --> 11:21.395
Keep it behind the bar.

11:21.604 --> 11:24.315
Ma'am, I need you to go ahead
and stand over there.

11:24.523 --> 11:26.609
- Officer.
-It's detective.

11:26.817 --> 11:29.278
Detective Quinn.

11:31.447 --> 11:34.408
Do not tell me you are fucking her.

11:34.575 --> 11:36.535
No. What makes you think that?

11:36.744 --> 11:39.580
You're not the only one
who's a detective.

11:40.414 --> 11:42.375
You really think a stripper's
a good idea?

11:42.583 --> 11:44.877
No, it's a horrible idea.

11:48.047 --> 11:51.175
Seriously,
how long is this gonna go on?

11:51.384 --> 11:56.222
I'm thinking every day until
we lock up Mike Anderson's shooter.

11:57.014 --> 12:00.559
Or you could say a number.
It'll be just like old times.

12:00.768 --> 12:02.561
You leave your car unlocked...

12:02.728 --> 12:05.981
...you'll find some cash,
maybe some blow.

12:06.190 --> 12:08.401
All this goes away.

12:09.610 --> 12:11.654
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:11.862 --> 12:13.989
Get the fuck out of my face.

12:23.332 --> 12:27.336
None of this makes any sense.
Viktor's dead. They got him.

12:27.545 --> 12:30.214
Not everyone at Miami Metro
knows this.

12:30.923 --> 12:32.466
Otherwise, they wouldn't be here.

12:33.926 --> 12:37.138
Maybe this Morgan and Greene
were working alone.

12:38.472 --> 12:41.434
Why the fuck would these two
assholes cover up Viktor's murder?

12:41.642 --> 12:43.394
I believe Dexter Morgan knows why.

12:43.602 --> 12:45.771
Well, say the word. I'll take him out.

12:45.980 --> 12:48.441
- No. I wanna talk to him.
- Talk?

12:48.607 --> 12:50.776
Hey, what are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

12:50.943 --> 12:53.320
We got two boats waiting
to drop off our supply...

12:53.529 --> 12:57.074
...even though we can't move
what we already have.

12:57.283 --> 12:59.285
We are bleeding money.

13:07.793 --> 13:11.172
The bartender, Alex.
One of ours, isn't he?

13:13.716 --> 13:15.176
Yeah.

13:15.676 --> 13:17.595
So let's give them what they want.

13:22.683 --> 13:26.103
For my money, four on one
is not really a fair fight.

13:27.646 --> 13:29.690
I did a little boxing myself
back in the day.

13:29.899 --> 13:34.069
I didn't take on four cops,
but, you know, I held my own.

13:35.154 --> 13:37.907
You don't wanna chitchat. I get that.

13:39.283 --> 13:40.868
Here's the thing though.

13:41.076 --> 13:44.121
My lieutenant is gonna come
in here...

13:44.330 --> 13:47.416
...and say that she saw you
at the maze where that waitress died.

13:49.126 --> 13:53.297
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Right, guy <i>like</i> you was at the gym.

13:53.506 --> 13:55.299
<i>But she's a woman.</i>

13:55.841 --> 13:57.801
They get shit wrong all the time.

13:58.802 --> 14:02.389
And this one, man, she's my boss.

14:02.598 --> 14:04.433
If you can believe that.

14:04.642 --> 14:08.854
I have to fucking answer
to her skinny ass every day.

14:09.563 --> 14:11.815
And she's always squawking at me,
you know?

14:12.024 --> 14:15.110
Her beak is,
"Squawk, squawk, squawk."

14:15.986 --> 14:17.571
To tell you the truth, I envy you.

14:18.948 --> 14:20.783
I've been wanting
to pop my lieutenant...

14:20.991 --> 14:22.618
...in that beak of hers for years.

14:26.163 --> 14:29.083
She's dying to get a shot at you.

14:29.750 --> 14:33.087
Should we let her? Could be fun.

14:33.295 --> 14:35.047
Right?

14:46.392 --> 14:48.769
- Nice job in there.
- He's all ready for you.

14:48.936 --> 14:50.479
Deb.

14:51.063 --> 14:52.273
Good luck.

14:55.192 --> 14:58.070
<i>He was mine,
but Deb needs this more than me.</i>

14:58.279 --> 15:00.155
<i>And she needs to get him her way.</i>

15:01.156 --> 15:04.159
Remember me?
I saw you just the other night.

15:04.368 --> 15:06.203
That is some maze that you built.

15:07.788 --> 15:09.373
What is it for, Ray?

15:11.250 --> 15:13.502
Are you sure
you don't remember me?

15:16.422 --> 15:18.591
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.

15:20.634 --> 15:22.386
Your morn sure was pretty.

15:23.387 --> 15:25.639
She died a few years ago, right?

15:25.848 --> 15:27.308
Cast a long shadow, I bet.

15:29.476 --> 15:31.729
Hard for any girl to measure up
to those looks...

15:31.895 --> 15:34.398
...but you keep trying, don't you?

15:35.107 --> 15:37.693
What do you think about the girls
that go home with you?

15:38.861 --> 15:40.904
That they're stupid? Easy?

15:42.323 --> 15:43.365
That they're whores?

15:45.618 --> 15:47.828
They'd have to be, right?

15:48.037 --> 15:50.414
To go home with you,
take their clothes off for you.

15:52.625 --> 15:54.460
Girls like that are vulgar.

15:55.085 --> 15:58.964
But girls like that
sure do look like your mom.

15:59.965 --> 16:03.177
So I have to wonder.
Your morn was so pretty.

16:03.385 --> 16:05.387
She probably had a lot of admirers,
right?

16:05.596 --> 16:10.768
Men that would go home with her
and watch her take her clothes off?

16:11.518 --> 16:14.396
And then take her
any way that they wanted her?

16:14.605 --> 16:16.357
<i>Shut up.</i>

16:17.316 --> 16:20.653
<i>There are many ways
to break a body down.</i>

16:21.695 --> 16:23.197
You could hear it, couldn't you?

16:24.907 --> 16:27.034
You could hear her
through those thin walls...

16:27.201 --> 16:29.703
...that the two of you shared.

16:30.496 --> 16:34.625
You could hear how much she loved
getting fucked by all those men.

16:34.833 --> 16:36.877
You could hear her kissing them.

16:37.086 --> 16:39.380
All the things that she might do
with her mouth...

16:39.588 --> 16:42.591
...that same mouth
that she would kiss you with.

16:42.758 --> 16:44.677
But be honest, Ray.

16:46.011 --> 16:48.222
You kind of liked it, didn't you?

16:50.599 --> 16:54.019
Weren't you kind of wishing
that it was you inside her?

16:55.187 --> 16:57.690
I should've killed you like
I killed that other bitch!

16:57.856 --> 16:59.483
Go to hell.

16:59.650 --> 17:01.402
We got him.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.621
- Way to go, lieutenant.
- Good job.

17:13.372 --> 17:15.165
Congratulations.

17:15.708 --> 17:17.501
Hey, Deb.

17:17.710 --> 17:20.546
Jamie said she was good to watch
Harrison till late tonight...

17:20.754 --> 17:23.173
...if you wanna grab a drink
or something.

17:25.050 --> 17:27.553
I thought you'd be in the mood
to celebrate.

17:30.305 --> 17:33.892
I'm really glad we got Speltzer,
but celebrate? No.

17:34.101 --> 17:36.353
Melanie Garrett is still dead.

17:37.271 --> 17:40.774
But you got Speltzer.
He'll never hurt anyone again.

17:40.983 --> 17:43.402
- Well, outside of prison.
- Dexter.

17:45.612 --> 17:49.116
I've been thinking a lot about Rita.
About how she died.

17:50.701 --> 17:52.035
She died because of you.

17:53.662 --> 17:55.330
Because you were selfish.

17:56.290 --> 17:59.710
You have a son.
Harrison is three years old.

17:59.918 --> 18:02.463
- Someone needs to protect him.
- I do.

18:02.671 --> 18:04.757
Someone needs to protect him
from you.

18:08.010 --> 18:09.887
He could go live with Astor and Cody.

18:10.053 --> 18:12.681
- With their grandparents in Orlando.
- I am a good father.

18:12.848 --> 18:13.932
I am the right person.

18:14.099 --> 18:17.686
The only person
who can and should raise my son.

18:19.480 --> 18:20.856
Who, like me, lost his mother.

18:21.064 --> 18:25.569
It is not fair of you
to expose a child to your life...

18:26.779 --> 18:28.655
...choices.

18:29.823 --> 18:33.619
- You have to decide. Your desires or--
- No, I don't.

18:33.827 --> 18:38.248
You said it yourself, Dexter, that you
can't stop, that you don't wanna stop.

18:38.832 --> 18:42.795
And if you keep doing this,
you're like a fucking magnet.

18:44.004 --> 18:46.924
Bad shit is gonna find you.

18:47.841 --> 18:49.510
And if that happens, I'll handle it.

18:53.430 --> 18:58.435
What if you had been three minutes
later to Speltzer's fucking maze?

18:58.644 --> 19:01.104
- But I wasn't.
- You were too late for Rita.

19:04.608 --> 19:07.069
I should've killed Trinity
the first time I saw him.

19:07.236 --> 19:09.488
- That's the mistake I made.
- That's the mistake?

19:09.696 --> 19:13.659
Yes! And I will never, from this
moment on-- Do you hear me?

19:13.867 --> 19:15.828
I will never ever make
that mistake again.

19:16.036 --> 19:18.038
It is not in your control.

19:18.580 --> 19:20.374
Everything is in my control.

19:32.302 --> 19:33.971
I am not giving up my son.

19:54.199 --> 19:56.743
Mr. Sirko, George.

19:56.910 --> 19:58.370
I wasn't expecting visitors.

19:58.579 --> 20:00.956
That's all right.
We don't stand on ceremony here.

20:01.164 --> 20:02.374
Have a seat, Alex.

20:02.541 --> 20:04.793
You have a beautiful family.

20:05.586 --> 20:08.297
Thank you.
That is why I came here.

20:08.505 --> 20:09.882
They are still in Kursk.

20:11.717 --> 20:14.177
Your son and daughter,
what are their names?

20:14.386 --> 20:17.973
My son's Zakhary
and my girl, her name's Yulia.

20:19.141 --> 20:22.311
- They're twins, yes? How old?
- Five.

20:22.519 --> 20:25.606
- Their birthday's in April.
- Wow, five.

20:25.814 --> 20:28.233
That's the best age.

20:29.109 --> 20:32.070
Learning to read, walking,
seeing the world...

20:32.279 --> 20:34.740
...and yet, they still want to be held.

20:34.907 --> 20:38.911
You're probably wondering
why I stopped by. Well, you see...

20:39.620 --> 20:43.415
Tell me, how much money do you
send back to Kursk each month?

20:43.624 --> 20:47.836
- From your job at The Fox Hole?
- Seven-hundred-fifty dollar.

20:48.045 --> 20:52.591
I take out only my rent,
my food, some money for my car.

20:52.799 --> 20:58.096
A sacrifice for you, I'm sure.
But still, it's not very much.

20:59.473 --> 21:04.645
What if your family
could have a lot of money?

21:05.103 --> 21:09.274
Security.
College for Zakhary and Yulia?

21:09.858 --> 21:12.945
- You'd want that for them.
- I would give anything for them.

21:14.196 --> 21:15.572
That pleases me.

21:15.781 --> 21:20.327
Because that is why
I came by here today.

21:20.535 --> 21:23.789
- To ask you a favour, Alex.
- Yes, of course. Anything.

21:23.997 --> 21:25.207
I have a problem.

21:27.084 --> 21:29.753
One of my men killed a police officer...

21:29.920 --> 21:33.423
...and I have to give the police
a suspect so they'll stop harassing us.

21:33.632 --> 21:37.844
- And that suspect is you.
- But I didn't kill anyone.

21:40.389 --> 21:43.600
- Sure, you did.
- I want you to write a note.

21:43.809 --> 21:45.894
Pen, paper?

21:48.730 --> 21:50.899
This is what I want you to write.

21:52.150 --> 21:53.735
Kaja...

21:54.945 --> 21:58.323
...I cannot live with what I have done.

21:59.324 --> 22:01.576
I'm very sorry.

22:03.954 --> 22:06.707
I will take care of your family now.

22:07.624 --> 22:11.795
Zakhary and Yulia
will want for nothing.

22:14.631 --> 22:17.884
That's for you. It's the gun
that killed the police officer.

22:18.093 --> 22:19.636
What do I do with it?

22:23.265 --> 22:24.307
Bang.

22:28.687 --> 22:33.233
Look at your children's faces.
They're looking at you.

22:33.400 --> 22:36.945
Wanting you to give them the best life
this world has to offer.

22:38.071 --> 22:42.117
- You will do this for them.
- And if I don't?

22:44.244 --> 22:45.620
We'll kill you anyway.

22:46.621 --> 22:49.374
And throw your wife
and fucking kids in the river.

22:51.001 --> 22:52.044
No need for threats.

22:52.586 --> 22:53.670
We're all friends here.

22:54.796 --> 22:58.258
But I think you understand
the situation.

23:16.777 --> 23:18.612
You won't feel a thing.

23:20.947 --> 23:23.200
It'll be quick.

23:24.326 --> 23:26.286
Like turning off a light.

23:48.350 --> 23:49.851
For my family?

24:05.408 --> 24:06.618
<i>Hannah McKay.</i>

24:06.827 --> 24:08.328
<i>She spent six years in juvie...</i>

24:08.537 --> 24:11.373
<i>...after pleading guilty to being
Wayne Randall's accomplice.</i>

24:11.581 --> 24:15.252
<i>She always claimed she was just
another one of his victims.</i>

24:15.460 --> 24:18.839
<i>Wayne called her the Robin
to his Batman...</i>

24:19.047 --> 24:21.049
<i>...but with better legs.</i>

24:21.216 --> 24:22.884
Dexter Morgan.

24:24.469 --> 24:25.512
You look a little lost.

24:25.679 --> 24:29.975
Well, I haven't been inside a police
station in 15 years.

24:30.183 --> 24:33.395
Still smells the same,
like fast food and sweat.

24:33.603 --> 24:36.356
Hospitality isn't exactly
our main concern.

24:38.024 --> 24:41.903
I heard the sheriff's department found
the body of one of Wayne's victims.

24:42.112 --> 24:46.366
Yeah, they went back one last time
after Wayne died.

24:47.033 --> 24:48.451
And expanded the perimeter.

24:50.453 --> 24:51.913
Is that what you're doing here?

24:52.080 --> 24:54.624
To help us find the other bodies
Wayne buried?

24:54.833 --> 24:56.668
My lawyer said it was for the best.

24:59.963 --> 25:02.799
There's a rumour going around
that you were the last person...

25:03.008 --> 25:06.011
...to talk to Wayne before he...

25:08.388 --> 25:09.556
...died.

25:11.391 --> 25:13.143
His last words were about you.

25:16.646 --> 25:19.858
He said something about every day
being like an unwrapped present.

25:20.650 --> 25:21.860
Yeah.

25:22.027 --> 25:23.904
Yeah.

25:24.070 --> 25:27.449
I remember when he got that fortune
from a cookie.

25:28.617 --> 25:30.660
You two didn't stay in contact?

25:32.537 --> 25:34.456
Too painful.

25:37.626 --> 25:39.628
Where were you
and Wayne going anyway?

25:39.836 --> 25:41.254
Or was there a plan?

25:41.922 --> 25:43.506
Not much of one at first.

25:43.715 --> 25:46.134
We were just trying to get out
of Clopton, Alabama...

25:46.343 --> 25:50.013
...which isn't even a town.
It's an intersection and a cemetery.

25:50.722 --> 25:54.559
But somewhere around Sarasota,
a plan did begin to form.

25:54.768 --> 25:56.561
Argentina.

25:56.770 --> 26:00.941
We were gonna go find a farm
in Argentina and settle down.

26:02.734 --> 26:05.445
- What?
- We were living on farms in Alabama...

26:05.654 --> 26:09.199
...like somehow it would all be
so different in South America.

26:13.787 --> 26:15.038
Do you miss him?

26:16.665 --> 26:20.085
I miss the way I felt with him
on the road.

26:21.253 --> 26:24.673
That life was just beginning,
and that anything...

26:25.590 --> 26:27.801
Anything was possible.

26:30.637 --> 26:32.013
You know the feeling?

26:38.812 --> 26:40.522
No.

26:44.859 --> 26:45.986
It's my lawyer.

26:46.194 --> 26:48.947
I'm sure he's wondering
where I got lost to.

27:05.338 --> 27:06.923
We have a big problem.

27:09.467 --> 27:10.969
<i>Get down.</i>

27:12.846 --> 27:14.973
<i>Stay down there.</i>

27:15.140 --> 27:17.183
- What's the problem?
- Watch the Miranda.

27:17.392 --> 27:19.477
<i>Put him on the fucking car.</i>

27:20.103 --> 27:22.397
<i>You know how this goes.
If you want an attorney...</i>

27:22.605 --> 27:25.525
<i>...we'll get one for you,
even if you can't afford one.</i>

27:25.734 --> 27:28.028
<i>Do you understand your rights?</i>

27:28.403 --> 27:30.071
<i>Do you understand?</i>

27:32.407 --> 27:35.994
<i>Did you guys see that?
Looks like a yes to me.</i>

27:36.202 --> 27:38.455
<i>Fucking cocksucker.</i>

27:39.873 --> 27:42.584
Never got confirmation
that Speltzer understood his rights.

27:42.792 --> 27:44.753
- No.
- But Speltzer fucking nodded.

27:44.961 --> 27:46.629
He didn't say yes.

27:46.838 --> 27:50.592
And at Speltzer's arraignment,
his PD was able to make the case...

27:50.759 --> 27:52.510
- Don't.
-...that because Speltzer...

27:52.677 --> 27:54.888
...was knocked unconscious,
it is possible...

27:55.055 --> 27:57.015
...that he did not understand
his rights.

27:57.182 --> 27:59.934
That it wasn't a nod.
That it was a temporary blackout.

28:00.143 --> 28:01.728
And the judge fucking bought that?

28:01.936 --> 28:05.315
The judge threw his confession
out of court.

28:05.648 --> 28:06.900
- He walked.
- When?

28:07.067 --> 28:09.527
- Two hours ago.
- Motherfucker.

28:09.736 --> 28:13.073
And apparently, Speltzer's planning
to file a lawsuit against us.

28:13.281 --> 28:14.991
Use of excessive force?

28:16.242 --> 28:20.413
- I don't believe this.
- So all that's left to do is...

28:20.622 --> 28:21.748
-ls what?
- Yeah, we--

28:21.915 --> 28:25.460
- We'll wait till he kills someone else?
- There's nothing else we can do.

28:25.668 --> 28:29.589
- But there is something <i>I</i> can do.
-Fuck that. Fuck all of this.

28:40.433 --> 28:44.020
The bartender from The Fox Hole
blew his brains out last night.

28:46.523 --> 28:50.693
Why don't they wear uniforms?
There's no respect.

28:52.737 --> 28:54.864
You would never know
they were police.

29:04.791 --> 29:07.293
Unless you knew
who you were looking for.

29:18.221 --> 29:20.598
We got a single gunshot wound
to the right temple...

29:20.807 --> 29:23.351
...what appears to be GSR
on the right hand.

29:23.560 --> 29:27.063
It was through and through. Based on
the height of the bullet in the wall...

29:27.230 --> 29:30.400
...Alex was sitting at the table.
He put his gun to his head.

29:30.608 --> 29:33.695
- We got a White Russian on ice.
- Very funny.

29:33.903 --> 29:37.031
I'll have you know
I have a major following on Twitter.

29:38.366 --> 29:41.327
This gun is a 9-mil. Same type
of weapon used on Mike Anderson.

29:42.871 --> 29:44.831
I'll go to Ballistics
and run this through.

29:45.039 --> 29:47.292
And confirm this turd is our shooter.

29:49.377 --> 29:51.671
<i>But I know that Viktor
killed Mike Anderson.</i>

29:51.880 --> 29:54.799
<i>Why would Alex take the fall for him?</i>

29:55.008 --> 29:58.344
<i>Unless there's someone at the club
who wants the investigation to end...</i>

29:58.511 --> 30:00.346
<i>...as much as Miami Metro does.</i>

30:00.513 --> 30:02.182
Quinn, read that note again.

30:02.390 --> 30:05.810
"Kaja, I cannot live with
what I have done. I am very sorry."

30:06.019 --> 30:08.688
- Sorry to Kaja?
- Yeah.

30:08.897 --> 30:12.484
It makes sense. It's obvious this
Alex Dubrozny had feelings for her.

30:12.650 --> 30:14.027
And she was in love with Tony.

30:14.235 --> 30:16.279
Which probably
didn't sit very well with him.

30:16.488 --> 30:18.239
So he kills her, kills Tony...

30:18.448 --> 30:21.117
...and Mike was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

30:21.326 --> 30:24.162
I mean, this guy still has pictures
up of his kids, his wife.

30:24.370 --> 30:28.249
Yeah, he probably feels horrible
having to look at her face all day.

30:28.458 --> 30:32.504
That's just it. He doesn't have to. Take
the pictures down. Put them away.

30:32.670 --> 30:35.256
Leaving the pictures up
tells me he cares for them.

30:35.423 --> 30:38.218
He's a guy. Once something's up,
why bother taking it down?

30:38.426 --> 30:40.053
- I don't know.
- What don't you know?

30:40.261 --> 30:43.556
- I don't know if it all adds up.
- Look. We'll talk to the neighbours.

30:43.723 --> 30:46.726
See if they saw anyone coming in
or out of Alex's apartment...

30:46.935 --> 30:49.312
-...if it'll make you happy.
-It's not about happy.

30:49.521 --> 30:53.024
Angel.
Angel, this is our fucking guy.

30:57.445 --> 31:00.823
<i>Everyone yearns for clarity,
for closure.</i>

31:02.116 --> 31:04.953
<i>But is that ever really possible?</i>

31:10.083 --> 31:13.127
- Jamie?
- Harrison's outgrown half these toys.

31:13.336 --> 31:16.381
I know we had to go through them.
Didn't know it was gonna be now.

31:16.548 --> 31:18.967
I'm almost done.
I wanted to do it while he's asleep.

31:19.133 --> 31:23.179
Anything we're unsure about,
we can put in the keep-for-now pile.

31:26.766 --> 31:29.936
- What's the other pile?
- Trash.

31:33.439 --> 31:36.609
- You put Lamby in the trash?
- Lamby smells like pee.

31:37.944 --> 31:43.199
And Harrison hasn't slept
with Lamby in more than a year.

31:43.408 --> 31:45.535
Used to be he couldn't go to sleep
without it.

31:45.743 --> 31:48.162
I remember. Keep?

31:49.330 --> 31:50.915
No.

31:51.082 --> 31:54.711
Yeah, a lot of kids sleep with security
blankets when they're little...

31:54.919 --> 31:56.629
...but once they start socializing...

31:56.796 --> 31:59.424
...you know,
learning how to be part of a group...

31:59.632 --> 32:01.050
...they don't need it.

32:01.259 --> 32:04.971
And Harrison, because he's a genius,
hit this milestone early.

32:07.807 --> 32:09.350
He was so small.

32:11.185 --> 32:13.688
Lamby was a gift from Rita's mother
when he was born.

32:13.896 --> 32:16.816
Maybe we should keep it for Harrison.

32:17.025 --> 32:19.569
For Harrison, of course.

32:29.787 --> 32:34.167
<i>Some toys are more difficult
than others to part with.</i>

32:53.061 --> 32:57.315
<i>Speltzer is already back at work,
digging graves.</i>

32:59.400 --> 33:01.861
<i>He should start by digging his own.</i>

33:06.449 --> 33:09.243
<i>Miami Metro impounded
Speltzer's little pied-é-RV...</i>

33:09.410 --> 33:10.620
<i>...when he was arrested...</i>

33:10.787 --> 33:13.206
<i>...but they had to give it back
once he was set free.</i>

33:16.626 --> 33:19.796
<i>Ray's been juicing.
At least he doesn't mind needles.</i>

33:21.923 --> 33:24.384
<i>I can hide up here,
wait for Speltzer to come home.</i>

33:24.592 --> 33:26.177
<i>I'll use the RV as my kill room...</i>

33:26.344 --> 33:30.056
<i>...and transportation
to get rid of Ray's body.</i>

33:37.188 --> 33:39.399
<i>And his trophies.</i>

34:20.898 --> 34:25.027
<i>I'm still alive, but I don't think
I'm going to like the reason why.</i>

34:30.783 --> 34:33.995
<i>Speltzer couldn't have done
all of this in a day.</i>

34:34.954 --> 34:38.040
<i>Is this place his masterpiece?</i>

34:46.299 --> 34:50.094
<i>I don't run. I make people run.</i>

35:11.532 --> 35:14.786
<i>However, I do run if there's</i> a <i>bull
coming after me with an axe.</i>

36:43.583 --> 36:46.294
You should really try taking
a shower once in a while.

36:56.512 --> 36:57.555
Where are you?

37:04.812 --> 37:07.356
<i>Speltzer keeps forcing me
down to the next floor.</i>

37:08.608 --> 37:13.654
<i>So if he wants me to go down,
what happens if I go up?</i>

37:58.240 --> 37:59.617
<i>He knows my face now.</i>

38:00.868 --> 38:04.246
<i>If I want a rematch,
I'm gonna have to be smarter.</i>

38:06.749 --> 38:10.836
<i>To take Speltzer down, I have
to make sure I have nothing to lose.</i>

38:17.927 --> 38:21.180
Harrison's only going to Orlando
for a few weeks, Dexter.

38:21.389 --> 38:24.600
- Yep, I know.
- He's gonna be fine.

38:24.809 --> 38:26.769
All he'll wanna do is follow
Cody around.

38:26.978 --> 38:28.229
Thanks for driving him up.

38:28.437 --> 38:32.149
I actually might spend a few days
there, see what trouble I can get into.

38:32.358 --> 38:34.402
- Knock yourself out.
- Thanks.

38:34.610 --> 38:36.779
I'll take these down to the car.

38:43.619 --> 38:46.747
Astor and Cody
are excited to see you.

38:46.914 --> 38:49.667
I want you to be good for your
grandma and grandpa, okay?

38:49.875 --> 38:53.838
<i>I'm not sending Harrison to Orlando
because Deb asked me to...</i>

38:54.046 --> 38:56.716
<i>...but because Speltzer
is a problem I need to solve.</i>

38:56.924 --> 39:00.594
<i>Once I do, Harrison will come home
where he belongs.</i>

39:00.761 --> 39:05.016
- You mean more to me than--
- Pizza!

39:06.142 --> 39:09.854
That's right. Pizza. Let's go.

40:42.530 --> 40:44.448
I will avenge your death.

40:48.327 --> 40:50.579
Everything I do...

40:52.081 --> 40:54.250
...is for you.

41:13.185 --> 41:16.730
- Deb, you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

41:18.274 --> 41:19.859
I wanna get back to the station...

41:20.025 --> 41:22.486
...finish up the paperwork
on Mike's shooter.

41:22.653 --> 41:23.696
Be there in a minute.

41:35.541 --> 41:37.751
Motherfucker.

41:45.050 --> 41:46.427
You impotent fuck.

41:47.178 --> 41:49.013
- You got some mouth.
- What are you doing?

41:49.180 --> 41:52.016
- Haven't you done enough?
- Oh, I'm just getting started.

41:52.224 --> 41:54.560
You fucking motherfucking
cocksucker!

41:54.768 --> 41:56.604
- All right--
- You fucking piece of shit!

41:56.812 --> 42:00.941
- Deb, get your shit together.
- You're so easy, just like the others.

42:01.150 --> 42:03.485
Get the fuck out of here.
Come on.

42:03.694 --> 42:05.070
Fuck you up.

42:06.488 --> 42:08.657
I'll you see around.

42:20.211 --> 42:22.338
Batista called.

42:23.672 --> 42:26.800
- I'm sure he did.
- What happened?

42:29.511 --> 42:32.056
I fucking lost my mind.

42:32.973 --> 42:36.602
I saw Speltzer at Melanie's funeral.

42:37.895 --> 42:42.358
- Fucking smiling at the hearse, and--
- What'd you do?

42:42.566 --> 42:46.904
I fucking attacked him!
I wanted to fucking kill him.

42:48.405 --> 42:50.241
Fuck you.

42:50.866 --> 42:52.076
Is that why you came here?

42:52.284 --> 42:55.871
To prove some fucking point
that everybody wants someone dead?

42:56.080 --> 43:00.584
I came here to see how you are.

43:01.293 --> 43:02.378
That's all.

43:05.631 --> 43:07.508
I'm just fucking great.

43:23.190 --> 43:24.984
Is this ever gonna get easier?

43:25.526 --> 43:28.362
Nothing's really all that different, Deb.

43:35.160 --> 43:38.372
The only thing that's changed
is now you know more about me.

43:39.540 --> 43:41.333
What I know about you...

43:46.880 --> 43:49.133
...makes you a completely
different person.

43:49.883 --> 43:53.178
But I'm not.
I'm the same person I've always been.

43:55.514 --> 43:59.685
Your brother, the same person
who will always be there for you.

44:06.900 --> 44:09.611
Maybe the question
is whether you'll be there for me.

44:20.289 --> 44:23.667
I don't know if I can feel
the same way about us.

44:25.544 --> 44:27.129
I do.

44:31.300 --> 44:32.343
I do.

44:35.387 --> 44:36.555
And I don't too.

45:06.335 --> 45:11.006
Are we sure this Alex Dubrozny guy
shot Mike Anderson?

45:11.465 --> 45:14.343
- Why are you trying to rattle this?
- It smells like a set-up.

45:14.510 --> 45:16.095
And what does a set-up smell like?

45:16.261 --> 45:18.806
This bartender had no record
back in Kursk.

45:19.014 --> 45:21.100
Suddenly he decides
to murder three people?

45:21.308 --> 45:25.813
Alex had a short fuse, a broken heart
and a loaded gun.

45:26.021 --> 45:29.233
A gun that Masuka confirmed
was the same one used on Mike.

45:29.400 --> 45:31.527
And we got a sweet little suicide
note...

45:31.735 --> 45:35.030
...that helped us solve not just
Mike's murder, but two others.

45:35.239 --> 45:37.741
That's what a set-up smells like.

45:37.950 --> 45:41.495
It's all too neat, too easy.
Alex wasn't even on our radar.

45:41.662 --> 45:46.083
- Why would he off himself now?
- His conscience got to him.

45:46.750 --> 45:50.546
Let's just swing by the club
one last time, ask around.

45:51.130 --> 45:53.674
This is Mike we're talking about here.

45:54.258 --> 45:56.593
Fine. Not tonight.

45:58.178 --> 45:59.930
- What's her name?
- Nadia.

46:00.139 --> 46:02.808
- The stripper?
- She's a dancer.

46:03.016 --> 46:05.686
- Doesn't keep a lot of clothes on.
- You serious about her?

46:06.353 --> 46:08.689
I don't know what I am about her...

46:08.897 --> 46:13.861
...but she was real close to Kaja and
Tony and all this is real hard on her.

46:14.069 --> 46:16.029
I'm so glad
you're there to comfort her.

46:16.238 --> 46:18.073
- Come on.
- I'm just jealous.

46:18.282 --> 46:19.992
At least you got someone
in your life.

46:20.200 --> 46:21.910
She's got a lot of pretty friends.

46:22.119 --> 46:25.622
I'm a twice-divorced detective staring
down the barrel of retirement.

46:25.831 --> 46:27.166
I'm already a cliché.

46:27.374 --> 46:29.334
Don't need to add a stripper
to that list.

46:29.543 --> 46:33.255
Fine. We'll go by tomorrow. Make sure
Alex isn't some patsy for the mob.

46:33.422 --> 46:35.424
Have a good night.

46:52.357 --> 46:54.401
<i>Fight or flight.</i>

46:57.029 --> 47:00.282
<i>That's a part
of everyone's lizard brain.</i>

47:18.425 --> 47:20.427
<i>Speltzer may have a lizard brain
like me...</i>

47:21.929 --> 47:25.432
<i>...but his shortcoming is he doesn't
have much of a human brain.</i>

47:45.994 --> 47:47.496
What the fuck is this?

47:48.038 --> 47:50.332
The end of your run.

47:52.167 --> 47:54.294
Get me out of here!

47:54.836 --> 47:57.381
Yell all you want.
No one's gonna hear you.

47:57.548 --> 47:59.925
Fuck. Fuck!

48:00.133 --> 48:04.054
Fuck! Fuck!

48:04.263 --> 48:09.184
Feels good. Fuck!

48:11.228 --> 48:13.689
Now is when I'd slice your cheek
with my scalpel...

48:13.897 --> 48:16.692
...and get a drop of blood
to remember you by...

48:16.900 --> 48:19.903
...but I can't risk anyone finding
a blood slide ever again.

48:20.112 --> 48:22.030
You're a fucking freak.

48:22.614 --> 48:25.242
Everything's different now.

48:25.909 --> 48:28.495
The memory of killing you
will have to be enough.

48:28.704 --> 48:30.706
I'm gonna kill you.

48:31.540 --> 48:35.168
That would be a twist.

48:35.794 --> 48:38.797
But not one that's gonna
happen tonight.

48:46.722 --> 48:50.892
You were supposed to be a way out
of the tangle I was in with my sister...

48:51.101 --> 48:54.313
...a thread she could follow
to understand me better...

48:54.521 --> 48:55.897
...to accept me even.

48:57.733 --> 49:01.069
But she and I lost each other.

49:01.278 --> 49:04.531
She almost lost herself
going after you.

49:06.533 --> 49:09.745
She wanted to catch you
just as much as I did.

49:10.912 --> 49:15.334
Who knows, maybe our relationship
can rise from your ashes.

49:17.252 --> 49:20.380
No. No.

49:53.372 --> 49:56.375
It's time for everyone to move on.

50:11.390 --> 50:12.974
Goodbye, friends.

51:00.522 --> 51:02.399
You came.

51:03.442 --> 51:05.026
I wasn't sure you would.

51:05.819 --> 51:07.571
Me neither.

51:11.241 --> 51:12.492
What am I doing here?

51:16.538 --> 51:17.748
That smoke.

51:28.258 --> 51:29.634
It's Speltzer.

51:41.313 --> 51:43.482
Did you do this for me?

51:50.405 --> 51:51.948
No.

52:00.081 --> 52:02.334
How do you feel?

52:09.466 --> 52:11.426
Glad.

52:22.813 --> 52:25.190
What does that make me?

52:32.614 --> 52:34.241
Human.
