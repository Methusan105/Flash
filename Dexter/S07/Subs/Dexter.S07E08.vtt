00:09.933 --> 00:11.017
<i>Previously on Dexter:</i>

00:12.811 --> 00:15.814
<i>She accepts both sides of me.
The whole Dexter.</i>

00:16.022 --> 00:19.234
How in the hell does the most crucial
piece of evidence...

00:19.442 --> 00:21.778
...against Isaak Sirko just disappear?

00:21.945 --> 00:25.615
I did what you wanted. Evidence against
Sirko is gone. I want Nadia's passport.

00:25.782 --> 00:28.993
She's done with you and your whole
shitty fucking organisation.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.537
That's not gonna happen, Joey.

00:30.745 --> 00:32.914
So you think real hard
about your next move.

00:33.373 --> 00:35.208
I'm at a dead end
on Bay Harbour Butcher.

00:35.375 --> 00:37.335
Everything we've done,
all the evidence...

00:37.502 --> 00:41.047
...it still points to Sergeant Doakes.
At some point, we have to face facts.

00:44.008 --> 00:47.053
Harrison is only going to Orlando
for a few weeks, Dexter.

00:47.262 --> 00:48.972
He's gonna be fine.

00:49.180 --> 00:51.433
All he'll want to do
is follow Cody around.

00:51.641 --> 00:54.102
Every time the shit hits the fan,
I go to him.

00:54.310 --> 00:55.520
He's your safe place.

00:55.729 --> 00:59.482
You're making it sound like
I wanna be with him or something.

00:59.691 --> 01:01.025
Well, do you?

01:01.234 --> 01:03.236
You didn't kill Viktor
out of vengeance.

01:03.445 --> 01:07.240
I have a feeling that
you're a different kind of animal.

01:07.407 --> 01:09.868
I can't even drink with someone
without them dying.

01:10.034 --> 01:12.120
Sorry, I wish
I could tell you what happened.

01:12.287 --> 01:14.956
I know what happened.
Hannah McKay.

01:15.915 --> 01:19.711
Sal Price was writing a book on you.
You didn't like it, so you poisoned him.

01:20.420 --> 01:22.130
- That's crazy.
- Report's back...

01:22.297 --> 01:23.923
...on the tox screen on Sal Price.

01:24.132 --> 01:26.926
ME ran it twice.
Negative both times.

01:27.135 --> 01:30.138
That fucking bitch is gonna
get away with it again.

01:30.346 --> 01:34.100
Hannah McKay killed Sal Price
and she's gonna walk.

01:36.394 --> 01:37.979
I want you to make it right.

01:38.521 --> 01:40.648
<i>Do what you do.</i>

03:37.473 --> 03:40.518
<i>Was Deb's call just a bad dream?</i>

03:44.397 --> 03:46.482
<i>Or does she really want me
to kill Hannah?</i>

03:46.691 --> 03:48.568
Morning.

03:48.776 --> 03:51.905
- How did you sleep?
- Okay.

03:53.156 --> 03:56.951
Special herbs from my garden.
It's my secret ingredient.

04:01.873 --> 04:03.750
How can I help?

04:04.375 --> 04:06.628
You can dice.

04:15.303 --> 04:18.514
It's more my style.

04:36.991 --> 04:40.411
I sometimes lose track of time,
but your calendar goes beyond that.

04:40.620 --> 04:45.333
Oh, it's not so much a calendar
but a reminder.

04:45.541 --> 04:48.127
That's the year you took off
with Wayne.

04:48.670 --> 04:49.796
It's not about Wayne.

04:51.172 --> 04:53.216
It's Argentina.

04:53.424 --> 04:55.760
What was so special
about Argentina?

04:55.969 --> 05:00.890
Nothing, really, I just--
I like the picture. It looks like...

05:01.057 --> 05:03.726
Nice, happy-

05:03.935 --> 05:05.353
A home.

05:13.987 --> 05:17.907
My sister,
who's also my lieutenant...

05:18.116 --> 05:20.243
...so I should probably
get to work soon.

05:22.578 --> 05:24.706
Your sister is the lieutenant?

05:24.914 --> 05:27.000
Yeah, I didn't mention that.

05:27.208 --> 05:29.585
No, you didn't.

05:34.799 --> 05:36.759
Is this crazy?

05:37.552 --> 05:38.845
"This"?

05:39.721 --> 05:45.351
You and me, just sitting here,
eating breakfast.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.604
I always eat breakfast.
It's important.

05:53.192 --> 05:57.864
I know that we decided
to never see each other again...

05:58.072 --> 05:59.782
...so I just want you to know that...

05:59.949 --> 06:04.912
...if last night was a one-night thing
for you, then I'm okay with that.

06:05.121 --> 06:06.789
Okay.

06:08.458 --> 06:11.669
But if you want to never see each other
again tomorrow night...

06:11.836 --> 06:13.921
...then I'm okay with that too.

06:14.130 --> 06:15.590
Okay.

06:17.508 --> 06:19.135
You're very agreeable.

06:20.178 --> 06:21.679
Yep.

06:26.392 --> 06:29.020
<i>I need to find some way
to get her out of Debra's head...</i>

06:29.228 --> 06:31.814
<i>...even if I can't get her out of mine.</i>

06:41.741 --> 06:43.201
Hey, come on in.

06:43.409 --> 06:44.660
Do you want coffee?

06:44.869 --> 06:47.246
There's plenty.
I couldn't fucking sleep.

06:47.455 --> 06:48.706
Sure.

06:59.383 --> 07:02.095
- Deb?
- Yeah?

07:03.596 --> 07:06.432
What you said last night,
you didn't mean it.

07:06.641 --> 07:07.725
Did you?

07:09.227 --> 07:11.771
Yeah, Dex, I meant it.

07:14.315 --> 07:16.859
The good news is
I've already vetted her for you.

07:17.026 --> 07:21.155
She killed three people that we know of,
not including what she did with Wayne.

07:21.364 --> 07:25.409
And Price had a tissue sample
and a lab report on Beverly Grey...

07:25.618 --> 07:27.662
...that proved she was poisoned
with aconite.

07:27.870 --> 07:31.457
But go figure, some asshole
broke into his apartment...

07:31.666 --> 07:33.626
...and disappeared
all the files on Hannah.

07:33.835 --> 07:36.671
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

07:37.088 --> 07:38.965
You don't know she killed Price.

07:39.173 --> 07:41.050
You don't even know
Price was murdered.

07:41.259 --> 07:44.011
You want to know
what he was doing the day he died?

07:44.804 --> 07:46.973
He was recording this.

07:47.515 --> 07:53.187
<i>Then she just kept screaming
and there was so much blood.</i>

07:53.396 --> 07:54.689
<i>What did you do?</i>

07:57.525 --> 08:02.613
<i>I stabbed her
until the screaming stopped.</i>

08:04.407 --> 08:07.451
- Deb, she was 15.
- You want more?

08:07.660 --> 08:11.164
Let's talk about how she didn't allow
her husband's body to be embalmed.

08:12.915 --> 08:15.626
She fits your code, Dex.

08:17.211 --> 08:19.547
I'm not killing Hannah McKay.

08:28.764 --> 08:32.310
You know how hard it was for me
to ask you that?

08:34.979 --> 08:37.273
I have been going around
in my head in circles...

08:37.481 --> 08:39.233
...trying to come up
with something...

08:39.442 --> 08:42.987
...with anything that I can fucking use,
but I've got nothing.

08:43.654 --> 08:47.450
Sal and I were so close.
If that body hadn't decomposed...

08:49.035 --> 08:51.287
...we'd fucking have her.
She'd be locked up.

08:51.495 --> 08:53.664
He would be alive.

08:53.998 --> 08:57.168
But he's dead and Hannah McKay
is walking around, free to kill again.

08:57.376 --> 08:59.670
And she will fucking kill again,
Dexter.

08:59.879 --> 09:02.006
That's who she is.

09:02.215 --> 09:04.675
And I can't let that happen.
Not after Speltzer.

09:06.260 --> 09:09.013
I wish there was another way.

09:12.016 --> 09:14.018
You're all I have left.

09:33.371 --> 09:35.081
What's up?

09:35.748 --> 09:36.791
It's Astor.

09:36.999 --> 09:39.043
"Grandpa's kidney stones
are acting up again.

09:39.252 --> 09:43.381
Grandma's taking him to the doctor.
Hopefully it's not too serious."

09:49.637 --> 09:52.556
Deb, you told me you didn't wanna be
a part of what I do.

09:53.516 --> 09:54.558
Before I realised--

09:54.725 --> 09:57.895
You could hardly live with yourself
when you lied to Batista for me.

09:58.062 --> 10:00.982
How will you live with knowing
you're responsible for a murder?

10:01.148 --> 10:04.443
Don't tell me
what I can and can't handle.

10:04.944 --> 10:08.155
Turns out there's a fuck of a lot
that I can live with these days.

10:08.364 --> 10:12.451
No, you can't. Ever since you found out,
you've been teetering on the edge.

10:12.618 --> 10:15.037
- You've covered up evidence, lied--
- For you.

10:15.204 --> 10:17.373
That's why I can't let you
take it any further.

10:17.540 --> 10:19.208
- For your own good.
- For my own--?

10:19.375 --> 10:22.920
Oh, please, do not parent me, Dexter.
You sound like Dad.

10:23.129 --> 10:25.339
Because that's probably
what he'd say.

10:25.548 --> 10:27.925
This isn't who you are.

10:28.843 --> 10:34.098
Deb, I care about you too much to let
you do something you're gonna regret.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.726
I'm sorry, the answer is no.

10:40.396 --> 10:43.607
Well, I guess it's
your fucking decision, isn't it'?

10:45.109 --> 10:47.153
<i>Even though everything
I just said is true...</i>

10:47.361 --> 10:50.239
<i>...it doesn't make me
any less of a liar.</i>

11:20.227 --> 11:21.270
Excellent.

11:21.479 --> 11:24.899
The police will follow Jurg and
your bodyguard around all afternoon.

11:25.107 --> 11:26.317
And then what?

11:26.525 --> 11:28.569
The cops are dicks,
but they're not morons.

11:28.778 --> 11:30.696
They'll figure out
you're not in the car.

11:30.905 --> 11:32.490
Eventually, sure.

11:32.698 --> 11:36.118
But by then, I'll have taken care
of my business.

11:38.496 --> 11:41.665
Business? What business?

11:41.874 --> 11:44.085
This isn't about Dexter Morgan
again, is it?

11:46.045 --> 11:47.630
You're not thinking straight here.

11:47.838 --> 11:49.215
He works for Miami Metro.

11:49.423 --> 11:53.427
We take out one more of theirs,
they shut this place down for good.

11:53.886 --> 11:57.431
We have inventory to move tonight.

11:59.475 --> 12:03.145
Come on, man, just let it go.

12:04.730 --> 12:05.940
Go home.

12:29.422 --> 12:32.383
Deb's got 24-hour
police surveillance on Isaak...

12:32.591 --> 12:35.386
...which means
I know where he is at all times.

12:35.553 --> 12:37.263
He's moved into Viktor's apartment...

12:37.430 --> 12:41.267
...and hardly gone anywhere other than
The Fox Hole and a few restaurants.

12:41.475 --> 12:43.811
Hey, Dexter. The usual?

12:44.019 --> 12:46.021
Yeah, thanks.

12:46.564 --> 12:49.483
Do you have any Boston creams?
It's my sister's favourite.

12:49.692 --> 12:51.652
Got some fresh ones
coming out now.

12:51.861 --> 12:54.530
- Take just a minute.
- Thanks.

12:55.072 --> 12:58.075
Is that your plan to keep Debra
from going over to the dark side?

12:58.284 --> 13:01.996
- Give her a massive sugar rush?
- I don't exactly have a plan yet.

13:02.204 --> 13:04.623
I can think of an obvious one.

13:05.207 --> 13:09.086
I'm not gonna stop seeing Hannah
just because she's a murderer...

13:09.295 --> 13:11.881
...and my sister wants to kill her.

13:12.089 --> 13:14.175
Do you hear how that sounds?

13:31.275 --> 13:34.111
- What the hell?
- I don't know.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.697
Those fucking gang kids
are at it again.

13:36.906 --> 13:39.992
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I'm calling the police.

13:45.873 --> 13:49.460
While you played house with Hannah,
Isaak found a way to shake the police...

13:49.627 --> 13:51.879
...which likely means
he'll come after you again.

13:52.087 --> 13:54.924
Well, if he can get past
Miami Metro Homicide, so can I.

13:55.132 --> 13:56.509
<i>Grandpa's gone to surgery.</i>

13:56.675 --> 13:58.177
<i>- We have to stay with you.
- Shit.</i>

13:58.344 --> 13:59.845
What?

14:00.179 --> 14:03.766
- The kids are coming.
- Kids as in plural?

14:04.308 --> 14:06.018
Grandpa has to have surgery.

14:06.185 --> 14:09.355
I need to send Jamie
to Orlando to pick them up.

14:15.819 --> 14:16.987
It was Isaak, wasn't it?

14:18.697 --> 14:22.493
- How did he get away from the cops?
- Does it matter?

14:22.868 --> 14:24.245
- Did you see him?
- Yeah.

14:24.453 --> 14:26.622
Then you're a fucking witness.
I can arrest him.

14:26.830 --> 14:28.832
You already tried that once.
It didn't work.

14:29.917 --> 14:34.547
You really want an investigation into
why Isaak Sirko is trying to kill me?

14:34.755 --> 14:36.507
So, what the fuck
am I supposed to do?

14:36.715 --> 14:38.300
Just let me handle it.

14:38.509 --> 14:41.262
It's not like I have much of a choice.

14:41.929 --> 14:44.139
Just be careful, okay?

14:44.348 --> 14:47.893
There's one other thing.
I got a call from the kids' grandmother.

14:48.102 --> 14:49.937
- Harrison okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

14:50.145 --> 14:52.773
But Bill has to
have emergency surgery...

14:52.982 --> 14:55.484
...and Maura wants me
to watch Harrison...

14:55.693 --> 14:57.820
...and Astor and Cody for a few days.

14:58.028 --> 15:00.573
- Now is not a good time.
- I know, but what could I say'?

15:00.739 --> 15:03.576
- Jamie's picking them up.
- They can't stay at your apartment.

15:03.742 --> 15:05.703
Isaak probably
has his own key by now.

15:07.621 --> 15:09.331
Any ideas?

15:12.376 --> 15:15.087
Yeah, they can stay at my place.

15:15.713 --> 15:19.133
I'll get patrol cars
to cover my house, just in case.

15:19.341 --> 15:22.011
How are you gonna
explain that to LaGuerta?

15:22.678 --> 15:28.601
I'll tell her that I'm afraid lsaak's
gonna come after me for his arrest.

15:28.809 --> 15:31.353
Your house isn't exactly kid friendly.

15:31.562 --> 15:33.731
- What does that mean?
- Well, you have a gun.

15:33.939 --> 15:35.566
I'll lock it up.

15:35.774 --> 15:39.320
And the pay channels. Cody's 12.

15:40.195 --> 15:42.698
Okay, I'll lock up the remote.
Anything else?

15:42.906 --> 15:45.868
Anything in your kitchen
besides salsa and beer?

15:46.035 --> 15:47.911
There was some cheese
when I moved in.

15:48.078 --> 15:50.706
I'll have Jamie stock the fridge.

15:52.416 --> 15:54.752
This is gonna be great. I love kids.

15:57.379 --> 15:59.840
I don't love kids in general,
but I love your kids.

16:01.550 --> 16:04.762
And Astor and Cody,
it's been a long time.

16:04.928 --> 16:08.098
I'll give you a heads-up when
I know when they're getting in. Thanks.

16:08.265 --> 16:09.350
Yeah.

16:10.768 --> 16:12.311
What's that?

16:12.519 --> 16:14.688
I'm gonna pay
Hannah McKay a visit.

16:14.897 --> 16:16.357
Why?

16:16.982 --> 16:19.151
Just because you're not gonna do
what you do...

16:19.318 --> 16:22.780
...doesn't mean she gets to live
happily fucking ever after.

16:24.198 --> 16:28.118
<i>I guess it was foolish to think Deb
would simply walk away from this.</i>

16:32.539 --> 16:35.417
Hey, I heard about your donut shop.

16:35.626 --> 16:39.463
Oh, yeah. Pretty scary.
Francisco thinks it was gang-related.

16:39.672 --> 16:42.383
Showdown between
the crullers and the fritters?

16:43.676 --> 16:45.928
Deb, if you need me,
I'll be on my cell phone.

16:46.637 --> 16:48.347
Something UP?

16:48.555 --> 16:50.599
Just some business
on the other side of town.

16:50.808 --> 16:52.851
Dexter. Ladies.

16:53.060 --> 16:56.271
If you get a chance,
stop by Papa's after work today.

16:56.438 --> 16:59.441
-It's under new management.
- Shut up. You got the restaurant?

16:59.650 --> 17:02.820
The landlord and I
came to an agreement with the lease.

17:03.028 --> 17:04.822
Call me Papa.

17:05.030 --> 17:07.866
No, I will not do that,
but I will stop by for a drink later.

17:08.075 --> 17:10.911
- Dex, you're in?
- No, I've got the kids coming into town.

17:11.120 --> 17:13.372
It's a family place. Bring them.

17:14.915 --> 17:16.667
Angel.

17:19.002 --> 17:21.380
I'm really happy for you.

17:22.172 --> 17:26.719
One cubic yard of cocoa mulch,
25 pounds of--

17:28.554 --> 17:30.305
Let me get back to you.

17:32.933 --> 17:34.685
Lieutenant.

17:34.893 --> 17:38.230
You in the market for
some orchids?

17:38.439 --> 17:40.691
I'm not buying anything from you.

17:40.899 --> 17:43.944
- Look, I think you have the wrong idea--
- Shut up.

17:44.111 --> 17:48.532
I'm not interested in anything you have
to say, because you're a fucking liar.

17:48.741 --> 17:51.326
I know who you are.
I know what you are.

17:52.244 --> 17:56.331
Well, I think you'd be surprised at the
things that you don't know about me.

17:56.540 --> 17:59.626
Sal Price shared everything with me.

17:59.835 --> 18:03.213
So you may think you're safer because
he's dead, but actually it's worse.

18:03.422 --> 18:07.050
He was just a writer. I'm a cop.
Whatever you're hiding, I'll find out.

18:07.259 --> 18:09.678
Sal Price was a storyteller.
He wanted to sell books.

18:09.887 --> 18:11.722
He didn't care
if they were true or not.

18:11.930 --> 18:16.268
You admitted to him on tape
that you killed with Wayne.

18:16.643 --> 18:20.856
How convenient that he died before
he had a chance to write about it.

18:21.064 --> 18:24.902
Lieutenant, what were you doing
when you were 15 years old?

18:25.444 --> 18:29.072
I'm guessing you were probably on
the soccer team or something, right?

18:29.281 --> 18:32.201
Me, I was just some dumb farm girl...

18:32.367 --> 18:34.578
...who was wakened in the middle
of the night...

18:34.745 --> 18:38.540
...by an older boy that I had a crush on
who said, "Let's go on a trip."

18:40.459 --> 18:42.628
I was in over my head.

18:44.004 --> 18:47.216
You knew exactly
what you were doing then.

18:47.633 --> 18:49.676
You're in over your head now.

18:50.594 --> 18:53.889
Well, I don't know why
I care so much about what you think...

18:54.097 --> 18:56.683
...but somehow I do, so I'm sorry.

18:56.892 --> 18:59.853
You haven't even begun to be sorry.

19:08.779 --> 19:11.448
I'm not suggesting a coup here.

19:11.657 --> 19:14.117
More like a realignment.

19:14.576 --> 19:18.038
I'd never do anything without
the support of the Brotherhood...

19:18.247 --> 19:21.375
...but I feel like something
has to be done...

19:21.583 --> 19:25.003
...or this whole thing's
gonna explode in our faces.

19:27.756 --> 19:29.424
Okay.

19:30.467 --> 19:32.469
Consider it done.

19:50.195 --> 19:52.739
You wanna stick around?
Watch your girl?

19:52.948 --> 19:54.199
Drinks on me.

19:54.408 --> 19:57.536
I've got a better idea.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

19:57.744 --> 20:01.999
- Come on, Joey.
- No, don't "Come on, Joey" me.

20:02.207 --> 20:05.335
We had a deal and you fucked me over,
so we're done.

20:05.502 --> 20:09.006
Look, I'm sorry
I couldn't get you Nadia's passport.

20:09.214 --> 20:13.302
I tried, man, but the guys in Kiev,
they pull the strings.

20:13.510 --> 20:16.013
What I do have is some cash.

20:16.221 --> 20:20.517
If you do one more job for me,
you can buy something for Nadia.

20:20.726 --> 20:23.103
See, I don't want your fucking cash.

20:23.312 --> 20:24.897
And if you take that out on her...

20:25.105 --> 20:27.608
...I'll have ICE down here
faster than you can count...

20:27.816 --> 20:30.569
...checking on the immigration status
of all your employees.

20:30.777 --> 20:33.030
So go fuck yourself. Bye.

20:33.906 --> 20:36.783
<i>Miami Metro believes they know
where Isaak is at all times...</i>

20:36.992 --> 20:39.912
<i>...but obviously I can't count on that.</i>

20:43.206 --> 20:45.208
<i>Hope he enjoys his last meal.</i>

20:45.417 --> 20:48.545
<i>When he gets home
to Viktor's apartment, I'll be waiting.</i>

20:53.175 --> 20:55.052
<i>- Hey, Jamie.
- Hey, Dex.</i>

20:55.260 --> 20:58.305
We just made a quick pit stop.
I warned Cody about the Big Gulp.

20:58.513 --> 21:02.601
But we're about three hours out
depending on traffic.

21:02.809 --> 21:06.063
Great. Why don't we meet
at your brother's new restaurant?

21:06.271 --> 21:08.649
If he's got macaroni and cheese,
we'll be fine.

21:08.815 --> 21:11.318
Apparently that's all
Harrison's willingly consumed...

21:11.485 --> 21:13.862
<i>-...since he got to Orlando.
-It is his favourite.</i>

21:14.071 --> 21:17.157
- God, Cody, we don't want to stop again.
- But I'm thirsty.

21:17.324 --> 21:19.284
Can't we leave him
by the side of the road?

21:19.451 --> 21:22.955
No, Astor, we can't just leave him
by the side of the road.

21:23.163 --> 21:25.040
Sounds like you got your hands full.

21:25.248 --> 21:27.793
<i>We'll see you in Miami, Dexter.</i>

21:28.502 --> 21:30.295
Drive safe.

21:47.354 --> 21:50.399
<i>People always say they'd like
to die at home.</i>

21:50.607 --> 21:55.362
<i>I'll leave his body here and let
the police blame it on the Colombians.</i>

22:07.249 --> 22:08.291
Who the hell are you?

22:08.500 --> 22:11.086
I'm the building super.
I came to fix the faucet.

22:11.294 --> 22:13.296
I didn't know anyone was home.

22:15.257 --> 22:17.009
You're not the super.

22:17.217 --> 22:19.803
Sure I am. Who are you?

22:20.679 --> 22:22.639
I'm the Avon Lady.

22:22.848 --> 22:24.057
Well, that's just silly.

22:24.266 --> 22:26.101
You're here
for the same reason I am.

22:26.309 --> 22:28.228
- Which is?
- To kill Sirko.

22:28.437 --> 22:30.772
Look, I don't know
who sent you here...

22:30.981 --> 22:34.317
...but I'm not going halfsies
with anyone. This is my job.

22:46.329 --> 22:48.957
We could have just gone halfsies.

22:53.837 --> 22:55.881
<i>With all the people who want
to kill</i> Isaak...

22:56.048 --> 22:58.884
<i>...why is it so hard to get him dead?</i>

23:10.437 --> 23:12.564
Not this guy.

23:15.275 --> 23:16.318
This one either.

23:20.864 --> 23:22.074
Dexter Morgan.

23:22.699 --> 23:24.201
This guy had a slip.

23:24.409 --> 23:26.536
Had? Meaning he doesn't
have one anymore?

23:26.745 --> 23:30.123
No, he moved a few years back.
I remember because it was odd.

23:30.332 --> 23:33.376
He had eight months to go
on his lease.

23:33.585 --> 23:35.670
When exactly did he move?

23:35.879 --> 23:38.548
May, 2007.

23:41.176 --> 23:44.971
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

23:52.187 --> 23:54.773
You're getting heavier.
What did they feed you up there?

23:54.981 --> 23:58.068
Mac and cheese.
And more mac and cheese.

23:58.276 --> 24:01.822
- Wanna play on the beach after we eat?
- Oh, I can take him now.

24:02.322 --> 24:04.741
Astor and Cody were fighting
the entire drive down.

24:04.908 --> 24:06.785
I need a break.

24:07.410 --> 24:10.622
- Mojitos on the house.
- All right.

24:10.831 --> 24:11.873
For the grown-ups.

24:13.250 --> 24:17.045
Sodas for the kids.
Sorry, I gotta keep my liquor license.

24:17.254 --> 24:20.674
- Everything good here?
-It's perfect. Thanks, Angel.

24:20.882 --> 24:24.594
<i>Perfect because
it has a built-in security system.</i>

24:24.803 --> 24:28.014
Dexter, check out
my "Angry Birds" score.

24:28.223 --> 24:31.268
Dexter doesn't wanna see your
"Angry Birds" score. Put it away.

24:32.686 --> 24:36.022
- I've missed you guys.
- We missed you too.

24:36.231 --> 24:38.483
So how's school?
ls math still kicking your ass?

24:38.692 --> 24:41.778
Butt. Kicking your butt.

24:41.987 --> 24:44.781
That's what I said.
ls math still kicking your butt?

24:44.990 --> 24:47.909
I'm a year ahead in math now
and I'm taking A.P. Bio.

24:48.118 --> 24:49.494
Impressive.

24:49.703 --> 24:52.414
She passed out
when they dissected the fetal pig.

24:52.622 --> 24:55.625
Can we not talk about fetal pigs
at dinner?

24:57.544 --> 25:01.339
Can we not get through dinner without
you doing something disgusting?

25:01.548 --> 25:03.717
Can you stop acting
like Miss Perfect?

25:03.925 --> 25:06.803
You can't even make it through
a weekend without smoking pot.

25:07.012 --> 25:09.556
Oh, my God.
You know how many cops are here?

25:09.764 --> 25:12.559
- You wanna get arrested?
- God, what is wrong with you?

25:16.521 --> 25:17.939
Guess I should go talk to her.

25:18.815 --> 25:20.775
I'll be your backup.

25:29.701 --> 25:33.079
I don't do it a lot, I swear.
Just when I get really stressed out.

25:33.997 --> 25:35.999
You wanna tell me what's going on?

25:36.208 --> 25:37.250
It's just pot.

25:37.459 --> 25:40.212
In some states,
it's not even against the law.

25:40.587 --> 25:43.340
It's always against the law
for someone your age...

25:43.548 --> 25:45.717
...which is for your own good,
by the way.

25:45.926 --> 25:48.178
Thanks for the
public service announcement.

25:48.386 --> 25:51.890
Dexter's right. Sometimes things that
seem like a good idea in the moment...

25:52.057 --> 25:54.100
...are things you'll end up
regretting later.

25:56.686 --> 25:58.188
Astor...

25:59.898 --> 26:02.359
...I know how...

26:03.068 --> 26:07.113
...certain vices can be used
to relieve stress.

26:10.075 --> 26:15.789
But sometimes those vices can cause
more problems than the original stress.

26:15.997 --> 26:18.375
Okay, I get it, pot is evil.
Are we done?

26:20.418 --> 26:22.545
Sure, we're done.

26:38.270 --> 26:39.854
Kids are all asleep in your room.

26:40.063 --> 26:42.232
I put Harrison on your bed.
I hope that's okay.

26:42.440 --> 26:44.317
Yeah, sure.

26:45.026 --> 26:46.736
He doesn't wet the bed, does he?

26:47.696 --> 26:48.780
Not always.

26:48.989 --> 26:51.074
You owe me.

26:51.283 --> 26:53.410
Jamie will be here first thing
in the morning.

26:53.618 --> 26:55.120
Hey, Dex...

26:58.456 --> 27:00.583
...maybe you were right...

27:01.668 --> 27:02.711
...about Hannah.

27:04.629 --> 27:09.342
I mean, don't get me wrong. If anyone
deserves what you do, she does.

27:10.677 --> 27:13.847
But it must have been hard to resist
and I know you did it for me.

27:14.055 --> 27:18.018
So thanks for caring.

27:19.853 --> 27:22.105
You don't have to thank me.

27:26.568 --> 27:28.194
Thanks for taking everyone in.

27:29.529 --> 27:31.865
My home is their home.

27:33.700 --> 27:34.743
<i>My family-.</i>

27:34.951 --> 27:37.245
<i>All that's left of it is here,
under one roof.</i>

27:37.454 --> 27:39.539
<i>It should feel like home.</i>

27:39.748 --> 27:43.084
<i>So why do I want so badly
to be somewhere else?</i>

27:52.844 --> 27:54.679
Look who's not here again.

27:54.888 --> 27:56.264
Is this a bad time?

27:56.890 --> 28:01.644
Fortunately, you've managed to
catch me in between gentleman callers.

28:02.312 --> 28:04.105
Well, I guess it's my lucky night.

28:04.314 --> 28:05.899
What brings you DY?

28:06.107 --> 28:08.818
Or is this your version
of a booty call?

28:09.694 --> 28:12.322
- What's a booty call?
- Seriously?

28:12.530 --> 28:16.701
Actually, I just stopped by because
I'm gonna be busy for the next few days.

28:16.910 --> 28:20.622
So you came by to see me
because you can't see me?

28:20.830 --> 28:22.832
Something like that.

28:23.041 --> 28:25.627
So, what's got you so busy?

28:25.835 --> 28:29.297
Nothing, I just...

28:31.424 --> 28:34.594
The head of the Koshka Brotherhood
wants to kill me.

28:37.806 --> 28:39.224
You're not kidding.

28:41.184 --> 28:44.979
Well, I don't know what a Koshka
Brotherhood is, but it sounds bad.

28:45.146 --> 28:50.402
It's kind of Ukrainian mafia.

28:51.361 --> 28:53.321
What did you do to piss them off?

28:53.530 --> 28:56.408
Not them. Just Isaak Sirko.

28:56.616 --> 28:59.119
He has this personal vendetta
against me.

28:59.327 --> 29:00.954
Why?

29:02.455 --> 29:04.332
I killed one of his key guys.

29:06.084 --> 29:07.293
Well, it happens.

29:07.961 --> 29:11.923
So, what do you know
about this Isaak Sirko?

29:12.757 --> 29:16.344
I know that he wants to kill me
and that I need to kill him first...

29:16.553 --> 29:20.348
...and that it's harder than
I thought it would be.

29:20.557 --> 29:22.392
Well, you want my advice?

29:24.227 --> 29:25.270
Sure.

29:25.478 --> 29:29.899
You spent a lot of time finding out
all about me before you...

29:31.317 --> 29:34.696
- Before I tried to kill you.
- Right.

29:35.405 --> 29:39.075
This is different.
I had to make sure that you fit my code.

29:39.284 --> 29:41.077
I already know lsaak's a killer.

29:41.244 --> 29:45.039
Still, it seems like you have a system
and it's working for you, right?

29:45.248 --> 29:46.291
Most of the time.

29:46.499 --> 29:49.335
Well, so why don't you
try the same thing on this guy?

29:49.544 --> 29:53.006
Figure out who he is
and why he really wants to kill you.

29:54.591 --> 29:56.134
Here.

29:58.011 --> 30:01.347
Take my van.
He might know your car.

30:01.556 --> 30:07.187
Besides, it'll give you a decent excuse
to come by and not see me again.

30:20.617 --> 30:25.330
I have never been able to talk
to anyone about my kills before.

30:26.831 --> 30:28.875
Not like this.

30:29.167 --> 30:33.004
No judgment, no fear, no panic.

30:34.297 --> 30:37.425
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

30:38.009 --> 30:40.678
I'm kind of tired of talking.

30:41.471 --> 30:44.057
Maybe I can show you
what a booty call is.

30:54.150 --> 30:55.902
Come on, Joey. It's not that bad.

30:57.111 --> 31:01.074
I only have to work for George for two
more years. Then I'll have my freedom.

31:01.241 --> 31:05.453
- You believe that?
- He likes his dancers young.

31:05.662 --> 31:08.665
There are always more girls
who want to come here.

31:10.875 --> 31:13.127
I'm sorry I let you down.

31:13.336 --> 31:17.215
Just promise me you'll never do
anything for them again.

31:17.924 --> 31:19.759
Not even for me.

31:21.970 --> 31:23.721
I promise.

31:24.681 --> 31:28.685
- Okay, I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.

31:51.374 --> 31:54.252
How'd I know
I'd find your horny ass here?

31:56.254 --> 31:57.755
I got something to show you.

32:00.091 --> 32:04.095
- I'm not interested.
- Oh, I think you might be.

32:05.138 --> 32:08.224
<i>But Isaak Sirko, he wants you
to lose the blood evidence...</i>

32:08.391 --> 32:11.227
<i>...linking him
to the Colombian murders.</i>

32:12.228 --> 32:14.731
Let me skip to the good part.

32:14.939 --> 32:19.569
<i>If I do this, Nadia's a free woman.</i>

32:20.069 --> 32:22.905
<i>You give me her fucking passport,
understand?</i>

32:23.114 --> 32:28.077
<i>Deal. And I'll do you one better.
You can even keep the cash.</i>

32:28.870 --> 32:30.663
Now do we understand each other?

32:30.872 --> 32:35.460
If I go down,
you're going down with me.

32:35.877 --> 32:39.172
It won't exactly ruin my reputation.

32:39.631 --> 32:41.424
I got the Koshka Brotherhood
behind me.

32:41.633 --> 32:43.718
You saw how long
Sirko stayed behind bars.

32:43.926 --> 32:47.805
Who's gonna save your ass?
Miami Metro?

32:48.306 --> 32:49.349
What do you want'?

32:49.557 --> 32:51.893
Same kind of shit
you used to do for us.

32:52.101 --> 32:53.936
We have some product
that needs to move.

32:54.145 --> 32:56.773
I need a cop around
to make sure nothing goes wrong.

32:56.981 --> 32:58.608
If you help us,
you make some money.

32:58.816 --> 33:02.737
And if you don't, that recording
goes on the fucking cloud.

33:02.945 --> 33:07.200
I'm sorry to twist your arm, buddy,
but you really left me no choice.

33:08.034 --> 33:09.911
I'll see you tonight.

33:20.046 --> 33:22.215
No one else here.

33:22.423 --> 33:24.592
Not anymore, anyway.

33:25.343 --> 33:26.844
Do you recognise him?

33:27.053 --> 33:30.098
- He's one of George's men.
- Sent here to kill me.

33:30.765 --> 33:35.311
George wouldn't make a move without
getting approval from the boys in Kiev.

33:35.812 --> 33:37.855
- So much for brotherhood.
- This can be fixed.

33:38.064 --> 33:40.483
- We can go home, we can call--
- No.

33:40.692 --> 33:43.111
I'm a dead man there.

33:44.570 --> 33:48.491
You've already gone above
and beyond the call of duty, Jurg.

33:48.700 --> 33:50.993
Your loyalty could get you killed.

33:51.202 --> 33:53.621
Where you go, I go.

33:57.125 --> 33:59.085
My offshore accounts
should last some time.

33:59.293 --> 34:02.255
But I won't have access
to the corporate accounts.

34:02.880 --> 34:04.924
Bloody hell.

34:05.133 --> 34:06.801
Then there's this.

34:07.009 --> 34:08.803
We're gonna need
another place to stay.

34:09.011 --> 34:10.763
Who do you think killed him?

34:12.223 --> 34:15.351
Well, that's a job for the police,
isn't it?

34:15.977 --> 34:18.938
Why don't you go
and give our friends downstairs a call?

34:29.866 --> 34:31.826
Looks like the gang's all here.

34:36.581 --> 34:39.459
So you have no idea
what he was doing in your apartment?

34:39.667 --> 34:41.294
Not a clue.

34:41.502 --> 34:45.214
But I'm sure your trusty blood spatter
analyst could figure it out.

34:45.423 --> 34:47.967
Mr. Sirko, the gun that we found...

34:48.176 --> 34:50.762
...would suggest that
he came here to kill someone.

34:50.970 --> 34:56.017
And since you live here,
that someone may very well be you.

34:56.225 --> 34:58.144
What a frightening thought.

34:58.352 --> 35:00.646
Then perhaps
I need some sort of police escort.

35:00.813 --> 35:05.234
- Oh, I already have that.
- We'll have to confirm with the ME...

35:05.401 --> 35:07.820
...but judging by the lividity
and state of rigour...

35:07.987 --> 35:11.574
...I'd estimate the time of death
as sometime yesterday afternoon.

35:11.783 --> 35:15.578
Let me see.
Now, where was I yesterday afternoon?

35:15.787 --> 35:18.956
Perhaps these kind officers
could refresh my memory.

35:19.165 --> 35:21.083
Unis tailed him all day.

35:21.292 --> 35:22.710
He wasn't here.

35:22.919 --> 35:26.631
Seems I have an alibi.
I hope they're trustworthy.

35:26.839 --> 35:30.843
- Dex, what have you got?
- Yes, please, Dex, tell us your theory.

35:31.052 --> 35:33.054
I'm so curious.

35:33.262 --> 35:37.141
Well, judging by the photo
found in the victim's pocket...

35:37.350 --> 35:39.519
...he was lying in wait for Mr. Sirko.

35:40.019 --> 35:41.687
Here you go.

35:41.896 --> 35:44.857
These scuff marks
indicate a struggle.

35:45.066 --> 35:46.609
They fell to the floor.

35:48.236 --> 35:51.614
And then the killer
cut his carotid artery...

35:51.781 --> 35:55.701
...with one swipe
of a very sharp knife.

35:56.494 --> 35:57.578
My, my-

35:57.787 --> 36:01.249
You couldn't have described that better
if you'd been there yourself.

36:02.625 --> 36:04.001
Thanks.

36:05.044 --> 36:08.130
I have plans with the kids today.
You think you can finish this up?

36:08.297 --> 36:11.467
Fine, but one of these days, I'm gonna
track down some of my kids...

36:11.634 --> 36:14.262
-...so that I can skip out on work.
- Thanks.

36:15.596 --> 36:17.265
Vince is gonna take it from here.

36:17.473 --> 36:19.267
Keep him occupied as long
as you can.

36:19.475 --> 36:21.435
<i>Kill you later, Isaak.</i>

36:21.644 --> 36:24.814
Yeah.
Oh, that's gonna be really good.

36:25.022 --> 36:26.816
See, get it all up in there.

36:27.775 --> 36:31.946
Yeah. That's a strong castle, mister.

36:32.154 --> 36:34.699
You're doing so good.

36:36.576 --> 36:40.037
- Want that?
- He did it all himself.

36:40.288 --> 36:43.249
- That's pretty awesome.
- Yummy.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.837
You know what? I think you need
a little bit more sunscreen, Harrison.

36:48.713 --> 36:50.673
Hey, buddy,
you know what this place needs?

36:50.882 --> 36:54.677
A moat. Keep the bad guys out.

37:03.769 --> 37:05.813
I'll be back in a minute.

37:06.981 --> 37:09.233
Can I have some of that leg?

37:18.868 --> 37:20.494
I miss the beach.

37:21.329 --> 37:22.872
It reminds me of Mom.

37:23.873 --> 37:26.959
Yeah, she used to take you guys
here all the time.

37:27.627 --> 37:30.379
Atlanta doesn't feel like home,
but here doesn't either.

37:30.546 --> 37:34.300
It's like there's no place
I actually belong.

37:34.508 --> 37:36.093
You know what I mean?

37:37.845 --> 37:39.889
Actually, yeah, I do.

37:41.265 --> 37:44.101
If my grandparents find out
about the pot...

37:44.310 --> 37:47.021
...they'll think I'm just turning into
my dad or something.

37:47.229 --> 37:50.775
I feel like they're just waiting
for that to happen anyways.

37:54.111 --> 37:57.657
You know, when I was younger,
someone told me who I was...

37:57.865 --> 38:01.118
...and I pretty much took
his word for it.

38:03.454 --> 38:07.500
If I'd taken the time
to decide for myself...

38:08.960 --> 38:10.878
...I would have turned out different.

38:11.087 --> 38:13.214
Different how?

38:13.673 --> 38:17.551
I don't really know,
but I kind of wish I did.

38:19.428 --> 38:22.890
For the record,
you didn't turn out so bad.

38:29.063 --> 38:34.068
For the record,
the pot will stay off the record.

38:44.078 --> 38:46.455
Just give me a sec.

38:49.458 --> 38:52.294
- Hey, Hannah.
- Hey, I'm sorry to bother you...

38:52.461 --> 38:55.256
...but I accidentally left
my greenhouse keys in the van.

38:55.464 --> 38:59.552
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
I could bring them by in a few hours.

38:59.760 --> 39:01.804
<i>Just tell me where you are
and I'll swing by.</i>

39:04.473 --> 39:06.726
<i>Home Beach. Tower 1.</i>

39:06.934 --> 39:09.311
Okay, great.
I'll call you when I get there.

39:22.283 --> 39:25.369
- Is this the one?
- Yeah, thanks.

39:27.371 --> 39:29.540
So, what are you doing out here?

39:30.207 --> 39:32.793
Hey, Dexter. Look.

39:35.838 --> 39:38.049
Oh, right.

39:38.466 --> 39:40.634
Of course.
I should've seen that one coming.

39:40.843 --> 39:42.845
No, she's not--

39:45.139 --> 39:46.682
She's my nanny.

39:46.891 --> 39:48.726
Your nanny?

39:49.727 --> 39:53.898
Yeah, that little guy is my son.

39:54.106 --> 39:56.984
Harrison. He's 3.

39:57.818 --> 40:01.238
I told you about his mother,
how she passed away.

40:01.447 --> 40:04.825
The other two are Astor and Cody.
They're my step-kids.

40:04.992 --> 40:08.496
They live in Orlando
with their grandparents.

40:08.704 --> 40:11.665
Harrison lives with me...

40:11.874 --> 40:13.834
...most of the time.

40:16.337 --> 40:18.047
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

40:19.965 --> 40:24.303
You didn't trust me or you
were afraid it would push me away?

40:25.012 --> 40:27.306
Maybe a little of both.

40:28.974 --> 40:31.894
Well, I'd love to meet them sometime.

40:34.021 --> 40:37.691
- You're lucky, Dexter.
- Lucky?

40:37.900 --> 40:39.693
No matter where I go...

40:39.860 --> 40:43.531
...I'm Hannah McKay,
the spree killer's girlfriend.

40:43.739 --> 40:45.866
Nobody has a clue who you are.

40:46.075 --> 40:51.914
You get to have this normal life
with kids and...

40:54.375 --> 40:57.211
Is that something you want?

40:57.378 --> 40:59.421
It was, once upon a time.

40:59.630 --> 41:02.049
Wayne and I talked about
having 10 of them.

41:02.258 --> 41:05.010
Could you imagine what a train wreck
that would have been?

41:05.678 --> 41:07.721
Then when I got married to Jake,
I thought:

41:07.888 --> 41:10.808
"This is how it's supposed to be,"
you know?

41:11.475 --> 41:13.519
But when that whole thing
went to shit...

41:13.727 --> 41:17.189
...I just figured it wasn't really
in the cards for me.

41:18.482 --> 41:20.651
That's what I used to think too.

41:20.860 --> 41:23.571
Dex, get over here.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.157
Well, I won't intrude.

41:26.365 --> 41:29.910
- Enjoy your time with them.
- Okay.

41:48.721 --> 41:49.763
Hey.

41:49.972 --> 41:51.932
Everyone asleep?

41:52.141 --> 41:54.268
Yeah, finally.

41:54.476 --> 41:59.023
Dexter, you did not tell me that bedtime
is, like, this two-hour process.

41:59.231 --> 42:02.610
And that reading those Dr. Seuss
books out loud is really fucking hard.

42:02.818 --> 42:05.237
Sorry I missed that.

42:05.404 --> 42:07.531
Teenagers are great.
You tell them what to do.

42:07.698 --> 42:09.783
I mean, my house
has never looked so clean.

42:09.992 --> 42:11.285
I love families.

42:13.954 --> 42:16.582
<i>Does Hannah fit
into my family somewhere?</i>

42:26.550 --> 42:28.177
What's that doing here?

42:31.680 --> 42:35.351
I borrowed a oar from a friend
so Isaak wouldn't recognise me.

42:36.644 --> 42:39.730
Does that friend
happen to be Hannah McKay?

42:45.527 --> 42:48.030
- I was going to--
- Oh, my God.

42:53.619 --> 42:55.287
Are you fucking her?

42:57.998 --> 42:59.833
- I can explain.
- I know what fucking is.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.503
No explanation necessary.

43:03.921 --> 43:05.881
Is that why you wouldn't kill her?

43:07.341 --> 43:09.051
Partially.

43:14.223 --> 43:17.476
I am the biggest asshole
on the planet.

43:18.727 --> 43:21.230
All that bullshit about you caring
about me too much...

43:21.438 --> 43:24.483
...to let me do something
I would regret? I fucking bought it.

43:24.692 --> 43:26.944
Deb, everything I said was true.

43:33.200 --> 43:36.120
Yes, I didn't kill Hannah
because I have feelings for her...

43:36.287 --> 43:38.956
...but that doesn't make
what I said to you any less true.

43:39.123 --> 43:43.127
Feelings? Are you in love with her?

43:44.378 --> 43:46.046
I don't know.

43:47.214 --> 43:50.009
Is it because she's a serial killer?

43:50.467 --> 43:52.469
Does that turn you on or something?

43:54.388 --> 43:58.684
What do you all do, sit around and talk
about who you're gonna take out next?

44:02.354 --> 44:03.772
Oh, my God.

44:04.732 --> 44:06.442
Price?

44:07.526 --> 44:09.361
Did you fucking help her with Price?

44:09.903 --> 44:11.071
No.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.490
I don't even know
why I fucking ask you, Dexter.

44:13.657 --> 44:15.826
Every time I think I know exactly
who you are...

44:15.993 --> 44:17.619
...you tell me something worse.

44:17.828 --> 44:19.163
Being with Hannah is worse...

44:19.330 --> 44:21.623
-...than being a killer?
- Yes.

44:22.333 --> 44:24.543
No. I don't...

44:29.381 --> 44:31.300
I know you're not gonna stop killing.

44:31.508 --> 44:34.470
I mean, you've made that very clear.

44:35.888 --> 44:37.973
But you can stop seeing her.

44:38.849 --> 44:41.226
I don't wanna stop seeing her.

44:41.769 --> 44:44.855
Look what happened
to her husband, Dexter.

44:45.064 --> 44:47.232
She doesn't have
the best track record with men.

44:47.441 --> 44:50.110
I don't even want to talk
about the fucking body trail...

44:50.319 --> 44:52.321
...that you've left in your love life.

44:52.529 --> 44:55.366
I'm not asking your permission, Deb.

44:55.574 --> 44:58.285
So you don't care
what it does to me?

44:58.494 --> 45:02.581
- I don't want to hurt you.
- Well, guess what. You did.

45:03.082 --> 45:05.584
You picked the one way
that you could hurt me...

45:05.793 --> 45:08.796
...worse than you could ever
fucking understand.

45:11.673 --> 45:13.634
You told me you accepted
me being a killer.

45:13.842 --> 45:17.513
- If you love me, you'll accept this.
- If I love you? If I love you.

45:17.721 --> 45:20.808
I went to the church that night
that you killed Travis Marshall...

45:21.016 --> 45:23.769
...to tell you that I'm in love with you.

45:32.569 --> 45:34.029
You're...

45:34.405 --> 45:35.989
...in love with me?

45:36.198 --> 45:39.660
Fuck. Oh, my God.

45:41.620 --> 45:43.497
Was.

45:45.332 --> 45:48.335
I don't even know
if I fucking like you.

45:48.544 --> 45:50.087
Just...

45:51.255 --> 45:53.048
Forget it.

45:58.137 --> 46:00.722
What do you mean,
you're in love with me?

46:06.770 --> 46:10.607
I didn't mean to say that. I don't...

46:13.527 --> 46:17.823
I know it's weird and it's gross
and it's fucked up, but...

46:19.450 --> 46:22.244
And I know you don't feel the same.

46:24.580 --> 46:26.415
I don't even know if I feel the same.

46:26.582 --> 46:28.834
It's one thing to be in love
with your brother...

46:29.001 --> 46:32.087
...but it is a whole other level to be
in love with your brother...

46:32.254 --> 46:35.674
...who's a goddamn fucking
serial killer.

46:39.970 --> 46:44.099
You're a serial killer
and I'm more fucked up than you are.

46:55.819 --> 46:58.614
Well, aren't you gonna
say anything?

47:06.705 --> 47:08.624
I'm sorry.

47:15.547 --> 47:17.508
I don't know what to say.

47:17.674 --> 47:20.344
Oh, God, you never do.

47:25.682 --> 47:28.268
Will you please just go?
I really-- I can't look at you.

47:42.699 --> 47:45.327
Are you gonna just keep following
Isaak around all night?

47:45.536 --> 47:47.037
I can really use a kill tonight.

47:47.246 --> 47:49.164
After what just happened
with your sister?

47:49.373 --> 47:50.874
She's not...

47:51.208 --> 47:53.418
She's not in love with me.
That's insane.

47:53.627 --> 47:55.337
You have to admit, it explains a lot.

47:55.546 --> 47:59.049
Why she didn't arrest you.
Why she keeps believing all your lies.

47:59.258 --> 48:02.302
Why she's willing to give up
everything she believes in for you.

48:02.970 --> 48:06.181
What am I supposed to do?
I can't feel what Deb wants me to feel.

48:06.390 --> 48:09.685
You don't even know how
she wants you to feel. You just left.

48:09.893 --> 48:11.395
She asked me to leave.

48:11.603 --> 48:13.272
Dexter...

48:14.106 --> 48:15.566
...calm down.

48:15.774 --> 48:18.986
Oh, well, you know
what I do to calm myself.

48:25.409 --> 48:26.994
Where is Isaak going?

48:27.578 --> 48:29.705
Looks like a bar.

48:38.005 --> 48:41.341
I'll give him half a dose, walk out
the back so the police don't see me.

48:41.508 --> 48:44.636
I'll look like a friend walking
his drunk buddy to his car.

48:44.845 --> 48:47.014
He could be leading you into a trap.

48:47.222 --> 48:50.517
Not to mention,
the police are only 100 feet away.

49:11.538 --> 49:12.748
What a pleasant surprise.

49:12.956 --> 49:15.584
We both know you can't kill me here.

49:15.792 --> 49:17.461
Oh, I can.

49:18.128 --> 49:19.880
But I won't.

49:20.339 --> 49:24.343
Has to be some vestige of civility left
even in this corner of the world.

49:24.551 --> 49:27.304
You call shooting at me
in a donut shop civil?

49:27.512 --> 49:29.181
I was short on time and opportunity.

49:29.389 --> 49:33.143
Barman, can I have a beer
for my friend, Dexter Morgan?

49:33.352 --> 49:35.896
Now we can both relax.

49:36.396 --> 49:40.942
Unlike most places on the planet,
everyone's welcome here.

49:52.079 --> 49:55.874
You thought your enemies
wouldn't follow you into a gay bar?

49:57.209 --> 49:58.335
No.

49:59.002 --> 50:02.881
I thought I'd feel comfortable
in a gay bar.

50:06.677 --> 50:08.261
Ironic, isn't it?

50:09.179 --> 50:12.766
I always feared the Brotherhood would
learn my secret and turn against me.

50:12.933 --> 50:16.436
Now they've turned against me anyway,
and none the wiser about this.

50:16.603 --> 50:19.439
I will have to thank you
for slitting that assassin's throat.

50:19.606 --> 50:21.191
You might have saved my life.

50:21.358 --> 50:25.946
But you must explain to me
your aversion to guns sometime.

50:27.572 --> 50:31.201
-It's complicated.
- I can imagine it is.

50:35.038 --> 50:37.874
You should cut your losses, Isaak.

50:38.083 --> 50:39.543
Go back to Kiev.

50:42.921 --> 50:45.132
There's nothing waiting for me
back in Kiev...

50:45.340 --> 50:47.718
...except for a large,
well-staffed house...

50:47.884 --> 50:51.555
...and an attractive secretary who
occasionally pretends we're an item...

50:51.722 --> 50:54.057
...to keep the rumours
from circulating.

50:58.562 --> 51:01.064
The one thing that made my life
worth living in Kiev...

51:01.231 --> 51:03.442
...you tossed in the ocean
a few weeks back.

51:05.402 --> 51:08.822
- You and Viktor were--
- Lovers. More than that.

51:12.534 --> 51:18.707
You took from me the one thing
that money and power can't bring back.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.921
And now thanks to you,
also the luxuries are gone too.

51:26.339 --> 51:29.718
Not because of me. Because of this
vendetta you're holding on to.

51:29.926 --> 51:33.054
And what did you do to the man
who murdered your spouse?

51:33.889 --> 51:36.349
Nothing you wouldn't have done.

51:36.558 --> 51:40.270
Nothing I wouldn't do
a thousand times over again.

51:41.897 --> 51:44.733
- Did it help?
- She's still dead.

51:49.529 --> 51:51.823
I can see that Viktor
meant a great deal to you...

51:52.032 --> 51:55.619
...but he was a killer
and he got what he deserved.

51:55.827 --> 51:57.370
My wife was innocent.

51:58.789 --> 52:02.375
And if she weren't,
you'd feel the same.

52:03.585 --> 52:05.712
That's how love is.

52:06.171 --> 52:08.799
It's a powerful weapon.

52:09.591 --> 52:13.261
It can work for us
or against us, can't it?

52:15.847 --> 52:18.099
I don't understand much about love.

52:18.850 --> 52:21.520
Well, that's because
you're a scientist.

52:22.187 --> 52:24.064
Love defies reason.

52:24.606 --> 52:27.108
Nothing defies reason.

52:28.568 --> 52:32.239
Logically, Viktor and I
shouldn't have been together.

52:32.447 --> 52:34.616
I mean, aside from
the obvious social stigma...

52:34.825 --> 52:37.744
...Viktor was impulsive,
foolhardy even.

52:37.953 --> 52:40.163
Always out to prove something.

52:41.915 --> 52:46.670
I suppose the heart knows something
that we just don't know.

52:50.590 --> 52:53.468
Or maybe the heart is just wrong.

52:53.677 --> 52:54.803
Oh, I doubt that.

52:55.011 --> 53:00.392
Love can be inconvenient,
perhaps inappropriate.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.769
It can be dangerous.

53:02.978 --> 53:05.897
Make us do things
we wouldn't dream of doing.

53:07.274 --> 53:09.359
But wrong?

53:12.988 --> 53:15.532
That just depends...

53:16.241 --> 53:19.119
...on where we end up, doesn't it?

53:23.707 --> 53:27.544
- We don't have to do this.
- I do have to do this.

53:27.752 --> 53:29.462
And then what?

53:31.548 --> 53:32.924
Then?

53:33.133 --> 53:35.635
Well, I hadn't really thought about it.

53:36.428 --> 53:40.432
Suppose I'll take my funds, find some
little attractive corner of the world...

53:40.640 --> 53:45.020
...and while away my days in comfort
and anonymity.

53:45.854 --> 53:47.147
Argentina.

53:47.355 --> 53:51.234
Actually, I was thinking more like
Micronesia, but each to their own.

53:52.944 --> 53:55.822
We're outsiders, you and I.

53:56.573 --> 53:58.617
On the periphery.

53:59.159 --> 54:01.328
Watching everybody else.

54:01.536 --> 54:04.581
Pretending we're just like them,
but knowing we're not.

54:07.083 --> 54:11.254
Best we can hope for is to find a place
where we don't have to pretend.

54:15.425 --> 54:17.427
It's a shame, really.

54:18.386 --> 54:22.057
Under different circumstances, I think
we could have been great friends.

54:34.861 --> 54:36.196
Till next time.

54:49.209 --> 54:51.878
<i>Everyone wants an Argentina.</i>

54:53.046 --> 54:56.091
<i>A place where the slate
is wiped clean.</i>

55:00.512 --> 55:05.266
<i>Isaak, I'm at the airport in Miami.
I'll be home soon.</i>

55:08.645 --> 55:13.400
<i>Isaak, I'm at the airport in Miami.
I'll be home soon.</i>

55:16.611 --> 55:21.574
<i>But the truth is Argentina
is just Argentina.</i>

55:35.505 --> 55:40.760
<i>No matter where we go, we take
ourselves and our damage with us.</i>

55:51.563 --> 55:56.192
<i>So is home the place we run to
or is it the place we run from?</i>

56:04.492 --> 56:09.039
<i>Only to hide out in places
where we're accepted unconditionally.</i>

56:09.247 --> 56:12.542
<i>Places that feel more
like home to us...</i>

56:32.395 --> 56:35.398
<i>...because we can finally
be who we are.</i>
