00:09.974 --> 00:11.518
<i>Previously on Dexter:</i>

00:14.020 --> 00:15.772
Dexter, what the fuck?

00:15.980 --> 00:20.360
Maybe we should just get rid of the
body. We make it look like a suicide.

00:20.568 --> 00:21.861
How do we do that?

00:22.070 --> 00:24.072
Gasoline. There's a station nearby.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.408
I'll go get a couple of gallons.

00:31.621 --> 00:34.165
If Doakes really wasn't
the Bay Harbor Butcher...

00:34.374 --> 00:36.543
...best thing
is look into his final days.

00:36.751 --> 00:40.463
We should start with the cabin
in the Everglades where Doakes died.

00:42.507 --> 00:45.260
Maria's convinced
that Doakes was innocent...

00:45.468 --> 00:48.763
-...that the real killer might be you.
- Me?

00:51.975 --> 00:53.643
Do what you gotta do.

00:57.021 --> 01:01.025
That was Department of Corrections.
Hector Estrada is up for parole.

01:01.234 --> 01:03.278
- Estrada?
- I told you about my mother...

01:03.486 --> 01:05.238
...and how she died?

01:06.656 --> 01:08.908
Was he one of the men
that killed her?

01:09.117 --> 01:11.536
He was the leader.
He gave the order.

01:11.745 --> 01:14.330
It's the universe giving you
a Christmas present.

01:14.539 --> 01:17.083
No one but you
would see it that way.

01:17.292 --> 01:18.585
Estrada!

01:18.793 --> 01:20.879
You're working with her, aren't you?

01:21.087 --> 01:24.549
That fucking cop bitch,
the one that got me out.

01:24.758 --> 01:26.760
- LaGuerta.
- She fucking set me up.

01:26.968 --> 01:29.471
You're not the one who was set up.

01:36.186 --> 01:39.105
Debra's at St. Joseph's.
She's been in a car accident.

01:39.314 --> 01:42.442
Well, I sure as shit
didn't swallow a handful of pills.

01:42.650 --> 01:45.820
She poisoned you
while she was at your house last night?

01:46.029 --> 01:47.155
Find the proof.

01:47.363 --> 01:49.741
<i>Hannah dissolved the pills
into Deb's water...</i>

01:49.949 --> 01:52.202
...so <i>that she'd pass out
behind the wheel.</i>

01:52.827 --> 01:54.662
Sal Price's pen.

01:55.038 --> 01:58.458
If you test it,
you'll find traces of aconite on the end.

01:58.666 --> 02:02.921
- Can't believe you're gonna turn her in.
- As long as she's free, you're not safe.

02:03.254 --> 02:05.381
You should have killed me.

04:41.245 --> 04:43.998
You look like you got some sun.

04:45.249 --> 04:46.626
The boat.

04:47.335 --> 04:48.628
They treating you well?

04:48.836 --> 04:50.713
I get 10 minutes outside.

04:52.590 --> 04:54.008
My cellmate seems nice.

04:54.217 --> 04:56.761
She robbed a liquor store
so she could buy meth.

04:56.970 --> 04:59.305
- You have every--
- You said you loved me.

04:59.514 --> 05:00.890
- I do.
- Then why am I here?

05:01.099 --> 05:03.726
You poisoned Debra.

05:10.024 --> 05:13.319
Because she was trying
to keep us apart.

05:16.447 --> 05:18.700
And what was I supposed to do?

05:18.908 --> 05:23.162
I don't know. I don't know,
you could have just broken up with me.

05:23.538 --> 05:27.000
And completely free you up to kill Deb?
No.

05:27.208 --> 05:30.712
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
behind bars.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.506
- You left me no choice.
- You had a choice.

05:33.715 --> 05:35.633
You were supposed to choose me.

05:35.842 --> 05:36.884
She's my sister.

05:37.093 --> 05:38.886
Jesus.

05:41.097 --> 05:43.891
I never stood a chance.

05:49.313 --> 05:50.815
Don't.

05:58.031 --> 05:59.866
Why are you even here?

06:00.074 --> 06:02.243
I had to see you.

06:03.870 --> 06:07.707
If you're worried I'm gonna tell people
what you are, then don't worry.

06:08.374 --> 06:10.960
Your secret is safe with me.

06:12.211 --> 06:13.671
Is it?

06:14.130 --> 06:16.591
I would never do that to you.

06:21.262 --> 06:25.850
I came here because I wanted--
I needed you to know.

06:27.435 --> 06:33.066
If there was another--
Any way to keep Deb safe...

06:33.858 --> 06:35.902
...I would have found it.

06:45.620 --> 06:48.706
I miss you so much.

06:48.915 --> 06:50.541
I miss you too.

06:55.963 --> 07:01.761
You're the only person in the world
I don't have to hide anything from.

07:04.972 --> 07:08.184
I don't know what I'm gonna do
without you.

07:09.727 --> 07:12.647
Dexter, it's not too late.

07:15.108 --> 07:18.319
The only thing they have on me
is that fucking pen.

07:18.528 --> 07:21.405
If the pen disappears, so can we.

07:21.614 --> 07:24.367
We can go some place
that your sister can't find us.

07:24.575 --> 07:27.954
We can go to Argentina
and be together always.

07:28.162 --> 07:30.581
I can never trust you.

07:31.666 --> 07:35.002
- But you just--
- And you know you can never trust me.

07:41.467 --> 07:46.347
We both knew it would come to this,
one of us dead or behind bars.

07:46.556 --> 07:47.849
Yeah.

07:49.100 --> 07:51.727
Except I always thought
it would be you.

07:53.646 --> 07:55.064
Sorry.

07:56.023 --> 07:58.317
Yeah, me too.

08:25.428 --> 08:27.555
Goodbye, Dexter.

08:43.905 --> 08:46.324
<i>I tried to kill Hannah but couldn't.</i>

08:46.741 --> 08:49.452
<i>I wanna hate her
for what she did to Deb...</i>

08:49.660 --> 08:51.495
<i>...but can't.</i>

08:52.580 --> 08:53.706
- Hello.
- An inmate...

08:53.915 --> 08:55.750
<i>...from the Sheriff's Department...</i>

08:55.958 --> 08:58.294
...is <i>trying to contact you
via collect call.</i>

08:58.502 --> 09:00.588
<i>Do you accept the charges?</i>

09:00.838 --> 09:02.006
<i>- Yeah.
- Connecting.</i>

09:02.423 --> 09:03.799
Arlene, thank God.

09:04.008 --> 09:06.052
<i>- Hannah, what's wrong?</i>
- I can't <i>do this.</i>

09:06.260 --> 09:09.096
<i>I can't spend my life in here.
I need you to help me.</i>

09:09.305 --> 09:11.682
I need this to be over.

09:12.350 --> 09:13.935
<i>No, you're stronger than that.</i>

09:14.143 --> 09:16.812
You haven't even had your trial.
I can visit you.

09:17.021 --> 09:20.816
Arlene, you owe me. I took care of
that counsellor for the both of us...

09:21.025 --> 09:25.029
...and now I need your help, okay?
I can't live like this.

09:29.367 --> 09:30.910
Tell me what to do.

09:34.163 --> 09:36.624
I don't know who's worse,
you or him.

09:36.832 --> 09:39.710
It is Toy-mageddon
every time I walk in here.

09:39.919 --> 09:42.880
He can't make up his mind
which one he likes the best.

09:43.089 --> 09:45.925
He's a boy. He wants them all.

09:46.133 --> 09:47.510
I can clean this stuff up.

09:47.718 --> 09:50.471
Go, get ready for work. I got it.

09:51.180 --> 09:52.556
- All right, Harrison.
- Hey.

09:52.765 --> 09:55.851
We're gonna need to let Jamie
pick some things up.

09:56.060 --> 09:58.479
That doesn't mean
you can't play with Thomas.

09:58.854 --> 10:00.314
I want Hannah.

10:01.899 --> 10:06.320
Sweetie, Hannah had to go away,
but that doesn't mean...

10:06.529 --> 10:10.491
...that she doesn't miss you
very, very much. Okay?

10:11.158 --> 10:12.660
Okay.

10:13.244 --> 10:16.872
- Let's see if we can get Thomas to talk.
- One...

10:19.041 --> 10:21.043
- Captain?
- Dexter.

10:21.627 --> 10:23.212
What are you doing here?

10:26.507 --> 10:30.011
It might be best
if you take Harrison to another room.

10:30.219 --> 10:31.887
Because?

10:34.056 --> 10:37.727
Because I'm placing you under arrest
for the murder of Hector Estrada.

10:39.020 --> 10:40.396
Dexter?

10:40.855 --> 10:44.650
- This has to be some sort of mistake.
- I wish it was.

10:44.859 --> 10:47.069
- Who is Hector Estrada?
- Stay back.

10:47.278 --> 10:49.113
- Get your hands off.
- Stay back.

10:49.322 --> 10:52.074
Jamie, just take Harrison to his room.
It's okay.

10:52.491 --> 10:53.534
I'm calling Deb.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.125
Dexter Morgan...

11:04.045 --> 11:06.255
..."you have the right
to remain silent.

11:06.464 --> 11:07.882
Anything you say or do...

11:08.090 --> 11:10.426
...can be used against you
in a court of law.

11:10.634 --> 11:12.470
You have the right to an attorney.

11:12.636 --> 11:16.515
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you."

11:26.067 --> 11:30.363
- What the hell's going on?
- Jesus. LaGuerta arrested Morgan.

11:30.863 --> 11:32.573
I'll call you later.

11:32.782 --> 11:33.824
What are you doing?

11:34.033 --> 11:36.702
- Out of my way, Angel.
- Why is Dexter in handcuffs?

11:36.911 --> 11:39.455
I have proof
he's the Bay Harbor Butcher.

11:39.663 --> 11:42.708
Doakes is the Bay Harbor Butcher.
Have you lost your mind?

11:42.917 --> 11:44.627
- What is this?
- I don't know.

11:44.835 --> 11:46.587
What the fuck?

11:46.796 --> 11:51.092
She thinks your brother's the Bay
Harbor Butcher. How is that possible?

11:51.300 --> 11:53.594
It's not.
Take those things off his wrists.

11:53.803 --> 11:56.514
- Leave those.
- Maria, what are you doing?

11:56.722 --> 12:00.351
Stand down, lieutenant.
Dexter's my prisoner, you're family.

12:00.559 --> 12:02.603
You need to recuse yourself.

12:03.104 --> 12:04.814
Let's go.

12:05.564 --> 12:07.650
- Angel.
- I'm on it.

12:15.241 --> 12:17.827
Just so we're clear then...

12:18.786 --> 12:22.623
...your official statement
is that you went fishing last night...

12:22.832 --> 12:24.875
...then went home
to be with your son.

12:25.084 --> 12:27.128
I didn't kill Hector Estrada.

12:27.670 --> 12:29.255
No?

12:29.839 --> 12:32.049
You didn't cut his body into pieces...

12:32.258 --> 12:34.844
...and put it into bags,
take it on your boat...

12:35.052 --> 12:37.888
-...then throw it into the ocean?
- Why would I do that?

12:38.097 --> 12:41.559
Because Hector Estrada
butchered your mother in front of you.

12:41.767 --> 12:44.603
So how about you start telling me
the truth?

12:45.646 --> 12:47.940
I'm not the Bay Harbor Butcher.

12:48.899 --> 12:51.527
He's answered your questions.
You've got nothing.

12:51.735 --> 12:53.195
Not all my questions.

12:57.658 --> 12:59.994
These are from my phone
last night...

13:00.202 --> 13:03.497
...and that's you carrying
plastic garbage bags onto your boat.

13:03.706 --> 13:06.292
It was ice to keep any fish
I caught cold.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.835
My cooler broke.

13:08.043 --> 13:11.380
But earlier today,
you said you didn't catch anything.

13:12.214 --> 13:13.299
What was in the bag?

13:16.218 --> 13:19.305
It was a shirt
with Hector Estrada's blood on it...

13:19.513 --> 13:21.265
...and his wallet.

13:21.474 --> 13:22.558
You killed him.

13:22.766 --> 13:26.228
You killed him
like you killed all your other victims.

13:26.437 --> 13:27.813
Admit it.

13:28.355 --> 13:30.316
You're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

13:30.524 --> 13:33.527
- Dexter, don't say another word.
- That's enough, sergeant.

13:33.736 --> 13:35.404
I was throwing away my dinner.

13:35.613 --> 13:38.866
It was a bag from Franco's.
You can check.

13:39.074 --> 13:42.453
- Angel, you gotta believe me.
- You framed Doakes.

13:43.078 --> 13:46.332
After I defended you against him.

13:46.540 --> 13:50.753
You betrayed me, this department,
everybody around you.

13:50.961 --> 13:52.588
Is that what this is about?

13:52.796 --> 13:55.966
Your desperate need to believe
the James Doakes you knew...

13:56.175 --> 13:59.178
...or thought you knew,
wasn't a cold-blooded killer?

13:59.386 --> 14:02.223
You don't have the right
to speak his name.

14:03.599 --> 14:05.851
You're so hurt...

14:06.060 --> 14:08.312
...angry, scared.

14:08.771 --> 14:11.232
He's dead because of you.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.235
You were his partner,
his lieutenant...

14:15.486 --> 14:17.321
...his lover.

14:19.114 --> 14:21.534
If you couldn't see
what was in front of your eyes...

14:21.700 --> 14:23.619
...what does that say about you?

14:23.827 --> 14:25.913
I swear to God, Dexter...

14:26.330 --> 14:29.542
...I'm gonna nail you to the wall
for what you've done.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.210
- Maria.
- To the wall!

14:31.418 --> 14:33.254
Maria, that's enough.

14:33.462 --> 14:35.798
Goddamn it, lieutenant.
You can't be in here.

14:36.006 --> 14:39.301
- Tell them what you told me.
- I reran the blood on the shirt...

14:39.510 --> 14:41.887
...Captain LaGuerta discovered
in the trash.

14:42.096 --> 14:45.724
It's definitely Hector Estrada's,
but after going over it...

14:45.933 --> 14:47.518
...I found an evidence number.

14:47.726 --> 14:49.144
What? What evidence number?

14:49.353 --> 14:52.648
Shirt with Estrada's blood on it
is the shirt he was wearing...

14:52.856 --> 14:55.526
...the day he was brought in,
back in '73.

14:55.734 --> 14:59.780
Things got a little rough and the
arresting officers broke his nose.

15:00.781 --> 15:02.032
That's impossible.

15:02.241 --> 15:03.909
I checked inventory.

15:04.118 --> 15:06.036
The shirt's missing.

15:06.245 --> 15:07.413
What about his wallet?

15:07.621 --> 15:10.666
Don't kill the messenger.
There was a partial print...

15:10.874 --> 15:12.710
...and it's yours.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.754
- Were you trying to frame my brother?
- Deb.

15:15.963 --> 15:17.339
You son of a bitch.

15:17.548 --> 15:19.049
- You set me up.
- Maria.

15:19.258 --> 15:20.926
- Can I go now?
- Yes, you can.

15:22.303 --> 15:23.554
He did this.

15:24.597 --> 15:27.182
He's the Bay Harbor Butcher.
He has to be.

15:27.391 --> 15:30.853
This witch hunt of yours is over.
If you have a problem with it...

15:31.061 --> 15:33.397
...we can take it upstairs.

15:44.867 --> 15:46.118
Captain.

15:46.452 --> 15:50.289
Everyone else may have bought
your little victim routine in there...

15:50.497 --> 15:52.625
...but we both know the truth.

15:54.043 --> 15:56.378
And the truth
is it's been a very long day.

15:56.587 --> 15:59.840
You set me up,
just like you did James.

16:00.049 --> 16:03.761
Now, I'm sure you've already managed
to kill Estrada.

16:03.969 --> 16:06.221
Leaves me no chance to prove
any of this.

16:06.680 --> 16:09.224
Congratulations. You've won again.

16:09.433 --> 16:11.518
I just wanna go home
and see my son.

16:13.896 --> 16:16.815
James always knew
there was something wrong with you.

16:19.610 --> 16:21.320
Surprise, motherfucker.

16:22.571 --> 16:23.656
You got my reports?

16:23.864 --> 16:25.074
Hot off the presses.

16:26.241 --> 16:27.368
Headlines.

16:27.534 --> 16:30.037
Twenty-six stab wounds,
the first pierced her heart.

16:30.245 --> 16:32.581
- Whoever did this--
- Was making a point.

16:33.290 --> 16:34.583
This is our third vic.

16:35.042 --> 16:36.794
Any Suspects?

16:37.002 --> 16:38.462
Walter Munro.

16:38.671 --> 16:41.340
Crazy. Thinks he's some philosopher
or some shit.

16:41.548 --> 16:44.134
Scribbling his fucked-up thoughts
in his journals.

16:44.343 --> 16:47.513
Victims are all prostitutes.
Wounds suggest the same weapon.

16:47.721 --> 16:49.390
Consistent with a single killer.

16:49.598 --> 16:51.934
The thing is he's crazy,
but he's smart too.

16:52.434 --> 16:54.728
I can never get anything on him.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.025
Hold up.

17:04.697 --> 17:06.240
What's up?

17:06.990 --> 17:08.575
What we talked about.

17:12.162 --> 17:13.831
Come on, Maria.

17:14.039 --> 17:16.417
Don't you at least
wanna think about it?

17:17.209 --> 17:18.252
I'm sorry, James.

17:23.424 --> 17:26.468
Oh, shit, Morgan.
I didn't even know you were there.

17:27.261 --> 17:29.263
You're, like, invisible.

17:33.100 --> 17:36.270
<i>If only I had stayed invisible.</i>

17:38.272 --> 17:40.691
- Maria, wait up.
- Angel.

17:40.899 --> 17:42.443
- Hey.
- I don't wanna hear it.

17:42.651 --> 17:45.237
I just checked
with Estrada's parole officer.

17:45.446 --> 17:48.282
You were behind his release
from prison?

17:48.490 --> 17:52.035
Somehow Dexter figured out
I was watching him.

17:55.914 --> 17:58.709
Everyone thinks
that you're trying to frame Dexter.

17:58.876 --> 17:59.918
- I am--
- Dexter.

18:00.085 --> 18:02.045
I don't care
what everybody else thinks.

18:02.254 --> 18:05.340
Well, you better start caring.
Do you wanna keep your job?

18:05.924 --> 18:08.635
- I wanna keep my job.
- Then better back off...

18:08.844 --> 18:13.265
-...and drop this whole crazy idea.
- Angel, I need you to be on my side.

18:13.474 --> 18:16.977
I am on your side
and that's why I'm telling you this.

18:17.186 --> 18:19.480
But you have to stop.

18:28.197 --> 18:31.116
- It looks pretty bad, doesn't it?
- More than pretty bad.

18:31.325 --> 18:34.203
And you're gonna have to work
really hard to fix this.

18:34.411 --> 18:36.330
But come on, Maria.

18:36.538 --> 18:40.584
If anyone can work their way
out of a jam like this...

18:40.793 --> 18:41.835
...it's you.

18:44.797 --> 18:46.131
Okay.

18:46.340 --> 18:48.759
Thanks for your advice, Angel.

18:53.889 --> 18:54.973
We need to talk.

18:55.182 --> 18:58.602
Harrison just went to sleep.

18:59.770 --> 19:02.397
I'm glad one of us will sleep tonight.

19:05.943 --> 19:08.654
Heads up next time
you're gonna get arrested...

19:08.862 --> 19:11.156
...or make our captain look
like a lunatic.

19:11.365 --> 19:12.699
It worked, didn't it?

19:12.908 --> 19:14.785
Everyone thinks
LaGuerta framed me.

19:14.993 --> 19:17.246
She won't be able to come after me
anymore.

19:17.454 --> 19:19.498
All it cost her was her career.

19:19.706 --> 19:22.292
How many careers
has LaGuerta destroyed?

19:22.501 --> 19:24.795
That still doesn't make it right.

19:25.754 --> 19:28.715
Not that I even know
what that is anymore.

19:32.970 --> 19:37.057
I wish it hadn't come to this,
but it was either her or me.

19:37.724 --> 19:41.270
She almost caught me
trying to kill Estrada on the docks.

19:41.770 --> 19:43.272
Whose fault was that?

19:43.480 --> 19:45.232
LaGuerta's the one who set me up.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.984
So you repay the favour?

19:47.401 --> 19:50.737
Would you prefer my normal method
of conflict resolution?

19:50.946 --> 19:52.114
Not fucking funny.

19:52.322 --> 19:55.492
There was a problem, and I solved it
the best way I knew how.

19:55.701 --> 19:57.077
And it's over.

19:57.286 --> 19:58.871
That's what you keep saying.

19:59.079 --> 20:00.831
What about Hannah?

20:01.623 --> 20:03.083
What about her?

20:03.292 --> 20:06.169
Well, I assume she knows
what you are.

20:06.378 --> 20:08.672
- Yeah, but--
- Her arraignment's tomorrow.

20:08.881 --> 20:11.925
How do you know she won't use that
to get a better deal?

20:12.134 --> 20:14.595
- She won't.
- How do you know that?

20:15.721 --> 20:18.056
Because she's in love with me.

20:20.976 --> 20:23.228
I pray to fuck you're right.

20:26.607 --> 20:28.942
Take tomorrow off, all right?

20:29.776 --> 20:32.905
At least until the dust settles
with this LaGuerta thing.

20:41.079 --> 20:43.165
You know this isn't over.

20:43.373 --> 20:46.293
Despite what LaGuerta thinks,
Estrada's still out there.

20:46.501 --> 20:50.380
I know. It's been six days since
I let him go and I haven't found him yet.

20:50.589 --> 20:52.883
If he resurfaces,
LaGuerta gets wind of it--

20:53.091 --> 20:55.928
She'll offer him a deal.
Put him up in some safe house.

20:56.136 --> 20:59.932
You're left to explain to the DA why
you came after him with a chainsaw.

21:00.140 --> 21:01.934
I'll find him.

21:03.143 --> 21:05.562
I'll do What I have to do.

21:06.939 --> 21:09.232
You sound like Hannah.

21:19.868 --> 21:21.912
<i>According to Estrada's
parole officer...</i>

21:22.120 --> 21:24.498
<i>...this is the last known address
of his wife.</i>

21:24.706 --> 21:26.500
<i>Hector has nowhere else to turn.</i>

21:26.708 --> 21:30.128
<i>He's wanted by the police, me.</i>

21:36.385 --> 21:37.970
Mrs. Estrada?

21:38.178 --> 21:40.806
I'm Arthur Curry,
Hector's parole officer.

21:41.014 --> 21:43.809
Why are you here?
I haven't seen Hector in years.

21:44.017 --> 21:45.227
Hey, honey, who's that?

21:45.435 --> 21:46.853
The neighbour.

21:47.062 --> 21:48.105
Please.

21:48.563 --> 21:50.190
Don't come here again.

21:50.399 --> 21:51.650
My Tony doesn't like it.

21:52.442 --> 21:55.946
Well, if you haven't seen Hector,
why are you still married to him?

21:57.823 --> 21:59.116
I'm Catholic.

21:59.324 --> 22:00.450
Is it that guy again?

22:01.868 --> 22:04.705
- You sure he hasn't been around?
- You should go.

22:14.548 --> 22:18.260
<i>It's been 40 years,
but Florencia hasn't let go of Hector.</i>

22:18.468 --> 22:22.347
<i>Sometimes it only takes a moment
to reveal who we really are.</i>

22:22.556 --> 22:24.975
Looks like you spun a goddamn web.

22:25.183 --> 22:27.102
Yeah, it's more like a puzzle.

22:27.310 --> 22:30.105
Connect the dots.
Can you pin this on Munro or not?

22:30.313 --> 22:32.607
Entry wounds on the victim
are consistent...

22:32.816 --> 22:34.651
...with wounds on previous victims.

22:34.860 --> 22:36.528
She was standing when attacked.

22:36.737 --> 22:40.449
- Get another one.
- She stumbled, her body turning.

22:40.657 --> 22:45.746
The killer's behind her now,
stabbing her in the back repeatedly.

22:45.954 --> 22:49.291
Then she's down on all fours,
crawling away...

22:49.499 --> 22:52.044
...until the killer grabs her
and flips her over.

22:52.252 --> 22:53.837
He's on top of her now.

22:54.046 --> 22:57.466
He slices her carotid artery.

22:57.674 --> 23:00.218
She's terrified, heart's racing.

23:00.594 --> 23:03.764
It's releasing more blood
in thick arterial spurts...

23:03.972 --> 23:06.141
...here and here and...

23:06.558 --> 23:08.101
Here.

23:08.894 --> 23:12.314
I've never seen someone so excited
about a crime scene before.

23:12.522 --> 23:14.357
You like this blood shit too much.

23:14.566 --> 23:15.859
I'm just doing my job.

23:16.568 --> 23:18.236
Wipe that smile off your face...

23:18.445 --> 23:21.156
...and help me find the creep
who did this.

23:23.033 --> 23:24.493
<i>I let my guard down.</i>

23:24.701 --> 23:27.662
<i>For an instant,
my real life bled into my fake life...</i>

23:27.871 --> 23:31.500
...and <i>Doakes caught his first glimpse
of the real me.</i>

24:01.363 --> 24:02.948
Thanks for coming, Tom.

24:03.156 --> 24:06.952
Chrissakes, it's all over the station
you tried to frame Dexter.

24:07.536 --> 24:10.413
- You know that's not true.
- Do I?

24:12.624 --> 24:16.461
Commissioner's going to open an
investigation into your recent conduct.

24:16.670 --> 24:19.256
If called to testify,
I'll be dragged into this...

24:19.464 --> 24:21.591
...and have no choice
but tell the truth.

24:21.800 --> 24:25.637
That we found definitive proof that
Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher.

24:25.846 --> 24:28.723
And that despite me advising you
to cease and desist...

24:29.182 --> 24:31.560
...you continued
on this reckless course.

24:31.768 --> 24:34.980
- So, what's your advice?
- Start kissing anything...

24:35.188 --> 24:37.190
...that even remotely resembles
an ass.

24:37.399 --> 24:39.693
I'm serious, Tom.

24:40.152 --> 24:42.237
I was hoping for your support.

24:42.696 --> 24:44.823
And make myself look
as crazy as you?

24:45.031 --> 24:48.493
People still respect you here.

24:51.163 --> 24:53.582
I need someone to have my back,
Tom...

24:53.790 --> 24:56.376
...and you could say
I had reasonable suspicion.

24:56.585 --> 24:58.628
- You carried it too far.
- Then say that.

24:58.837 --> 25:02.090
Say that due to my overzealous nature
as a police officer...

25:02.299 --> 25:04.259
...I got too caught up in the case.

25:04.467 --> 25:08.722
- You got too caught up being an idiot.
- I'm already down, Tom.

25:09.514 --> 25:11.516
Stop kicking.

25:16.229 --> 25:19.149
My job is at stake.

25:20.859 --> 25:21.902
Tom?

25:25.947 --> 25:27.490
All right.

25:28.074 --> 25:29.367
I'll see what I can do.

25:29.784 --> 25:31.578
Thank you.

25:32.245 --> 25:34.539
You just keep your head low.

25:36.875 --> 25:40.879
And for God's sake, start doing your
job if you have any hope of keeping it.

25:54.142 --> 25:55.602
Lieutenant.

25:55.810 --> 25:57.062
What brings you here?

25:57.270 --> 25:59.147
I'm the arresting officer.

26:00.607 --> 26:02.234
How's the wrist?

26:02.442 --> 26:04.110
Stronger every day.

26:04.319 --> 26:07.030
How's facing life
without the possibility of parole?

26:07.239 --> 26:11.034
Last time I checked
it's innocent until proven guilty.

26:11.243 --> 26:12.577
This is your last chance.

26:12.786 --> 26:16.665
You can save yourself a lot of time
and trouble, confess what you've done.

26:16.873 --> 26:18.667
I will if you Will.

26:18.875 --> 26:20.502
My conscience is clear.

26:21.962 --> 26:24.005
All that Xanax.

26:24.214 --> 26:27.008
My, how you must have trouble
sleeping at night.

26:27.217 --> 26:30.178
You don't know shit about me.

26:30.387 --> 26:33.306
- A minute?
- Except you're lieutenant of Homicide...

26:33.515 --> 26:36.101
...and you wear a big shiny badge...

26:36.351 --> 26:39.062
...and yet you know exactly
what your brother is.

26:41.106 --> 26:43.108
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

26:43.316 --> 26:45.986
They wouldn't believe me
even if I did.

26:46.194 --> 26:49.406
But knowing that you have
to live with it...

26:49.614 --> 26:51.574
...is punishment enough.

26:51.783 --> 26:53.910
Still, I'm curious.

26:54.327 --> 26:58.999
How do you justify arresting me
and not him?

26:59.207 --> 27:03.378
Or is the law just something
that you make up as you go along?

27:03.586 --> 27:06.214
Turning a blind eye
whenever you feel like it...

27:06.423 --> 27:08.341
...or whenever Dexter is involved?

27:08.550 --> 27:10.677
Fuck you.

27:12.262 --> 27:14.514
You are a liar and a killer.

27:14.723 --> 27:16.516
But not a hypocrite.

27:16.725 --> 27:19.019
Miss McKay. Come on, let's go.

27:23.189 --> 27:25.692
You're charged with murder,
first degree...

27:25.900 --> 27:28.737
...with the death of Salvador Price.
How do you plead?

27:28.945 --> 27:30.530
My client pleads not guilty.

27:30.739 --> 27:33.658
Miss McKay, you are remanded
to the state of Florida...

27:33.867 --> 27:35.160
...and bail is denied.

27:35.368 --> 27:36.411
No.

27:38.163 --> 27:39.372
Hannah.

27:40.123 --> 27:43.335
- I'm so sorry.
- Listen to me. It's gonna be fine, okay?

27:43.543 --> 27:46.129
- Ma'am, you need to step back, please.
- Thank you.

27:46.338 --> 27:47.964
Good bye.

27:54.763 --> 27:56.264
Maria.

27:57.349 --> 27:58.391
Just checking in.

27:59.642 --> 28:00.810
It's nice of you.

28:01.561 --> 28:04.189
Seems everyone else is avoiding me.

28:04.397 --> 28:07.734
You know how it is. Everyone
is waiting to see where this lands.

28:07.942 --> 28:11.571
I'm doing everything I can to make sure
it doesn't land on my head.

28:11.946 --> 28:14.157
You need to show up to my party.

28:14.491 --> 28:17.619
I really don't think
anyone wants to see me there.

28:17.827 --> 28:19.704
Of course they do.

28:20.580 --> 28:23.750
It's also an opportunity for you
to apologise to Dexter.

28:23.958 --> 28:27.504
- A public act of contrition.
- If you straighten it outwith him...

28:27.712 --> 28:31.674
...he can tell the people upstairs
that it was just a misunderstanding.

28:31.883 --> 28:34.010
Either way, show up tonight.

28:34.219 --> 28:38.098
It's not just New Year's Eve.
It's also my retirement party.

28:39.140 --> 28:41.643
It wouldn't feel right without you.

28:41.851 --> 28:43.103
I'll be there.

28:58.827 --> 29:01.037
1500 cds, supercharged.

29:01.246 --> 29:03.832
It's the best Jet Ski out there.

29:04.124 --> 29:07.710
Yeah, I just can't see spending
14 grand--

29:07.919 --> 29:10.088
Shit! What the fuck?

29:12.924 --> 29:15.009
Seward Memorial Hospital, now!

29:15.218 --> 29:17.637
She's having some sort of seizure.

29:22.684 --> 29:27.397
She seems stable. We're wheeling her
into Seward Memorial Emergency now.

29:31.067 --> 29:33.403
We'd better contact her next of kin.

29:35.071 --> 29:36.698
Hang on, sweetheart.

29:36.948 --> 29:40.785
Go ahead and get her an MRI.
Make sure it's with contrast.

29:40.994 --> 29:43.288
ETA is...

30:18.031 --> 30:19.699
<i>Let's hope my hunch is right...</i>

30:19.908 --> 30:22.076
<i>...that the pull of a past romance...</i>

30:22.285 --> 30:25.497
...is <i>enough to compel Florencia
to help Estrada.</i>

30:27.832 --> 30:29.417
You wanted to talk?

30:29.626 --> 30:31.794
Deb, come in and have a seat.

30:33.505 --> 30:34.547
What's up?

30:36.382 --> 30:38.301
You were right.

30:38.801 --> 30:40.053
About?

30:40.261 --> 30:41.638
Me.

30:42.680 --> 30:47.977
I let my feelings for Sergeant Doakes
affect my decision-making.

30:48.186 --> 30:54.275
What I put your brother through
was negligent and unforgivable.

30:55.985 --> 30:57.654
And I'm sorry.

30:59.489 --> 31:04.410
If it's any consolation,
my career is gonna take a hit.

31:04.619 --> 31:07.872
Suspension, probably worse.

31:08.456 --> 31:09.707
I hope not.

31:11.626 --> 31:13.711
You don't have to say that.

31:14.170 --> 31:17.006
Either way, in the event I'm not around
much longer...

31:17.215 --> 31:21.511
...I wanna leave things
in some kind of order.

31:23.012 --> 31:26.057
I was trying so hard to prove
the Butcher was still active...

31:26.224 --> 31:29.769
...I overlooked some loose ends
on Travis Marshall's death.

31:29.978 --> 31:32.605
I was hoping you could help me
with the time line.

31:33.356 --> 31:34.899
Sure.

31:35.108 --> 31:38.820
Okay.
According to Dexter's statement...

31:39.028 --> 31:42.198
...previous to the day
we found Travis Marshall's body...

31:42.407 --> 31:45.410
...he was doing his final
forensics sweep on the church.

31:45.618 --> 31:46.703
Yeah, that's right.

31:46.911 --> 31:48.871
- Under your supervision.
- No.

31:49.247 --> 31:51.958
I mean, yes, I sent him,
but he was on his own.

31:52.166 --> 31:54.168
He doesn't need someone
to watch him.

31:54.377 --> 31:56.170
You didn't go to the church?

31:56.379 --> 31:59.132
- That day or evening?
- No.

31:59.299 --> 32:01.175
You sure?

32:01.384 --> 32:03.011
Yes.

32:11.603 --> 32:15.690
Going through the mail, I got a package
from Mike Anderson's widow.

32:17.233 --> 32:21.279
And it seems that before Mike died,
he ordered security footage...

32:21.487 --> 32:24.824
...from all gas stations
around the church.

32:26.284 --> 32:28.661
This got lumped
into his personal belongings.

32:28.870 --> 32:32.457
It recently got sent to me, so...

32:35.043 --> 32:36.085
Can you see that?

32:38.004 --> 32:41.799
That's two blocks from the church
and there's a time stamp.

32:42.842 --> 32:44.427
It was <i>22</i> minutes...

32:44.636 --> 32:48.890
...before the fire department
got the call on the burning church.

32:51.809 --> 32:54.228
What were you doing there,
lieutenant?

32:57.482 --> 33:00.026
What it looks like. I was getting gas.

33:00.234 --> 33:01.903
Then why lie about it?

33:02.278 --> 33:05.365
I didn't lie. I forgot.

33:05.907 --> 33:07.033
It was a crazy night.

33:07.241 --> 33:10.078
You were certain about it
a moment ago.

33:11.204 --> 33:12.246
No--

33:12.455 --> 33:15.291
I'm-- I am sorry, I...

33:15.500 --> 33:17.543
Took some food to Dexter
at the church.

33:17.752 --> 33:19.545
I was only there for 30 seconds...

33:19.754 --> 33:22.840
...so I didn't think
that it was worth remembering.

33:23.049 --> 33:24.384
Then you got some gas.

33:25.051 --> 33:27.929
- Yes.
- That you put in a gas can?

33:30.682 --> 33:31.766
Yeah.

33:31.974 --> 33:34.519
Why in the world--?

33:34.727 --> 33:36.437
Captain, where is this going?

33:37.939 --> 33:41.025
That's up to you, lieutenant.

33:42.235 --> 33:43.277
Debra...

33:44.737 --> 33:47.365
...we've known each other
a long time.

33:48.408 --> 33:52.286
Is there something
you wanna get off your chest?

34:01.337 --> 34:03.089
Yes.

34:15.017 --> 34:18.229
I think you have been
under a lot of stress.

34:24.152 --> 34:26.195
You know what I think?

34:29.490 --> 34:33.786
I think I'm not the only one
who made a mistake...

34:33.995 --> 34:36.873
...trying to protect someone
they care about.

34:43.379 --> 34:45.298
Is there anything else, captain?

34:45.506 --> 34:47.341
Not for now.

34:47.967 --> 34:52.096
But this is just the start
of a much larger conversation.

34:54.432 --> 34:56.267
Count on it.

35:25.379 --> 35:27.215
<i>Estrada.</i>

35:30.551 --> 35:32.595
<i>I guess some bonds
are unbreakable.</i>

35:32.804 --> 35:36.140
<i>We never leave behind
the ones we love.</i>

35:46.859 --> 35:48.820
<i>He could be there all day.</i>

35:54.033 --> 35:55.827
And you can keep that, all right?

36:02.250 --> 36:03.793
Hey!

36:19.767 --> 36:21.310
Hi, Deb.

36:22.103 --> 36:24.522
Well, now?

36:25.773 --> 36:26.816
Okay.

36:27.024 --> 36:29.068
Give me 15 minutes.

36:29.277 --> 36:31.737
Still unconscious,
but seizures have stopped.

36:31.946 --> 36:34.782
We've got her stabilised.
We're waiting for a doctor.

36:34.991 --> 36:36.784
We could use your help over here.

36:48.170 --> 36:49.672
Just-- Okay.

36:50.506 --> 36:52.174
LaGuerta knew I was lying, Dex.

36:52.383 --> 36:54.594
Wait, wait, let me think.

36:57.305 --> 36:58.848
What?

36:59.140 --> 37:00.641
This is bad, Deb.

37:01.309 --> 37:05.438
I don't wanna fucking hear you say that.
You always say that you can fix it.

37:05.646 --> 37:06.981
I Will.

37:07.773 --> 37:09.984
Just don't know how yet.

37:11.485 --> 37:14.155
Dangerous enough
when she was focused just on me...

37:14.363 --> 37:17.617
...but now that she's pulled you
into this, well, it's worse.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.827
Tell me about it.

37:21.454 --> 37:25.333
- I've said this a hundred times.
- But you're sorry I got involved in this.

37:25.541 --> 37:27.043
I am.

37:29.545 --> 37:31.839
Are we really that fucked?

37:34.216 --> 37:36.719
Look, all she knows
is that you bought some gas.

37:36.928 --> 37:38.512
That's not a crime.

37:38.721 --> 37:41.223
Yeah, but buying gas
to burn down a church...

37:41.432 --> 37:45.102
...to cover up the fact you killed
Travis Marshall is. She knows that.

37:45.311 --> 37:47.355
But she can't prove it.

37:47.647 --> 37:49.106
Yet.

37:50.107 --> 37:53.027
I need to know what else she has,
what her next move is.

37:53.235 --> 37:56.280
If all she's got is that DVD,
I can handle this.

37:57.114 --> 37:59.200
Is this ever gonna end?

38:00.409 --> 38:02.411
Yeah, it will.

38:05.790 --> 38:09.627
Just go back to work
and try and act normal.

38:10.586 --> 38:12.421
Normal? What the fuck is normal?

38:12.630 --> 38:14.090
Just do the best you can.

38:14.298 --> 38:15.675
I'll deal with LaGuerta.

38:17.468 --> 38:20.638
- What the hell is that?
- Estrada.

38:35.486 --> 38:37.113
Oh, shit. Let's go!

38:37.321 --> 38:41.575
Officer Armes calling for backup.
We need units at Seward Memorial.

38:57.842 --> 38:59.010
LaGuerta's house.

38:59.218 --> 39:01.887
What is it you're hoping to find,
Dexter?

39:03.055 --> 39:04.098
I don't know.

39:13.607 --> 39:14.734
Not this.

39:15.109 --> 39:16.819
Warrants.

39:17.194 --> 39:19.530
With a judge's signature...

39:20.281 --> 39:23.909
...allowing LaGuerta to track the GPS
on my phone and Debra's...

39:24.118 --> 39:26.370
...the night the church burnt down.

39:27.121 --> 39:28.289
Once this goes through...

39:28.456 --> 39:31.625
...LaGuerta will have the time line
for the night I killed Marshall.

39:31.834 --> 39:36.338
She'll know Debra went to the church,
then the gas station.

39:37.048 --> 39:39.800
And then back to the church...

39:40.509 --> 39:43.971
...proving that we both were
at the church when it burned down...

39:44.180 --> 39:47.058
...and proving
that Deb was my accomplice.

39:47.516 --> 39:50.352
I think it's time to run, Dexter.

39:50.811 --> 39:52.730
But Deb. I can't leave her behind.

39:52.938 --> 39:54.482
Take her with you.

39:54.690 --> 39:58.611
Debra and Harrison, just go. You knew
one day it would come to this.

39:58.819 --> 40:00.780
Deb could never live like that.

40:00.988 --> 40:03.783
That's always been the plan, Dexter.

40:05.242 --> 40:06.702
That was before.

40:06.911 --> 40:08.788
It's not just Deb.

40:08.996 --> 40:10.331
I don't wanna run either.

40:10.539 --> 40:12.750
Before? Before what?

40:12.958 --> 40:14.376
Before everything.

40:14.585 --> 40:17.088
Before I married Rita,
before I had a son...

40:17.296 --> 40:19.840
...before Deb knew who I was,
before I fell in love.

40:20.007 --> 40:21.509
What difference does that make?

40:21.675 --> 40:23.844
Somewhere along the line,
the fake life...

40:24.011 --> 40:27.056
...that we created as a cover for me
to kill became real.

40:27.223 --> 40:30.559
It's not fake to me anymore.

40:31.102 --> 40:33.104
I don't wanna lose it.

40:34.105 --> 40:36.440
I'm gonna stand my ground.

40:36.649 --> 40:39.735
I don't see any other options here,
Dexter.

40:43.781 --> 40:45.574
But I do.

40:48.327 --> 40:51.705
No. Dexter, you have never
done a kill like this.

40:53.290 --> 40:54.583
I'm about to.

40:55.543 --> 40:57.128
No.

40:57.837 --> 41:01.465
LaGuerta's an innocent. She doesn't
even begin to meet the code.

41:01.674 --> 41:03.467
It's the only option.

41:03.759 --> 41:06.637
I can't let Deb go down
for what I've done.

41:07.388 --> 41:09.640
My God, Dexter.

41:13.144 --> 41:14.478
How did we end up here?

41:21.569 --> 41:22.653
Morning, Dex.

41:24.029 --> 41:26.574
Gonna pick up
some steaks and beer tonight, yeah?

41:26.782 --> 41:27.825
Sounds good.

41:28.033 --> 41:30.911
The kind of doughnut you choose
says a lot about a man.

41:31.120 --> 41:33.122
Hey.

41:33.831 --> 41:35.166
Avoid Doakes. Bad mood.

41:35.374 --> 41:39.336
First, Lt dumps him, now his prostitute
killer seems to have gone missing.

41:40.254 --> 41:41.422
- I love these.
- Hey.

41:41.630 --> 41:43.215
Thanks.

41:46.302 --> 41:47.928
Get one while they last.

41:48.387 --> 41:50.681
I don't want no fucking doughnut,
Morgan.

41:50.890 --> 41:52.308
Sorry.

41:53.184 --> 41:54.351
Hell, it's not you.

41:54.560 --> 41:59.565
It's LaGuerta. I should have never
gotten involved with her to begin with.

42:03.485 --> 42:07.489
Never jump the fence if you're not
willing to face what's on the other side.

42:08.073 --> 42:10.492
Where the fuck did you hear that?

42:11.660 --> 42:14.914
A friend said it to me
in a moment of stress.

42:15.122 --> 42:18.083
Bullshit. You don't have any friends.

42:22.379 --> 42:25.841
This is the journal
of that motherfucking hooker killer...

42:26.050 --> 42:27.509
...Walter Munro.

42:27.718 --> 42:31.430
I took it from his place a couple
of weeks ago while serving a warrant.

42:31.639 --> 42:33.140
Locked up in my drawer since.

42:33.349 --> 42:34.683
"Never jump the fence...

42:34.892 --> 42:37.978
...if you're not willing to face
what's on the other side."

42:41.315 --> 42:42.733
That's a weird coincidence.

42:42.942 --> 42:45.361
Fuck coincidences.
I don't believe in them.

42:47.029 --> 42:49.406
- I should--
- There's something off about you.

42:49.615 --> 42:51.325
I should have seen it before.

42:51.909 --> 42:54.912
The fake smile, the doughnuts.

42:55.120 --> 42:57.957
You don't even walk
like a normal person. You glide.

42:58.165 --> 43:01.835
Like a fucking lizard on ice.

43:02.461 --> 43:04.255
It's all a fucking act...

43:04.463 --> 43:06.298
...and I ain't buying it.

43:08.300 --> 43:10.386
I think you're overreacting.

43:12.137 --> 43:13.973
You're hiding something...

43:14.181 --> 43:17.184
...and one day
I'm gonna figure out what it is.

43:18.435 --> 43:21.105
You are one creep motherfucker.

43:29.405 --> 43:32.324
<i>It was a mistake to try to act human
in front of Doakes.</i>

43:32.533 --> 43:35.327
<i>All I did was reveal how fake I was.</i>

43:39.456 --> 43:42.668
<i>- Captain LaGuerta.</i>
- Oye, <i>this is Hector Estrada.</i>

43:42.876 --> 43:43.919
You're alive?

43:44.128 --> 43:45.212
I need your help.

43:45.421 --> 43:47.006
<i>I'm back here at the shipyard.</i>

43:47.214 --> 43:49.508
<i>Same container.</i>

44:01.729 --> 44:02.813
That's good.

44:03.022 --> 44:04.940
Very convincing.

44:05.149 --> 44:08.569
- You're gonna let me go now, right?
- No.

44:08.777 --> 44:12.781
- You said--
- You think I'm a killer and not a liar?

44:18.704 --> 44:22.583
Now, this is a kill I've been
looking forward to for a long time.

44:22.791 --> 44:27.296
You're the one who started this all,
so many years ago.

44:28.088 --> 44:29.965
Should auld acquaintance be forgot?

44:30.174 --> 44:32.843
- No, but look. I can--
- It's a rhetorical question.

44:33.052 --> 44:34.136
Look!

44:34.345 --> 44:37.473
I'm sorry I killed your mother,
all right?

44:39.058 --> 44:40.851
Was it hard?

44:41.685 --> 44:44.146
Making the decision to kill her?

44:44.938 --> 44:46.357
Yes.

44:46.565 --> 44:47.858
Yeah, man.

44:48.067 --> 44:50.069
It was the hardest decision
of my life.

44:50.277 --> 44:52.321
Look, I didn't wanna do it.

44:52.529 --> 44:53.572
You're lying.

44:53.781 --> 44:56.075
She was a snitch.

44:56.283 --> 44:59.036
It was a matter of survival.
It was her or me.

44:59.244 --> 45:01.580
Come on! This was 40 years ago!

45:01.789 --> 45:03.707
Why are we still talking about this?

45:03.916 --> 45:06.835
When we finish talking, I kill you.

45:07.336 --> 45:10.214
Okay, okay.

45:11.215 --> 45:13.592
What else you wanna know?

45:15.386 --> 45:17.721
Did it make you feel bad?

45:18.347 --> 45:20.557
Look, I said I--

45:21.016 --> 45:23.352
It was her or me.

45:24.561 --> 45:25.979
Survival of the fittest?

45:26.188 --> 45:28.107
Yeah, exactly.

45:28.941 --> 45:30.943
Killing you will be easy...

45:31.151 --> 45:36.073
...but I have another kill I have to do
that's not so easy.

45:37.116 --> 45:39.326
So why are you doing it, man?

45:39.535 --> 45:41.745
To protect myself.

45:42.121 --> 45:43.956
And my sister.

45:44.164 --> 45:45.791
Exactly.

45:45.999 --> 45:48.335
Survival, right?

45:48.544 --> 45:50.504
The normal reasons.

45:50.712 --> 45:53.006
The normal reasons?

45:54.800 --> 45:57.803
I've never killed for normal reasons.

45:59.680 --> 46:02.683
I used to think I was special,
a special kind of killer...

46:02.891 --> 46:05.144
...but tonight...

46:05.352 --> 46:06.520
...I'm not.

46:06.728 --> 46:08.814
I hear you, bro.

46:09.731 --> 46:11.525
I hear you.

46:11.733 --> 46:14.862
So then what are you, right?

46:15.070 --> 46:16.905
What am I?

46:18.031 --> 46:21.368
I'm just a creep motherfucker.

46:45.434 --> 46:46.477
- Jamie.
- Hey, Deb.

46:46.685 --> 46:49.730
- Have you seen Dex?
- He was supposed to pick up Harrison.

46:49.938 --> 46:52.232
So tired,
I put him down in the back office.

46:52.441 --> 46:54.818
You see him,
let him know I'm looking for him?

46:55.027 --> 46:56.445
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

46:56.653 --> 46:58.405
Happy New Year.

46:58.614 --> 46:59.656
What?

47:00.032 --> 47:01.909
Fuck, sorry. Happy New Year.

47:02.117 --> 47:05.496
- You wanna dance?
- Okay, let's go dance. Come on.

47:05.704 --> 47:08.457
Oh, slow down, cowboy.

47:08.665 --> 47:10.417
I'll share.

47:14.254 --> 47:16.840
I heard that you broke up
with your girlfriend.

47:17.549 --> 47:18.675
She dumped me.

47:18.884 --> 47:22.679
So are you gonna get all sloppy drunk
and make an ass of yourself...

47:22.888 --> 47:26.558
-...like when you broke up with Deb?
- I was thinking about it.

47:26.767 --> 47:29.019
You gonna hit on me again too?

47:30.020 --> 47:31.772
I'm just saying, fair warning.

47:31.980 --> 47:34.525
I do not need my brother
to protect me.

47:34.733 --> 47:36.902
And if you don't show me respect...

47:37.110 --> 47:39.488
...I will fuck you up...

47:39.696 --> 47:42.824
...and serve your balls
in a shot glass.

47:43.158 --> 47:46.662
How do you make that sound
so fucking sexy?

47:49.623 --> 47:51.375
- Everything good here?
- Just fine.

47:51.583 --> 47:53.126
Yeah? Good.

47:59.550 --> 48:01.426
- Hey, hermano.
- Hey.

48:01.635 --> 48:05.556
So how's it feel knowing
you're putting away your badge?

48:06.014 --> 48:09.059
Honestly, a little scary.

48:09.268 --> 48:10.644
All I've been is a cop.

48:10.852 --> 48:12.854
I'm putting it all behind me,
you know?

48:13.063 --> 48:14.106
Unknown territory.

48:14.773 --> 48:15.983
That takes balls, man.

48:16.567 --> 48:18.569
Oh, hey. It's almost time.

48:19.278 --> 48:21.113
Where can I go to change?

48:21.321 --> 48:24.908
No, you're not gonna put on a diaper
and come out as Baby New Year.

48:25.117 --> 48:27.995
- Try and stop me.
- No.

48:28.203 --> 48:29.830
You're gonna scare people is--

48:30.038 --> 48:32.332
- Great party.
- Thanks. ls your brother here?

48:32.541 --> 48:34.376
He said he was gonna be here.

48:34.585 --> 48:38.422
Maria too. Maybe after what happened,
they wanna avoid each other.

48:38.630 --> 48:41.592
- I'm gonna call, make sure he's okay.
- Okay.

48:44.553 --> 48:46.847
- Dispatch.
- This is Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

48:47.055 --> 48:49.600
I was hoping to get a 20
on LaGuerta's vehicle.

48:49.933 --> 48:50.976
I'll Wait.

48:51.184 --> 48:54.521
<i>Heading north towards the Miami Port,
by the shipping yards.</i>

48:54.730 --> 48:57.399
- The shipping yards? Are you sure?
- That's correct.

48:57.608 --> 48:59.109
Thank you.

49:05.949 --> 49:09.202
Dex. Whatever you're thinking of doing,
please don't do it.

50:29.032 --> 50:30.575
So, what's the plan?

50:32.160 --> 50:34.871
I gave LaGuerta half a dose of M99...

50:35.247 --> 50:37.749
...so it won't be found in her system.

50:39.167 --> 50:42.421
I'll use her gun to shoot Estrada
in his puncture wound.

50:42.629 --> 50:45.340
Destroying any evidence
that he was stabbed.

50:46.091 --> 50:47.718
And then?

50:48.802 --> 50:50.387
Tell me.

50:50.595 --> 50:52.723
I'll use Estrada's gun
to shoot LaGuerta.

50:52.931 --> 50:55.434
So it'll look
like they killed each other.

50:55.642 --> 50:57.394
Yes.

50:57.769 --> 50:59.521
Dexter.

51:00.689 --> 51:02.482
Where will this end?

51:22.043 --> 51:24.880
Shit, Dex, what have you done?

51:37.225 --> 51:38.643
Deb?

51:38.852 --> 51:40.520
Oh, God.

51:41.480 --> 51:42.606
Dex.

51:44.274 --> 51:45.484
You shouldn't be here.

51:47.861 --> 51:50.989
Why shouldn't I be here?

51:54.409 --> 51:55.702
What are you doing?

51:56.286 --> 51:57.996
What needs to be done.

51:58.497 --> 52:01.208
- Are you gonna kill her?
- You need to leave.

52:01.416 --> 52:03.752
- I need to finish this.
- Dexter, you can't.

52:05.045 --> 52:06.671
I can and I will.

52:06.880 --> 52:08.965
Enough. Dexter, you can't do this.

52:09.549 --> 52:11.843
The only solution,
the only way to end this.

52:12.052 --> 52:14.387
No, no.
I can't let you go through with this!

52:14.596 --> 52:16.014
Shoot him, Debra.

52:20.894 --> 52:22.646
You have to end this.

52:23.104 --> 52:24.648
Shoot him.

52:27.234 --> 52:29.736
- Stop!
- Do it, Debra. Shoot him.

52:31.655 --> 52:33.990
Do it! Shoot him!

52:34.366 --> 52:37.661
This is not who you are.

52:37.994 --> 52:39.246
You're a good cop.

52:39.454 --> 52:41.915
You're a good person.
You're not like him.

52:43.917 --> 52:45.544
Put him down!

52:48.505 --> 52:49.631
It's true.

52:49.840 --> 52:52.092
Everything she said.

52:52.300 --> 52:54.386
You're a good person.

52:57.806 --> 52:59.307
It's okay.

53:07.816 --> 53:09.901
Do what you gotta do.

53:17.826 --> 53:19.494
Dex.

53:29.170 --> 53:30.297
Oh, my God!

53:30.922 --> 53:33.383
Oh, my God!

54:09.044 --> 54:12.130
<i>We all make rules for ourselves.</i>

54:14.007 --> 54:17.594
<i>It's these rules
that help define who we are.</i>

54:21.348 --> 54:24.559
<i>So when we break those rules,
we risk losing ourselves...</i>

54:25.101 --> 54:27.062
<i>...and becoming something unknown.</i>

54:27.771 --> 54:29.814
<i>Who is Deb now?</i>

54:30.023 --> 54:31.858
<i>Who am I?</i>

54:32.609 --> 54:34.986
<i>Is this a new beginning...</i>

54:36.196 --> 54:38.281
<i>...or the beginning of the end?</i>
