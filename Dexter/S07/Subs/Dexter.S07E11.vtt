WEBVTT

00:10.475 --> 00:11.685
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

00:11.893 --> 00:14.396
Our primary suspect
is Sergeant James Doakes.

00:16.022 --> 00:17.857
- Doakes?
- If Doakes really wasn't...

00:18.024 --> 00:22.445
...the Bay Harbour Butcher, best thing
to do is look into Doakes' final days.

00:22.612 --> 00:26.491
We should start with the cabin
in the Everglades where Doakes died.

00:28.034 --> 00:30.537
- I was renting the place to Jimenez.
- Jimenez?

00:30.745 --> 00:34.708
He was one of the three men responsible
for killing Dexter Morgan's mother.

00:34.916 --> 00:38.545
What if Dexter
is the real Bay Harbour Butcher?

00:38.753 --> 00:41.506
If somebody's gonna talk to Dexter,
it's gonna be me.

00:41.715 --> 00:44.426
All right,
tell your boyfriend who you belong to.

00:46.594 --> 00:50.640
- I'm sorry.
-It's okay. Go. Go, now.

00:51.433 --> 00:53.059
He died in my apartment.

00:53.268 --> 00:56.604
Figured it would kick in while Price
was on the road. An auto accident.

00:56.813 --> 00:59.482
- How'd you do it?
- Price liked to chew on his pens.

00:59.691 --> 01:01.693
Last one had a little something on it.

01:01.901 --> 01:03.570
She is a killer.

01:04.237 --> 01:05.905
You will never be safe with her.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.908
When Hannah got out of juvie...

01:09.117 --> 01:11.953
...she killed a counsellor
at a halfway house.

01:12.162 --> 01:13.413
She fed him rat poison.

01:13.621 --> 01:17.709
Her roommate, a little gal
named Arlene Schram, saw her do it.

01:20.336 --> 01:22.046
He won't be bothering you again.

01:22.297 --> 01:23.506
I love you.

01:24.549 --> 01:26.342
I think I love you too.

01:28.678 --> 01:30.638
I need to find Arlene Schram.

01:30.805 --> 01:32.432
Sure. Who's that?

01:33.057 --> 01:36.686
According to a message I got last night
from Hannah McKay's father...

01:36.895 --> 01:38.605
...she's a witness to a murder.

03:32.010 --> 03:34.596
<i>I've never thought about the future.</i>

03:37.974 --> 03:40.351
<i>About growing old.</i>

03:49.485 --> 03:53.448
<i>Maybe because the future
has never been kind to people like me.</i>

04:15.970 --> 04:18.181
<i>Or their loved ones.</i>

04:18.765 --> 04:19.933
Bye, Dad.

04:20.141 --> 04:22.060
Bye, Harrison.

04:28.107 --> 04:32.153
<i>But, suddenly,
my future seems very possible.</i>

04:40.411 --> 04:43.081
<i>And growing old
is not only a possibility...</i>

04:43.289 --> 04:46.584
<i>...it seems appealing.</i>

05:02.016 --> 05:04.727
<i>- Hello.
- Am I speaking with Dexter Morgan?</i>

05:04.936 --> 05:07.855
<i>- Yeah, that's right.
- This is Department of Corrections.</i>

05:08.022 --> 05:10.358
<i>Hector Estrada
is having a parole hearing.</i>

05:10.525 --> 05:12.485
- What? When?
<i>- This</i> morning at 10 a.m.

05:12.694 --> 05:14.320
<i>I know this is sudden.</i>

05:14.988 --> 05:17.115
Okay. Thank you for letting me know.

05:17.323 --> 05:19.450
<i>You're welcome, sir.</i>

05:22.120 --> 05:26.040
That was the Department of Corrections.
Hector Estrada is up for parole.

05:26.249 --> 05:28.501
He thinks there's good chance
he'll get it.

05:28.710 --> 05:29.961
Estrada?

05:30.169 --> 05:33.423
Remember I told you about my mother
and how she died?

05:34.716 --> 05:36.050
Oh, God.

05:36.259 --> 05:39.387
Was he--?
Was he one of the men that killed her?

05:39.595 --> 05:42.390
He was the leader.
He gave the order.

05:42.598 --> 05:44.600
What about the others?

05:47.979 --> 05:49.522
Dead.

05:51.315 --> 05:53.443
Estrada is the last survivor.

05:54.902 --> 05:57.947
I'm sure you'll have something to say
about that.

06:00.742 --> 06:02.618
Look at it this way.

06:03.036 --> 06:06.581
Maybe it's the universe
giving you a Christmas present.

06:08.166 --> 06:11.002
No one but you
would see it that way.

06:15.631 --> 06:19.927
<i>Maybe killing Estrada
will close this chapter of my life...</i>

06:21.345 --> 06:23.931
<i>...and open me up to a future
with Hannah.</i>

06:25.058 --> 06:28.061
Panel has reviewed
all the pertinent data in this matter.

06:28.269 --> 06:31.731
We find that the prisoner
meets the requirements for parole...

06:31.939 --> 06:36.486
...under the
Compassionate Release Statute 463.

06:36.694 --> 06:39.989
Have you read the statute?
You understand your obligations?

06:40.531 --> 06:43.785
I understand what's expected of me.

06:43.993 --> 06:46.162
I won't screw up.

06:46.954 --> 06:50.458
At this time, we invite any victims
present to enter a statement...

06:50.666 --> 06:54.587
...either for or against
the board's decision.

06:55.004 --> 06:57.215
<i>I have no objection.</i>

06:58.800 --> 07:00.426
Nadia, it's me again.

07:00.635 --> 07:02.386
This is my fifth message.

07:02.595 --> 07:04.222
Just wanna know where you are.

07:04.430 --> 07:05.807
Give me a call.

07:06.015 --> 07:07.517
Did you get a bad news?

07:07.725 --> 07:09.769
Just trying to find Nadia.

07:09.977 --> 07:11.771
Hey. Taking a survey.

07:11.979 --> 07:14.315
Secret Santa this year
or no Secret Santa?

07:14.524 --> 07:16.734
I got enough presents to buy, man.

07:17.985 --> 07:21.531
Man, the Christmas spirit around here
sucks big reindeer dicks.

07:22.031 --> 07:23.282
Deb.

07:23.491 --> 07:24.909
I found Arlene Schram.

07:25.118 --> 07:26.410
Oh, fucking amazing.

07:26.619 --> 07:28.371
She's living out in Hialeah.

07:28.579 --> 07:32.125
Two drug arrests since juvie,
has two kids from different fathers.

07:32.333 --> 07:37.713
Temporarily lost custody a year ago
due to her drug abuse.

07:37.922 --> 07:41.259
Good to know. I'll have to go hard.
I might have to take away...

07:41.467 --> 07:45.847
-...her Mother of the Year trophy.
- Any luck in locating Hannah's father?

07:46.055 --> 07:49.600
No, zero. He dropped the dime
on his daughter and then skipped town.

07:49.809 --> 07:52.145
Well, he's a drifter.
He could be anywhere.

07:54.689 --> 07:57.525
Maybe we should let your brother know
what we're doing.

07:57.733 --> 08:00.862
- We're investigating his girlfriend.
- I told Dexter...

08:01.070 --> 08:03.531
...that if I found anything on Hannah,
I'd act.

08:03.739 --> 08:08.161
- I still don't feel right about this.
- And I'm telling you it's my call, okay?

08:11.414 --> 08:12.957
<i>Matthews made his choices.</i>

08:13.166 --> 08:16.085
<i>Now he spends Christmas alone
with his boat.</i>

08:16.294 --> 08:18.212
<i>How close was I to the same fate?</i>

08:18.421 --> 08:22.175
Oh, hand me one of those zip ties
on the table there, will you?

08:27.680 --> 08:29.265
Thanks.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.186
Fucking Christmas lights.

08:35.646 --> 08:39.150
Every year I put them up, and
every year I wonder why I bothered.

08:39.358 --> 08:41.194
You said you wanted to see me.

08:41.402 --> 08:44.113
Yeah. Yeah, thanks for coming out.

08:45.156 --> 08:46.699
Sit.

08:47.825 --> 08:52.079
I wanted to give you a heads-up on this
idea that Captain LaGuerta has got.

08:52.288 --> 08:53.664
What?

08:53.998 --> 08:56.125
The Bay Harbour Butcher.

08:56.334 --> 08:59.086
Maria's convinced
that Doakes was innocent...

08:59.295 --> 09:02.131
...and that the real killer
is still at large.

09:03.424 --> 09:07.845
Actually, she thinks it might be you.

09:10.014 --> 09:11.515
Me?

09:12.058 --> 09:15.937
I know. Personally, I think
she's had one too many Mosquitos...

09:16.145 --> 09:18.439
...or whatever they call
that goddamn drink.

09:18.648 --> 09:22.068
But, anyway, here we are.

09:22.568 --> 09:25.112
What makes her think
I'm the Bay Harbour Butcher?

09:25.279 --> 09:27.573
She knows your life story,
your childhood...

09:27.782 --> 09:30.785
...what you saw
in that cargo container.

09:31.118 --> 09:35.873
Most people,
that would screw them up for life.

09:37.500 --> 09:41.212
Your brother went through the
same thing, look what happened to him.

09:41.420 --> 09:46.259
He saw your mother dismembered
before his eyes...

09:46.467 --> 09:50.012
...then he went on
to dismember his own victims.

09:53.933 --> 09:55.226
Drink?

09:55.434 --> 09:56.936
No.

09:57.853 --> 10:01.107
The Bay Harbour Butcher
also dismembered his victims.

10:01.941 --> 10:04.568
Of course,
your brother wasn't the Butcher.

10:05.361 --> 10:08.322
The murders continued
after his death.

10:08.656 --> 10:12.451
But it's weird, huh?

10:14.245 --> 10:18.582
Another thing that's weird,
that cabin where Doakes died.

10:18.791 --> 10:20.251
What about it?

10:20.459 --> 10:23.212
Was rented to a man named Jimenez.

10:23.421 --> 10:25.715
He's one of the men
who killed your mother.

10:25.923 --> 10:29.719
I mean, what are the odds?

10:31.262 --> 10:33.556
<i>He's interrogating me.</i>

10:36.058 --> 10:38.769
You knew my father,
you've known me my whole life...

10:38.978 --> 10:41.439
...do you think
I'm the Bay Harbour Butcher?

10:44.775 --> 10:46.068
Of course not.

10:47.236 --> 10:50.489
But if I don't ask these questions,
Maria will.

10:51.866 --> 10:55.119
You know, I always had a bad feeling
about Doakes.

10:55.411 --> 11:00.624
He obviously didn't like me
too much...

11:00.833 --> 11:02.585
...from the get-go.

11:03.753 --> 11:05.629
Not exactly a secret.

11:05.796 --> 11:08.257
But then
that whole Bay Harbour Butcher case...

11:08.466 --> 11:11.344
...came along
and something happened...

11:11.552 --> 11:13.971
...that I've never told anyone about.

11:14.180 --> 11:17.224
- What?
- I saw Doakes on his boat.

11:17.725 --> 11:19.310
Doakes had a boat?

11:19.518 --> 11:20.561
Yeah.

11:20.770 --> 11:24.357
I figured he used it
to dispose of his victims.

11:26.108 --> 11:30.488
He kept it at the same marina as mine.
I moved my boat to get away from him.

11:30.696 --> 11:32.198
Why didn't you come forward?

11:32.365 --> 11:35.326
Because I didn't know
what he'd do to me or my sister.

11:38.788 --> 11:40.206
Yeah.

11:40.790 --> 11:44.251
Doakes was a pretty formidable guy.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.087
Yeah.

11:46.295 --> 11:49.256
I can imagine how scared
you must have been.

11:51.926 --> 11:54.220
Sorry to put you through all this,
Dexter.

11:55.346 --> 11:57.348
I'll talk to Maria...

11:57.556 --> 11:59.475
...get her to move on.

12:00.267 --> 12:02.269
No hard feelings?

12:03.270 --> 12:04.688
None.

12:08.526 --> 12:10.528
<i>I've given them a boat to search for.</i>

12:10.736 --> 12:14.281
<i>Now I just have to make sure
there's something for them to find.</i>

12:14.865 --> 12:17.118
Hey, don't splash your sister.

12:17.326 --> 12:19.203
I'm not gonna tell you again.

12:20.079 --> 12:22.873
Sorry, they are non-stop.

12:23.165 --> 12:26.335
No, I have a nephew their age,
so I can relate.

12:28.087 --> 12:30.714
Traded one vice for another.

12:31.465 --> 12:34.552
At least they can't take your kids away
for tobacco.

12:34.718 --> 12:38.055
First Christmas clean and sober,
and it won't be the last.

12:38.973 --> 12:42.351
Knock on wood. Just wanna
keep looking forward, you know?

12:42.977 --> 12:47.523
That's kind of why I'm here, Arlene,
to keep you looking forward.

12:48.107 --> 12:50.651
To keep you out of jail, actually.

12:50.860 --> 12:54.363
- Why would I be going to jail?
- As an accessory to murder.

12:55.489 --> 12:59.160
He was a counsellor at a halfway house
where you resided 10 years ago.

12:59.368 --> 13:02.496
Someone spiked his coffee
with rat poison.

13:02.705 --> 13:05.291
- I don't have any idea.
- I'm not after you.

13:05.499 --> 13:08.711
I'm after Hannah McKay.
She was your roommate at the time.

13:08.919 --> 13:11.130
It was her idea,
but you had part in it.

13:11.338 --> 13:13.424
You either helped or you kept quiet.

13:13.632 --> 13:16.469
- What do you want'?
- I wanna know what happened.

13:16.677 --> 13:19.513
In return, I'll promise immunity
from prosecution...

13:19.722 --> 13:23.225
...keep you out of jail, make sure
your kids have their mother...

13:23.434 --> 13:25.269
...to put presents under the tree.

13:29.398 --> 13:31.442
I'd like some time
to think about this.

13:31.942 --> 13:33.819
Okay, do that.

13:34.945 --> 13:38.616
And play with your kids. Because
depending on what you decide...

13:38.824 --> 13:41.994
...you might not get to do that
for a really long time.

13:42.203 --> 13:43.996
Quiet now.

13:47.666 --> 13:49.710
So turn this way now.

13:49.919 --> 13:54.089
Do you remember the first and last time
Dad took us to see Santa?

13:54.298 --> 13:57.676
You yanked his beard
and I asked for a gun.

13:59.970 --> 14:03.432
Where the fuck are you, the North
Pole? You haven't said anything.

14:04.308 --> 14:05.809
What is it?

14:06.018 --> 14:07.686
You sure you wanna know?

14:07.895 --> 14:09.688
Oh, Jesus.

14:09.897 --> 14:11.524
Tell me.

14:11.941 --> 14:15.027
LaGuerta is still looking
into the Bay Harbour Butcher.

14:15.236 --> 14:16.946
Shit.

14:17.154 --> 14:20.658
I talked to Matthews.
She's pulled him into the investigation.

14:20.866 --> 14:23.994
- What?
- It gets worse.

14:24.828 --> 14:26.664
They think it's me.

14:26.872 --> 14:29.375
You weren't gonna fucking tell me?

14:30.167 --> 14:31.919
Do they have anything?

14:32.962 --> 14:34.672
I don't know.

14:36.423 --> 14:39.552
I need to put them off this
once and for all.

14:40.261 --> 14:41.387
How?

14:41.595 --> 14:44.098
Give them proof
that Doakes was the Butcher.

14:44.306 --> 14:46.350
It will mean planting evidence.

14:48.602 --> 14:51.438
You can't do that,
not with those two on your case.

14:51.939 --> 14:54.108
I'll just have to be very careful.

15:01.031 --> 15:05.077
Now, were you a good boy?
So, what do you want for Christmas?

15:06.287 --> 15:09.665
- Fuck it. It's too risky for you. I'll do it.
- Deb, no.

15:09.873 --> 15:12.710
I'm not gonna let Harrison grow up
without a father.

15:12.918 --> 15:16.005
I just want this to be the end
once and for all.

15:16.213 --> 15:17.840
Hey, guys.

15:18.132 --> 15:19.758
Hey.

15:23.971 --> 15:25.556
Hey.

15:25.723 --> 15:31.562
- Ready? Say "cheese," everyone.
- Cheese.

15:34.023 --> 15:37.151
I'm sorry, I don't think Dexter Morgan
has anything to do...

15:37.318 --> 15:40.779
-...with the Bay Harbour Butcher.
- You're letting your feelings...

15:40.946 --> 15:42.781
...completely cloud your judgment.

15:42.990 --> 15:47.786
You're letting whatever you had with
Doakes make you blind to his guilt.

15:47.995 --> 15:50.831
I've heard of people
fucking their brains out, but God.

15:50.998 --> 15:56.086
- Well, that's low even for you, Tom.
- Look, let's just follow up on this boat.

15:56.295 --> 15:59.131
Look, if James had owned a boat,
I would have known.

15:59.340 --> 16:00.758
Well, call it a wild guess.

16:00.966 --> 16:03.969
But if he was using it to dump victims
into the ocean...

16:04.178 --> 16:07.222
...he would have tried
to keep its existence a secret.

16:19.902 --> 16:23.322
I swear, I never told anyone
I saw you poison that man.

16:23.822 --> 16:26.950
I don't get how that stanky detective
could know about it.

16:28.285 --> 16:30.621
Must have been my dad.

16:30.829 --> 16:32.790
Why would he do that?

16:33.332 --> 16:36.960
He needed money and I wouldn't give it
to him. You know my dad.

16:37.544 --> 16:39.213
Yeah, unfortunately.

16:41.799 --> 16:45.761
I can't go to jail, Hannah.
Lose my kids again, I couldn't take it.

16:45.969 --> 16:48.305
I'm not gonna let that happen.

16:49.390 --> 16:53.185
Hey, look at me. When that counsellor
was putting his hands on us...

16:53.394 --> 16:56.105
...and I shut him down for good,
you backed me up.

16:57.106 --> 16:59.358
Always stuck together.

16:59.817 --> 17:02.528
That's not gonna change now, is it?

17:06.281 --> 17:08.492
But that detective's
gonna come back.

17:08.701 --> 17:09.952
She's not gonna let up.

17:10.661 --> 17:13.038
I'm gonna figure something out.

17:13.831 --> 17:16.500
You just have to stay strong, okay?

17:21.588 --> 17:22.923
<i>Not this one.</i>

17:27.261 --> 17:28.762
<i>This one looks like Doakes.</i>

17:38.981 --> 17:40.941
Did you have to get the biggest tree?

17:41.150 --> 17:45.112
Well, anything smaller than this
looks like a Charlie Brown tree.

17:46.739 --> 17:50.325
By the way, you still doing Christmas
day with Debra and Harrison?

17:50.617 --> 17:52.369
Yeah. You can join us.

17:52.870 --> 17:55.873
Not sure if Debra and me
in the same room...

17:56.081 --> 17:58.125
...would be very Christmassy.

18:06.425 --> 18:08.051
Okay.

18:08.886 --> 18:11.638
Maybe we could start a new tradition.

18:11.847 --> 18:14.016
Christmas Eve...

18:14.224 --> 18:17.102
...this year and next year,
the year after that.

18:17.311 --> 18:20.689
I like that,
except there is one problem.

18:20.898 --> 18:24.359
- What?
- I haven't got you a Christmas present.

18:24.568 --> 18:27.738
I don't really need anything.

18:28.113 --> 18:29.656
Suit yourself.

18:29.865 --> 18:34.620
Guess I'm just gonna have to go out
and buy you a pair of socks.

19:44.857 --> 19:46.525
Hold up! Hey! Hey!

19:46.733 --> 19:48.569
<i>That's not the walk of a dying man.</i>

19:48.777 --> 19:51.613
<i>I guess freedom
was the tonic he needed.</i>

19:51.822 --> 19:54.032
<i>But I'll soon change that.</i>

19:58.036 --> 19:59.788
- Jenna.
- Hey, Quinn.

19:59.997 --> 20:02.165
I'm looking for Nadia.
Know where she is?

20:02.624 --> 20:04.793
Hey, pal, find your own.

20:05.002 --> 20:07.004
Sorry, does your wife know
you're here?

20:07.170 --> 20:09.548
No, so shut the fuck up.

20:09.756 --> 20:11.174
Nadia's in Vegas.

20:11.383 --> 20:14.428
- What are you talking about?
- She moved there to work.

20:14.636 --> 20:16.930
Got a job in one of the casinos.

20:17.347 --> 20:19.850
- When?
- Couple days ago.

20:20.058 --> 20:22.978
She left you a note. It's in my locker.

20:23.186 --> 20:26.023
- I probably shouldn't have read it.
- What did it say?

20:26.773 --> 20:28.942
She's sorry,
but she needed a new start.

20:29.151 --> 20:31.737
Staying here was too hard for her.

20:31.945 --> 20:33.780
She was really broken up.

20:36.575 --> 20:37.784
That all?

20:38.869 --> 20:43.332
Oh, that you mean a lot to her and
she'll never forget what you did for her.

20:44.416 --> 20:47.336
I'll be done in a few minutes
and I can go get it.

20:47.669 --> 20:48.962
Thanks.

20:54.301 --> 20:56.762
Last Christmas,
I was down in the Keys.

20:56.970 --> 20:59.640
This Christmas, your garage.

20:59.848 --> 21:04.019
- No one's forcing you to be here, Tom.
- Oh, I'm too afraid to leave you alone.

21:04.227 --> 21:08.106
You might decide I'm the
Bay Harbour Butcher and haul me in.

21:09.274 --> 21:12.069
- What is it?
- Come here. Take a look.

21:13.445 --> 21:15.739
It's a tackle box.

21:27.751 --> 21:30.629
These are deep-sea fishing lures.

21:31.046 --> 21:32.673
Meaning?

21:32.881 --> 21:36.134
Meaning they're the kind you need
a boat to use.

22:02.744 --> 22:04.413
Jeez, what a mess.

22:05.288 --> 22:07.499
Well, it's been empty for years.

22:07.708 --> 22:11.545
Doakes probably scrapped his boat
once we were closing in on him.

22:11.837 --> 22:16.717
We don't know Doakes used this place.
You're jumping to conclusions.

22:17.676 --> 22:21.430
This address came
from the tackle box...

22:22.139 --> 22:25.642
...which came from the cabin
where Doakes died.

22:25.851 --> 22:28.020
This isn't jumping to a conclusion.

22:28.228 --> 22:30.313
This conclusion's hanging
from your ass.

22:49.708 --> 22:53.754
- That private forensics team of yours?
- Yeah, what about them?

22:53.962 --> 22:55.839
Get them out here.

23:00.802 --> 23:03.555
I think we just struck oil.

23:08.602 --> 23:13.023
The blood's too degraded to analyse,
but we found one print on the hilt.

23:13.231 --> 23:14.900
It's a match for James Doakes.

23:17.736 --> 23:19.654
You're certain?

23:19.863 --> 23:21.907
No question, captain.

23:22.491 --> 23:24.618
Well, that sews it up.

23:24.826 --> 23:26.369
Tom.

23:29.498 --> 23:32.084
This evidence
could have been planted.

23:32.584 --> 23:35.545
Dexter is a forensics expert...

23:35.754 --> 23:38.507
-...and he has the skills--
- Maria, it's over.

23:38.715 --> 23:41.051
The fat lady isn't singing,
her song is done.

23:41.259 --> 23:43.428
She's getting humped
in her dressing room.

23:43.595 --> 23:45.055
Jesus Christ, Tom.

23:47.349 --> 23:48.600
What is wrong with you?

23:48.809 --> 23:51.686
Maria, why can't you let this go?

23:56.858 --> 24:01.071
I guess because I feel I owe it to James
to clear his name.

24:01.279 --> 24:05.075
Why?
Because you two were a couple?

24:05.909 --> 24:07.828
Because he was innocent.

24:08.370 --> 24:11.081
You're not an investigator, Maria.

24:11.498 --> 24:14.918
Your talent's in playing the game,
and you play a great one.

24:15.127 --> 24:17.212
Hell, you beat me.

24:18.004 --> 24:19.965
But either way...

24:20.549 --> 24:22.092
...I'm done here.

24:22.300 --> 24:25.220
Now, I expect you to live up
to your end of the bargain.

24:25.887 --> 24:29.057
Forty-year pay scale on my pension.

24:31.059 --> 24:33.061
I remember, Tom.

24:34.354 --> 24:36.690
Don't worry,
you'll get what's coming to you.

24:36.898 --> 24:37.941
I expect to.

24:40.735 --> 24:43.155
<i>Feliz Navidad, Mafia.</i>

24:58.295 --> 25:00.380
What the hell are you doing here?

25:00.589 --> 25:02.382
Don't tell me we're neighbours.

25:02.591 --> 25:05.677
I'm not here to fight with you
or trade insults.

25:06.428 --> 25:09.431
That's a good thing,
you probably wouldn't last one round.

25:11.099 --> 25:13.894
I came here to talk to you
about Dexter.

25:15.228 --> 25:16.938
Dexter?

25:17.230 --> 25:20.025
If you care about him,
listen to what I have to say.

25:20.233 --> 25:22.944
Just hear me out, that's all I ask.

25:23.153 --> 25:24.905
I'm all ears.

25:25.113 --> 25:26.656
Dexter is happy..-

25:26.865 --> 25:29.326
...and I know him well enough
to understand...

25:29.534 --> 25:32.120
...that this is a pretty big deal.

25:32.704 --> 25:37.209
He's been through a lot of trouble
and a lot of pain.

25:38.418 --> 25:41.463
- I can't deny that.
- I think for the first time...

25:41.671 --> 25:45.759
...in really a long time, he's actually
looking forward to the future.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.970
He talks about it.

25:49.888 --> 25:53.350
About me and him together.

25:55.185 --> 25:58.939
And I think that Dexter
could be a whole lot happier...

25:59.147 --> 26:02.400
...if he knew that you and I
could find some common ground.

26:03.443 --> 26:05.946
- For Dexter's sake.
- Yeah.

26:14.120 --> 26:17.040
He really does seem
to like having you around.

26:18.124 --> 26:20.043
I love him.

26:20.335 --> 26:23.672
- And I know that you do too.
- Yeah, you bet I do.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.091
Can't we work out our issues?

26:31.096 --> 26:32.931
I think we can.

26:39.604 --> 26:42.440
It's because I love Dexter...

26:42.691 --> 26:47.028
...that I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to protect him from you.

26:48.113 --> 26:51.825
I'm not gonna give up until your
murdering ass is behind bars for good.

26:52.033 --> 26:54.953
That's how we're gonna work out
our issues.

26:55.245 --> 26:56.788
But, hey...

26:57.831 --> 27:00.083
...thanks for stopping by.

27:02.752 --> 27:04.337
Okay.

27:16.141 --> 27:17.517
Son of a bitch.

27:17.726 --> 27:18.810
You got a dead one.

27:20.812 --> 27:22.272
Yeah.

27:22.731 --> 27:26.901
Well, it's gonna have to stay dead.
There's only so much a man can do.

27:27.110 --> 27:30.322
- What brings you around?
- Merry Christmas.

27:31.114 --> 27:34.826
- I noticed you were on empty.
- Thanks.

27:37.078 --> 27:39.664
I was thinking
about the last conversation we had.

27:39.873 --> 27:41.416
I owe you an apology.

27:42.083 --> 27:45.086
I should have come forward
with my suspicion about Doakes.

27:45.295 --> 27:48.757
- More people would be alive.
- If anyone should apologise, it's me.

27:48.965 --> 27:50.050
I was stupid.

27:50.258 --> 27:54.512
I should never have entertained Maria's
theory about you being the Butcher.

27:54.721 --> 27:58.433
- You think she'll ever accept the truth?
- She already has.

27:58.641 --> 28:01.978
- We found Doakes' boathouse.
- Really?

28:02.479 --> 28:05.982
What's even more amazing
is what we found hidden inside it.

28:06.358 --> 28:11.071
I won't go into details, except to say
it leaves no doubt as to Doakes' guilt.

28:11.279 --> 28:14.699
Believe me, you won't have to worry
about LaGuerta anymore.

28:17.118 --> 28:21.873
Well, I gotta say, that's about the best
Christmas present I could've imagined.

28:22.082 --> 28:24.834
You and me both.
Have a good Christmas with your boy.

28:25.668 --> 28:27.379
We Will.

28:29.047 --> 28:32.050
<i>Christmas just got a lot less merry
for Hector Estrada.</i>

28:32.258 --> 28:35.678
<i>My late lamented Dark Passenger
would be very pleased.</i>

28:35.887 --> 28:38.598
<i>If I can break this last strand
from my past...</i>

28:38.807 --> 28:40.934
<i>...do I get the future I want?</i>

28:42.519 --> 28:44.437
<i>- Yeah.
- I went to see Matthews again.</i>

28:44.604 --> 28:47.023
<i>They're calling off the investigation.</i>

28:47.816 --> 28:48.900
You sure?

28:49.109 --> 28:51.736
Yeah. They bought it. Everything.

28:51.945 --> 28:54.489
Well, let's hope they stay bought.

28:54.864 --> 28:56.574
<i>Thanks, Deb.</i>

29:06.167 --> 29:08.545
- You're Hector Estrada?
- I know you?

29:08.753 --> 29:11.548
You do now. Steve Gaskill.

29:12.882 --> 29:14.676
Come on, man. You're a legend.

29:14.884 --> 29:18.096
You're gonna be a stain if you
don't crawl to where you came from.

29:18.304 --> 29:21.724
I know I'm way out of line.
I gotta tell you about my situation.

29:21.933 --> 29:24.936
I have this contact in Honduras,
an old Army buddy.

29:25.145 --> 29:27.981
He sends me a crate of sativa
every other month.

29:28.189 --> 29:31.901
I've been trying to lay it off. You know,
college campuses and whatnot.

29:32.110 --> 29:35.029
But it keeps piling up.
It's too much for me to move.

29:35.238 --> 29:38.908
- How much are we talking about?
- Enough to make you shit your pants.

29:39.117 --> 29:42.120
I've been trying to find a way
into the Hispanic market.

29:42.328 --> 29:45.123
- Here you are. It's Kismet.
- Kiss who?

29:46.082 --> 29:49.043
It's good luck for both of us.

29:49.878 --> 29:51.254
I can show you the stuff.

29:51.463 --> 29:54.466
If you're interested,
maybe we can work something out.

29:54.674 --> 29:56.759
Let me hear you say
you're not a cop.

29:56.968 --> 29:58.845
I'm not a cop, man.

29:59.053 --> 30:02.140
Jeez, we know a lot of the same people.
Tuerto, Pepe Chap.

30:02.348 --> 30:05.477
- I've sold plenty of shit to them.
- Fuck.

30:05.852 --> 30:08.771
Long time since I've dealt
with those guys.

30:12.275 --> 30:15.778
- Where and when?
- Thirty-five Quayside Road. Tonight.

30:15.987 --> 30:19.741
Ten o'clock. Unless you got something
else to do on Christmas Eve.

30:20.992 --> 30:22.494
I'll see you then.

30:27.916 --> 30:29.459
<i>- Yep.
- Dex, it's Angel.</i>

30:29.667 --> 30:32.754
Debra's at St. Joseph's.
She's been in a car accident.

30:32.962 --> 30:34.839
<i>I'll meet you at the hospital.</i>

30:41.596 --> 30:44.098
Did you fill out all the questions?

30:45.099 --> 30:47.769
- Dex.
- How is she?

30:48.394 --> 30:49.604
She's fine.

30:49.812 --> 30:53.441
Her wrist is broken, lots of bruising,
but she'll be out by tomorrow.

30:53.650 --> 30:54.692
What happened?

30:54.901 --> 30:57.904
Apparently, she blacked out
or something behind the wheel.

30:58.112 --> 31:02.075
Does Debra have a prescription
for anti-anxiety medication?

31:02.283 --> 31:04.661
Not that there's a problem.
Most people do.

31:04.869 --> 31:06.621
Yeah, she does. Why?

31:06.829 --> 31:09.457
Doctor said there was a lot of that
in her system.

31:09.666 --> 31:12.210
Almost three times the normal dose.

31:12.418 --> 31:14.587
Maybe she lost track
on how much she took.

31:14.796 --> 31:16.923
You know, it happens.

31:17.131 --> 31:20.093
Well, why is she here in Hialeah?

31:20.301 --> 31:21.886
Where was she going?

31:24.055 --> 31:25.848
Debra drove here for an interview.

31:26.057 --> 31:28.518
A second interview with a woman,
Arlene Schram.

31:28.685 --> 31:32.897
Now, look, Dex, maybe I should've
told you this before now...

31:34.107 --> 31:35.441
...but Deb got a tip...

31:35.650 --> 31:40.905
...that this woman, Arlene Schram,
was a possible witness to a murder.

31:41.114 --> 31:44.117
A murder committed
by Hannah McKay.

31:45.326 --> 31:46.494
You should've told me.

31:46.661 --> 31:48.913
Debra has a bug up her ass
with this girl.

31:49.122 --> 31:52.875
Maybe that's why she took
all those anti-anxiety pills.

31:53.084 --> 31:56.838
Because she's convinced
that her brother is dating a killer.

32:00.133 --> 32:02.218
I don't know what happened.

32:02.927 --> 32:05.471
I was tired. I was driving.

32:06.514 --> 32:07.974
I kept getting sleepier.

32:08.182 --> 32:13.021
And, I don't know, I must have
closed my eyes for a second.

32:13.229 --> 32:17.275
- But the next thing I knew, I was--
- Hanging upside down in a ditch.

32:17.483 --> 32:20.320
Hanging by my seat belt.

32:21.404 --> 32:24.365
This is the most fucked-est
Christmas ever.

32:24.574 --> 32:27.410
And you were gonna spend it
with Arlene Schram.

32:29.787 --> 32:31.372
Hannah told you?

32:32.582 --> 32:34.208
Hannah knew?

32:34.417 --> 32:36.919
She was at my house yesterday...

32:37.128 --> 32:39.255
...asking me to back off.

32:40.173 --> 32:42.508
Arlene must've called
after I left her house.

32:42.717 --> 32:44.802
Hannah was at your house
yesterday?

32:46.262 --> 32:47.847
Yes.

32:51.893 --> 32:54.103
And now I'm here.

32:55.605 --> 32:58.941
- Fucking hell, Dexter. It's like--
- She didn't poison you.

32:59.150 --> 33:02.445
Well, I sure as shit didn't swallow
a handful of pills.

33:02.654 --> 33:07.033
The doctor said that it's possible
the drugs built up in your system.

33:07.700 --> 33:09.744
I took one.

33:10.787 --> 33:13.873
One. Last night.

33:14.290 --> 33:17.043
That drug has a short half-life.

33:19.462 --> 33:21.964
Gotta hand it to her.
That's a really good plan.

33:23.299 --> 33:27.178
Making it look I accidentally took
too much of a prescription that I have?

33:27.387 --> 33:28.888
It's not a hard drug to get.

33:29.097 --> 33:32.517
- How would she know you were on it?
- You must have mentioned it.

33:32.725 --> 33:34.894
I never did. No.

33:35.103 --> 33:38.022
That's the thing about people
that poison people.

33:38.231 --> 33:40.066
They're really fucking sneaky.

33:40.900 --> 33:45.613
So she what, poisoned you
while she was at your house last night?

33:45.822 --> 33:48.116
I didn't let her inside my house
last night.

33:48.324 --> 33:49.575
- Deb--
- I went for a run.

33:49.784 --> 33:52.578
Maybe she broke in after I left
or something.

33:52.787 --> 33:55.707
She broke into your house
and did what?

33:59.919 --> 34:02.797
- I don't know how she did it.
- Because she didn't.

34:03.005 --> 34:05.133
Fuck, this is what happened
to Sal Price.

34:05.341 --> 34:08.636
He got close to knowing the truth
about Hannah, she killed him.

34:08.803 --> 34:11.055
There's no proof
she killed Sal Price...

34:11.264 --> 34:13.558
...and no proof
that she poisoned you.

34:13.766 --> 34:16.269
Well, maybe we need
to find the proof.

34:22.942 --> 34:25.319
There's another explanation
for what happened.

34:25.528 --> 34:28.364
You took more of those pills
than you think you did.

34:28.573 --> 34:30.575
You've been under a lot of stress,
Deb.

34:31.159 --> 34:34.036
No shit, Sherlock.

34:35.246 --> 34:38.458
So you took one and you lost track.
You took another.

34:38.666 --> 34:42.086
And another.
It's possible. It happens.

34:42.295 --> 34:45.214
You have to admit that, right?

34:49.677 --> 34:53.055
<i>Deb's more right than she knows
about what happened to Sal Price.</i>

34:53.222 --> 34:55.808
<i>But Hannah wouldn't do that to Debra.</i>

34:57.101 --> 34:58.144
<i>Would she?</i>

35:04.609 --> 35:08.821
<i>I make my living at crime scenes,
proving what happened.</i>

35:10.531 --> 35:13.493
<i>But now can I prove
what didn't happen?</i>

35:14.410 --> 35:17.121
<i>Prove that Hannah
didn't poison Debra?</i>

35:44.524 --> 35:47.527
<i>Is this proof that Hannah was here?</i>

35:51.155 --> 35:53.241
<i>Did she break in?</i>

36:00.832 --> 36:04.085
<i>Or did she simply walk through
an open door?</i>

36:05.127 --> 36:09.006
<i>Or did this fall off me?
Did I track this in just now?</i>

36:09.674 --> 36:14.178
<i>The drug works quickly. Deb would've
passed out minutes after ingesting it.</i>

36:16.222 --> 36:18.307
Sorry for your loss.

36:19.016 --> 36:21.853
- No, my sister's doing fine.
- Yeah.

36:22.061 --> 36:24.981
Can't say the same thing
for this poor baby.

36:25.189 --> 36:27.817
You'll have to go in
through the passenger side.

36:58.097 --> 37:01.642
<i>I'll see what the lab has to say
about what's in this bottle.</i>

37:03.352 --> 37:04.979
<i>Hannah didn't poison Debra.</i>

37:05.187 --> 37:08.649
<i>All I want for Christmas
is for that to be true.</i>

37:14.196 --> 37:15.281
Merry Christmas Eve.

37:15.781 --> 37:18.451
We're having a Nochebuena
at the restaurant later.

37:18.910 --> 37:22.121
Auri will be there.
You should come by.

37:22.371 --> 37:26.459
Thank you, but I'm not up for it.

37:26.792 --> 37:29.670
Holidays, family, cheer.

37:29.879 --> 37:33.716
They're keeping Debra overnight
at the hospital. You should know that.

37:33.925 --> 37:34.967
I know.

37:38.846 --> 37:41.557
You wanna tell me
the real reason you're here?

37:44.060 --> 37:46.687
I've been thinking about
what's next for me.

37:46.896 --> 37:47.980
Yeah?

37:48.189 --> 37:51.317
I'm enjoying the restaurant,
even with all the headaches.

37:53.569 --> 37:55.404
It's real.

37:55.613 --> 37:57.365
Straightforward.

37:57.573 --> 38:00.451
You open up, you feed people...

38:00.660 --> 38:05.289
...you clean up, you close up,
then you go home.

38:05.498 --> 38:06.916
That's it. That's your day.

38:07.458 --> 38:09.877
You don't carry it with you.

38:10.252 --> 38:12.838
- Not like this job?
- No.

38:13.047 --> 38:16.300
And up until, I don't know...

38:16.509 --> 38:17.969
...Mike's death maybe...

38:18.803 --> 38:20.888
...it never got to me.

38:22.056 --> 38:24.141
It's time, isn't it?

38:25.393 --> 38:27.645
You ever think about what's next?

38:28.813 --> 38:31.232
Sometimes.

38:32.358 --> 38:35.111
I've been looking back a little too.

38:35.319 --> 38:40.116
You know, wondering
about some choices I've made...

38:40.324 --> 38:42.201
...wishing I'd made different ones.

38:42.410 --> 38:47.164
Are you talking about me?
Are you talking about you, about us?

38:47.373 --> 38:49.834
Are you wishing
that it would've worked out?

38:50.042 --> 38:51.377
No.

38:51.585 --> 38:52.962
No.

38:53.170 --> 38:55.381
Okay, just checking.

38:55.589 --> 38:59.552
So when are you retiring?

38:59.760 --> 39:02.138
Thought about putting papers in
on the first.

39:05.725 --> 39:07.852
Happy New Year.

39:08.811 --> 39:10.646
Let's hope.

39:13.649 --> 39:15.901
Dexter, hey.

39:17.403 --> 39:19.780
I was worried about you.

39:24.201 --> 39:26.537
- Look who's here.
- Daddy's home.

39:26.746 --> 39:31.000
Come here, bud. Oh, yeah.

39:32.043 --> 39:34.837
- Thanks for staying over tonight.
- My pleasure.

39:35.337 --> 39:38.174
Ever since I've gone vegetarian,
watching my brother...

39:38.382 --> 39:41.343
...roast a whole pig grosses me out.

39:41.552 --> 39:44.138
Besides, you guys are family too.

39:44.638 --> 39:45.931
Yeah, and so are you.

39:46.140 --> 39:47.183
How's Debra?

39:47.391 --> 39:49.143
Yeah, how's she doing?

39:49.351 --> 39:51.479
She's fine.
She should be out tomorrow.

39:51.687 --> 39:53.773
Oh, I'm glad to hear that.

39:53.981 --> 39:56.817
Well, I hope you're hungry, Dexter.

40:08.579 --> 40:11.082
<i>Look at her. So beautiful.</i>

40:22.259 --> 40:25.638
<i>But can you ever fully trust
a poisoner?</i>

40:32.019 --> 40:33.729
Okay, Dexter?

40:36.357 --> 40:37.650
Dexter.

40:37.858 --> 40:40.069
Earth to Dexter.

40:40.277 --> 40:42.571
I think your food coma's hitting
way early.

40:42.780 --> 40:44.573
- You're right.
- What do you want'?

40:44.782 --> 40:46.992
A little bit of everything.

40:49.286 --> 40:53.415
<i>Christmas is a time of expectation.
If you're good, a red-suited fat man...</i>

40:53.624 --> 40:56.168
<i>...will break into your house
and leave presents.</i>

40:56.710 --> 40:59.421
<i>But Santa Claus doesn't exist.</i>

40:59.630 --> 41:03.676
<i>The most wonderful time of the year
celebrates a lie.</i>

41:09.431 --> 41:12.810
<i>ls the future I imagine with Hannah
nothing more than a vision...</i>

41:13.018 --> 41:14.520
<i>...dancing in my head?</i>

41:28.784 --> 41:32.872
It's funny how we started off
in Santa's Holiday Adventure...

41:33.080 --> 41:37.001
...and here we are,
Christmas Eve together.

41:37.334 --> 41:40.296
A place I never thought I'd be
with anyone again...

41:40.504 --> 41:42.548
...much less you.

41:46.302 --> 41:47.928
Thanks.

41:48.429 --> 41:50.848
I'm not saying this quite right.

41:53.184 --> 41:55.144
All the men that I've been with...

41:55.352 --> 42:00.232
...there was a lot of running away.

42:01.192 --> 42:03.569
But when I'm with you...

42:03.819 --> 42:05.863
...I don't wanna go anywhere.

42:12.745 --> 42:15.080
Stay with me tonight.

42:16.040 --> 42:19.043
No, I can't. I have somewhere to be.

42:20.169 --> 42:21.754
Debra?

42:26.759 --> 42:28.636
Estrada?

42:32.014 --> 42:33.599
Good for you.

42:33.807 --> 42:36.227
He's somebody you've wanted
for a long time.

42:36.435 --> 42:38.938
Someone I thought I'd never get.

42:39.271 --> 42:43.734
I imagine that will be
deeply satisfying.

42:51.825 --> 42:54.453
When Deb had her accident...

42:54.828 --> 42:58.332
...she was heading
to Arlene Schram's house.

43:03.921 --> 43:06.590
She was hoping Arlene
would give her a statement...

43:06.757 --> 43:08.634
...that would let her arrest you.

43:09.927 --> 43:13.305
But Deb never made it there.

43:14.098 --> 43:16.725
She blacked out behind the wheel.

43:22.356 --> 43:25.276
- Does that sound familiar?
- Familiar?

43:25.484 --> 43:26.527
Sal Price.

43:26.735 --> 43:30.489
It's what you hoped would happen
to him before you poisoned him.

43:33.951 --> 43:35.452
Are you...?

43:38.122 --> 43:41.375
Do you think that I had something to do
with Debra's accident?

43:44.044 --> 43:45.504
Did you?

43:46.463 --> 43:50.509
Oh, I can't believe you would
even think something like that.

43:52.845 --> 43:53.971
Say something.

43:54.138 --> 43:56.807
You will do whatever it takes
to protect yourself.

43:57.016 --> 43:58.600
That does not include
trying to poison your sister.

43:58.809 --> 44:02.730
You yourself told me Arlene saw you
poison that counsellor's coffee.

44:02.938 --> 44:06.317
And I can't tell you how many times
I saw Arlene shoot up.

44:06.525 --> 44:10.195
I was nervous about what she could do,
but then I went to see her...

44:10.404 --> 44:11.822
...and she's a mess...

44:12.031 --> 44:15.617
...that any law student could discredit.
She's not a threat to me.

44:26.295 --> 44:28.297
But Deb is.

44:28.630 --> 44:30.883
Do you think I would be that stupid...

44:31.091 --> 44:34.094
...to try and poison
the lieutenant of Homicide?

44:35.596 --> 44:38.891
And to think
that you wouldn't figure it out?

44:39.099 --> 44:42.686
Wouldn't exactly bring us
closer together, would it?

44:47.566 --> 44:49.651
You know I love you, right?

44:50.152 --> 44:51.695
Yes.

44:52.905 --> 44:54.990
Do you love me?

44:56.200 --> 44:57.951
Yes.

45:00.204 --> 45:03.082
I don't know if I believe you.

45:03.290 --> 45:06.710
You were at her house last night.

45:06.919 --> 45:10.798
I thought if she knew how much I cared
then she would back down a little.

45:11.006 --> 45:13.217
But she never will.

45:14.009 --> 45:16.678
What happens next week
when Deb has a heart attack?

45:16.887 --> 45:18.138
Do you hear yourself?

45:18.347 --> 45:21.975
If anything happens, I'll wonder
if you had something to do with it.

45:22.184 --> 45:24.561
Well, that's your problem,
your lack of trust.

45:24.770 --> 45:26.772
Your inability to trust.

45:26.980 --> 45:28.232
God, it's like...

45:28.440 --> 45:31.068
It's like you have something
deep inside of you...

45:31.276 --> 45:33.987
...that you think is undeserving
of love.

45:34.196 --> 45:36.907
- Don't turn this back on me.
- You're accusing me.

45:37.116 --> 45:40.244
I ju-- I know what you're capable of.

45:46.250 --> 45:50.254
Okay, I'm not sure
quite how to say this...

45:53.340 --> 45:55.175
...but I've never made a mistake.

45:57.719 --> 46:01.140
If I had poisoned Debra,
then she would be dead.

46:01.348 --> 46:04.059
If you know me
the way that you say that you do...

46:04.268 --> 46:06.061
...then you know that that's true.

46:10.858 --> 46:13.819
Maybe it all was just an accident.

46:16.488 --> 46:20.200
It must have been really scary
to see her in the hospital like that.

46:20.409 --> 46:22.327
It was.

46:23.495 --> 46:26.081
It's understandable
you would try to make sense...

46:26.248 --> 46:29.001
...of a situation
that doesn't make sense...

46:29.460 --> 46:32.629
...but you're doing that
at the expense of this relationship.

46:32.838 --> 46:35.340
I'm not trying to. I...

46:36.258 --> 46:38.218
I don't wanna lose you.

46:38.427 --> 46:39.887
I'm sure about you.

46:41.805 --> 46:43.807
I'm 100-percent sure...

46:44.016 --> 46:47.561
...but you need to be able
to say the same thing about me.

46:48.145 --> 46:49.813
I know.

46:51.940 --> 46:54.359
We could have it all.

46:58.780 --> 47:02.034
I think you need to figure out
what it is that you want...

47:03.702 --> 47:06.580
...and what type of future
you wanna have.

48:03.011 --> 48:05.013
It's right in here.

48:09.017 --> 48:11.395
What the fuck is this, huh?
Where's the stuff?

48:11.603 --> 48:12.938
Fuck.

48:23.240 --> 48:25.158
Estrada.

48:26.076 --> 48:27.911
Estrada.

48:30.163 --> 48:32.583
Estrada, it's time.

48:34.543 --> 48:37.212
The Department of Corrections
kept that for you.

48:37.421 --> 48:39.631
That was very thoughtful.

48:41.174 --> 48:44.678
You've changed a lot
in the past 40 years.

48:45.220 --> 48:47.097
So have I.

48:48.807 --> 48:50.976
Three men murdered my mother.

48:51.476 --> 48:54.271
Juan Pablo Aliso,
shot in another deal.

48:54.479 --> 48:55.814
Santos Jimenez.

48:56.023 --> 48:59.067
You remember him.
He testified against you.

49:00.152 --> 49:03.947
I cut him into six roughly-equal pieces
with a chain saw.

49:04.156 --> 49:06.617
Just like he did my mother.

49:07.200 --> 49:08.619
Like I'm gonna do to you.

49:08.827 --> 49:11.204
Holy fuck, you're Dickie Moser.

49:11.413 --> 49:14.666
Dexter Moser.

49:21.632 --> 49:24.092
I am Dexter Moser.

49:24.301 --> 49:25.594
And I'm gonna kill you.

49:25.802 --> 49:27.929
Is that what all this is about?

49:28.138 --> 49:32.392
I was 3 years old
when you left me in that container.

49:34.353 --> 49:36.772
Who am I gonna be
when you're dead?

49:36.980 --> 49:40.359
Still some fucking freak, probably.

49:41.818 --> 49:43.654
We'll see.

49:52.037 --> 49:54.456
You're working with her, aren't you?

49:56.166 --> 49:57.626
What?

49:58.210 --> 50:01.838
That fucking cop bitch,
the one who got me out.

50:02.047 --> 50:04.758
Oh, yeah, they said
that there was a big push...

50:04.966 --> 50:08.804
...for my release
from the captain of Miami Metro.

50:09.888 --> 50:11.390
LaGuerta?

50:11.598 --> 50:13.934
She fucking set me up.

50:14.351 --> 50:16.853
You're not the one who was set up.

50:18.313 --> 50:19.523
Officer.

50:19.731 --> 50:21.692
We followed him here,
but we lost him.

50:21.900 --> 50:24.653
Till we heard the gunshot.
That's when we called you.

50:24.820 --> 50:26.822
- All right. Anything else since?
- No.

50:26.988 --> 50:28.407
Show me where.

50:55.809 --> 50:57.561
What is going on in this place?

50:57.769 --> 51:02.274
Keep looking for Estrada and anyone
else with him. Estrada's not alone.

51:12.659 --> 51:15.245
Don't make a fucking sound.

51:24.379 --> 51:26.548
Around the other side.

51:41.146 --> 51:45.484
<i>It wasn't the universe giving me a gift.
It was LaGuerta.</i>

52:05.462 --> 52:08.048
<i>I can make sure one member
of the Morgan family...</i>

52:08.256 --> 52:10.217
<i>...has a good Christmas.</i>

52:18.809 --> 52:19.851
Yes.

52:20.060 --> 52:24.105
<i>It's Sergio. You told me to call you
when I ran that water you brought in.</i>

52:24.272 --> 52:25.690
What'd you find?

52:25.899 --> 52:27.943
<i>That water's like
40 percent alprazolam.</i>

52:28.151 --> 52:29.778
<i>That's an anti-anxiety drug.</i>

52:29.986 --> 52:32.531
<i>Someone must have wanted
to knock themselves out.</i>

52:32.739 --> 52:35.158
<i>But this time of year,
who can blame them?</i>

52:36.785 --> 52:39.120
<i>- Thanks.
- You got it.</i>

52:41.540 --> 52:42.916
<i>It was no accident.</i>

52:43.124 --> 52:45.502
<i>Hannah dissolved the pills
into Deb's water...</i>

52:45.710 --> 52:48.630
...so <i>that she'd pass out
behind the wheel.</i>

52:48.839 --> 52:52.133
<i>A problem in Hannah's life solved.</i>

52:53.218 --> 52:55.887
<i>Hannah poisoned Debra.</i>

52:56.721 --> 53:00.016
<i>It's not the future I had wanted
with Hannah...</i>

53:00.642 --> 53:03.353
<i>...but maybe it's what I deserve.</i>

53:15.991 --> 53:19.119
You barely said two words
on the ride home.

53:24.416 --> 53:26.710
I have something for you.

53:27.752 --> 53:29.504
A present?

53:30.046 --> 53:32.424
A new car, I hope.

53:34.259 --> 53:36.636
I guess it's a present.

53:38.513 --> 53:41.266
It's Sal Price's pen.

53:43.268 --> 53:46.938
If you test it, you'll find traces
of aconite on the end...

53:47.814 --> 53:50.025
...and Hannah's prints.

53:52.819 --> 53:55.280
So that's how she did it.

54:02.078 --> 54:05.665
I found it the next morning.
I kept it out of evidence.

54:07.918 --> 54:10.420
I can't believe
you're gonna turn her in.

54:14.299 --> 54:17.385
As long as she's free,
you're not safe.

54:20.388 --> 54:23.558
Dex, I know how hard this must be
for you.

54:42.827 --> 54:44.663
You're here.

54:49.334 --> 54:52.045
Does that mean
that you know what you want?

54:52.587 --> 54:54.172
Yes.

54:58.593 --> 55:03.014
- Hannah...
- You have to kiss me or it's bad luck.

55:17.612 --> 55:19.197
What's the matter?

55:20.532 --> 55:21.700
I'm sorry.

55:21.908 --> 55:23.785
Sorry?

55:32.085 --> 55:36.047
Hannah McKay, you're under arrest
for the murder of Sal Price.

55:47.225 --> 55:49.310
You should have killed me.

56:07.495 --> 56:11.166
<i>I should know better
than to count on the future.</i>

56:19.132 --> 56:22.177
<i>All you can ever believe in is now...</i>

56:22.802 --> 56:24.220
<i>...this moment.</i>

56:28.850 --> 56:30.852
<i>Because in a blink...</i>

56:31.061 --> 56:32.771
<i>...everything can change.</i>
