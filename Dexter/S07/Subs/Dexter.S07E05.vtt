00:10.475 --> 00:11.518
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

00:11.726 --> 00:13.144
Who is Dexter Morgan?

00:13.353 --> 00:16.940
He's just a jerk who works
for Miami Metro Homicide.

00:18.942 --> 00:20.902
- That's Dexter Morgan.
- His face...

00:21.111 --> 00:22.696
...it looks familiar.

00:23.530 --> 00:26.366
Only one person who worked
at Miami Metro took blood slides...

00:26.574 --> 00:29.619
...Sergeant Doakes,
the Bay Harbor Butcher.

00:33.498 --> 00:35.542
Same type of weapon
used on Mike Anderson.

00:35.750 --> 00:39.629
Are we sure this Alex Dubrozny guy
shot Mike Anderson?

00:39.838 --> 00:41.297
Because it smells like a setup.

00:41.923 --> 00:44.342
<i>Hannah McKay,
she spent six years in juvie...</i>

00:44.551 --> 00:47.053
<i>...after pleading guilty to being
Randall's accomplice.</i>

00:47.262 --> 00:50.390
<i>She always claimed she was just
another one of his victims.</i>

00:50.557 --> 00:53.184
That what you're doing,
to help us find the other bodies?

00:53.351 --> 00:55.437
My lawyer said it was for the best.

00:55.645 --> 00:58.565
<i>Do you understand your rights?</i>

00:58.773 --> 01:01.776
He didn't say, "Yes." He walked.

01:01.985 --> 01:06.030
- There is nothing we can do.
- Fuck that. Fuck all of this.

01:06.239 --> 01:08.199
<i>But there is something I can do.</i>

01:11.453 --> 01:12.954
That smoke.

01:13.830 --> 01:15.790
It's Speltzer.

01:16.666 --> 01:18.209
How do you feel?

01:19.919 --> 01:21.171
Glad.

01:22.130 --> 01:24.466
What does that make me?

03:20.456 --> 03:23.626
It never ends, does it?
The maintenance.

03:23.835 --> 03:25.378
I don't mind it.

03:25.587 --> 03:28.172
It's the one thing
that never changes.

03:28.381 --> 03:30.091
The waves keep rolling in...

03:30.300 --> 03:33.386
...wearing everything down
in their path a little more every day.

03:33.595 --> 03:36.055
Harrison's coming home.
I wanna have the boat ready.

03:36.264 --> 03:40.643
- So life's back to normal?
- A new normal.

03:41.561 --> 03:44.564
Deb's not poring over
the past anymore.

03:44.772 --> 03:48.151
We're on course, moving forward.

03:48.484 --> 03:50.403
Life can be less complicated now.

03:50.612 --> 03:51.821
You don't believe that.

03:52.030 --> 03:55.283
- Why not? She didn't abandon me.
- She didn't accept you either.

03:55.491 --> 03:58.995
- She doesn't know what to think.
- She's adjusting.

03:59.537 --> 04:03.541
I did everything in my power to protect
her from you, what you really are.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.169
- A monster?
- Your words.

04:06.377 --> 04:07.545
Your thoughts.

04:07.754 --> 04:11.883
You didn't think she could handle it
because you couldn't. Deb is stronger.

04:12.050 --> 04:13.676
For now.

04:13.885 --> 04:15.970
But the long-term exposure...

04:16.179 --> 04:21.059
...it's going to eat away at her,
like salt water on steel.

04:31.527 --> 04:32.862
Blood.

04:33.071 --> 04:36.491
It's not from Viktor.
I never leave a mess behind.

04:36.699 --> 04:38.076
Who's been on my boat?

04:48.920 --> 04:50.880
<i>This is too much blood.</i>

04:51.089 --> 04:53.007
<i>Someone died here.</i>

04:54.092 --> 04:56.302
<i>Someone I didn't kill.</i>

05:04.143 --> 05:05.937
<i>Who are you?</i>

05:07.772 --> 05:10.608
If I'm getting shit-canned
and you know something about it...

05:10.817 --> 05:13.152
...just give me a heads-up, all right?
We're bros.

05:17.865 --> 05:22.662
First of all, we are not
and never will be bros.

05:22.870 --> 05:27.333
Secondly, I've told you a million times,
I don't know anything.

05:27.542 --> 05:29.836
Really? Then why did your voice
just rise?

05:30.044 --> 05:31.963
Look, I took a class
in paralinguistics.

05:32.171 --> 05:34.716
Change in pitch,
dead giveaway for lying.

05:34.924 --> 05:37.051
Get away from my desk.

05:39.429 --> 05:42.348
- Am I getting the axe?
- You are if you don't get out of my way.

05:42.557 --> 05:46.394
I got off the phone and LaGuerta's
processing evidence at a private lab.

05:46.561 --> 05:47.812
What are you talking about?

05:48.021 --> 05:51.899
A charred blood slide containing
the blood of one Travis Marshall.

05:52.066 --> 05:54.902
I asked myself, "Vince, if your
boss is processing evidence...

05:55.111 --> 05:58.114
-...at another lab--"
- Blood slide? Are you certain?

05:58.322 --> 06:01.117
Increase in vocal volume,
indicating emotional dissonance.

06:01.325 --> 06:02.827
You know something. I'm fucked.

06:03.036 --> 06:05.371
I am sure that LaGuerta is using
an outside lab...

06:05.580 --> 06:08.041
...because she knows
how slammed you are.

06:08.249 --> 06:13.629
<i>- I'll</i> look into this, so just fucking relax.
- Okay. Thanks, LT. You rock.

06:18.676 --> 06:20.803
- Got a second?
- Sure.

06:21.971 --> 06:26.017
Masuka got wind that you're using
an outside lab to run evidence...

06:26.225 --> 06:29.729
...and he thinks he's gonna get fired.
ls there anything I should know?

06:29.937 --> 06:32.106
I needed a second pair of eyes
on something.

06:32.315 --> 06:34.067
It's nothing.

06:36.402 --> 06:39.947
Does this have anything to do
with the Bay Harbor Butcher?

06:41.657 --> 06:44.160
Lundy carried that notebook
everywhere he went.

06:45.620 --> 06:47.413
Get the door.

06:54.879 --> 06:57.507
This has to remain between
you and me.

06:57.715 --> 06:59.550
Of course.

07:00.343 --> 07:03.971
I had a lab analyse a blood slide
that I found at the abandoned church.

07:04.472 --> 07:07.141
A blood slide,
like a Bay Harbor Butcher trophy?

07:07.975 --> 07:09.894
Travis Marshall's blood was on it.

07:11.145 --> 07:13.815
Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher
and Doakes is dead.

07:14.023 --> 07:15.900
Well, what if it wasn't Doakes?

07:16.109 --> 07:18.861
What if the Bay Harbor Butcher
is still alive and at work?

07:19.070 --> 07:21.114
What if he killed Travis Marshall?

07:22.281 --> 07:27.245
Except Travis Marshall wasn't cut up
into pieces and put into bags.

07:27.453 --> 07:29.831
But the fact
that the Bay Harbor Butcher kept...

07:30.039 --> 07:32.834
...blood slides was never released
to the public.

07:33.042 --> 07:37.839
It's probably not some copycat.
How do you explain this?

07:39.298 --> 07:41.050
I can't.

07:41.259 --> 07:45.054
I know it sounds impossible but...

07:46.430 --> 07:49.058
...I never believed that Doakes
was a killer.

07:49.809 --> 07:52.562
And from his notes,
Lundy had his doubts too.

07:54.272 --> 07:56.691
Well, you can add me to that list.

07:57.191 --> 07:58.901
Doakes was my partner.

07:59.610 --> 08:01.070
He was a good man.

08:04.615 --> 08:06.909
Is there anything I can do to help?

08:09.412 --> 08:12.707
You have no idea how good it is
to hear you say that.

08:12.915 --> 08:16.043
I've been keeping this all to myself.

08:20.464 --> 08:22.758
Your eyes only.

08:23.676 --> 08:25.469
My eyes only.

08:39.150 --> 08:40.985
Fuck.

08:43.112 --> 08:44.655
Fuck.

08:46.657 --> 08:48.701
Motherfucking suck bag.

08:48.910 --> 08:53.122
You cock-munching,
fucking fuck nugget.

08:56.292 --> 08:58.044
Fuck.

09:07.803 --> 09:09.889
<i>The blood on my boat belongs</i> to...

09:10.806 --> 09:12.808
<i>...Louis Greene?</i>

09:13.017 --> 09:15.061
<i>Louis is dead?</i>

09:16.812 --> 09:18.147
<i>Why was he killed on my boat?</i>

09:18.356 --> 09:20.858
<i>Why would he have even been
on my boat?</i>

09:21.067 --> 09:22.610
<i>Why. .</i> .

09:22.818 --> 09:26.697
<i>-...Is my sister looking at</i> me <i>like that?</i>
- Dex.

09:31.285 --> 09:33.537
We are in a storm of fuck.

09:34.288 --> 09:37.041
LaGuerta found a slide
with Travis Marshall's blood on it...

09:37.250 --> 09:39.502
...at the fucking church.

09:42.088 --> 09:45.216
- That's not good.
- How the fuck do you lose a slide?

09:45.424 --> 09:49.262
Deb, you know that night
wasn't my usual scenario.

09:50.471 --> 09:52.473
Are you saying it's my fault...

09:52.640 --> 09:55.226
...LaGuerta thinks
the Bay Harbor Butcher is alive?

09:55.434 --> 09:59.021
No, that's not what I meant but...

09:59.230 --> 10:03.567
...that night at the church
wasn't exactly by the playbook.

10:04.235 --> 10:07.196
I talked LaGuerta into letting me help
with the investigation...

10:07.405 --> 10:09.323
...so I can keep tabs
on what's happening.

10:09.532 --> 10:12.618
You what? No.

10:12.827 --> 10:15.496
I'll deal with this.
I don't want you involved.

10:15.705 --> 10:18.708
Well, it's a little fucking late for that.

10:18.916 --> 10:22.420
She wants to talk to the friends
and family of everyone on this list...

10:22.628 --> 10:24.547
...who's gone missing
since Doakes died.

10:24.755 --> 10:28.718
They all the fit the victim profile
of the Bay Harbor Butcher.

10:28.926 --> 10:31.345
Anyone here that you recognise?

10:36.559 --> 10:40.187
These three are mine.

10:42.648 --> 10:44.275
This is never gonna end, is it?

10:44.483 --> 10:46.068
They were bad people, Deb...

10:46.235 --> 10:48.988
...who would've continued
to do bad things.

10:49.196 --> 10:53.617
This is the only one
with family in Miami: Phillip Barnes.

10:54.577 --> 10:56.537
So when LaGuerta and I
split up the list...

10:56.746 --> 10:58.372
...I'll make sure I get his family.

10:58.581 --> 11:01.792
- No, I don't like you doing this.
- I don't give a fuck...

11:02.001 --> 11:04.587
...what you like, Dexter.

11:05.254 --> 11:07.673
It's beyond that. This is my ass too.

11:09.925 --> 11:12.720
Tell me what I need to know
about Barnes.

11:17.058 --> 11:20.186
He was a wedding photographer.

11:21.771 --> 11:27.902
He would find a guest from out
of town. Young, female, by herself.

11:28.110 --> 11:30.946
He would charm her,
invite her back to his hotel.

11:33.115 --> 11:35.284
She'd never come home.

11:36.369 --> 11:39.163
He took pictures of what he did.

11:42.208 --> 11:44.293
So, what did you do?

11:45.836 --> 11:47.922
He was going out of town
for another job...

11:48.089 --> 11:51.717
...so I nabbed him after a reception.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.678
A reception?

11:55.388 --> 11:57.139
A fucking wedding reception?

11:58.140 --> 12:01.394
Dexter, what if Barnes
got a picture of you?

12:01.602 --> 12:04.480
- Deb, it was a wedding.
- What if someone remembers you?

12:04.688 --> 12:08.025
Everyone was concentrating on the
bride and groom. I slipped in and out.

12:08.234 --> 12:09.985
It's fine.

12:10.861 --> 12:14.115
- What if you're wrong?
- I'm not.

12:14.323 --> 12:19.120
LaGuerta will not tie me to this.
There's no body, no proof.

12:19.328 --> 12:21.497
Stay away from it, okay?

12:30.464 --> 12:34.427
<i>First thing I have to do is find out
why Louis was killed on my boat.</i>

12:35.719 --> 12:37.430
<i>My curtains are open.</i>

12:38.556 --> 12:40.641
<i>With Harrison gone,
Jamie is not around.</i>

12:40.850 --> 12:43.227
<i>Someone has been
in my apartment.</i>

12:43.436 --> 12:45.604
<i>Maybe still is.</i>

12:57.158 --> 12:58.742
<i>Hey, Dex. It's Sam.</i>

12:58.951 --> 13:02.788
<i>Just wanna confirm we're still on
for 1:00 at Schooner or Later...</i>

13:02.997 --> 13:08.127
...at 12th and Bayshore Drive.
See you there.

13:26.520 --> 13:29.064
<i>I've met him before at the bar
at The Fox Hole...</i>

13:29.273 --> 13:31.650
<i>...owned by the Koshka Brotherhood.</i>

13:31.859 --> 13:34.153
<i>The man who killed Mike Anderson,
Viktor Baskov...</i>

13:34.361 --> 13:35.988
<i>...was one of the Koshkas.</i>

13:36.197 --> 13:40.284
<i>Could they have figured out I killed
Viktor and sent a hit man after me?</i>

13:59.470 --> 14:00.513
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

14:00.721 --> 14:03.140
I think I have a phone call for you.

14:04.350 --> 14:06.602
A small coffee, please.

14:07.144 --> 14:10.648
<i>- Hello?
- Why were you in my apartment?</i>

14:11.482 --> 14:14.068
Well, aren't you Mr. Smarty-Pants?

14:14.276 --> 14:17.321
Answer the question.
What were you doing in my place?

14:17.530 --> 14:21.450
I was looking to have a discussion
about a friend who's gone missing.

14:21.659 --> 14:23.994
Viktor. I'm sure you remember him.

14:24.203 --> 14:26.038
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

14:26.247 --> 14:29.083
- I don't care for lies.
- I told you, I don't know who that is.

14:29.291 --> 14:30.918
You're wasting both our time.

14:31.126 --> 14:34.672
Louis Greene,
who I found on your boat...

14:34.880 --> 14:38.050
...the boat that was used
to dump Viktor in the ocean...

14:38.259 --> 14:42.137
-...gave me your name.
- So you killed Louis.

14:42.596 --> 14:46.350
We had a conversation
that ended rather abruptly, yes.

14:46.559 --> 14:48.394
What else did Louis say?

14:48.978 --> 14:52.064
I believe he may have referred
to you as a douche bag.

14:52.273 --> 14:55.442
- You think you're very clever.
- I do, actually, yes.

14:55.651 --> 14:57.653
Your bosses
at the Koshka Brotherhood...

14:57.820 --> 14:59.530
...they sent you?

15:00.531 --> 15:02.491
You've done your homework.

15:03.659 --> 15:05.619
There are no bosses telling me
what to do.

15:05.786 --> 15:07.913
Viktor was a friend of mine.
This is personal.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.540
So an eye for an eye, huh?

15:09.748 --> 15:12.251
Your friend Viktor kills
an innocent woman and a cop...

15:12.459 --> 15:15.004
...and killing me somehow
settles the score?

15:15.212 --> 15:16.755
Oh, you misunderstand me.

15:16.964 --> 15:19.049
I'm not stopping with you.

15:19.258 --> 15:22.970
I also want any of your police officer
friends involved in this little vendetta.

15:23.178 --> 15:25.764
- Wait.
-Including your lieutenant sister.

15:25.973 --> 15:27.725
I've done my homework too.

15:27.933 --> 15:30.144
It was just me.
She had nothing to do with this.

15:33.105 --> 15:34.148
Hello, handsome.

15:34.815 --> 15:36.066
I work alone.

15:36.275 --> 15:39.945
I killed Viktor, only me.
I'll see you around.

15:40.154 --> 15:41.864
That's the plan.

15:44.658 --> 15:47.870
Why in fuckville are you telling me
to meet you in the parking garage?

15:48.078 --> 15:49.747
Because of him.

15:49.955 --> 15:52.583
- Do you wanna be more specific?
- His name is Isaak Sirko.

15:52.791 --> 15:56.503
He's part of the Koshka Brotherhood.
He's after me.

15:56.712 --> 15:59.173
But don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of it.

15:59.381 --> 16:01.842
- What did you do?
- But you could be in danger too.

16:02.051 --> 16:04.720
That's why you need to know.
That's why we're meeting--

16:04.928 --> 16:06.805
- Dex.
- But I'm gonna handle this.

16:07.014 --> 16:09.016
Why is he after you?

16:10.309 --> 16:11.644
Viktor Baskov.

16:13.228 --> 16:15.981
Viktor Baskov disappeared.

16:19.401 --> 16:23.238
- You killed him.
- He killed Mike Anderson.

16:23.989 --> 16:25.991
What about the guy
that said he killed Mike?

16:26.158 --> 16:28.077
The bartender
that blew his brains out?

16:28.243 --> 16:30.663
Someone put him up to it,
Isaak probably.

16:30.871 --> 16:33.749
So that you would close the case
and move on.

16:33.957 --> 16:35.918
This is un-fucking-real.

16:36.126 --> 16:39.338
Viktor Baskov was on his way back
to Kiev. I had to kill him.

16:39.546 --> 16:41.256
I didn't have any time.
There wasn't--

16:41.465 --> 16:43.759
Time? You didn't have time
to make a phone call...

16:43.967 --> 16:46.011
...so that I could arrest him
or something?

16:46.220 --> 16:48.889
- His flight was leaving.
- His fl--

16:49.264 --> 16:50.891
How do you know he killed Mike?

16:53.352 --> 16:55.562
I found his fingerprint at the scene.

16:58.065 --> 16:59.983
And you didn't tell me?

17:01.068 --> 17:03.737
You kept it from
the Police Department?

17:06.949 --> 17:10.077
Dexter, what happened
to you only taking care of people...

17:10.285 --> 17:13.330
...that slip through the cracks
of the justice system?

17:13.539 --> 17:14.915
You can't rip a case open...

17:15.082 --> 17:18.502
-...so that it falls into your fucking lap.
- I know.

17:18.711 --> 17:22.881
Obviously you don't know, Dexter,
because this is normal for you.

17:23.090 --> 17:26.844
But trust me, this is not
fucking normal for me, not at all.

17:27.052 --> 17:28.804
How am I supposed to do my job?

17:29.012 --> 17:31.265
Which is the be-all, end-all
of hypocrisy...

17:31.432 --> 17:33.475
...because I am the lieutenant
of Homicide...

17:33.642 --> 17:37.229
...and I have already helped you
cover up two murders.

17:37.438 --> 17:39.064
Three. This makes three.

17:39.273 --> 17:43.819
And the fucking bartender.
Oh, my fucking God. Oh, my God.

17:44.236 --> 17:46.280
How did this become my life?

17:48.574 --> 17:50.909
- Deb, where are you going?
- I'm gonna arrest Isaak.

17:51.076 --> 17:52.661
- Take him to jail.
- On what charge?

17:52.828 --> 17:54.496
<i>- I'll</i> find something!
- No.

17:54.705 --> 17:59.835
We can't--
I can't afford to risk him talking.

18:01.378 --> 18:06.842
Look, I will handle this, but until I do,
we need to take extra precautions.

18:07.050 --> 18:11.054
Isaak is convinced
that there's some police conspiracy.

18:11.263 --> 18:15.434
He thinks we all killed Viktor,
so you're at risk too.

18:15.642 --> 18:18.729
- What?
- But I can keep you safe.

18:19.772 --> 18:21.273
We're gonna go to a hotel.

18:21.482 --> 18:23.734
A place where no one knows
who we are...

18:23.942 --> 18:27.529
...no one asks any questions,
a place where we'll both be safe.

18:27.738 --> 18:30.324
This is fucking fantastic.

18:30.532 --> 18:33.327
He might be watching the precinct,
your home.

18:33.535 --> 18:35.788
I need you to take a car
from the motor pool...

18:35.954 --> 18:38.123
...make sure you never
leave the same way twice.

18:38.332 --> 18:41.376
Make sure no one follows you.
I'll do the same.

18:41.877 --> 18:45.547
- I need you to promise me something.
- What?

18:45.756 --> 18:50.844
That you will never take a case
from the Police Department again...

18:51.053 --> 18:54.890
-...from me, ever.
- Okay.

18:55.474 --> 18:57.059
Are you lying to me?

18:57.601 --> 18:59.812
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so?

19:00.020 --> 19:03.148
- You don't fucking think so?
- I'm not lying.

19:04.733 --> 19:07.361
I have no way of knowing, do I?

19:19.456 --> 19:22.376
<i>When you begin a stalk,
you start with what you know.</i>

19:22.584 --> 19:25.754
<i>And with Isaak, that isn't much.</i>

19:45.315 --> 19:48.777
<i>Isaak isn't just some hit man.
He's a boss.</i>

20:00.414 --> 20:02.708
- Yes?
- Dexter, Hannah McKay...

20:02.875 --> 20:04.251
...is on her way in.

20:04.459 --> 20:06.753
I'm kind of tied up with something
right now.

20:06.962 --> 20:09.756
Dexter, Hannah is gonna
talk us through her road trip...

20:09.965 --> 20:12.801
...with Wayne Randall and help us
find the rest of the bodies.

20:13.010 --> 20:15.387
This is important. Get here now.

20:15.596 --> 20:18.140
Right. I'm on my way.

20:26.815 --> 20:27.858
In that first week...

20:28.066 --> 20:31.361
...Wayne shot a gas station attendant
in Ashford, Alabama.

20:31.570 --> 20:33.864
That's where these are from.

20:35.157 --> 20:40.037
And Wayne shot another attendant
in Lake City, Florida.

20:47.836 --> 20:51.089
And then he shot a guy outside
of Sarasota...

20:51.298 --> 20:54.259
...who stopped to help you fix a flat.

20:57.262 --> 21:01.934
You then get picked up in Miami
trying to sneak on board a cruise ship.

21:02.851 --> 21:04.811
That week you guys were in Miami...

21:05.812 --> 21:08.482
...that's the story we don't know.

21:08.690 --> 21:13.111
The people Wayne killed,
the bodies we'd like to find.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.156
It looks like it starts here.

21:18.992 --> 21:23.622
We got to Miami and
we were the only thing on the news.

21:23.830 --> 21:27.459
We were desperate.
No money, cops everywhere.

21:27.668 --> 21:30.087
Wayne decided that we would
hide out in the motels...

21:30.295 --> 21:33.674
...until we could make it
to that cruise ship.

21:36.468 --> 21:39.596
He killed people
so we could take their rooms.

21:42.182 --> 21:44.935
We buried the bodies close
to the motels.

21:45.143 --> 21:48.855
- Where were the motels?
- One was by a Frosty Swirl.

21:49.064 --> 21:52.275
- Wayne's favourite.
- That's where Ms. Dubois was found.

21:52.484 --> 21:55.529
- What about these?
- Those two go together.

21:55.737 --> 21:59.908
- Together?
- They were a couple.

22:00.117 --> 22:02.327
Husband and wife, I guess.

22:02.536 --> 22:05.831
- Where are they buried?
- Close to one of the ports.

22:06.039 --> 22:10.043
- I remember big ships unloading.
- And the motel?

22:10.669 --> 22:13.755
Small, one storey, I think...

22:13.964 --> 22:18.385
...I would recognise it, but so much
of that time is just a blur, you know?

22:20.887 --> 22:24.182
Everything changed in Miami.
Wayne, most of all.

22:25.017 --> 22:29.730
I was so scared.
I thought that he was gonna kill me.

22:29.938 --> 22:33.358
He forced me to dig those holes and
every time that I dug one of them...

22:33.567 --> 22:37.529
...I wasn't sure if I was digging
my own grave or not.

22:37.738 --> 22:41.074
I understand how difficult this is
for you, but if you'll excuse me...

22:41.283 --> 22:46.496
...I'm gonna get the ball rolling
on the next dig. Tomorrow if possible.

22:46.705 --> 22:48.832
Sure. I'd like to get this over with.

23:04.431 --> 23:07.684
<i>That toy isn't bringing back
memories of being scared.</i>

23:07.893 --> 23:09.770
<i>She's nostalgic.</i>

23:09.978 --> 23:11.855
No touching.

23:16.693 --> 23:19.237
Can I have your giraffe back,
please?

23:20.572 --> 23:22.908
It's Wayne's.

23:23.283 --> 23:24.910
Wayne's giraffe.

23:25.118 --> 23:27.537
It was wrapped in your shirt.

23:28.705 --> 23:31.124
What, are you a detective now too?

23:37.130 --> 23:40.050
Sergeant Batista will give you
the details for tomorrow.

23:42.260 --> 23:44.012
Will you be there?

23:47.182 --> 23:48.975
I hope so.

23:57.943 --> 24:01.947
<i>Killing Isaak would make
a lot of Koshkas very angry.</i>

24:06.409 --> 24:08.829
<i>But a lot of Colombians very happy.</i>

24:09.037 --> 24:12.999
The goddamn shower has
two settings, scalding and freezing.

24:13.208 --> 24:15.877
It's a cheap motel. That's the point.

24:17.045 --> 24:18.839
I'm not doing this another night.

24:19.381 --> 24:22.259
Hopefully you won't have to.

24:22.467 --> 24:25.178
Does that mean
you're working on a solution?

24:25.387 --> 24:28.515
I have a plan, yes.

24:29.099 --> 24:31.059
Does it involve you killing someone?

24:33.562 --> 24:35.939
I'm not killing anybody.

24:39.359 --> 24:41.194
That's my bed.

24:42.028 --> 24:43.989
Closest to the door.

24:53.165 --> 24:56.501
- Tell me your plan.
- No.

24:56.960 --> 25:01.173
Dexter, I'm hiding out in this
fucking motel room. I'm a part of this.

25:01.381 --> 25:04.134
But not any more
than you need to be.

25:12.726 --> 25:15.562
This is not how I ever imagined
spending tonight.

25:16.563 --> 25:19.107
We've stayed in hotel rooms before.

25:22.652 --> 25:26.031
Yeah, when we went to Myrtle Beach
to visit Mom's sister.

25:28.366 --> 25:32.495
There were seashells embedded
in the plaster in the walls.

25:34.164 --> 25:37.876
No air-conditioning, just ceiling fans.

25:38.084 --> 25:40.962
There was sand
from the beach everywhere.

25:41.171 --> 25:43.256
Even in the beds.

25:46.718 --> 25:49.387
You kept your eyes on me all day.

25:51.431 --> 25:53.767
I didn't want you to drown.

25:59.231 --> 26:01.483
You were my hero.

26:11.243 --> 26:13.703
Good boy. Good.

26:17.624 --> 26:19.709
Hot as hell out here...

26:19.876 --> 26:22.420
...even with the ocean breeze.

26:23.421 --> 26:25.548
Think we'll find anything?

26:26.591 --> 26:29.052
The motel Hannah and Wayne
stayed at is still here.

26:29.261 --> 26:34.516
Nothing's changed much
since their spree.

26:34.724 --> 26:36.559
Pretty good odds.

26:41.439 --> 26:43.400
Can I ask you something?

26:45.860 --> 26:50.907
This bartender who shot himself,
Alex Dubrozny.

26:53.076 --> 26:55.120
Do you think it's a suicide?

26:55.996 --> 26:59.124
Masuka matched his handwriting
to the note he left.

26:59.332 --> 27:01.918
His fingerprints were on the gun,
GSR on the hand.

27:02.127 --> 27:03.670
He definitely pulled the trigger.

27:07.465 --> 27:09.217
Fucking bugs.

27:11.136 --> 27:13.722
I'm gonna go get some spray
from the car.

27:18.810 --> 27:20.937
This part of the job?

27:22.397 --> 27:23.815
Stand around and stare?

27:24.024 --> 27:27.319
I'm not needed unless
there's a body or blood.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.447
I don't know how you do it.

27:31.323 --> 27:36.369
First time Wayne killed somebody,
he shot him right in the chest and I...

27:37.370 --> 27:42.042
I couldn't move. Never seen
that much blood in my life.

27:45.211 --> 27:46.796
First crime scene I ever worked...

27:47.005 --> 27:51.217
...a woman stabbed her husband
after fixing him a sandwich.

27:51.384 --> 27:54.012
By the time I got there,
he looked like he was asleep...

27:54.179 --> 27:59.934
...just floating on a sea of red
and the sandwich next to his head.

28:01.019 --> 28:03.855
Seemed so sad
that no one was gonna eat it.

28:05.732 --> 28:08.360
Look at us talking blood and gore
like we're on a date...

28:08.568 --> 28:11.112
...sharing our
first sexual experience.

28:15.575 --> 28:17.202
I've got work to do.

28:25.502 --> 28:26.920
There you are.

28:27.087 --> 28:29.339
Aren't you supposed to be talking
to the Connors?

28:29.506 --> 28:31.174
They were less than cooperative.

28:31.383 --> 28:35.178
This was on my way back
to the station, so I thought I'd sit in.

28:35.387 --> 28:37.138
Great.

28:43.395 --> 28:46.231
Hi. I'm Captain Maria LaGuerta,
Miami Metro...

28:46.398 --> 28:48.191
...and this is
Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.485
I talked to your morn, Patricia.
Is she home?

28:50.693 --> 28:52.821
No, sorry.
She got called into work.

28:53.029 --> 28:56.533
- Oh, we'll come back.
- Is this about my dad?

28:56.741 --> 28:58.451
She said you guys had called.

28:58.660 --> 29:00.954
I could try to answer any questions,
if you want.

29:01.162 --> 29:05.041
- That would be very helpful.
- Yeah.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.462
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

29:12.715 --> 29:14.801
When was the last time
you saw your father?

29:15.635 --> 29:20.515
May 19th, 2007.
The best fucking day of my life.

29:21.307 --> 29:22.725
How so?

29:23.643 --> 29:25.395
Because he never came back.

29:26.646 --> 29:29.315
So wasn't it hard growing up
without a father?

29:29.482 --> 29:31.860
It was a lot better
than growing up with a father...

29:32.026 --> 29:34.154
...who beat me and my mom
every chance he got.

29:35.613 --> 29:36.739
I'm sorry.

29:36.948 --> 29:39.284
Then one night,
he didn't come home.

29:39.492 --> 29:41.619
I swear everything got better.

29:41.828 --> 29:44.289
My morn wasn't crying all the time...

29:44.497 --> 29:47.083
...and I wasn't constantly looking
over my shoulder.

29:47.292 --> 29:49.794
Ty, you mentioned the last time
you saw your father...

29:50.003 --> 29:51.629
...he was working a wedding?

29:51.838 --> 29:55.008
Yeah, my mom printed out some
pictures for you from that night.

29:55.216 --> 29:57.510
- She thought you might want them.
- Great.

30:00.972 --> 30:03.766
What are you hoping
to find in these pictures?

30:03.975 --> 30:05.685
Special Agent Lundy
had this theory...

30:05.852 --> 30:08.480
...that the Bay Harbor Butcher
was in law enforcement.

30:08.688 --> 30:10.398
If Barnes was killed by the Butcher--

30:10.607 --> 30:12.484
His face might be
in one of the pictures.

30:12.650 --> 30:15.904
We might even know him. Or her.

30:19.824 --> 30:21.075
- Would you mind?
- Yeah, no.

30:27.665 --> 30:28.958
Okay.

30:33.505 --> 30:35.340
What are you looking for exactly?

30:35.548 --> 30:38.218
We think your father
may have been abducted...

30:38.426 --> 30:40.428
...and murdered
the night he disappeared...

30:40.637 --> 30:43.556
...and the person responsible
could be in these pictures.

30:45.517 --> 30:48.269
Mom would finally know
he's not coming home.

30:48.478 --> 30:51.356
This is a big wedding.
A lot of pictures.

30:51.564 --> 30:54.984
You know, maybe I should
take these back to the station...

30:55.193 --> 30:57.612
...and spend the day
going over them.

31:01.449 --> 31:03.201
You're right.

31:03.409 --> 31:04.911
We shouldn't rush this.

31:05.119 --> 31:08.081
Thank you, Ty. Thanks.

31:10.250 --> 31:12.460
Right here. Put it down.

31:19.050 --> 31:21.010
Go ahead, detective.

31:28.434 --> 31:32.188
"Till death do us part"
didn't quite work out for these guys.

31:32.814 --> 31:36.359
Get it? Because they're dead
but they're still together.

31:36.568 --> 31:38.069
Okay, moving on.

31:38.278 --> 31:42.490
Shower curtain helped preserve
the bodies and the clothes.

31:42.699 --> 31:44.701
Our lucky day.

31:51.749 --> 31:55.295
It's a safe assumption
that Wayne started with the male.

31:55.461 --> 31:59.007
Would've been important
to immobilise him first...

31:59.882 --> 32:02.802
...because he presented
the biggest threat.

32:03.011 --> 32:05.430
There are defensive wounds
on the arms and the hands.

32:05.638 --> 32:06.764
He put up a fight.

32:06.973 --> 32:09.851
Judging from the cuts in the fabric...

32:10.059 --> 32:12.979
...we're looking at perhaps
a 6-inch knife.

32:13.605 --> 32:16.232
Numerous shallow wounds...

32:16.441 --> 32:21.696
...until Wayne was able to inflict this,
the fatal wound.

32:22.447 --> 32:23.781
Once he was done with him...

32:26.034 --> 32:29.287
...he moved on to the female victim.

32:31.331 --> 32:32.957
Stabbed numerous times.

32:34.208 --> 32:39.505
The spatter pattern suggests
the victim fell on her back.

32:39.714 --> 32:43.760
And these voids here
likely indicate that...

32:43.968 --> 32:45.970
...she was straddled
by her assailant.

32:46.179 --> 32:49.098
<i>Who was much smaller
than Wayne.</i>

32:49.682 --> 32:51.517
<i>If Wayne didn't kill this person...</i>

32:57.440 --> 32:59.192
Dexter.

32:59.942 --> 33:01.694
What does it mean?

33:02.695 --> 33:04.697
I'm not sure.
It could mean a lot of things.

33:04.906 --> 33:08.701
I won't know until I get back to the lab
and run some tests.

33:11.079 --> 33:13.039
I guess we're done here.

33:26.094 --> 33:29.764
- Why did you stop?
- Stop what?

33:29.972 --> 33:32.517
You started to describe
how Wayne killed that girl...

33:32.725 --> 33:36.729
...and you got halfway through
and then you stopped.

33:36.938 --> 33:38.606
Yeah, I did.

33:39.315 --> 33:43.403
- And then you looked right at me.
- I did.

33:43.611 --> 33:45.113
Why?

33:46.531 --> 33:50.785
The spatter told me a story
that conflicts what you say happened.

33:51.911 --> 33:53.705
Really?

33:54.205 --> 33:55.957
How so?

33:58.835 --> 34:00.920
How did you get this?

34:02.213 --> 34:06.426
It's a little something I got
for talking back to Wayne.

34:07.760 --> 34:11.639
- He got angry and slashed at me.
- Bullshit.

34:12.181 --> 34:16.602
- Do you know something that I don't?
- Wayne didn't kill that woman.

34:16.811 --> 34:20.356
He was too busy with the male.
It was someone smaller.

34:20.565 --> 34:27.530
Someone with a different knife
who was inexperienced.

34:28.072 --> 34:30.908
Got carried away
with the frenzy of the moment.

34:31.117 --> 34:34.078
Stabbed the woman over and over
until the knife got so bloody...

34:34.287 --> 34:38.082
...her hand slipped along the edge
of the sharp blade...

34:38.291 --> 34:42.295
...cutting her palm very deeply,
exactly like yours...

34:42.503 --> 34:47.467
...leaving a passive spatter stain
on the victim's dress.

34:49.135 --> 34:51.721
Everything you said is a lie.

34:54.474 --> 34:56.726
That's my story.

34:56.934 --> 34:59.687
And I'm sticking to it.

34:59.896 --> 35:02.398
And you don't even care.

35:05.651 --> 35:06.986
You have immunity, don't you?

35:07.195 --> 35:11.240
The DA gave you immunity
for cooperating with us.

35:11.449 --> 35:16.579
From any crime committed
with Wayne, yeah. Yeah.

35:17.205 --> 35:19.582
A girl's gotta protect herself.

35:21.918 --> 35:25.421
I'll see you around, Dexter Morgan.

35:44.315 --> 35:48.110
<i>Isaak. I knew
you would show up eventually.</i>

36:19.308 --> 36:22.436
<i>Don't worry. I'm not gonna lose you.</i>

36:56.888 --> 36:58.806
<i>Welcome to the wrong side of town,
Isaak.</i>

37:08.649 --> 37:11.027
<i>Not used to strangers here.</i>

37:11.319 --> 37:12.862
Koshkas.

37:13.029 --> 37:16.699
<i>And certainly not used
to their sworn enemies walking in.</i>

37:17.867 --> 37:22.538
<i>But Isaak, being from out of town,
won't know any of this.</i>

37:56.364 --> 38:00.242
<i>Definitely not as much fun as
putting Isaak on my table.</i>

38:00.785 --> 38:02.286
<i>But it does mask his death...</i>

38:02.495 --> 38:05.915
...as <i>the resulting war
between rival heroin dealers.</i>

38:08.960 --> 38:11.462
Who's saving whose ass now?

38:25.226 --> 38:26.852
- What's up?
- I know you're busy.

38:27.061 --> 38:30.022
I also want you to know
that I'm not trying to stir up any shit.

38:30.231 --> 38:31.774
Of course not.

38:33.109 --> 38:36.195
It's about this
Alex Dubrozny suicide.

38:41.450 --> 38:44.161
There's something about this guy
being Anderson's killer...

38:44.370 --> 38:45.955
...that's just not right.

38:47.915 --> 38:49.291
Sorry. It's Dispatch.

38:50.001 --> 38:51.877
Sergeant Batista.

38:55.965 --> 38:58.718
Okay. Got it.

38:58.926 --> 39:00.469
Gonna have to rain check this.

39:00.678 --> 39:03.681
Homicide at a Colombian hangout.

39:03.889 --> 39:05.599
Got blood, Dexter.

39:05.808 --> 39:07.601
- Where we going?
- Mateo's Bar.

39:07.810 --> 39:10.229
- Know it?
- Nope.

39:11.605 --> 39:13.524
I'll meet you there.

39:18.070 --> 39:20.156
Holy shit.

39:22.658 --> 39:25.745
It's like somebody turned on the hose
and sprayed blood everywhere.

39:25.953 --> 39:26.996
Great.

39:27.204 --> 39:30.791
<i>I left Isaak here outnumbered
and expected to find only his body.</i>

39:31.000 --> 39:33.586
<i>So where is he now?</i>

39:33.794 --> 39:35.504
Do we know these guys?

39:35.713 --> 39:39.884
This is Andres Rodriguez.
He's a member of the Rojas Cartel.

39:40.092 --> 39:42.928
We ran into each other a few times
when I worked Narcotics.

39:43.137 --> 39:45.056
<i>Is it possible Isaak did all of this?</i>

39:45.264 --> 39:48.100
Why do drug hits
have to be so messy?

39:48.309 --> 39:49.935
You gotta make a big show.

39:50.144 --> 39:53.814
Who you think is good for this?
The 87's?

39:54.774 --> 39:58.402
- Or the Koshka Brotherhood.
- Koshkas?

40:01.655 --> 40:03.199
What happened here, Dex?

40:06.494 --> 40:08.662
Considering this one
was closest to the door...

40:08.871 --> 40:13.250
...he's probably first to see
the attacker, first to respond.

40:13.459 --> 40:16.420
<i>He drew his gun
as the attacker fired.</i>

40:20.382 --> 40:21.717
<i>The misting on the jukebox...</i>

40:21.926 --> 40:26.639
...and the wall indicates multiple
bullet hits all through and through.

40:29.266 --> 40:32.812
- Victim number two.
- Looks like he got a shot off.

40:36.649 --> 40:39.401
But, that didn't stop the assault.

40:39.610 --> 40:41.737
The attacker returned fire.

40:50.871 --> 40:54.375
Twice in the chest,
once in the stomach.

40:54.583 --> 40:57.336
Judging from the lack of pooling
around the body suggests...

40:57.503 --> 41:00.131
...that the victim was dead
before the third shot.

41:00.339 --> 41:03.717
Wait. How many people
were here shooting?

41:05.010 --> 41:07.096
There's only evidence of one killer.

41:08.472 --> 41:12.726
- One brutally efficient killer.
- Jesus, fuck.

41:17.648 --> 41:21.235
Looks like our attacker
ran out of bullets right around here.

41:30.244 --> 41:32.288
It's from a defensive wound.

41:32.496 --> 41:36.667
Looks like it was a deep cut,
forearm maybe.

41:36.876 --> 41:38.752
Obviously not fatal.

41:41.297 --> 41:45.509
<i>The attacker grabbed the nearest
weapon, hit his victim over the head...</i>

41:45.718 --> 41:50.181
<i>...inflicted a massive skull fracture...</i>

41:54.852 --> 41:58.522
...and walked right out the door.

41:58.731 --> 42:00.983
So, we're looking
for the fucking Terminator.

42:04.361 --> 42:06.530
Let's get the blood
running through the system.

42:06.739 --> 42:09.825
Maybe we can match it to a name.

42:10.034 --> 42:13.662
Everybody outside. Let's let Dexter
and Masuka do their thing.

42:13.871 --> 42:17.249
Sarge, you mind
if I run an errand real quick?

42:23.047 --> 42:24.757
Was this part
of your fantastic plan?

42:24.965 --> 42:26.842
I never said my plan was fantastic...

42:27.051 --> 42:30.554
...but no, this is not
how I thought it would go.

42:30.763 --> 42:33.974
Do we have an even bigger problem
on our hands now?

42:34.183 --> 42:36.185
Not if we can find a match
for this blood.

42:36.393 --> 42:37.978
You'll be able to make an arrest.

42:38.896 --> 42:40.314
The sooner the better.

42:41.982 --> 42:44.318
<i>I couldn't agree more.</i>

42:48.280 --> 42:50.449
Right here, baby.

42:54.453 --> 42:56.580
Your car is fixed.
You have to start using it.

42:56.789 --> 42:58.666
But I like having a chauffeur.

42:58.874 --> 43:01.669
Come on.
Let me show you how much I like it.

43:01.877 --> 43:04.088
I wish I could, but I have work to do.

43:04.296 --> 43:06.674
Oh, just forget about work.

43:11.136 --> 43:13.180
We're gonna have to
fucking pay them back.

43:13.347 --> 43:15.391
I'll get some guys,
do it myself if you want.

43:15.557 --> 43:17.142
- No.
- Well, they're sure as shit...

43:17.309 --> 43:19.103
...gonna come after us.

43:19.270 --> 43:21.647
And we can't sit around
and do nothing.

43:22.189 --> 43:24.024
Shit.

43:24.650 --> 43:27.236
We don't need a cop here now.

43:28.612 --> 43:30.864
- Who is he?
- Joey Quinn.

43:31.073 --> 43:33.784
He came up from Narcotics,
and now he's Homicide.

43:33.993 --> 43:36.328
We used to have
an understanding with him.

43:36.537 --> 43:37.997
What kind of understanding?

43:38.205 --> 43:41.417
Leave a bag of cash in his car,
and he'd do whatever we asked.

43:41.625 --> 43:44.253
Mostly just look the other way.

44:20.873 --> 44:22.583
Fuck.

44:52.988 --> 44:54.448
Well?

45:15.010 --> 45:17.012
Lieutenant,
are the cuffs necessary?

45:18.555 --> 45:20.224
Probably not.

45:20.432 --> 45:23.310
Would your client
like to have a little chat with us?

45:23.519 --> 45:25.062
My client has nothing to say.

45:25.270 --> 45:27.773
He's exercising
his American right to silence.

45:27.981 --> 45:31.860
Well, fucking God bless America.
Get this guy to Booking.

45:32.069 --> 45:35.072
Your client's going to jail
for the rest of his life.

45:36.949 --> 45:39.743
Nice to meet you,
Lieutenant Morgan.

45:45.541 --> 45:47.835
<i>Maybe now that lsaak's behind bars,
we can have...</i>

45:48.043 --> 45:50.712
<i>...that face-to-face
he's been so desperate for.</i>

46:01.807 --> 46:04.601
So you got Isaak Sirko.

46:04.810 --> 46:07.646
We got Isaak Sirko.

46:07.855 --> 46:10.566
Congratulations. It's a big deal.

46:15.612 --> 46:17.030
May I?

46:26.707 --> 46:29.585
- Our earlier conversation.
- Right.

46:29.793 --> 46:34.256
I don't think Alex Dubrozny
shot Mike Anderson.

46:35.466 --> 46:36.967
It doesn't make any sense.

46:37.176 --> 46:39.303
Alex has been in this country
for two years...

46:39.511 --> 46:42.055
...and according to every stripper
I interviewed...

46:42.264 --> 46:45.267
...all he talked about
was his wife and his kids.

46:45.476 --> 46:48.854
He didn't show
any interest towards Kaja.

46:49.062 --> 46:51.982
I think someone put Alex up to this.

46:52.191 --> 46:55.527
Someone connected to Isaak Sirko.

46:55.736 --> 47:01.033
Deb, I still think Viktor Baskov
killed Mike Anderson...

47:01.241 --> 47:03.368
...and Viktor just disappeared
into thin air.

47:03.577 --> 47:05.871
- But if we can find--
- Sergeant.

47:07.998 --> 47:11.335
- Your dedication is admirable.
- Deb, you don't have to talk like that.

47:11.543 --> 47:12.753
-It's--
- And a year ago...

47:12.961 --> 47:16.632
...I might have been right beside you,
fighting for what I thought was right.

47:17.299 --> 47:20.219
But the hardest lesson
that I've learned as lieutenant...

47:20.427 --> 47:22.971
...is knowing when
to back the fuck down.

47:25.807 --> 47:28.435
You don't believe me?

47:28.644 --> 47:31.313
You don't have concrete evidence
to support your theory.

47:31.522 --> 47:33.899
And I can't afford to reopen
a murder investigation.

47:34.107 --> 47:36.527
This isn't any murder investigation.
This is Mike.

47:36.735 --> 47:38.403
- He--
- Mike's killer's dead.

47:41.448 --> 47:43.492
Mike got justice.

47:46.203 --> 47:47.871
Let it go.

47:49.540 --> 47:51.416
That's an order.

47:59.341 --> 48:01.510
Okay, lieutenant.

48:02.302 --> 48:04.054
You got it.

48:45.554 --> 48:48.682
- Hello, Isaak.
- Hello, Dexter.

48:48.890 --> 48:51.018
I underestimated you.

48:51.226 --> 48:52.728
You come here to taunt me?

48:52.936 --> 48:54.521
I thought maybe you could help me.

48:54.688 --> 48:59.109
Why is it so important
that you kill me?

49:00.068 --> 49:02.487
Well, it's quite simple, really.

49:02.696 --> 49:06.241
You killed Viktor. I liked Viktor.

49:07.659 --> 49:10.662
Like or not,
he killed Mike Anderson.

49:10.871 --> 49:13.874
Is that why you killed him?
Revenge?

49:14.791 --> 49:15.876
Yes.

49:17.419 --> 49:21.381
There was the briefest flicker
of hesitation there.

49:23.550 --> 49:25.802
But if you're telling the truth...

49:25.969 --> 49:28.221
...then you don't require
any explanation.

49:28.430 --> 49:31.016
You understand the need
for vengeance.

49:31.600 --> 49:36.772
So you got arrested. There'll be a trial.
You'll go to prison for a long time.

49:37.439 --> 49:38.774
Does that mean this is over?

49:42.778 --> 49:45.238
- Over?
- Yes.

49:48.784 --> 49:50.869
I had a great uncle...

49:51.662 --> 49:53.914
...my grandfather's brother.

49:54.122 --> 49:55.707
He was a hero.

49:55.916 --> 49:59.169
Fought with the Red Army
during the Second World War.

49:59.628 --> 50:05.092
When he returned to Kiev afterwards,
some fat, little party official...

50:05.300 --> 50:08.887
...resented the fact
that everyone admired him...

50:09.262 --> 50:12.057
...so he decided
to make an example of him...

50:12.265 --> 50:14.267
...by taking away his house.

50:16.269 --> 50:18.188
When my great uncle protested...

50:18.397 --> 50:21.817
...he was hung
in front of the council chambers.

50:22.609 --> 50:25.779
My grandfather was just a teenager.

50:25.987 --> 50:28.490
When that party official saw
the hatred in his eyes...

50:28.699 --> 50:31.993
...he had him arrested
and sent to Siberia.

50:32.202 --> 50:35.580
And the years rolled by.

50:36.248 --> 50:40.210
And my grandfather got on
with his life as best he could.

50:40.961 --> 50:43.380
He was a patient man.

50:45.716 --> 50:52.514
Finally, when the Soviet Union fell,
he returned to Kiev...

50:52.723 --> 50:57.477
...and celebrated in front of city hall
with all the others.

50:58.228 --> 51:02.774
And that's when he found
that fat, little party official...

51:03.775 --> 51:08.405
...and he got to enjoy the pleasure
that belonged to him and him alone...

51:08.613 --> 51:15.287
...by sticking a 6-inch knife into
that fat, little man's kidney.

51:16.830 --> 51:21.710
So you ask me if this is over.

51:23.170 --> 51:24.963
No.

51:25.172 --> 51:26.923
I'm afraid not.

51:30.385 --> 51:32.637
- There's only one problem.
- And that is?

51:32.846 --> 51:35.056
I'm not some fat, little man.

51:37.642 --> 51:39.519
That's true.

51:40.604 --> 51:42.355
I don't know who you are.

51:44.733 --> 51:47.861
If you ever find out, you'll regret it.

51:57.913 --> 51:59.831
Hey. Come on in.

52:00.040 --> 52:01.666
See this?

52:03.001 --> 52:04.044
What is it?

52:04.252 --> 52:06.713
It's me lifeguarding your ass
for a change.

52:08.340 --> 52:10.675
I took it from LaGuerta.

52:14.888 --> 52:18.433
- I told you to stay clear of this.
- Well, you're lucky I didn't.

52:20.101 --> 52:22.896
- Deb--
- She would've seen you, Dexter.

52:28.151 --> 52:30.237
So you saved me.

52:31.863 --> 52:33.365
Yeah.

52:38.119 --> 52:39.955
Thanks.

52:42.165 --> 52:44.167
That's yours. It's not mine.

52:45.544 --> 52:48.296
I don't wanna be involved in
that part of your life.

52:48.505 --> 52:50.465
I don't want you to be.

52:51.132 --> 52:53.301
I know you're not gonna stop.

52:55.053 --> 52:57.305
But I don't wanna know about it.

52:58.890 --> 53:00.392
Okay.

53:02.644 --> 53:04.980
I had to lie to Batista.

53:06.398 --> 53:09.276
Batista. For you.

53:10.610 --> 53:14.406
And that was the moment I realised
that I don't wanna be a part of this.

53:14.614 --> 53:16.449
I can't do it.

53:19.494 --> 53:23.081
It took me forever
to wrap my brain around the idea...

53:23.540 --> 53:25.667
...that you're not
who I thought you were.

53:28.461 --> 53:31.006
But it doesn't mean
I have to change.

53:34.551 --> 53:38.471
All of your stealing and your lying
and your covering up...

53:39.890 --> 53:41.600
...that's not me.

53:51.610 --> 53:56.114
So you think
LaGuerta's investigation is closed?

54:01.870 --> 54:03.246
No.

54:04.122 --> 54:06.374
Lundy didn't figure me out.

54:07.792 --> 54:10.295
No reason to think LaGuerta will.

54:19.012 --> 54:21.723
Oh, if Lundy could see me now.

54:24.893 --> 54:26.728
And you.

54:36.488 --> 54:39.908
I've been thinking about our vacation
to Myrtle Beach a lot.

54:40.784 --> 54:42.994
How we spent our days.

54:43.870 --> 54:45.789
On the beach.

54:46.289 --> 54:49.209
Running up and down the shore.

54:49.626 --> 54:51.878
And at low tide,
running in and out of the water.

54:52.087 --> 54:53.964
I was always chasing you.

54:54.172 --> 54:56.091
I could never catch you.

54:56.883 --> 54:59.719
You wouldn't take off your flippers.

55:04.432 --> 55:07.310
Even if I did, you were always...

55:07.686 --> 55:09.896
...just out of reach.

55:12.440 --> 55:15.276
Maybe, we're learning
it's better that way.

55:22.325 --> 55:26.830
Did you get the blood report back
on the bodies from the dig?

55:27.038 --> 55:28.581
Yeah.

55:30.458 --> 55:31.751
And?

55:33.336 --> 55:35.463
Anything I should know?

55:38.717 --> 55:40.343
Nope.

56:06.953 --> 56:11.041
<i>As kids, Deb and I
would try to outrun the waves...</i>

56:11.249 --> 56:13.835
<i>...but I would always end up
diving under them.</i>

56:14.044 --> 56:18.423
<i>I would swim deep because I could
withstand the pull of the tide.</i>

56:27.599 --> 56:30.727
<i>But Deb was always safest
at shore.</i>

56:32.103 --> 56:36.524
<i>From here on out,
I'll face the depths by myself.</i>
