00:10.517 --> 00:11.976
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

00:12.852 --> 00:14.604
You really believe in nothing?

00:14.813 --> 00:17.232
I suppose I believe in a certain set
of principles...

00:17.399 --> 00:20.026
...so that I don't get into trouble.

00:20.193 --> 00:23.196
- Like something I might teach a puppy.
- Is that so bad?

00:23.405 --> 00:27.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

00:27.409 --> 00:28.827
If I could have feelings...

00:28.993 --> 00:31.955
...I'd have them for Deb,
she's the only person who loves me.

00:32.163 --> 00:36.167
You've been the one
constantly good thing in my life.

00:36.334 --> 00:40.588
- There's something inside.
- Holy frankenfuck! Snakes!

00:40.797 --> 00:42.465
- So it's begun?
- Yes.

00:43.258 --> 00:45.635
-It's begun.
- No!

00:47.178 --> 00:48.805
Is this Doomsday?

00:48.972 --> 00:51.141
I'm taking a lot of heat
on Doomsday.

00:51.349 --> 00:52.559
Are we making any headway?

00:52.767 --> 00:55.311
I'm about to interview my top pick
for detective.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.690
So far, our Doomsday killer
has given us three tableaus...

00:58.857 --> 01:02.235
...most likely referencing Revelation,
chapters eight through 10.

01:03.403 --> 01:05.530
- I think I found a new lead.
- Who's this?

01:05.739 --> 01:08.116
Latest and greatest intern
from my forensics class.

01:08.324 --> 01:10.535
The game is about homicide...

01:10.744 --> 01:13.788
...but in my game,
you can be the serial killer.

01:13.997 --> 01:18.001
I think this is offensive.
Who would choose to be a serial killer?

01:20.170 --> 01:23.381
Are you out of your mind?
You fucked a person of interest?

01:23.590 --> 01:26.259
- Maybe you're jealous.
- This is a job of trust...

01:26.468 --> 01:28.511
...and I can't have a partner
I can't trust.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.431
I don't know how to act,
what to do, who to hire.

01:31.639 --> 01:34.058
You're too smart to think
this was gonna be easy.

01:34.267 --> 01:35.560
Did you really think...

01:35.769 --> 01:38.188
...Matthews made you Lieutenant
because you're ready?

01:38.354 --> 01:40.231
It's all politics to get back at me.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.525
Every time shit hits the fan,
I go to him.

01:42.734 --> 01:43.777
He's your safe place.

01:43.985 --> 01:47.113
You're making it sound like
I wanna be with him or something.

01:47.322 --> 01:48.698
Well, do you?

01:49.532 --> 01:52.535
You didn't really think you could foil
God's plan, did you?

01:54.871 --> 01:57.165
- I have to stop him.
- What happened to saving him?

01:57.332 --> 01:59.167
Travis' dark passenger
is a part of him.

01:59.334 --> 02:01.920
He can't be saved from it
any more than I can from mine.

02:02.754 --> 02:05.006
I think Travis is gonna kill again.

02:05.673 --> 02:07.133
The eclipse is here, Travis.

02:08.384 --> 02:10.428
This is not how it's supposed to be!

02:10.637 --> 02:14.265
It is exactly as it should be.

02:18.937 --> 02:20.355
Oh, God.

05:19.200 --> 05:23.246
<i>It's simple human nature
to keep little secrets about ourselves.</i>

05:23.454 --> 05:24.664
<i>We all do it.</i>

05:26.290 --> 05:28.084
<i>I dye my hair.</i>

05:29.711 --> 05:31.754
<i>I watch internet pornography.</i>

05:32.463 --> 05:35.758
<i>But what if your whole life
is a secret?</i>

05:35.967 --> 05:38.136
- A <i>lie.</i>
- How can I help you?

05:38.344 --> 05:41.764
One economy class ticket, flight 449.

05:41.973 --> 05:45.393
- To Budapest.
- Correct.

05:45.601 --> 05:48.229
<i>And exposing the truth
could destroy everything you are.</i>

05:48.980 --> 05:50.023
<i>What do you do?</i>

05:51.691 --> 05:53.693
<i>- Run?
-Oh, God.</i>

05:58.781 --> 06:01.200
- Get the fuck away from the body.
- Deb, it's me.

06:01.909 --> 06:05.496
- Who's on the altar?
- Travis Marshall.

06:05.705 --> 06:08.458
Dexter, what the fuck?

06:11.419 --> 06:14.589
- Oh, shit.
- Talk to me.

06:16.215 --> 06:17.383
Could you lower your gun?

06:19.343 --> 06:20.428
Please?

06:26.851 --> 06:31.147
I came to do one last forensics sweep
like you asked me to do...

06:31.939 --> 06:34.192
...Travis was here.
He came at me with his sword.

06:35.068 --> 06:36.110
I fought him off.

06:37.528 --> 06:39.739
I knocked him out.

06:40.865 --> 06:43.785
How did he end up
wrapped in plastic on the altar?

06:46.329 --> 06:48.122
I snapped.

06:48.331 --> 06:50.083
You Snapped?

06:50.833 --> 06:53.044
What the fuck does that mean?

06:56.464 --> 06:59.092
There's been a lot of anger inside me
since Rita died...

06:59.300 --> 07:03.096
...and when I looked at Travis
and thought about everything he did...

07:05.014 --> 07:07.350
...I wanted him dead, so I killed him.

07:10.812 --> 07:14.482
That still doesn't explain
why he's wrapped up like that.

07:19.153 --> 07:21.030
I didn't even think about it.

07:23.658 --> 07:24.951
I'm a forensics expert.

07:25.159 --> 07:28.246
I guess it's just second nature
not to leave a trace.

07:28.454 --> 07:30.873
Jesus, Dex.

07:33.876 --> 07:35.962
Why the fuck didn't you call me?

07:37.839 --> 07:40.967
I wasn't exactly
in the best state of mind.

07:48.391 --> 07:51.310
- Are you hurt?
- No.

07:52.061 --> 07:54.814
Physically, I'm okay.

08:04.282 --> 08:05.908
- Who are you calling?
- The station.

08:06.117 --> 08:08.244
- I've gotta get everyone down here.
- No.

08:09.579 --> 08:10.788
Please wait.

08:13.249 --> 08:14.500
Why?

08:15.710 --> 08:16.919
How does this look?

08:19.589 --> 08:23.009
- Pretty fucking weird.
- Exactly.

08:23.217 --> 08:25.344
An investigation
could complicate our lives...

08:25.553 --> 08:28.723
...more than either of us
are prepared to deal with.

08:30.308 --> 08:32.727
But it was self-defence.

08:38.357 --> 08:39.734
Yeah.

08:48.826 --> 08:50.870
But it's pretty fucking weird.

08:54.665 --> 08:56.751
I have to call this in.

09:00.463 --> 09:03.591
You had a moment
of temporary insanity.

09:04.675 --> 09:06.969
We can fix this.

09:07.428 --> 09:08.471
How?

09:11.140 --> 09:13.392
I'll get you the best fucking lawyer
in the city.

09:15.019 --> 09:18.022
Even if I'm lucky enough to get off
due to temporary insanity...

09:18.189 --> 09:21.859
...they'll still put me in some
psych ward.

09:22.276 --> 09:25.780
I'll lose my job, my career.

09:27.573 --> 09:30.159
And probably even Harrison.

09:39.293 --> 09:42.004
- So what then?
- Travis is dead.

09:44.757 --> 09:48.427
- Yes.
- Nothing's gonna change that.

09:50.388 --> 09:52.431
Maybe we should just get
rid of the body.

09:55.601 --> 09:56.644
What?

09:56.852 --> 09:59.605
I could put it in my car,
take it somewhere and dump it...

09:59.814 --> 10:01.983
-...where no one would ever find it.
- No.

10:02.191 --> 10:04.443
- If I'm careful--
- No. Use your head.

10:04.652 --> 10:08.406
If you get caught with the body,
everything's ten times worse.

10:08.614 --> 10:10.908
We're not moving
the fucking body anywhere.

10:11.117 --> 10:13.035
Okay.

10:23.671 --> 10:25.715
We make it look like a suicide.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.138
Frustrated the world didn't end
like he predicted...

10:32.305 --> 10:35.850
...Travis committed ritual suicide
at the church altar...

10:36.058 --> 10:38.686
...stabbing himself with his sword.

10:43.232 --> 10:44.275
Maybe.

10:44.483 --> 10:47.194
But not before first
setting the church on fire.

10:49.989 --> 10:51.115
Fire...

10:52.658 --> 10:53.826
...is biblical.

10:58.247 --> 10:59.290
One last tableau.

10:59.498 --> 11:02.168
And it'll erase any trace
that we were ever here.

11:02.376 --> 11:03.836
How do we do that?

11:04.420 --> 11:06.172
It would have to burn so fast.

11:07.214 --> 11:09.383
Gasoline. There's a station nearby.

11:20.895 --> 11:25.399
- I'll go get a couple of gallons.
- No, Deb, go home. I'll do it.

11:25.608 --> 11:29.945
- I know what I'm doing.
- Bullshit.

11:39.163 --> 11:41.457
Jesus, Debra.

11:44.919 --> 11:47.004
He's a good doggy.

11:47.213 --> 11:50.007
- Hey, Deb.
- His name is Banjo.

11:50.216 --> 11:54.011
- Where did that dog come from?
- The Millikans' dog had a litter.

11:54.220 --> 11:56.680
- I couldn't resist.
- No dogs in this house ever.

11:56.889 --> 11:58.808
- But why?
Because.

11:59.016 --> 12:02.269
- Harry, look how much Debra loves--
- End of discussion.

12:05.773 --> 12:06.899
Dexter.

12:07.858 --> 12:10.111
Don't even think about it.

12:12.446 --> 12:16.409
<i>I have to do whatever it takes
to keep Deb from the full truth.</i>

12:16.617 --> 12:19.495
<i>I have to keep my secret safe.</i>

12:25.751 --> 12:32.216
<i>Otherwise, my life, her life,
will never be the same.</i>

13:07.543 --> 13:10.546
Oh, fuck, Dexter, I don't know
if this was the right thing to do.

13:10.754 --> 13:13.424
It's only a matter of time
before we get called back here.

13:13.632 --> 13:15.801
- We have to go.
- Go where?

13:16.635 --> 13:18.596
- Go home.
- I don't wanna be alone.

13:18.804 --> 13:20.139
I don't want you to be alone.

13:21.182 --> 13:23.767
Well, just follow me.
We can't stay here.

13:42.369 --> 13:43.746
<i>This is all wrong.</i>

13:43.954 --> 13:46.832
<i>I should be on my boat right now
dumping the bags overboard.</i>

13:47.041 --> 13:49.043
<i>I can't let this get away from me.</i>

14:04.934 --> 14:05.976
Morgan.

14:13.317 --> 14:15.653
All right, everyone knows their jobs.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.488
Let's do this.

14:28.207 --> 14:29.792
The arson investigator said...

14:30.000 --> 14:32.711
...the fire started somewhere
in the middle of the church.

14:32.920 --> 14:35.381
The melted remains of a gas
can seem to confirm that.

14:35.589 --> 14:38.008
I was also able to get
one fingerprint...

14:38.175 --> 14:40.344
...that does give us
preliminary confirmation...

14:40.511 --> 14:42.012
...that this is Travis Marshall.

14:42.179 --> 14:45.558
Travis appears to have doused himself
in gasoline as well.

14:45.766 --> 14:48.769
He then climbed up on the altar,
grabbed his sword at the hilt...

14:48.978 --> 14:52.356
...and plunged it into his heart.

14:53.065 --> 14:55.025
One final tableau.

15:00.281 --> 15:03.492
- He died instantly.
- Please tell me he felt a little pain.

15:03.701 --> 15:05.202
It makes sense.

15:05.369 --> 15:07.955
World didn't end like he predicted
so he had to end his.

15:08.163 --> 15:10.249
Good. Saves us the trouble
having to do it.

15:11.584 --> 15:14.295
Cheer up, Lieutenant.
This is a big win.

15:15.462 --> 15:17.381
Would have been better
to catch him alive.

15:24.805 --> 15:26.724
<i>Plastic.</i>

15:28.142 --> 15:30.936
After all he did? Fuck him.

15:31.145 --> 15:33.188
Masuka. Masuka.

15:33.397 --> 15:35.899
Is it possible to kill yourself
with a sword?

15:36.108 --> 15:37.568
Oh, yeah, sure.

15:37.776 --> 15:40.446
The ancient art of hara-kiri
has been well established...

15:40.654 --> 15:42.823
...particularly amongst
my own ancestors...

15:43.032 --> 15:45.367
...as a penance for
various embarrassing...

15:45.576 --> 15:48.078
...and humiliating transgressions.

15:48.579 --> 15:49.913
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

15:50.122 --> 15:53.125
Miami has one less murderer
on the loose.

15:53.292 --> 15:57.254
- Thank you.
- There's a large press gathering outside.

15:59.298 --> 16:01.800
This is a good opportunity for you
to make a statement.

16:03.052 --> 16:04.845
Still a lot to be done in here.

16:05.054 --> 16:07.848
<i>She's not as comfortable lying
to the world as I am.</i>

16:08.057 --> 16:12.061
It's okay, Lieutenant. You can go.
We're just wrapping things up.

16:12.269 --> 16:15.272
- Go talk to them.
- Come on. I'll be right behind you.

16:15.481 --> 16:17.483
I'll sneak out back.
If the press sees me...

16:17.691 --> 16:21.862
...they'll only want to talk to me
and you're the hero this time.

16:32.289 --> 16:34.875
But it's more heroic if you do it...

16:36.293 --> 16:37.920
Hey.

17:03.654 --> 17:05.364
Hey, you. Come here.

17:09.326 --> 17:12.996
Would you make sure
this gets logged'? Thanks.

17:17.376 --> 17:20.421
<i>Even if I put Deb in the uncomfortable
position of lying for</i> me...

17:20.629 --> 17:23.590
...at <i>least I've kept the bigger truth
from her.</i>

17:24.133 --> 17:26.218
<i>It'll all be okay.</i>

17:29.054 --> 17:30.305
Oh, hey, Dexter.

17:32.975 --> 17:35.686
- What are you doing here?
- Jamie's putting Harrison to bed.

17:35.894 --> 17:37.354
I didn't wanna wake him.

17:40.607 --> 17:42.609
You used my computer
without my permission?

17:43.277 --> 17:45.320
I just wanted to check
the basketball scores.

17:45.529 --> 17:47.531
- I thought it would be okay.
-It's not okay.

17:47.740 --> 17:49.658
Okay, well, I'm really, really sorry.

17:49.867 --> 17:53.996
I don't give a shit if you're sorry,
Louis. Never touch my things.

17:54.621 --> 17:58.751
- Louis, here you are.
- Yeah, here he is.

17:58.959 --> 18:02.212
What are you doing here?
This is Dexter's side of the apartment.

18:03.005 --> 18:06.592
I didn't realise there were
different sides. I'm, like, super sorry.

18:08.469 --> 18:12.014
- Is Harrison asleep?
- Yeah. He's out.

18:12.222 --> 18:14.683
- You should go home.
- Okay.

18:51.428 --> 18:53.138
Shit.

19:03.565 --> 19:05.901
It'll all be okay.

19:23.126 --> 19:27.047
You know, everyone acts
like Dexter's such a great guy...

19:27.214 --> 19:30.092
...but he's really kind of
a pompous jerk, don't you think?

19:31.593 --> 19:33.345
No.

19:33.512 --> 19:35.013
Come on.

19:35.222 --> 19:37.432
He's all like,
"Don't touch my shit, man."

19:38.350 --> 19:40.477
- What a dick.
- Louis.

19:40.686 --> 19:41.812
What is your problem?

19:42.980 --> 19:47.442
Dexter's my boss, okay?
And he happens to be very good to me.

19:48.694 --> 19:51.029
I still don't understand
why you were on his side.

19:51.238 --> 19:54.366
Well, I told you.
I just wanted to get some water.

19:54.575 --> 19:55.701
Right.

19:57.536 --> 20:01.915
You know, the more I get to know you,
the weirder and weirder you get.

20:35.324 --> 20:38.160
<i>And we go live to this
Breaking News 9 special report.</i>

20:39.578 --> 20:43.206
<i>I can only speculate but I think it's fair
to say that Travis Marshall felt...</i>

20:43.415 --> 20:46.501
...the <i>intense pressure of Miami Metro
zeroing in on him...</i>

20:46.710 --> 20:49.379
...and <i>that led to his decision
to commit suicide.</i>

20:49.588 --> 20:52.925
<i>Lieutenant, are you ruling out
the possibility that this was a murder?</i>

20:58.597 --> 21:00.766
- Hey, Mike.
- Just had a thought.

21:00.974 --> 21:02.768
Where was his car?

21:02.976 --> 21:05.187
- Whose car?
- Travis Marshall's.

21:05.771 --> 21:09.024
His car wasn't found at the scene,
so how'd he get to the church?

21:10.776 --> 21:13.987
I'm guessing that a man that was
about to stab himself in the heart...

21:14.196 --> 21:19.076
...with a sword probably wouldn't see
a long walk as a big deal.

21:19.952 --> 21:23.163
Probably right, but still...

21:23.372 --> 21:25.248
Sure. Yeah. You should check it out.

21:27.584 --> 21:28.627
I Will.

21:29.670 --> 21:33.173
First thing in the morning.
Good night, Lt.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.316
- Need some help?
- No. No, thank you.

21:53.860 --> 21:57.489
-It's okay. I can fix it.
- Relax. I'm a cop.

21:58.657 --> 22:01.368
- Where's your lug wrench at?
- No!

23:05.515 --> 23:08.769
How were you so perfectly
prepared to kill Travis?

23:09.853 --> 23:11.563
- What do you mean?
- The plastic wrap?

23:11.772 --> 23:13.899
You just happened to have
that with you?

23:15.984 --> 23:17.694
I found it in the storeroom.

23:17.903 --> 23:19.112
What about the knives?

23:19.905 --> 23:21.990
You said Travis came at you
with a sword.

23:22.199 --> 23:25.243
Where did you get the knives?
There was like a whole roll of them.

23:25.452 --> 23:27.829
Travis had them with him.
They were his knives.

23:28.038 --> 23:30.457
I don't know where he got them from.

23:31.666 --> 23:33.502
You weren't in your regular
work clothes.

23:35.754 --> 23:39.883
You changed.
You had a rubber apron.

23:41.551 --> 23:43.970
Plastic sleeves.

23:49.810 --> 23:52.062
I'm just trying to put this together.

23:56.942 --> 24:00.695
Deb, I'm sorry
I put you in this situation.

24:05.242 --> 24:08.995
- You look pretty stressed.
- Yeah.

24:09.204 --> 24:10.372
But...

24:11.331 --> 24:13.083
You know, my job can get messy.

24:13.291 --> 24:15.919
I always keep a change of clothes
in my car.

24:16.128 --> 24:19.923
And the apron, all that other stuff,
is just part of my kit.

24:20.674 --> 24:22.759
Every blood spatter guy's got them.

24:26.179 --> 24:29.015
What about when you said,
"I know what I'm doing"?

24:30.308 --> 24:33.728
When you tried to get me to go,
you said, "I know what I'm doing."

24:33.895 --> 24:35.021
What did you mean?

24:35.230 --> 24:37.607
I meant I work crime scenes
every day.

24:39.776 --> 24:42.737
I know what people like me look for,
so I know what to cover up.

24:43.405 --> 24:44.906
This doesn't feel right.

24:50.537 --> 24:51.955
I know it doesn't.

25:00.630 --> 25:05.802
Deb, I never meant to get you involved
in any of this.

25:11.516 --> 25:13.101
But I am.

25:22.861 --> 25:25.363
We gotta go to work.

25:40.086 --> 25:41.922
What's wrong?

25:42.505 --> 25:46.259
We had to give Banjo back.
I am so sorry, sweetheart.

25:46.468 --> 25:49.179
I never should have gotten him
without talking to your dad.

25:49.387 --> 25:53.266
- This is all my fault.
- I want Banjo back.

25:53.475 --> 25:56.645
<i>No. It's all my fault.</i>

26:05.070 --> 26:06.154
Deb.

26:06.363 --> 26:08.615
Look, I made a huge mistake.
I admit it.

26:08.823 --> 26:11.117
But other than saying I'm sorry
again and again...

26:11.326 --> 26:13.245
...I don't know what else to say.

26:17.082 --> 26:19.417
Morgan. What?

26:20.085 --> 26:21.127
When?

26:22.545 --> 26:24.005
Jesus, fuck.

26:24.881 --> 26:26.675
That was Dispatch.
Mike's been shot.

26:26.883 --> 26:28.343
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

26:28.551 --> 26:30.679
- I'm right behind you.
- Now, Dex.

26:31.429 --> 26:34.599
Deb, I gotta find my keys,
put my bag together.

26:34.808 --> 26:37.435
I'll get Dispatch
to text me the address.

26:37.644 --> 26:39.271
I'll be two minutes behind you.

26:53.493 --> 26:54.619
<i>MY getaway pack.</i>

26:59.207 --> 27:01.376
<i>I don't want to run.</i>

27:02.252 --> 27:06.256
<i>But if Deb doesn't let up,
that may be my only option.</i>

27:30.238 --> 27:33.491
<i>Mike Anderson. One of our own.</i>

27:35.493 --> 27:38.079
Whoever did this to Mike
is gonna be very sorry.

27:39.080 --> 27:42.000
- He'll be very fucking dead.
- Hey.

27:42.208 --> 27:46.087
We do everything by the book.
We're cops, not killers.

27:46.296 --> 27:50.884
<i>But being a killer would feel
so very good right about now.</i>

27:53.470 --> 27:55.722
She suffered blunt force trauma
to the head.

27:55.930 --> 27:58.683
From something narrow
and cylindrical.

27:58.892 --> 28:02.645
- Steel pipe? Tyre iron?
- Yeah, something like that.

28:03.396 --> 28:05.774
The first blow was the left side
of the head...

28:05.982 --> 28:10.904
...and then three more blows to the top
much harder. She...

28:11.529 --> 28:12.739
Her skull was fractured...

28:12.947 --> 28:15.367
...and she haemorrhaged,
as evidenced by the blood...

28:15.575 --> 28:17.702
...that's trickling from her ear.

28:20.830 --> 28:23.041
<i>When will she believe me?</i>

28:23.249 --> 28:27.629
<i>- What happens if she never does?</i>
- When <i>do you think she</i> bought <i>it?</i>

28:29.005 --> 28:31.674
Rigour has set in. She hasn't been
moved from this trunk...

28:31.883 --> 28:33.802
...and judging from the lividity...

28:34.010 --> 28:36.221
...and pooling on the right side
of her face...

28:36.388 --> 28:41.684
-...I'd say eight to twelve hours ago.
- Not long after we all left the church.

28:43.937 --> 28:46.398
- Yeah.
- What a fucked up couple of days.

28:46.606 --> 28:48.149
I couldn't agree with you more.

28:53.154 --> 28:55.156
We're looking for one shooter
at a minimum.

28:55.740 --> 28:58.785
The shooter hits this girl,
dumps her in the trunk, speeds off.

28:59.411 --> 29:00.537
Gets a flat tyre.

29:00.745 --> 29:04.332
He repays Mike's kindness by
shooting him and fleeing in Mike's car.

29:04.541 --> 29:08.294
His car was found in an industrial park
near North West 52nd.

29:08.503 --> 29:12.173
- I've got people there. Start canvassing.
- And here? Any witnesses?

29:13.133 --> 29:14.175
None so far.

29:15.009 --> 29:16.344
Maybe somebody saw something.

29:17.512 --> 29:19.264
I'm on my way to talk to Mike's wife.

29:19.472 --> 29:22.642
All of her family's in Chicago
and she's gonna need all our support.

29:22.851 --> 29:23.935
Anything she needs.

29:24.102 --> 29:26.396
Hopefully Dexter and I will win
the DNA lottery...

29:26.604 --> 29:28.648
...because it looks
he wiped the car clean.

29:28.857 --> 29:31.151
Nothing on prints, except for hers.

29:31.359 --> 29:34.946
Well, judging by her attire
or lack of it, she was a stripper.

29:37.115 --> 29:39.075
And on duty at the time of her death.

29:39.284 --> 29:42.704
I've got an ID on the fingerprints.
A Kaja Soroka.

29:42.912 --> 29:45.081
Same person this car's registered to.

29:45.290 --> 29:47.041
We'll find out where she works.

29:47.250 --> 29:51.671
The steering wheel, shifter,
door handles, seatbelt buckle...

29:51.880 --> 29:53.173
...they're all wiped clean.

29:53.381 --> 29:56.801
<i>But there's always one place
they forget to clean: the turn signal.</i>

30:31.544 --> 30:33.379
- You're clear.
- Oh, fuck.

30:33.588 --> 30:34.631
The road's clear.

30:37.008 --> 30:38.801
Thank you.

30:45.141 --> 30:46.226
Fuck.

31:16.631 --> 31:17.799
Excuse me.

31:18.007 --> 31:20.426
I need to see the files
on the Ice Truck Killer case.

31:20.635 --> 31:23.179
- Row F-17.
- Thank you.

32:26.492 --> 32:30.079
Kaja Soroka was a Ukrainian national
here on a work visa.

32:30.288 --> 32:33.333
She worked at the Fox Hole
gentleman's club in Pinecrest.

32:33.541 --> 32:37.086
The same owner is listed as having
five other strip clubs in Miami.

32:37.253 --> 32:39.672
Looked into them with Narcotics.
Figured they were...

32:39.839 --> 32:42.884
...using the places to launder money
but we never got anywhere.

32:43.051 --> 32:44.469
Let's get somewhere now.

32:44.677 --> 32:46.638
Quinn and I
is gonna take the Fox Hole.

32:46.846 --> 32:50.099
The rest of you split up
the rest of the clubs. Let's go.

32:50.308 --> 32:54.937
<i>All the prints belong to Miss Soroka
except the one from the turn signal.</i>

32:56.356 --> 33:01.486
<i>But there aren't any matches
in Florida AFIS, FBI or DHS.</i>

33:02.362 --> 33:04.530
<i>There's always Interpol.</i>

33:13.289 --> 33:17.794
I had this weird flashback
of being on Rudy's ta...

33:18.002 --> 33:20.755
Brian's ta--
Whatever the fuck you wanna call him.

33:20.963 --> 33:22.173
Your brother's table.

33:23.216 --> 33:25.635
Sorry. That must have felt
not good for you.

33:25.802 --> 33:27.178
It didn't.

33:28.596 --> 33:33.351
But what bothers me about it
is that I was set up on that table...

33:33.559 --> 33:37.271
...the same way Travis Marshall
was set up on the altar.

33:37.772 --> 33:39.732
- Deb--
- I mean, how do you explain that?

33:42.402 --> 33:44.862
I don't know, I was there too.

33:45.071 --> 33:48.199
- I pulled you off that table.
- I was on that table.

33:48.700 --> 33:50.576
I almost died on that table.

33:50.785 --> 33:53.496
You would think that I would remember
every fucking detail.

33:54.580 --> 33:57.500
But even I don't remember it
that clearly.

33:57.709 --> 34:01.045
Dexter, you were somehow able to...

34:01.254 --> 34:05.007
...perfectly duplicate
how he set everything up.

34:05.174 --> 34:07.301
The same positioning.

34:07.510 --> 34:10.430
The same amount of plastic wrap.
They are the same, Dexter.

34:10.638 --> 34:14.058
They are exactly the same.

34:14.267 --> 34:17.145
<i>Because Brian was imitating me.</i>

34:19.021 --> 34:21.441
This is crazy, Deb. I know that.

34:21.649 --> 34:23.484
It's crazy that I did what I did.

34:23.693 --> 34:27.947
It's crazy that you just happened
to walk in and see me doing it.

34:28.156 --> 34:30.867
I mean, what were you doing
in the church, anyway?

34:32.452 --> 34:34.328
It was just...

34:37.206 --> 34:41.961
I was just fucking checking to see
if everything was okay.

34:45.423 --> 34:47.049
I'm sorry for all the questions.

34:47.258 --> 34:52.680
I'm just-- Dexter, I'm trying
to make sense of this.

34:52.889 --> 34:54.557
Deb, it's not gonna make sense.

35:08.988 --> 35:11.699
- Did you find anything in the car?
- No, not yet.

35:22.835 --> 35:26.380
<i>Give up, Deb.
Give up and just leave this alone.</i>

35:31.302 --> 35:33.346
We have a match.

35:37.099 --> 35:38.976
Viktor Baskov.

35:41.854 --> 35:44.106
<i>When you're losing control
of your entire life...</i>

35:44.315 --> 35:46.317
<i>...it helps to focus on
what you're good at.</i>

35:46.526 --> 35:47.610
<i>My little secret.</i>

36:29.193 --> 36:30.862
<i>I shouldn't be doing a kill now.</i>

36:35.533 --> 36:38.870
<i>The irony is that's the only way
I can maintain control...</i>

36:39.036 --> 36:41.205
<i>...the only way I can keep this
from Deb.</i>

36:43.791 --> 36:46.252
<i>Someone packed in a hurry.</i>

36:47.920 --> 36:49.130
<i>Blood.</i>

36:53.175 --> 36:57.471
<i>And gunshot residue.
Looks like you're our man, Viktor.</i>

36:59.348 --> 37:00.975
<i>How careless were you, Viktor?</i>

37:02.894 --> 37:07.899
<i>One first class one-way ticket to Kiev,
Ukraine leaving in less than two hours.</i>

37:08.107 --> 37:09.567
Very careless.

37:17.992 --> 37:19.035
How can I help you?

37:19.243 --> 37:22.663
One economy class ticket, flight 449.

37:22.872 --> 37:26.125
- To Budapest.
- Correct.

37:26.334 --> 37:30.212
That will be $1890, please,
Mr. Hartwell.

37:32.965 --> 37:35.009
- Dog track.
- Lucky you.

37:35.217 --> 37:37.511
Yeah, lucky me.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.138
- You're all set.
- Thank you.

37:41.933 --> 37:44.143
- Step through.
- Please wait.

37:45.102 --> 37:48.397
- Wait, sir. What are these for?
- Diabetes.

37:48.606 --> 37:50.650
I have a prescription
if you wanna see it.

37:51.817 --> 37:53.527
Go ahead.

38:06.916 --> 38:09.168
<i>Hello, Viktor.</i>

38:14.256 --> 38:15.341
Right here, sweetheart.

38:23.057 --> 38:26.602
- Kill the music.
- Good afternoon, everyone.

38:26.811 --> 38:29.897
I'm Sergeant Batista
from Miami Metro Homicide.

38:31.023 --> 38:35.528
We are investigating the suspected
homicide of one Kaja Soroka...

38:35.736 --> 38:38.906
...as well as the homicide
of a Miami Metro police officer.

38:39.115 --> 38:41.534
And no one is leaving
until they've been questioned.

38:41.742 --> 38:44.078
Employees of the club
up against this wall.

38:44.286 --> 38:45.955
The rest of you perverts, this wall.

38:46.122 --> 38:48.833
- Is there a manager here?
- Yeah, I'm the manager.

38:49.041 --> 38:50.501
- You heard him.
- Let's go.

38:50.710 --> 38:53.754
- George Novikov.
- Oh, my God.

38:53.963 --> 38:57.174
An employee and a pervert.
I don't know which wall you go to.

38:57.383 --> 38:59.927
- You know this guy?
- Yeah, he was a low-level scumbag.

39:00.136 --> 39:03.764
- Now I guess he's a mid-level scumbag.
- Nice to see you, Detective Quinn.

39:07.268 --> 39:10.021
What can you tell me
about Miss Soroka?

39:10.229 --> 39:12.189
Kaja wasn't the smartest girl
in the world.

39:12.398 --> 39:13.607
No?

39:13.816 --> 39:17.111
These girls come here from
little villages, still stinking of cow shit.

39:17.319 --> 39:19.697
They think they're gonna land
some rich husband.

39:19.864 --> 39:22.283
Hook up with the wrong guys,
end up over their heads.

39:22.491 --> 39:25.953
- Is that what you think happened?
- I really have no idea what happened.

39:26.162 --> 39:31.542
Look, I'm sorry Kaja's dead, you know?
She was a sweet kid.

39:31.751 --> 39:34.211
And I'm sorry about
your police officer too.

39:34.378 --> 39:36.213
Their deaths have nothing to do
with us.

39:36.422 --> 39:39.967
We can start with you supplying me
with a list of all of your employees.

39:40.134 --> 39:41.719
Sure.

39:41.927 --> 39:44.638
Can I get a head count list
at the main bar'?

39:44.847 --> 39:46.182
Something cold to drink?

39:46.390 --> 39:49.018
- Your name, please?
- Foxy Raven.

39:51.145 --> 39:54.315
All right. Is that the name
your mother gave you?

39:54.523 --> 39:57.151
And maybe you could show me
some form of ID.

39:58.110 --> 40:02.239
- I do not speak English.
- No, of course you don't.

40:02.823 --> 40:04.867
One of our guys found blood
outside the door.

40:34.522 --> 40:38.651
- Sir, I have your wheelchair.
- I don't need a wheelchair--

40:52.039 --> 40:53.833
<i>It never matters your destination.</i>

40:54.041 --> 40:58.629
<i>The smart traveller must be prepared
to make last-minute adjustments.</i>

41:18.315 --> 41:21.735
- Lieutenant, you got a second?
- Yeah, what's up?

41:21.944 --> 41:25.197
We shut down the strip club questioned
everyone, but didn't get shit.

41:25.406 --> 41:28.617
We know she worked last night.
She signed in at 10, never signed out.

41:28.826 --> 41:32.538
We found blood in the parking lot
which we believe belongs to Soroka.

41:32.746 --> 41:34.832
With that,
we still haven't gotten anywhere.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.542
- No one saw her leave?
- No.

41:36.750 --> 41:38.794
No one remembers any customers
she might have talked to.

41:39.003 --> 41:42.423
No one remembers seeing her car
in the parking lot. No one saw shit.

41:42.631 --> 41:46.552
- She's a fucking ghost in a G-string.
- Bullshit. She walked out of a club...

41:46.719 --> 41:48.679
...in the middle of her shift.
Someone saw.

41:48.888 --> 41:51.473
These places are mobbed up,
Russian, Ukrainian crime.

41:51.682 --> 41:54.059
Strippers who are brought in,
they know not to talk.

41:54.226 --> 41:57.438
- How would you like us to proceed?
- Shut down every club...

41:57.605 --> 41:59.231
...every night until someone talks.

41:59.440 --> 42:01.317
We're on it.
I'm gonna need more coffee.

42:01.525 --> 42:02.735
- Coffee truck?
- No.

42:02.902 --> 42:05.738
I already got so much caffeine
in my head, I can barely think.

42:05.946 --> 42:08.616
You know what, you're not gonna
get anything done tonight.

42:08.824 --> 42:11.368
Just go home.

42:11.577 --> 42:13.704
It's been a very long,
very fucked-up day.

42:13.913 --> 42:17.333
I'm too worked up to sleep
but I could use a drink.

42:17.499 --> 42:20.544
- Knock one back in Mike's honour?
- Lead the way.

42:20.753 --> 42:22.630
- You coming, Lieutenant?
- Rain check.

42:22.838 --> 42:25.132
- But slam a double for me.
- Sure.

42:25.341 --> 42:26.467
- Good night.
- Night.

42:26.675 --> 42:28.219
Good night.

42:33.265 --> 42:35.851
- What's up, Lieutenant?
- Any progress?

42:36.060 --> 42:39.939
We know our shooter
was wearing size ten Prada shoes.

42:40.147 --> 42:42.691
Very pricey.
We know he was right-handed.

42:42.900 --> 42:46.820
So that narrows it down
to about 800 million people.

42:47.029 --> 42:48.614
- Dexter here?
- No.

42:48.822 --> 42:51.450
I told him I'd work late
if he came in early.

42:57.039 --> 42:59.500
Scotch and whatever my friend
is having.

42:59.708 --> 43:00.876
I'll have a vodka.

43:01.085 --> 43:03.170
Don't you mean Shirley Temple?

43:03.379 --> 43:04.713
What, I can't toast to Mike?

43:09.134 --> 43:11.971
- To Mike.
- To Mike.

43:15.599 --> 43:18.686
What if your union rep sees?
Aren't you in some kind of programme?

43:18.894 --> 43:20.020
I start next week.

43:20.187 --> 43:22.523
Good. Sooner you address
your problem, the better.

43:22.690 --> 43:25.150
- I'm tired of your shit.
- Still breaking my balls?

43:25.359 --> 43:27.736
You lose one girlfriend
and the wheels come off.

43:27.945 --> 43:30.030
- I'm a sensitive guy.
- I lost two wives...

43:30.239 --> 43:31.865
...and countless girlfriends.

43:32.074 --> 43:33.742
I managed to keep my shit together.

43:33.951 --> 43:37.121
I wish my life was more like yours.
You're living the fucking dream.

43:37.329 --> 43:40.874
Keep it up. I'll put in for that transfer.
I don't care what the union says.

43:41.041 --> 43:44.878
<i>- I'll</i> make it happen.
- I thought you put in for my transfer.

43:46.505 --> 43:47.881
Didn't quite get around to it.

43:48.090 --> 43:50.926
So you were just fucking with me?
You didn't want me to leave.

43:51.135 --> 43:54.179
- You were trying to get me to shape up.
- A lot of good that did.

43:54.388 --> 43:57.349
- You still fucking love me.
- Fuck you.

43:57.558 --> 44:01.687
I try to help you and you go running
to your union rep like a little bitch.

44:02.521 --> 44:03.564
That was weak.

44:03.772 --> 44:05.816
- Well, actually--
- What?

44:06.025 --> 44:10.154
I plan on talking with him
as soon as I find out who he is.

44:10.362 --> 44:13.115
- What about this programme you're in?
- That's bullshit.

44:13.324 --> 44:15.451
You know I don't have
a drinking problem.

44:15.659 --> 44:17.953
Or maybe that's just me in denial.
Who knows?

44:18.162 --> 44:21.290
- We may never get to the bottom of this.
- Just deal with your shit.

44:22.541 --> 44:26.670
Mike was a hundred times better cop
than we'll ever be.

44:27.296 --> 44:29.048
I'll drink to that.

44:41.060 --> 44:43.020
Hello, Viktor.

44:44.313 --> 44:46.148
Where am I?

44:46.774 --> 44:49.818
You're in a place
where things are forgotten.

44:52.613 --> 44:56.408
Never to be used or seen
or touched again.

44:57.576 --> 45:00.746
It seems fitting for a cop killer.

45:00.954 --> 45:04.792
Not to dismiss Kaja Soroka.
She counts too.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.587
- Who are you?
- Good question.

45:10.589 --> 45:13.300
It all depends on who you ask.

45:14.426 --> 45:16.178
Who sent you?

45:17.596 --> 45:22.643
You should not fuck with me.
I have very dangerous friends.

45:22.810 --> 45:25.521
If you knew how many times
I've heard that over the years.

45:25.687 --> 45:29.400
What do you want? Money?
I can get you a lot of money.

45:29.608 --> 45:32.403
- I've heard that a lot too.
- Why are you doing this?

45:32.611 --> 45:35.572
You want the long version?
That could take a couple of hours.

45:36.407 --> 45:37.491
Short version.

45:39.576 --> 45:41.620
Because I have to.

45:41.787 --> 45:44.456
Because I need control.

45:46.792 --> 45:50.629
I'm trying to make things go back
to the way they were.

45:52.756 --> 45:53.882
You're crazy.

45:54.091 --> 45:57.761
There's really no need
for name calling, Viktor.

46:04.226 --> 46:06.728
Is there anything I can do
to keep you from killing me?

46:08.105 --> 46:12.067
- No.
- Then get it over with.

46:15.154 --> 46:17.990
Normally, I don't take orders.

46:19.324 --> 46:20.951
But in this case...

46:31.253 --> 46:33.255
How can I help you?

46:39.803 --> 46:42.890
- This <i>is Isaak.
-Viktor left on an evening flight.</i>

46:43.098 --> 46:46.143
He arrives in Kiev
at 5:25 p.m. your time.

46:46.351 --> 46:49.813
Good. What about
the dead police officer?

46:50.355 --> 46:54.109
That's still a problem
but they don't have shit on us, so...

46:55.736 --> 46:58.739
<i>- I'll make it go away.
- Good.</i>

47:09.583 --> 47:14.254
<i>Ridding the world of people like Viktor
is the one thing I'm good at.</i>

47:14.421 --> 47:17.049
<i>When I'm stressed
near to the breaking point, like</i> now...

47:17.216 --> 47:19.176
<i>...it centers me.</i>

47:19.384 --> 47:22.429
<i>Maybe nothing has to change
with Deb.</i>

48:02.719 --> 48:04.263
<i>Hello?</i>

48:06.348 --> 48:10.477
- Hi, Jamie. ls Dexter there? It's Deb.
- No, he's working late.

48:11.687 --> 48:14.523
- He's at work?
- Yeah.

48:14.731 --> 48:18.151
<i>He said with Mike's shooting and
everything, he might be there all night.</i>

48:18.360 --> 48:20.070
Oh, yeah, right.

48:23.115 --> 48:25.325
Does that happen a lot?

48:26.910 --> 48:29.830
I mean, I know I should know his hours
and everything.

48:30.038 --> 48:32.291
It's just that
I'm always juggling things, $0...

48:32.499 --> 48:35.377
Oh, yeah, he works crazy hours.

48:36.253 --> 48:40.007
<i>Lots of nights till 3, 4 a.m.</i>

48:41.717 --> 48:45.554
- All right. Okay, thanks.
- Want me to have him call you?

48:46.888 --> 48:48.390
No.

48:49.141 --> 48:51.351
No, I'll see him at work tomorrow.

48:51.560 --> 48:54.271
- Okay.
- Good night.

49:17.836 --> 49:20.839
- What's his name?
- Banjo.

49:21.048 --> 49:23.842
- Are you okay?
- No.

49:24.051 --> 49:26.678
Why did Daddy
take the real Banjo away?

49:26.887 --> 49:30.223
- What did I do wrong?
- You didn't do anything.

49:30.432 --> 49:32.517
It's me. It's my fault.

49:32.726 --> 49:34.728
Why? What did you do?

49:37.314 --> 49:42.361
Dexter's allergic to dogs, sweetie.
That's why we can't have them.

49:45.072 --> 49:46.823
Sorry.

49:48.241 --> 49:51.078
- What were you going to tell her?
- The truth.

49:51.286 --> 49:52.621
What is the truth?

49:52.829 --> 49:55.999
That you got rid of the dog
because you thought I might kill it.

49:56.208 --> 49:58.835
- But I wouldn't.
- I couldn't take that chance.

49:59.044 --> 50:02.339
But what's more important
is that you mustn't ever...

50:02.547 --> 50:05.133
...tell Debra the truth about yourself.

50:05.717 --> 50:09.012
- Why?
- If you think she's upset now...

50:09.179 --> 50:13.141
...that's nothing compared to how
she'd feel if she learned what you are.

50:13.350 --> 50:16.103
- She'd be terrified.
- But she loves me.

50:16.311 --> 50:19.356
Dex, she loves
who she thinks you are.

50:20.023 --> 50:22.734
If she ever saw the real you,
she'd never get over it.

50:23.360 --> 50:26.279
Son, your mother and I
aren't gonna be around forever.

50:26.488 --> 50:28.949
Someday Debra will be
all you have left.

50:29.157 --> 50:31.368
You don't wanna lose her, do you?

50:37.124 --> 50:39.292
<i>My mistake was stepping outside
the code.</i>

50:39.501 --> 50:43.755
<i>I should have killed Travis the instant
I met him rather than try to save him.</i>

50:43.922 --> 50:47.259
<i>Compassion does not fit me.</i>

51:15.662 --> 51:18.290
- You're ready?
- Yes, I'm ready to join you.

51:18.498 --> 51:21.960
But I can't. Not Deb.

51:27.716 --> 51:29.926
No, you can't be a killer and a hero.

51:46.693 --> 51:47.736
Vincent.

51:48.695 --> 51:51.907
- You're working late.
- Yeah, well, lots to do.

51:52.115 --> 51:54.242
Everyone's doing double shifts.

51:54.451 --> 51:57.662
I know you're working on Mike's case
and that's top priority.

51:57.871 --> 52:01.708
Wondering if anyone had a chance to go
through the evidence from the church.

52:01.917 --> 52:06.421
Sorry. It's all in those boxes over there
but I'm kind of swamped here.

52:06.588 --> 52:07.923
Of course.

52:13.094 --> 52:16.681
Hey, does our forensics team ever take
blood slides at crime scenes?

52:16.890 --> 52:20.185
No. If any of the evidence
is transportable, we bag it.

52:20.393 --> 52:23.396
Otherwise, if it's blood,
we absorb into cotton squares...

52:23.605 --> 52:25.065
-...then we bag it.
- I see.

52:25.273 --> 52:28.485
Only one person who ever worked at
Miami Metro ever took blood slides.

52:28.693 --> 52:30.904
- And that was?
- Sergeant Doakes.

52:31.112 --> 52:34.950
And that was only because of his
side gig as the Bay Harbour Butcher.

52:39.371 --> 52:42.207
Right. Of course, Sergeant Doakes.

52:43.917 --> 52:45.794
Thank you.

52:46.878 --> 52:49.422
<i>None of us want to be
fully revealed...</i>

52:49.631 --> 52:53.176
...all <i>our faults and weaknesses
laid bare for the world to see.</i>

52:54.719 --> 52:57.430
<i>All the more reason to make sure
I never again stray...</i>

52:57.597 --> 53:00.016
<i>...from what Harry taught me.</i>

53:35.886 --> 53:37.888
Did you kill all these people?

53:45.186 --> 53:46.313
I did.

53:50.609 --> 53:51.651
Are you...

53:54.738 --> 53:56.323
Are you a serial killer?

53:59.492 --> 54:01.494
Yes.
