00:10.475 --> 00:12.519
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

00:13.061 --> 00:15.605
Miami is still overcrowded by one.

00:15.814 --> 00:17.732
I'm not suggesting a coup here.

00:17.899 --> 00:19.484
More like a realignment.

00:21.778 --> 00:24.155
- Do you recognise him?
-It's one of George's men.

00:24.364 --> 00:27.242
Sent here to kill me.
So much for brotherhood.

00:27.450 --> 00:28.702
This guy had a slip.

00:28.910 --> 00:30.036
Dexter Morgan.

00:30.245 --> 00:32.122
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

00:33.665 --> 00:37.627
Chief Lane has somehow come
to learn about my indiscretions.

00:37.794 --> 00:39.003
He's asking me to retire.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.881
He thought that I ratted him out.
We both know it was you.

00:42.048 --> 00:44.884
This is how the game is played,
Morgan.

00:45.093 --> 00:47.721
- I don't owe you shit.
- Not the way Isaak sees it.

00:47.929 --> 00:51.808
He did you a favour by taking out
those Colombian scumbags.

00:52.016 --> 00:54.269
So, what do you know
about this Isaak Sirko?

00:54.436 --> 00:58.732
I know that he wants to kill me
and that I need to kill him first.

00:58.940 --> 01:01.776
I have never been able to talk
to anyone about my kills.

01:02.318 --> 01:03.361
Not like this.

01:05.113 --> 01:06.990
You should cut your losses, Isaak.

01:07.532 --> 01:08.992
Go back to Kiev.

01:09.200 --> 01:13.079
The one thing that made my life worth
living in Kiev, you tossed in the ocean.

01:13.288 --> 01:15.206
- You and Viktor were--
- Lovers.

01:15.415 --> 01:19.544
You took from me the one thing
that money and power can't bring back.

01:20.795 --> 01:21.921
Till next time.

01:23.423 --> 01:26.092
I know who you are.
I know what you are.

01:26.301 --> 01:29.345
I think you'd be surprised
at the things you don't know about me.

01:29.512 --> 01:30.847
Being with Hannah is worse...

01:31.014 --> 01:32.348
-...than being a killer?
- Yes!

01:32.515 --> 01:34.559
Feel like if you love me,
you'll accept this.

01:34.726 --> 01:37.771
If I love you? I'm in love with you.

01:37.979 --> 01:40.982
You're in love with me?

01:42.025 --> 01:44.611
Will you please just go? I really--
I can't look at you.

03:47.817 --> 03:52.030
<i>There are no two stronger
human emotions than fear and love.</i>

03:52.238 --> 03:56.284
<i>In many ways, they're not so different.
Both can make you do crazy things.</i>

03:56.492 --> 03:59.370
<i>Tell your own brother
you're in love with him.</i>

03:59.913 --> 04:02.040
<i>Put your life at risk
to hunt down the</i> man...

04:02.206 --> 04:03.708
<i>...who took away your beloved.</i>

04:08.963 --> 04:12.091
Could you maybe not do
that turny thing?

04:12.258 --> 04:15.386
- How you doing back there?
- Oh, you know, I'm fine.

04:17.096 --> 04:19.098
<i>Or do something
that scares you to death...</i>

04:19.265 --> 04:22.018
<i>...because you may be in love.</i>

04:32.654 --> 04:35.657
I didn't think it was gonna be this
choppy. Turn into the waves.

04:35.865 --> 04:37.492
Otherwise it's worse.

04:37.659 --> 04:40.286
Well, I wouldn't want that.

04:47.418 --> 04:50.254
You know, could we maybe stop
for a minute?

05:00.181 --> 05:02.016
We don't have to do this.
We can go back.

05:02.183 --> 05:03.810
No, no, no. I just need a minute.

05:05.728 --> 05:08.022
I thought I'd outgrown this.

05:09.023 --> 05:12.485
When you said your nanny
was taking the kids back to Orlando...

05:12.694 --> 05:15.321
...a morning on the ocean alone
soundedâ€œ.

05:15.863 --> 05:17.907
...better in my head.

05:21.953 --> 05:23.454
LS your--?

05:23.955 --> 05:24.998
You're shaking.

05:27.291 --> 05:29.293
You always been this afraid
of the water?

05:29.460 --> 05:32.630
Since my father thought that the best
way to teach me how to swim...

05:32.797 --> 05:35.508
...was to march me down to the local
pond and throw me in.

05:35.717 --> 05:38.052
- That's horrible.
- Yeah.

05:39.262 --> 05:41.848
- Where was your mother?
- She was right beside him.

05:42.056 --> 05:45.435
She noticed pretty quickly
that something was wrong...

05:45.768 --> 05:48.980
...but he wouldn't let her come to me.

05:49.731 --> 05:50.857
He wouldn't save you?

05:51.065 --> 05:54.694
Six years old and I already knew
what it felt like to be dying.

05:54.902 --> 05:56.237
I came to on the dock.

05:56.446 --> 05:59.282
A fisherman heard my mother
screaming.

05:59.615 --> 06:03.828
A complete stranger saved my life
instead of my father.

06:06.456 --> 06:08.332
Have you ever been that scared?

06:10.585 --> 06:12.128
Not--

06:12.670 --> 06:14.547
Not really.

06:15.214 --> 06:17.675
You've never felt that at all?

06:19.927 --> 06:22.180
It's okay if you have.
You can talk to me...

06:22.346 --> 06:24.515
...about this kind of stuff.

06:25.975 --> 06:27.727
I know.

06:38.988 --> 06:40.490
It's work.

06:41.365 --> 06:43.743
There's a body. I have to get back.

06:45.036 --> 06:46.788
Okay.

07:19.028 --> 07:20.071
You're positive?

07:20.738 --> 07:22.532
After George's attempt on your life...

07:22.698 --> 07:25.368
...the brotherhood has taken matters
into their own hands.

07:25.535 --> 07:28.621
They've sent two men to kill you.
They're most likely already here.

07:29.539 --> 07:30.581
Who?

07:32.041 --> 07:34.460
Mickie and Caffrey.

07:39.757 --> 07:42.510
You know there's still time for you.
You don't have to stay.

07:43.302 --> 07:45.555
I'm not going anywhere.
You're safe here for now.

07:45.721 --> 07:48.432
They won't be able to trace this room
to you.

07:48.933 --> 07:50.601
Your phone.

07:51.686 --> 07:55.189
I've made both these men very rich
when I required their services.

07:55.398 --> 07:57.984
Let's see if they're as loyal as you.

07:58.693 --> 08:00.444
- Oleg, it's--
- Isaak.

08:01.362 --> 08:03.823
Good to hear your voice.

08:04.031 --> 08:07.201
- How's your mother?
- Good days and bad.

08:08.661 --> 08:12.498
So I hear you're in town.
Don't suppose we can talk about this.

08:12.665 --> 08:15.918
I've already accepted the contract.
What's done is done.

08:16.627 --> 08:18.004
Right, then.

08:18.546 --> 08:20.673
We'll see you soon.

08:25.303 --> 08:27.346
We're gonna need some help.

08:30.850 --> 08:32.935
<i>Hannah keeps wanting me
to open up...</i>

08:33.144 --> 08:35.605
<i>...get to know the real me.</i>

08:35.938 --> 08:39.525
<i>The only problem is I'm not so sure
there is such a thing.</i>

08:41.736 --> 08:43.654
Relax. You're safe.

08:43.863 --> 08:46.324
As for me, I wish
I could say the same thing.

08:46.532 --> 08:50.036
- What are you doing here?
- Circumstances have changed greatly.

08:50.244 --> 08:54.540
Koshkas have sent two of their own
to kill me. Need your help to stay alive.

08:55.958 --> 08:58.127
I'm feeling rather exposed out here.

08:58.336 --> 09:01.881
We wouldn't want these two men
to know where you live now, would we?

09:12.725 --> 09:15.353
You don't seem like someone
who needs help.

09:15.561 --> 09:19.857
Even a man dangling from a cliff will
stretch out a hand to his worst enemy.

09:20.024 --> 09:22.276
Where's your assistant?

09:22.485 --> 09:25.196
As resourceful as Jurg is,
he's of no use to me now.

09:25.988 --> 09:28.241
These men know who he is.

09:29.408 --> 09:32.787
What I need
is the element of surprise.

09:32.995 --> 09:35.331
And that, Dexter...

09:36.040 --> 09:37.667
...is you.

09:40.169 --> 09:41.420
You're scared.

09:43.839 --> 09:46.884
If you knew
who these two men were...

09:47.093 --> 09:48.302
...you would be too.

09:50.096 --> 09:51.555
What's in this for me?

09:52.139 --> 09:54.058
Your life.

09:55.685 --> 09:58.062
I'll take my chances.

10:01.524 --> 10:02.566
Very well.

10:08.155 --> 10:10.074
<i>If the enemy of my enemy
is my friend...</i>

10:10.241 --> 10:12.868
<i>...I should be rooting for the men
who want Isaak dead.</i>

10:13.077 --> 10:15.621
<i>But crazy as it sounds, I'm not.</i>

10:15.830 --> 10:18.249
<i>Maybe because I still want Isaak
for myself.</i>

10:18.457 --> 10:21.210
<i>Or that he and I are more alike
than I want to admit.</i>

10:21.419 --> 10:23.879
Know what would be great
at the restaurant? S'mores.

10:24.088 --> 10:27.341
- The ones you make at your own table.
- Don't mention the restaurant.

10:27.508 --> 10:29.176
Health inspector stopped by.

10:29.343 --> 10:31.137
How can you think of food with this?

10:31.304 --> 10:34.765
Four violations and seven days to fix
or they're gonna shut me down.

10:34.974 --> 10:36.851
Mind if I take a look?

10:37.727 --> 10:40.521
I'd rather you not.
At least till I'm done here.

10:42.106 --> 10:44.817
- Little heads up next time?
- What would be the fun in that?

10:45.359 --> 10:47.570
Arson investigator.

10:50.990 --> 10:55.411
There's an empty canister of accelerant
under the passenger seat.

10:56.495 --> 10:59.165
I'm detecting an oily residue.

10:59.373 --> 11:01.000
There's also...

11:02.043 --> 11:03.919
...an ID badge.

11:07.173 --> 11:08.674
- What do we have here?
- Watch.

11:09.342 --> 11:11.344
Holy filet-o-fuck.

11:11.552 --> 11:13.429
- Who are you?
- See, it never gets old.

11:13.637 --> 11:15.181
Phil Bosso.

11:15.389 --> 11:17.600
We met a while back.
That church burning?

11:20.186 --> 11:23.105
- Have an ID?
- Danny Yamiro. Paralegal.

11:23.314 --> 11:25.107
Badge says he works downtown.

11:25.316 --> 11:27.068
Think you got a suicide here.

11:27.610 --> 11:29.445
Hara-kiri.

11:30.029 --> 11:31.781
Self-immolation.

11:31.947 --> 11:34.784
What is it with my people?
First in math, first to check out.

11:34.950 --> 11:36.952
It's actually self-incineration.

11:37.119 --> 11:41.123
Immolation is a form of sacrifice
by any means. Isn't restricted to fire.

11:41.374 --> 11:43.167
Well, excuse the fuck out of me.

11:43.376 --> 11:46.045
Hey, what about the backseat?

11:46.253 --> 11:49.632
The burn rate behind the driver's side
is different than the rest.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.676
- Are you sure it's a suicide?
- You're the blood guy?

11:53.219 --> 11:55.054
- Right.
- Exactly.

11:55.262 --> 11:57.598
- Crime scene's all yours.
- Thanks.

11:58.682 --> 12:01.602
Let me know what you find.
Gonna have unis canvass the area.

12:01.769 --> 12:03.729
- I can do that.
- No, no, I got it.

12:03.896 --> 12:06.065
<i>Deb's been afraid
of her feelings consuming her.</i>

12:06.232 --> 12:09.860
<i>If I can't find a way to extinguish them,
I'm afraid she might be right.</i>

12:10.027 --> 12:13.155
- Deb, wait up.
- I have to get back to the station.

12:13.364 --> 12:15.574
- What you said--
- I don't wanna talk about this.

12:15.783 --> 12:17.410
I'm glad you said it.

12:17.576 --> 12:21.205
How? When every second of every day,
all I wanna do is take it back.

12:21.414 --> 12:24.291
Because on some level,
I've always felt the same way.

12:24.500 --> 12:28.087
- You don't have to do this.
- I do. I am your brother, and I love you.

12:28.254 --> 12:30.464
Just not in the same way
you think you love me.

12:30.673 --> 12:33.259
- Dex--
- And it's okay.

12:34.260 --> 12:35.886
I understand. It makes sense.

12:36.095 --> 12:38.222
It's logical.

12:39.765 --> 12:41.434
Like...

12:42.476 --> 12:45.062
The way I love M&Ms,
even though I know I shouldn't.

12:45.271 --> 12:46.564
M&-fucking-Ms?

12:46.772 --> 12:48.607
I'm trying here. Just hear me out.

12:48.816 --> 12:50.818
Why, Dexter?
It's sure as shit not logical.

12:51.026 --> 12:52.820
Consider everything
we've been through.

12:52.987 --> 12:56.073
You are the one person on the planet
who's been down the same road.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.785
Same road, very different cars.

12:59.994 --> 13:04.623
Deb, we've always been the one
constant thing in each other's lives.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.334
It's like you and I...

13:07.543 --> 13:08.878
...we endure.

13:10.838 --> 13:12.506
Maybe that's what love is.

13:12.715 --> 13:14.717
Endurance.

13:17.428 --> 13:20.181
- You think you're in love with me.
- Please stop saying that.

13:20.347 --> 13:23.058
- But it's gonna be fine.
- No.

13:23.767 --> 13:24.810
It's--

13:24.977 --> 13:27.688
Logical. Because it is.

13:29.356 --> 13:30.816
You're not crazy.

13:31.358 --> 13:33.736
Fuck. That, coming from you...

13:33.944 --> 13:35.988
Should make you feel better.

13:37.907 --> 13:39.492
It does.

13:41.243 --> 13:45.122
God, Dexter. You, me, Dad.

13:46.415 --> 13:49.585
It's like Mom got cancer
to take the easy way out.

13:50.586 --> 13:53.088
I don't know.
Maybe it's better that it's out there...

13:53.255 --> 13:56.383
...and it's not controlling me
anymore.

14:02.348 --> 14:04.433
Do you feel that way
about your secret?

14:05.809 --> 14:07.520
Not really.

14:17.404 --> 14:18.989
Deb?

14:21.575 --> 14:23.160
Hannah?

14:24.495 --> 14:26.956
I saw your van outside. Are you--?

14:29.041 --> 14:31.585
- Here?
- Dexter. You're just in time for tea.

14:31.794 --> 14:34.755
Hope you don't mind, I let myself in.
That's far enough.

14:36.257 --> 14:38.342
I just want to talk.

14:39.051 --> 14:40.135
Where's Hannah?

14:41.011 --> 14:42.763
Jurg's been keeping tabs on you.

14:42.972 --> 14:44.557
For me.

14:44.765 --> 14:47.184
Your comings and goings.

14:47.351 --> 14:48.769
Where you spend your nights.

14:49.603 --> 14:51.564
Seems this Hannah's quite important
to you.

14:51.730 --> 14:54.275
- Where is she?
- I assure you she's perfectly safe...

14:54.441 --> 14:55.818
...and quite comfortable.

14:56.026 --> 14:57.403
Jurg is seeing to that.

15:00.364 --> 15:02.533
Let her go.
This is between you and me.

15:02.741 --> 15:04.493
Not quite.

15:04.743 --> 15:07.454
There's the small matter
of the two men who want me dead...

15:07.621 --> 15:10.082
...and your stubborn refusal to help.

15:11.375 --> 15:13.877
You asked me
what was in this for you.

15:14.086 --> 15:16.922
Well, if your life doesn't matter...

15:17.131 --> 15:18.591
...I'm betting hers does.

15:26.223 --> 15:29.393
Well, I guess I have no choice
but to take you up on that tea.

15:29.602 --> 15:31.228
Splendid idea.

15:33.105 --> 15:36.650
I have a better idea. I kill you, and
leave you out for the Koshkas to find.

15:36.817 --> 15:38.861
Yes, you can do that...

15:39.069 --> 15:41.280
...but that leaves Hannah with Jurg.

15:41.488 --> 15:45.659
I'm afraid he's not as honourable
nor as forgiving as I am.

15:45.868 --> 15:48.621
What makes you think
Hannah means anything to me?

15:48.829 --> 15:50.748
Well, if she didn't,
I'd be dead by now.

16:04.803 --> 16:07.640
You have the wrong guy.
This isn't what I do.

16:09.016 --> 16:12.895
You killed Viktor as well as the man
waiting for me in my apartment.

16:13.103 --> 16:15.939
He had a gun, you had a knife.
I think I have the right man.

16:16.106 --> 16:18.233
And if I help you, then what?

16:18.400 --> 16:20.611
You get Hannah back...

16:20.819 --> 16:22.821
...and I walk away from Miami
and from you.

16:23.572 --> 16:26.367
No matter what you may think of me
or my methods...

16:26.992 --> 16:29.411
...I'm a man of my word.

16:30.746 --> 16:33.248
I need to know she's alive.

16:48.389 --> 16:51.725
<i>Hannah, I trust you and Jurg
are settled in.</i>

16:51.934 --> 16:55.813
- Why are you doing this?
- The reason, <i>my</i> dear, <i>is</i> right here.

16:56.021 --> 16:57.606
Dexter.

16:57.773 --> 16:59.483
- Don't worry.
- That's enough.

16:59.650 --> 17:01.819
- Now, you behave.
- No, <i>wait!</i> Dexter--

17:04.905 --> 17:07.366
Your life is in his hands now.

17:07.574 --> 17:09.326
Listen to me carefully.

17:09.535 --> 17:12.913
Scream, make noise, I hurt you.

17:13.122 --> 17:14.498
Try to escape...

17:14.665 --> 17:17.126
...I hurt you badly.

17:17.418 --> 17:18.919
Clear?

17:21.547 --> 17:22.673
Here.

17:23.757 --> 17:25.259
Find something for us to watch.

17:26.844 --> 17:29.138
And none of the American
reality shit.

17:37.896 --> 17:39.148
Here.

17:39.314 --> 17:42.192
Oleg Mickie. Ex-military.
Efficient, methodical.

17:42.359 --> 17:45.070
Which is why I've employed him
more times than I can count.

17:47.281 --> 17:49.742
- And that one?
- Benjamin Caffrey.

17:49.950 --> 17:51.660
He's a Yank, like you.

17:51.869 --> 17:56.290
Out of New York.
Less reliable but, as you can see...

17:56.498 --> 17:57.708
...just as deadly.

17:57.916 --> 17:59.877
Any weaknesses?

18:00.544 --> 18:01.962
I need to know everything.

18:02.171 --> 18:05.299
Caffrey likes it up close and personal.
Knives, piano wire.

18:05.507 --> 18:07.259
And as you saw...

18:07.426 --> 18:08.886
...he's a vicious little cunt.

18:09.094 --> 18:11.555
Whereas Mickie doesn't like
to get his hands dirty.

18:12.222 --> 18:14.558
- Guns?
- High-powered riï¬‚es specifically.

18:14.725 --> 18:16.310
He's a slave to ritual.

18:16.518 --> 18:18.228
He'll buy a rifle locally...

18:18.437 --> 18:20.272
...and be compelled
to test it out first.

18:20.439 --> 18:23.108
Point of a rifle is to hit a target
from a long distance.

18:23.275 --> 18:25.569
The range would need
to be outdoors.

18:28.071 --> 18:30.032
That's his favourite.

18:34.495 --> 18:37.372
A Savage Arms 110 sniper rifle.

18:37.581 --> 18:42.002
Most ranges don't sell the kind
of magazine rounds this one uses.

18:43.045 --> 18:44.797
That's where I'll start tomorrow.

18:45.339 --> 18:49.343
Well, just where are you running off to,
all helter-skelter?

18:49.551 --> 18:50.594
I'm hungry-

18:50.803 --> 18:52.846
You've been tasked
with helping kill two men.

18:53.013 --> 18:56.767
A loved one's life hangs in the balance,
and you're hungry?

18:56.975 --> 18:58.977
-It's late.
- Let me ask you a question.

18:59.186 --> 19:01.730
Just how many men have you killed?

19:04.316 --> 19:05.692
A lot.

19:05.901 --> 19:08.695
I asked Mickie
the same question once.

19:08.904 --> 19:12.449
He answered 16. And the bastard
was almost pounding his chest.

19:12.658 --> 19:14.493
But you...

19:15.077 --> 19:17.579
...you don't seem to revel
in what you do.

19:17.788 --> 19:18.872
Why?

19:19.039 --> 19:21.458
You trying to have a moment?

19:21.667 --> 19:23.418
I don't bond.

19:24.920 --> 19:26.755
Most men kill for money.

19:26.964 --> 19:29.550
Some for the sheer brutality.

19:29.758 --> 19:33.095
Others like me, revenge.

19:33.262 --> 19:35.430
But you, Dexter...

19:35.931 --> 19:38.392
...with everything
I've put you through...

19:38.600 --> 19:43.522
...I get the sense you could walk away
without the need to kill me.

19:45.065 --> 19:46.608
My needs are different.

19:46.817 --> 19:47.860
Why do you do it?

19:48.068 --> 19:49.486
Why are you a killer?

19:49.695 --> 19:52.948
If anything happens to Hannah,
you'll find out.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.290
I need a favour.

20:01.498 --> 20:04.793
Okay. If you do me one
and watch where you're dripping.

20:05.961 --> 20:07.880
Isaak Sirko.

20:08.088 --> 20:09.423
What about him?

20:09.631 --> 20:11.425
Call off the 24-hour surveillance.

20:11.633 --> 20:13.802
Like hell I Will.

20:16.138 --> 20:17.598
What the fuck is going on?

20:19.391 --> 20:21.768
Someone's after Isaak.

20:23.145 --> 20:24.479
Two someones.

20:25.272 --> 20:28.066
You know, like the guy
in his apartment but worse.

20:28.275 --> 20:30.319
Actually, much worse.

20:30.485 --> 20:34.239
So you want me to pull the surveillance
so the two someones can...

20:34.406 --> 20:36.283
...do what they're hired to do?

20:36.450 --> 20:37.993
Not exactly.

20:38.201 --> 20:40.245
Well, then I'm not pulling
the surveillance.

20:40.412 --> 20:42.581
- He'll come after you.
- No, he won't.

20:42.748 --> 20:44.791
Because he and I...

20:46.209 --> 20:48.003
...are working together.

20:48.879 --> 20:52.215
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
-lsaak took Hannah.

20:53.008 --> 20:55.928
He got wind about these two guys
coming after him...

20:56.094 --> 20:58.138
...and he took Hannah
as leverage against me.

20:58.305 --> 21:01.892
- He's gonna kill her if I don't help him.
- And I should give a shit why?

21:03.477 --> 21:04.686
Because I do?

21:06.021 --> 21:07.648
Dexter, you don't have to save her.

21:09.191 --> 21:10.651
You shouldn't even be with her.

21:10.817 --> 21:13.111
It's not even like you
will have a fucking future.

21:13.278 --> 21:15.072
You're both what you are.

21:15.238 --> 21:19.284
I don't know what's in our future.
I don't want Isaak to kill her, that's all.

21:19.451 --> 21:21.203
Right now.

21:22.079 --> 21:23.538
Who do you think has her?

21:23.747 --> 21:25.999
His assistant. Jurg.

21:27.751 --> 21:30.921
If I can find out where, Isaak won't
have any more leverage on me...

21:31.088 --> 21:32.673
...and I can kill him.

21:32.839 --> 21:36.718
Well, how do you expect to find Jurg
if you're hanging outwith Isaak?

21:37.719 --> 21:39.638
I'll figure it out.

21:40.389 --> 21:42.766
You know what happened
this morning?

21:45.310 --> 21:48.897
I was lying in bed,
staring at the ceiling...

21:50.148 --> 21:53.652
...feeling the sun,
and listening to the waves, and...

21:55.445 --> 21:58.907
For a second,
everything was just like it used to be.

21:59.658 --> 22:02.119
Steaks and beer...

22:03.286 --> 22:05.872
...and bad movies on the couch.

22:07.791 --> 22:09.751
And then I blinked.

22:11.086 --> 22:13.630
And now it's burritos...

22:13.839 --> 22:17.217
...and hired killers and favours...

22:18.343 --> 22:20.387
...and Xanax
to get me to tomorrow morning...

22:20.554 --> 22:23.682
...so I can have that half second
of peace.

22:27.185 --> 22:29.521
I'll pull the surveillance...

22:30.313 --> 22:35.027
...but don't you ever expect me to be
okay with who you're doing this for.

22:35.193 --> 22:36.570
Deal?

22:38.030 --> 22:39.573
Deal.

23:04.347 --> 23:05.766
Tom.

23:05.932 --> 23:09.436
And a great creature arose
from the depths.

23:09.644 --> 23:11.104
Tokyo's that way, Maria.

23:11.897 --> 23:14.024
Nice to see you too, Tom.

23:14.983 --> 23:17.527
I thought I'd stop by
and see how you were doing.

23:17.736 --> 23:20.864
- I mean, it's been a while.
- Bullshit.

23:21.698 --> 23:25.660
Now, you have exactly the time
it takes for me to finish my drink...

23:25.827 --> 23:27.537
...to explain why you're really here.

23:28.872 --> 23:31.374
Little early for Scotch.

23:31.583 --> 23:32.793
The joy of retirement.

23:33.001 --> 23:35.962
I have no place to be,
no one cares what I do.

23:36.171 --> 23:40.258
If I'd known you were dropping by,
trust me, I'd have made it a double.

23:41.176 --> 23:42.219
So?

23:42.928 --> 23:46.431
I think the Bay Harbor Butcher
is alive and well...

23:46.598 --> 23:48.642
...and still in Miami.

23:49.851 --> 23:52.896
Clearly I'm not the only one
who's been hitting the sauce.

23:53.063 --> 23:56.608
Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher,
end of story.

23:56.817 --> 23:59.069
I found a blood slide
at a crime scene...

23:59.277 --> 24:02.114
...exactly like the ones we found
in Doakes' car.

24:02.322 --> 24:06.284
Bad people are still going missing,
and Doakes never had a boat.

24:06.660 --> 24:11.373
Here is a list of Miami personnel
who still do.

24:13.416 --> 24:16.837
Oh, and I'm on it too.
Are you fucking kidding me, Maria?

24:17.045 --> 24:20.257
Torn, you know I have to follow
every lead.

24:20.924 --> 24:23.343
You sound like a real cop.

24:23.718 --> 24:27.848
Except a real cop would've
remembered my hernia operation.

24:28.056 --> 24:29.182
And after the surgery...

24:29.349 --> 24:32.435
...I could barely lift my ass
out of a chair let alone a dead body.

24:32.602 --> 24:35.522
- You check the dates against the kills.
- I will.

24:37.107 --> 24:41.111
Since I'm here,
do any of those names look familiar?

24:43.905 --> 24:45.699
Go home, Maria.

24:45.907 --> 24:49.202
The only help you'll get from me
is a lift back to Cuba.

25:04.050 --> 25:07.512
<i>Only two firing ranges outside of Miami
sell high-calibre rounds...</i>

25:07.679 --> 25:10.557
<i>...and this is the only one
near the airport.</i>

25:11.933 --> 25:14.477
<i>But the target I'm interested in
isn't out there.</i>

25:14.686 --> 25:15.729
<i>It's beside me.</i>

26:14.621 --> 26:16.164
<i>Mickie is dead.</i>

26:16.331 --> 26:17.374
Fast work.

26:17.582 --> 26:19.084
I see I chose wisely.

26:19.292 --> 26:21.294
You're not out of the woods yet.

26:21.461 --> 26:25.340
When he finds out his partner's dead,
Caffrey is gonna be harder to kill.

26:25.507 --> 26:28.468
- What <i>does</i> he know <i>about</i> you?
- Everything, I suppose.

26:28.677 --> 26:30.929
I'm sure the Koshkas
would have saw to that.

26:31.096 --> 26:33.515
What if he knows you're after me
and can't track you?

26:33.682 --> 26:36.768
- He'll come after you hoping to find me.
- So let's let him.

26:36.977 --> 26:38.520
You're willing to be bait?

26:38.728 --> 26:41.731
<i>You're the one who wanted
the element of surprise.</i>

27:04.796 --> 27:07.382
I got your text. What's going on?

27:07.632 --> 27:11.428
Unis found Jurg's car at a park,
but it was abandoned.

27:11.636 --> 27:12.971
That's all I could find.

27:13.179 --> 27:16.349
You're not supposed to be finding
anything. I told you I've got this.

27:16.516 --> 27:19.686
You've got this? It sounds so casual.

27:20.020 --> 27:22.480
Facts without emotion.

27:24.149 --> 27:27.652
That's pretty much
how you've always seen the world.

27:28.278 --> 27:30.155
Pretty much.

27:31.364 --> 27:33.950
Except when it comes to Hannah.

27:36.411 --> 27:38.413
Will we be getting a call
about a body?

27:38.621 --> 27:40.957
No, it's outside
of Miami Metro jurisdiction.

27:41.166 --> 27:42.876
That's good.

27:43.084 --> 27:44.961
I guess.

27:47.130 --> 27:50.258
How do you know that Isaak
is not gonna kill Hannah anyway?

27:50.967 --> 27:52.052
I don't.

27:52.260 --> 27:55.805
And if you find Hannah
and you take care of Isaak, then what?

27:56.014 --> 27:59.142
Well, according to you, Hannah and I
don't have a future together.

28:02.312 --> 28:03.813
I had no right to say that.

28:04.022 --> 28:05.857
And it wasn't out of spite.

28:06.024 --> 28:09.652
Fuck, I don't know, maybe it was out
of spite. I don't even know anymore.

28:11.279 --> 28:12.864
It's just...

28:13.198 --> 28:17.619
I'm saying this to you as your
fucking sister and nothing else, okay?

28:18.870 --> 28:21.122
Dex, she is a killer.

28:21.790 --> 28:23.500
You will never be safe with her.

28:25.210 --> 28:27.379
You're safe with me.

28:27.587 --> 28:30.173
Promise me you'll think
about what I said.

28:30.507 --> 28:32.092
I Will.

28:39.224 --> 28:41.184
Breathe.

28:50.610 --> 28:53.780
What the fuck? Aren't you supposed
to be hunting down Isaak?

28:53.988 --> 28:55.740
Hey, I can't reach Mickie.

28:55.949 --> 28:58.284
I think Sirko got to him.

28:58.910 --> 29:00.412
Great.

29:00.620 --> 29:03.665
That's just fucking great.
You realise he'll be coming after me...

29:03.832 --> 29:05.250
...if this goes sideways?

29:05.417 --> 29:07.085
Then I need a way to find him.

29:10.046 --> 29:11.798
Morgan.

29:19.973 --> 29:22.058
I wanna talk to Hannah.

29:22.225 --> 29:23.393
She hasn't been harmed.

29:23.601 --> 29:27.647
I've done everything you've asked,
but I need to know she's still alive.

29:27.856 --> 29:29.941
<i>And figure out where she is.</i>

29:30.150 --> 29:33.528
Has anyone ever told you
you've got serious trust issues?

29:46.291 --> 29:47.375
Is it over?

29:47.917 --> 29:49.043
Not quite.

29:49.252 --> 29:51.796
Put Hannah on.
Someone wishes to speak to her.

29:57.886 --> 29:59.137
Hey.

29:59.304 --> 30:01.514
Hey, my God.

30:01.806 --> 30:04.058
It's so good to see you.

30:04.267 --> 30:07.020
- Has he hurt you?
- I'm fine.

30:08.480 --> 30:12.650
So those Ukrainians
you were telling me about?

30:13.651 --> 30:15.153
This would be them.

30:15.320 --> 30:18.156
<i>- Everything's gonna be okay.</i>
- I know.

30:18.364 --> 30:21.451
I'm sorry they're using me like this
to get to you.

30:21.618 --> 30:23.578
Don't be.

30:26.414 --> 30:28.541
It's not your fault.

30:30.043 --> 30:33.630
<i>Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
Just do what you have to do, okay?</i>

30:34.255 --> 30:37.091
<i>I want you to take me out
on that stupid boat of yours again.</i>

30:39.427 --> 30:41.387
<i>Promise?</i>

30:47.101 --> 30:48.561
I--

30:49.187 --> 30:50.772
<i>I miss you.</i>

30:56.027 --> 30:57.237
Likewise.

31:03.117 --> 31:04.327
Touching.

31:05.328 --> 31:06.871
I have to get back to work.

31:07.080 --> 31:12.085
If I had the chance to speak to Viktor
again and he told me he missed me...

31:12.293 --> 31:14.462
...I think I'd like to think
I could come up...

31:14.629 --> 31:17.048
...with something better
than "likewise."

31:17.257 --> 31:18.716
I'm not you.

31:19.342 --> 31:22.011
Yeah, but there she was,
trying to comfort you...

31:22.428 --> 31:25.431
...and you just couldn't manage
to do the same.

31:25.640 --> 31:28.059
- Why do you even care?
- Well, look around.

31:28.977 --> 31:32.355
There's no one else here for me
to talk to because of you.

31:32.564 --> 31:34.691
Viktor got exactly
what was coming to him.

31:34.899 --> 31:37.151
- Fuck you.
- That what these questions are about?

31:37.318 --> 31:40.655
Wondering what kind of killer I am,
trying to decide if I should die...

31:40.822 --> 31:43.908
-...because of what I did to him?
- He was my life!

31:46.160 --> 31:47.996
But still...

31:48.997 --> 31:51.416
...you sent him to Miami.

31:53.960 --> 31:56.337
You put him in over his head.

31:56.546 --> 31:59.132
You put all this in motion.

31:59.674 --> 32:02.468
And now you're terrified, Isaak.

32:02.844 --> 32:05.263
You're terrified
that I'm not really responsible...

32:05.471 --> 32:07.223
...for his death.

32:07.599 --> 32:08.641
That you are.

32:09.434 --> 32:10.893
No.

32:11.519 --> 32:14.230
You're the reason he's gone.

32:15.064 --> 32:17.734
If you really believed that,
I'd be dead by now.

32:27.493 --> 32:29.037
Go.

32:39.422 --> 32:42.258
Hey, Quinn, it's me.
I'm having a real shitty day here.

32:42.467 --> 32:45.219
So how about you return
one of my fucking calls?

32:49.766 --> 32:52.101
- Go get changed.
- My shift just started.

32:52.268 --> 32:55.605
Yeah, well, we're gonna take a break.
Your boyfriend's got me in a mood.

32:56.147 --> 32:57.940
Viceroy's just down the road.

32:58.149 --> 33:00.777
We had some good times there,
right?

33:02.362 --> 33:03.571
I'll get my things.

33:13.831 --> 33:17.001
Isaak is consumed by guilt,
drowning in grief.

33:17.210 --> 33:18.586
He'll never recover.

33:18.753 --> 33:23.174
You took the risk. How did you know
he blames himself for Viktor's death?

33:23.341 --> 33:25.218
I did the same thing with Rita.

33:25.426 --> 33:29.972
Even though it was Trinity
who killed her, I still felt responsible.

33:30.181 --> 33:32.558
Now it's happening all over again
with Hannah.

33:33.893 --> 33:36.479
If something were to happen to her,
and it's my fault...

33:36.646 --> 33:39.524
-...will I end up like Isaak?
- You recovered after Rita.

33:40.274 --> 33:41.734
Barely.

33:41.943 --> 33:45.321
Harrison reminds me of her
every day.

33:46.989 --> 33:48.825
But with Hannah...

33:49.033 --> 33:50.743
It feels different.

33:51.661 --> 33:55.748
I've spent my entire life
trying to mask who I am...

33:55.915 --> 33:57.834
...Wha'[ I do.

33:58.334 --> 34:01.087
But she sees through it all,
and accepts that part of me.

34:01.295 --> 34:02.755
So where's the problem?

34:02.964 --> 34:05.341
If we get through this...

34:07.135 --> 34:11.013
...maybe it's the human side of me
that'll push her away.

34:23.860 --> 34:26.070
Juan Pablo.

34:37.248 --> 34:39.417
It's a Colombian soccer player.

34:40.835 --> 34:43.004
The men Isaak killed in that bar
were Colombian.

34:43.171 --> 34:45.673
And dead men don't return home.

34:45.840 --> 34:48.801
It's the last place these killers
would think to look for Isaak.

34:48.968 --> 34:51.095
And the perfect place
to hold Hannah.

34:51.262 --> 34:54.724
Dex, grab your kit. We got another
burn victim near the university.

35:09.405 --> 35:11.824
<i>It's the man Isaak showed me.
Caffrey.</i>

35:12.658 --> 35:13.743
<i>He's taken the bait.</i>

35:13.951 --> 35:15.953
<i>I need to keep him close...</i>

35:16.162 --> 35:18.414
<i>...but not too close.</i>

35:19.874 --> 35:21.501
Fucking mould.

35:21.667 --> 35:24.962
With all that it's gonna cost me,
the universe is giving me the finger.

35:25.129 --> 35:28.007
And with proper lubrication,
nothing wrong with that, hombre.

35:28.216 --> 35:31.010
Yo, Dex. You wanna join the party?

35:31.677 --> 35:34.180
Victim's name is Leo Santolongo.
He's a grad student.

35:34.347 --> 35:37.183
One punch away from getting
free coffee at the student union.

35:37.350 --> 35:39.644
What the hell?
Two burning men in two days.

35:39.811 --> 35:42.104
Looks to be the same accelerant-
Petroleum-based.

35:42.271 --> 35:44.440
--As your car victim.
Same oily residue.

35:44.649 --> 35:47.401
- Another suicide?
- Typically with a suicide by fire...

35:47.568 --> 35:50.822
...the gas or fuel
is poured over the head, like so.

35:50.988 --> 35:52.365
This fire's point of origin...

35:53.908 --> 35:55.243
...was front centre mass.

35:55.451 --> 35:57.245
It burned upward and downward.

36:01.457 --> 36:03.751
Can we close the doors?

36:11.259 --> 36:15.972
This void. It's the same thing
that happened with the first car victim.

36:17.390 --> 36:19.725
We have a phantom.

36:20.560 --> 36:21.936
- Bobby.
- Maybe the victim...

36:22.103 --> 36:24.939
...was letting us know who did this.

36:25.398 --> 36:28.568
Or was it the last person
he was thinking of'?

36:33.698 --> 36:35.449
You Okay?

36:37.702 --> 36:39.287
Never seen anything like this.

36:39.954 --> 36:43.374
If this was a person...

36:43.583 --> 36:47.503
...then they'd have to be wearing
some kind of protective suit.

36:48.629 --> 36:51.757
He blocked the victim from escaping
and watched him burn alive.

36:52.425 --> 36:54.760
Oh, it's not as horrific
as one might think.

36:54.969 --> 36:57.096
Destruction of vital tissue,
nerve endings...

36:57.263 --> 37:03.185
...quickly induce shock or asphyxiation
making the event relatively painless.

37:03.895 --> 37:05.062
Relatively.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.240
I need my camera.

37:17.700 --> 37:20.661
- What does he need his camera for?
- Evidence we have a killer...

37:20.828 --> 37:25.124
...using fire as a weapon
and a first name. Bobby.

37:25.333 --> 37:26.709
Wonderful.

37:26.918 --> 37:29.086
Quinn, is there a security camera
on this level?

37:29.253 --> 37:31.547
Yeah, one.
I'll get the tape from the company.

37:31.756 --> 37:33.925
Well, if there's no blood,
I'm gonna head back.

37:34.091 --> 37:36.802
- Vince.
- Yeah, I've got it, Exter-Day.

37:37.011 --> 37:39.847
How can there be only one
security camera in this entire lot?

37:40.014 --> 37:41.223
Deb, you got a minute?

37:41.432 --> 37:43.142
Be right back.

37:45.645 --> 37:46.729
Who's Juan Pablo?

37:46.938 --> 37:50.191
He plays for the Colombians.
You remember Mateo's Bar?

37:50.399 --> 37:52.443
Yeah,
the three Colombians Isaak killed?

37:52.652 --> 37:54.445
Yeah, I grabbed this off of his phone.

37:54.654 --> 37:59.033
I think Hannah's being held
at one of the dead men's homes.

37:59.241 --> 38:00.785
I'll look into it.

38:00.993 --> 38:03.120
But that's all, and thank you.

38:12.296 --> 38:14.298
- Dexter.
- Your man, Caffrey?

38:14.966 --> 38:17.259
- He sees you?
- Yeah.

38:17.468 --> 38:19.053
I'm leaving a crime scene now.

38:19.261 --> 38:21.722
<i>Lead him to the port.
Pier 18, northwest corridor.</i>

38:21.889 --> 38:24.600
There's a cargo ship, the <i>Fearless.</i>
It's one of ours.

38:24.809 --> 38:26.602
I'll be waiting there.

38:38.197 --> 38:41.033
This is George. How can I help you?

38:41.242 --> 38:42.535
It's Caffrey.

38:43.035 --> 38:44.120
Did you find Isaak?

38:44.286 --> 38:46.872
- Please tell me that fucker's dead.
- Not <i>yet.</i>

38:47.081 --> 38:50.376
I'm tailing Morgan. Any reason
he'd be headed down to the port?

38:50.584 --> 38:51.919
<i>We got a boat down there.</i>

38:52.586 --> 38:54.630
You think Isaak is luring Morgan
to him?

38:55.297 --> 38:57.591
That's what I'm hoping to find out.

39:12.189 --> 39:13.691
- Hi.
- Hey.

39:16.485 --> 39:18.446
Joey, what are you doing here?

39:18.654 --> 39:22.700
I was on my way from a crime scene.
Thought I'd see if you can get off early.

39:22.908 --> 39:25.536
No. George wouldn't be happy.

39:25.745 --> 39:28.581
Fuck him. Can't one of the other girls
cover for you?

39:30.583 --> 39:33.127
Hey. ls everything okay?

39:33.335 --> 39:34.378
Yes.

39:34.587 --> 39:36.213
Please, just go.

39:36.380 --> 39:38.466
Well, did something happen?

39:39.592 --> 39:41.594
Would you please talk to me?

39:41.802 --> 39:43.304
This job is hard with you...

39:43.512 --> 39:46.265
...and the things
that are expected of me.

39:46.474 --> 39:48.768
I don't have a problem
with you working here.

39:48.934 --> 39:51.062
Promise me you won't be upset.

39:51.228 --> 39:53.397
Depends on what it is.
Nadia, what happened?

40:00.362 --> 40:02.573
You fucked my girl?

40:02.740 --> 40:05.743
Technically, if the dancers
are on the clock, they're my girls.

40:05.951 --> 40:08.746
Maybe you'd know that
if you ever returned my fucking calls.

40:08.913 --> 40:12.500
You left me high and dry tonight.
That's gonna stop.

40:12.708 --> 40:14.585
You could learn a thing or two
from her.

40:14.794 --> 40:17.505
She takes her job very seriously.

40:22.051 --> 40:23.677
You're gonna be sorry!

40:26.222 --> 40:27.640
Piece of shit!

40:33.229 --> 40:35.606
Consider that her fucking notice.

40:38.359 --> 40:39.819
Come on.

40:44.573 --> 40:47.284
Really? Cornflakes? Again?

40:47.493 --> 40:49.662
That's all there is in the cupboard.

40:58.462 --> 40:59.505
Eat.

40:59.713 --> 41:03.509
How about you let me introduce you
to some good old Southern cuisine?

41:03.717 --> 41:07.805
My grandma has this great recipe
for fried green tomatoes. It's amazing.

41:08.305 --> 41:10.641
I saw some tomatoes
growing in the garden out back.

41:11.142 --> 41:12.518
I can't let you outside.

41:12.685 --> 41:14.603
Okay, fine.

41:15.062 --> 41:16.897
You pick them, then.

41:19.608 --> 41:22.069
It's not like I'm going anywhere.

41:26.407 --> 41:28.284
Well, just remember, not too ripe.

41:35.374 --> 41:38.460
I think I'm on to something.
One of those Colombians was single.

41:38.669 --> 41:41.172
<i>The other two lived with their family
or an apartment.</i>

41:41.338 --> 41:43.799
But he has a house on Coral Road.
I'm heading there.

41:43.966 --> 41:46.886
<i>- Deb, no.
-I don't wanna hear it, Dexter, okay?</i>

41:47.052 --> 41:49.805
<i>And just so we're clear,
I am not doing this for Hannah.</i>

41:49.972 --> 41:54.643
I am doing this so you don't end up
dead. If you catch Isaak first, so be it.

41:55.436 --> 41:58.898
You kind of need to hurry. I'm leading
one of these guys to Isaak now.

42:00.482 --> 42:03.068
- Please be careful.
- I was gonna say the same to you.

42:05.070 --> 42:07.031
That's the plan.

42:42.566 --> 42:44.193
Sweetheart.

42:57.248 --> 42:59.750
See? A man of my word.

43:03.254 --> 43:05.381
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

43:06.423 --> 43:08.550
Your assistant told me
I'd find you here.

43:08.759 --> 43:09.802
We need to talk.

43:10.010 --> 43:13.222
About what?
The horrible things you said to me?

43:13.430 --> 43:15.391
You cost me my job, Maria.

43:15.599 --> 43:18.894
Was nine months shy of a 40-year
pension before you stuck the knife in.

43:19.061 --> 43:21.689
Before you could return the favour.
It's not my fault...

43:21.855 --> 43:23.565
...I beat you at your own game.

43:23.732 --> 43:26.151
So why don't you take
your own advice? Go home.

43:26.360 --> 43:30.030
Now, why would I wanna do that
if I'm here to help?

43:32.283 --> 43:35.327
Don't fuck with me, Torn.

43:41.834 --> 43:44.295
That little list of yours?

43:44.586 --> 43:48.132
You'd be surprised what I know
about some of the names on there.

43:48.674 --> 43:51.302
- Which names?
- Oh, not so fast, no.

43:51.510 --> 43:53.846
I help you,
you support my reinstatement.

43:54.388 --> 43:57.099
Just long enough for me
to get my pension bump.

43:57.308 --> 43:59.393
Boats are fucking expensive.

44:00.769 --> 44:04.732
So the question, Maria...

44:04.940 --> 44:06.984
...is how bad do you want this?

44:14.491 --> 44:17.036
Looks like a table just opened up.

44:26.003 --> 44:28.297
Careful, they're hot.

44:29.590 --> 44:31.091
Isaak hasn't checked in yet.

44:31.675 --> 44:33.844
If anything has happened to him...

44:34.011 --> 44:36.597
...it would be a shame
to kill you after a lovely meal.

44:36.764 --> 44:39.558
Well, let's hope
that doesn't have to happen.

44:40.601 --> 44:42.478
In case you want some more.

44:52.237 --> 44:53.572
- Water.
- I'm sorry.

44:53.739 --> 44:55.449
Grams always went heavy
on the pepper.

46:08.147 --> 46:10.649
Never cared much for that man.

46:11.108 --> 46:13.610
We should go before we're spotted.

46:15.821 --> 46:17.823
So this is over?

46:18.157 --> 46:20.659
And still you don't trust me?

46:20.951 --> 46:22.411
Well?

46:23.495 --> 46:24.538
You can talk.

46:24.746 --> 46:26.290
The knife?

46:29.334 --> 46:30.461
How'd that get there?

46:31.003 --> 46:33.672
In the water. I'll do the same.

46:36.258 --> 46:38.510
Fine. Together, then.

46:42.055 --> 46:44.475
You go ahead.
I'm gonna hose this down to be safe.

46:44.641 --> 46:46.143
I'll wait for you below.

46:47.186 --> 46:50.189
<i>Isaak was right.
I could have walked away if he'd let me.</i>

46:50.397 --> 46:52.191
<i>But I was wrong about him.</i>

46:52.399 --> 46:54.568
<i>I never thought he would.</i>

47:09.833 --> 47:12.127
What the hell happened to you?

47:15.464 --> 47:17.007
Well...

47:17.299 --> 47:19.885
What are you waiting for,
you little shit?

47:25.849 --> 47:27.434
God.

47:44.576 --> 47:46.620
Don't move.
I can get you to a hospital.

47:46.828 --> 47:48.872
The bullet's still inside.

47:49.081 --> 47:51.250
We both know I'm a dead man.

47:53.544 --> 47:54.670
There's a kit in my car.

47:54.836 --> 47:57.422
- I can help with the pain.
- No.

47:58.382 --> 48:00.300
I need you to do me one better.

48:38.797 --> 48:40.424
Fuck.

48:54.479 --> 48:57.524
- Dispatch.
- This is Lt. Morgan requesting backup.

48:58.066 --> 49:00.986
And a fucking ambulance
at 2085 Coral Road.

49:01.194 --> 49:03.363
<i>We're sending someone right now.</i>

49:17.336 --> 49:18.920
Sorry for the bumpy ride.

49:19.713 --> 49:21.465
You're forgiven.

49:22.466 --> 49:24.176
We're here.

49:28.055 --> 49:30.265
Indulge a dying man.

49:31.725 --> 49:35.145
What do you intend to say to Hannah
when you see her again?

49:37.439 --> 49:39.107
I guess that I'm sorry.

49:39.316 --> 49:40.359
You guess?

49:40.567 --> 49:44.613
Fuck's sakes, Dexter. She needs
to know how you feel about her.

49:44.821 --> 49:46.990
It's not that easy.

49:47.908 --> 49:51.745
How is it you can be absolutely
fearless in the face of death...

49:51.912 --> 49:55.123
...and yet so afraid to live?

49:56.333 --> 49:58.001
I'm not...

49:59.044 --> 50:00.879
...afraid.

50:02.172 --> 50:04.049
Then what is it?

50:10.764 --> 50:13.642
Death has always calmed me.

50:15.477 --> 50:17.479
It's soothing.

50:19.106 --> 50:20.607
Predictable.

50:20.816 --> 50:22.776
Inevitable.

50:24.945 --> 50:28.573
With a knife in my hand,
I feel it's mine to control.

50:28.782 --> 50:30.242
It gives you intimacy.

50:30.409 --> 50:32.160
Yes.

50:32.369 --> 50:34.413
But it never lasts.

50:34.621 --> 50:36.081
It's over...

50:36.289 --> 50:38.792
...then you move on.

50:42.003 --> 50:44.965
But now, with Hannah...

50:47.467 --> 50:50.053
...I feel
like I don't have any control...

50:50.262 --> 50:53.265
...and I'm not sure I wanna move on.

50:53.849 --> 50:55.726
I was like you.

50:56.059 --> 50:58.311
So detached.

50:59.688 --> 51:01.732
Until Viktor.

51:02.607 --> 51:05.652
Was it worth it? Your feelings for him
cost you everything.

51:05.861 --> 51:07.904
Oh, God, yes.

51:08.238 --> 51:10.240
Being with him...

51:12.117 --> 51:14.327
...I never had to hide.

51:15.328 --> 51:17.330
I was finally...

51:19.082 --> 51:20.751
Alive.

51:22.627 --> 51:24.463
There's hope for you yet.

51:51.782 --> 51:54.618
<i>Watch any Western, and you'll know
a man out for vengeance...</i>

51:54.785 --> 51:55.994
<i>...should dig two graves.</i>

51:56.161 --> 51:59.414
<i>One for his enemy
and one for himself.</i>

51:59.623 --> 52:00.874
<i>I won't be needing mine.</i>

52:01.082 --> 52:04.711
<i>But I'll see to it
that Isaak isn't alone in his.</i>

52:06.338 --> 52:09.299
And you have no idea
why you were taken by the deceased?

52:09.508 --> 52:10.634
No.

52:10.842 --> 52:13.178
He barely spoke.

52:13.929 --> 52:17.140
So he chained you up, you got free...

52:17.349 --> 52:20.936
...he stabbed you,
and then you beat him to death.

52:21.102 --> 52:23.480
As I stated, it was self-defence.

52:23.688 --> 52:27.526
Oh, I know.
Still, there was a lot of blood.

52:27.734 --> 52:31.029
I mean, I know it's not the first time
you've gotten your hands bloody.

52:31.863 --> 52:33.281
Are we finished?

52:33.490 --> 52:37.285
I wanna make sure what you're telling
me reflects what really happened.

52:37.702 --> 52:40.330
But, yeah, sure, we can be done.

52:40.539 --> 52:43.041
How is it that you were the one
that found me?

52:44.084 --> 52:45.794
I'm a cop.

52:46.002 --> 52:48.547
It's my job to follow through
on anonymous tips.

52:48.755 --> 52:50.465
Where was your backup?

52:50.674 --> 52:52.133
Lieutenant's prerogative.

52:52.801 --> 52:55.887
Doctor said I was in pretty bad shape
when you found me.

52:56.096 --> 52:57.347
Yep.

52:57.556 --> 53:03.103
So given your feelings about me,
why not just let me die?

53:04.855 --> 53:07.315
I was doing my job.

53:08.066 --> 53:09.901
Was it because of Dexter?

53:14.364 --> 53:15.782
No.

53:17.158 --> 53:20.996
I think it's about fucking time
I start doing things for myself.

53:22.956 --> 53:26.167
Maybe you can be fine with being
responsible for someone's death...

53:26.334 --> 53:28.587
...but I can't. That's...

53:28.795 --> 53:29.963
That's not who I am.

53:36.928 --> 53:38.471
I got here as fast as I could.

53:39.139 --> 53:40.891
Everything taken care of?

53:41.433 --> 53:44.436
All taken care of.

53:46.563 --> 53:48.648
Then I guess I'll go.

53:53.111 --> 53:54.696
You gonna be okay?

53:55.447 --> 53:58.450
Yeah. I'm gonna be fine.

54:09.252 --> 54:13.548
It's only 12 stitches.
I'm gonna be out of here tomorrow.

54:18.887 --> 54:21.139
God, you're shaking.

54:22.974 --> 54:27.354
When you asked me on my boat
if I'd ever been scared like that, I have.

54:28.855 --> 54:30.565
Twice.

54:33.860 --> 54:37.155
When I was 3,
seeing my mother murdered.

54:40.283 --> 54:42.452
And when I realised
these past few days...

54:42.661 --> 54:45.163
...that I might never see you again.

54:50.919 --> 54:53.213
Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?

54:53.755 --> 54:55.465
I don't know.

54:58.718 --> 55:02.764
I'm not sure what this is...

55:04.391 --> 55:05.433
...exactly.

55:05.642 --> 55:07.519
Or what's...

55:09.104 --> 55:10.730
...coming.

55:16.820 --> 55:20.240
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be.
Out of my control.

55:42.095 --> 55:45.181
All I know is that when I'm with you,
I feel...

55:51.855 --> 55:53.565
...safe.
