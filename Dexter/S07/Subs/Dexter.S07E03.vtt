WEBVTT

00:10.100 --> 00:11.810
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

00:13.103 --> 00:15.605
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it all the way.

00:15.814 --> 00:18.441
We're gonna eat together.
We're gonna watch TV together.

00:18.650 --> 00:21.861
We're gonna drive
to fucking work together.

00:22.987 --> 00:24.906
Why did you send me the hand?

00:25.115 --> 00:28.618
I came to you for help with my game
and you said no.

00:28.827 --> 00:30.954
Your game?

00:31.121 --> 00:35.792
Kaja was dating someone. Tony Rush.
He's one of the bosses here.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.212
The night that Kaja died,
she left the club with Viktor.

00:41.214 --> 00:44.592
Viktor never made his flight. I checked.

00:44.801 --> 00:47.053
Well, I don't understand.
Where is he, then?

00:51.224 --> 00:53.143
You loved her, didn't you?

00:53.351 --> 00:55.311
- What?
- Kaja.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.439
Maybe that's why
you talked to the police.

00:57.647 --> 00:59.899
You know what? I didn't say a word.

01:04.070 --> 01:06.948
This pretty face
belongs to Wayne Randall.

01:07.157 --> 01:09.784
Fifteen years ago,
Randall and his teenage girlfriend...

01:09.993 --> 01:13.037
...went on a three-state killing spree
that ended here in Miami.

01:13.246 --> 01:16.708
Hannah used to think
I was something special.

01:16.916 --> 01:19.878
Now she sees me as just a killer.

01:20.044 --> 01:22.380
There's just one last person
I need to kill.

01:25.592 --> 01:27.302
<i>Randall couldn't take life in prison.</i>

01:29.596 --> 01:31.306
<i>Can I?</i>

03:32.093 --> 03:34.053
Hey, excuse you.

03:34.262 --> 03:36.431
<i>I feel trapped,
like there's no escape.</i>

03:38.683 --> 03:40.852
<i>And it's not because
I'm at the post office.</i>

03:49.652 --> 03:52.739
<i>She's got me penned in
like</i> a <i>caged animal.</i>

03:52.906 --> 03:57.952
<i>And an animal is never more dangerous
than when it's backed into a corner.</i>

04:08.796 --> 04:10.465
Dexter.

04:10.673 --> 04:14.093
How much longer are you gonna be?
We have a briefing in 20 minutes.

04:15.178 --> 04:16.930
I'll be out in a minute, Deb.

04:17.138 --> 04:19.223
Why do you look so guilty?

04:19.891 --> 04:20.934
Next.

04:21.142 --> 04:22.644
<i>I can't do anything about Deb...</i>

04:22.852 --> 04:25.438
<i>...but there's one irritation
I can get rid of.</i>

04:27.190 --> 04:28.274
<i>Louis.</i>

04:47.877 --> 04:49.337
<i>The morning briefing.</i>

04:49.545 --> 04:53.716
<i>It's the only time Deb's looking
at everyone and not just me.</i>

04:54.968 --> 04:58.763
Let's get started. Batista, where are we
on the Mike Anderson investigation?

04:58.972 --> 05:01.140
Specifically with
Baskov Fuckwad-enov over here.

05:01.683 --> 05:04.185
We're still chasing our tail.
BOLO turned up squat...

05:04.352 --> 05:07.271
...so if Baskov is still in the U.S.,
he's gone way underground.

05:07.438 --> 05:08.898
If he did manage to leave...

05:09.107 --> 05:13.027
Okay, he's talking
but why's she staring at you?

05:14.028 --> 05:17.407
All right, well, let's keep digging around
the Russian expat community.

05:17.615 --> 05:21.077
If Baskov is hiding out locally,
then someone must be helping him.

05:21.285 --> 05:23.663
The club's owned
by Ukrainian business interests...

05:23.871 --> 05:27.500
...with ties to organised crime
so I wouldn't count on anybody...

05:27.667 --> 05:30.753
-...getting too talkative.
- She's still staring. Is she mad at you?

05:30.920 --> 05:34.424
Moving on, Simms and Miller brought
in a suspect on the I-95 shooting.

05:34.590 --> 05:37.218
Dexter, I'm gonna need you
to get a standard.

05:37.802 --> 05:40.096
I'm definitely picking up a chill
in her voice.

05:40.304 --> 05:42.974
You fucked up, didn't you? You did.
You screwed the pooch.

05:48.813 --> 05:50.815
We're coming up on the end
of the month.

05:51.024 --> 05:52.567
You guys are working open cases.

05:52.775 --> 05:54.694
If you need help, anything I can do...

05:54.902 --> 05:58.740
...make sure you're asking for it.
We need to get our numbers down.

06:00.324 --> 06:02.493
Okay.

06:03.202 --> 06:06.164
You're under arrest.
The DNA swab isn't optional.

06:06.330 --> 06:07.415
Fuck you.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.918
I can get
some uniforms to come in...

06:11.127 --> 06:12.879
...and hold your mouth open for you.

06:13.087 --> 06:16.883
What's the matter, you too much
of a pussy to do it yourself?

06:17.884 --> 06:21.846
No, I'm just on edge today.
You probably shouldn't push me.

06:22.013 --> 06:24.098
I am quaking in my boots.

06:28.936 --> 06:31.147
What the fuck?

06:32.940 --> 06:35.109
He was being very uncooperative.

06:35.318 --> 06:38.488
- He tried to kill me.
- Shut the fuck up. Get outside.

06:41.324 --> 06:42.366
Help.

06:45.244 --> 06:47.080
What the fuck is the matter with you?

06:47.288 --> 06:49.457
- You. Watching me all the time.
- Me?

06:49.624 --> 06:51.417
Living with you is driving me crazy.

06:51.626 --> 06:55.296
- I have to watch you, Dexter.
- Why? When I had the urge to--

06:55.797 --> 06:57.256
I called you.

06:57.465 --> 06:59.926
Didn't I? And you talked me down.
It worked.

07:00.093 --> 07:03.012
- Why can't you back off?
- Can you promise if I wasn't on you...

07:03.179 --> 07:04.222
...you wouldn't slip?

07:04.430 --> 07:07.183
If you don't get off my ass,
something bad is gonna happen.

07:07.350 --> 07:09.727
- What's that mean?
- If I don't control my need...

07:09.894 --> 07:12.647
-...it's gonna control me.
- I am trying to help you.

07:12.814 --> 07:16.818
- I am trying to help you control it.
- No, you're trying to suppress it.

07:17.110 --> 07:19.612
To lock it away.
But the lock is not gonna hold.

07:19.821 --> 07:21.781
You saw what happened in there.

07:21.989 --> 07:25.243
The only way I control it is to channel it
the way Harry taught me.

07:25.451 --> 07:27.829
No. I do not accept that.

07:28.037 --> 07:29.080
Dad was wrong.

07:29.789 --> 07:34.627
I'm not so sure. Sometimes I think
he knew me better than I know myself.

07:39.841 --> 07:42.301
Think about Harrison.

07:42.510 --> 07:44.387
What you could be exposing him to.

07:44.595 --> 07:47.140
I think about him all the time.

07:47.348 --> 07:50.101
Sooner or later,
this is gonna catch up to you...

07:50.309 --> 07:51.894
...and to him.

07:57.692 --> 07:58.943
I'll give you some space.

08:00.570 --> 08:01.779
I'll back off.

08:01.988 --> 08:03.656
Just hang in there with me, okay?

08:20.923 --> 08:24.302
<i>I can't go on like this,
living by Deb's rules.</i>

08:32.351 --> 08:35.688
<i>Ray Speltzer.
Just paroled for assault.</i>

08:35.897 --> 08:39.150
<i>But there have been
more serious charges.</i>

08:39.358 --> 08:42.987
<i>Ann Feig disappeared
after a date with Speltzer.</i>

08:43.654 --> 08:46.032
<i>And another date,
Nina Fleischer, turned up dead...</i>

08:46.240 --> 08:49.410
<i>...but the police
couldn't make anything stick.</i>

08:51.454 --> 08:54.749
<i>Did Nina lose her earring
in the struggle?</i>

08:59.295 --> 09:04.467
<i>Speltzer will most likely kill again
unless I take him out.</i>

09:07.929 --> 09:11.641
<i>A groundskeeper in a cemetery.
That's appropriate.</i>

09:11.849 --> 09:14.268
<i>But he didn't get those muscles
pushing a lawnmower.</i>

09:18.731 --> 09:22.193
<i>Speltzer's grown his hair,
but he seems no less hostile.</i>

09:24.403 --> 09:26.113
<i>ls Speltzer just blowing off steam...</i>

09:26.322 --> 09:29.825
...or <i>is this the ritual he goes through
before he kills?</i>

09:32.870 --> 09:35.206
- Hey, Deb.
- Hey, what are you up to?

09:35.414 --> 09:37.333
I'm just trying out a new gym.

09:37.541 --> 09:41.671
- What's wrong with the old one?
- Well, this one has a smoothie bar.

09:43.422 --> 09:44.840
Yeah.

09:45.049 --> 09:47.426
Look, I gotta go.
I wanna keep my heart rate up.

09:48.010 --> 09:50.137
<i>Thanks for checking in.</i>

10:03.776 --> 10:06.112
- Nadia.
- Hi, Joey.

10:06.279 --> 10:09.407
- What are you doing here?
- I came to ask you a favour.

10:09.573 --> 10:15.079
Another one? Oh, it's like giving milk
to a stray cat. Here, sit down.

10:15.830 --> 10:18.666
- I remind you of a dirty cat?
- No, no.

10:18.874 --> 10:22.545
I was trying to be clever,
which is sort of out of my wheelhouse.

10:23.671 --> 10:24.714
What can I do for you?

10:25.381 --> 10:28.092
Kaja was wearing a bracelet
the night she was killed.

10:28.301 --> 10:30.761
I know she would want
to be buried in it.

10:30.928 --> 10:32.763
It's the least I could do for my friend.

10:32.972 --> 10:35.099
If it's been cleared for DNA,
you can have it.

10:35.308 --> 10:38.894
I got a list of her personal effects.
Here we go.

10:42.565 --> 10:44.984
There's no bracelet listed.

10:45.192 --> 10:49.322
Are you sure?
I know she was wearing it that night.

10:49.947 --> 10:51.991
I don't know what you're implying...

10:52.199 --> 10:54.952
...but I'm the only dirty cop
in this station.

10:55.161 --> 10:56.746
And I didn't take it $0...

10:56.912 --> 11:00.750
A dirty cop is better than a dirty cat.

11:00.958 --> 11:03.002
- I believe you. Thanks.
- Wait.

11:03.210 --> 11:07.256
I was wondering if you'd like to
go outwith me sometime.

11:07.423 --> 11:09.925
Or you could come to my place
and I'll make you dinner.

11:10.468 --> 11:12.762
Why don't I cook you dinner?

11:13.262 --> 11:14.597
I was hoping you'd say that.

11:32.698 --> 11:34.533
Did you see the list
with your own eyes?

11:34.742 --> 11:36.619
Sit down.

11:37.495 --> 11:39.330
No.

11:39.497 --> 11:42.333
How do you know the detective
wasn't lying about the bracelet?

11:43.959 --> 11:46.170
Because he likes me.

11:47.880 --> 11:48.923
He likes you?

11:49.590 --> 11:51.384
Do you understand
what's at stake here?

11:51.592 --> 11:54.637
If the cops find that dead GPS chip
in that bracelet...

11:54.845 --> 11:57.556
...they're gonna figure out
we use them to track our mules.

11:57.765 --> 12:02.019
- And if they get on to our system--
- They'll shut down your heroin business.

12:02.269 --> 12:06.857
Which is a lot more lucrative than
the tits-and-ass business, Nadezhda.

12:07.024 --> 12:08.651
George...

12:09.110 --> 12:12.571
...maybe you should accept good news
when you hear it.

12:16.909 --> 12:20.204
Your name is Nadezhda,
but you go by Nadia.

12:20.413 --> 12:22.873
I always hated Nadezhda.

12:23.082 --> 12:24.708
You shouldn't.

12:24.917 --> 12:27.837
It's a beautiful Russian name.

12:28.587 --> 12:31.340
Did you know that
the greatest mezzo-soprano...

12:31.549 --> 12:34.468
...of the Bolshoi Theatre
was also named Nadezhda?

12:35.886 --> 12:39.432
- No.
- Nadezhda Obukhova.

12:40.057 --> 12:43.352
It was said that her voice could unlock
the mysteries of the heart.

12:44.562 --> 12:47.148
She died before I was born...

12:47.356 --> 12:50.276
...but I still listen to her recordings
of The Snow Maiden.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.533
My music teacher, Mr. Chillich...

12:58.701 --> 13:02.997
...he said to me,
"lsaak, you think you're strong...

13:03.205 --> 13:05.416
...but you are not strong
if you don't feel."

13:07.793 --> 13:09.295
He gave me an F...

13:09.503 --> 13:11.464
...so I pushed him down
a flight of stairs.

13:11.672 --> 13:13.215
I felt bad about it.

13:14.300 --> 13:20.181
After that, my father shipped me off
to a disciplinary school in England.

13:20.347 --> 13:23.559
Now I'm afraid my love of opera...

13:23.767 --> 13:26.854
...is all that's left of my sensitive side.

13:30.107 --> 13:32.234
I want you to get close
to this detective.

13:32.443 --> 13:35.070
Find out what the police know
about Viktor.

13:36.238 --> 13:39.241
You'll do that for me, won't you,
Nadezhda?

13:40.284 --> 13:41.619
Good.

13:44.413 --> 13:46.290
You can go now.

14:04.475 --> 14:06.477
Viktor is smart.

14:07.186 --> 14:10.231
He probably took the bracelet
to keep the police from getting it.

14:10.439 --> 14:12.608
He probably has it
and is hiding out somewhere.

14:12.816 --> 14:16.320
But we'll never know because
the signal died over a week ago.

14:16.529 --> 14:18.822
With technology,
there's always a way.

14:19.031 --> 14:21.867
Find the IT man
who set the system up.

14:22.076 --> 14:24.453
If we can track the bracelet...

14:25.204 --> 14:27.331
...we can find Viktor.

14:33.837 --> 14:36.799
So she called and I said,
"Okay, let's do a double-dater."

14:37.967 --> 14:40.427
Five p.m., we're laying down there
on the couch...

14:40.636 --> 14:43.013
...and I feel this hand
kind of go up my back.

14:43.222 --> 14:46.016
<i>This is what my life has become?</i>

14:57.152 --> 15:00.322
<i>Time to start prying one monkey
off my back.</i>

15:00.531 --> 15:03.117
Got a package here addressed
to Miami Metro forensics.

15:03.325 --> 15:04.702
Oh, yeah, I'll take it.

15:04.910 --> 15:07.079
- There you go.
- Thanks.

15:07.288 --> 15:11.083
I think I drunk-ordered from the Hustler
store and that never turns out well.

15:22.511 --> 15:23.554
What the fuck?

15:37.192 --> 15:40.112
"Dear Mr. Greene, when I bought
the Ice Truck Killer's hand...

15:40.279 --> 15:43.741
...I assumed it would be in mint condition,
not with lines over its palm.

15:43.907 --> 15:46.243
Please refund my money immediately."

15:50.664 --> 15:52.541
You had the hand the whole time?

15:52.750 --> 15:54.668
And you sold it online?

15:54.877 --> 15:57.171
- No, I swear--
- After all I've done for you...

15:57.338 --> 15:58.964
...you stab me in the fucking back?

15:59.173 --> 16:01.342
- You are so fucking fired.
- Vince. You gotta--

16:01.508 --> 16:02.843
Out. Now.

16:21.070 --> 16:22.696
I have the worst luck with interns.

16:24.281 --> 16:27.576
<i>One more step and Louis
will be out of my life for good.</i>

16:28.285 --> 16:32.081
<i>Now to focus on where
I can find Speltzer next.</i>

16:33.165 --> 16:36.377
Lieutenant, I have someone here
who'd like to speak to you.

16:36.585 --> 16:39.046
This is Donna Randall.

16:39.254 --> 16:40.714
Wayne's mama.

16:40.923 --> 16:44.009
The one who suicided out there
on the highway.

16:44.760 --> 16:48.681
Ms. Randall, I'm so sorry for your loss.
How can I help you?

16:48.889 --> 16:50.974
It's me might be able to help you.

16:51.183 --> 16:54.978
I got some stuff here
that might interest you.

16:55.187 --> 16:59.191
Wayne sent it to me 15 years ago,
just before he got caught.

16:59.400 --> 17:03.028
He said it was some sentimental items
and would I hold it for him...

17:03.195 --> 17:06.281
...till he got settled someplace
away from the law.

17:06.490 --> 17:09.118
Ms. Randall, why didn't you
turn this over years ago?

17:09.326 --> 17:11.245
Look, I know my boy did wrong...

17:11.453 --> 17:14.873
...but I wasn't about to help
the state of Florida kill him.

17:15.541 --> 17:17.543
Anyway, now that he's gone...

17:17.751 --> 17:22.005
...I figured maybe something in there
might help bring some...

17:23.048 --> 17:25.634
...peace to the families,
you know, of the victims.

17:25.843 --> 17:30.097
It's mostly just junk
that Wayne and that girl...

17:30.305 --> 17:31.932
...collected on their little tear.

17:32.516 --> 17:36.729
There was some cash in there too
but I spent that ages ago.

17:37.563 --> 17:40.149
It might be a waste of time
but have the lab go over it.

17:40.357 --> 17:43.026
Just when you think a case is closed,
it pops open again.

17:44.069 --> 17:46.613
Another book of matches
from Stuckey's.

17:46.822 --> 17:50.159
You would think one memory
of that place would be enough.

17:51.493 --> 17:52.745
Anything interesting?

17:52.953 --> 17:54.371
Not so far.

17:54.580 --> 17:58.834
One tightly wrapped
young woman's T-shirt.

17:59.042 --> 18:04.006
And inside,
we have a little plastic giraffe.

18:07.426 --> 18:09.845
And a lighter.

18:10.846 --> 18:12.931
And a necklace.

18:13.140 --> 18:16.143
It looks like more of the same
but why was that stuff wrapped up?

18:16.351 --> 18:18.937
Maybe they have a special meaning.

18:19.938 --> 18:21.815
"Janice."

18:21.982 --> 18:23.859
Name of the woman
Randall said he killed.

18:24.067 --> 18:26.904
- Might be a trophy.
- Means Wayne was telling the truth.

18:27.112 --> 18:29.072
Her body must be buried out there
someplace.

18:29.239 --> 18:32.534
If the giraffe and lighter are trophies too
there might be more bodies.

18:32.743 --> 18:35.704
I just got a call. The bouncer
from the Fox Hole, Tony Rush...

18:35.913 --> 18:38.415
...they found him with a screwdriver
through his head.

18:38.582 --> 18:39.750
We just interviewed him.

18:39.917 --> 18:42.961
The Koshka Brotherhood were
trying to send a message about oops.

18:43.128 --> 18:45.422
Just got that much harder
to find who killed Mike.

18:45.631 --> 18:49.134
No matter what we do,
there's always another body.

18:51.720 --> 18:52.930
Yo, Mary Poppins, wait up.

18:53.138 --> 18:55.265
Deb, I'm not gonna
be home for dinner tonight.

18:55.474 --> 18:57.100
I'm gonna hit the new gym.

19:09.655 --> 19:12.491
Hey, babe. What's going on?

19:12.950 --> 19:15.577
I'm just watching a video.

19:15.786 --> 19:17.538
Wanna see it?

19:19.581 --> 19:23.085
<i>Idea: a video diary app.</i>

19:23.252 --> 19:26.839
<i>One touch, device starts recording.
Tap again and it uploads directly to--</i>

19:28.882 --> 19:30.467
<i>Still waiting.</i>

19:30.676 --> 19:32.135
<i>Yeah, I'm almost done.</i>

19:32.344 --> 19:36.473
<i>Your hour's almost up.
I'm only thinking of you.</i>

19:41.979 --> 19:44.189
<i>Oh, God.</i>

19:45.065 --> 19:47.359
<i>There will never be an app for this.</i>

19:47.526 --> 19:49.987
That was before we started dating.

19:50.737 --> 19:54.658
You're wearing the shirt I gave you
for your birthday, asshole.

19:54.825 --> 19:58.078
It was a hooker.
It's not cheating if you pay for it.

19:58.287 --> 20:00.914
Oh, my God, you are a pig.

20:01.123 --> 20:04.960
If I catch anything from you,
I'm gonna kill you.

20:05.752 --> 20:07.212
How did you get that disc?

20:07.421 --> 20:10.924
It was mailed to me anonymously,
probably by your hooker.

20:11.133 --> 20:14.011
- What did you do, cancel her cheque?
- Dexter sent it.

20:14.219 --> 20:17.222
Dexter? He broke into your apartment
and he stole your porno?

20:17.431 --> 20:21.018
Yeah, and he just got me fired.
He's trying to ruin my life.

20:21.226 --> 20:26.273
You are fucking crazy.
I don't ever wanna see you again.

20:29.693 --> 20:30.736
Fuck!

20:40.787 --> 20:44.583
Gym, huh? Lying little shit.

20:54.301 --> 20:57.679
- Morgan.
- Ordered you a beer.

20:58.430 --> 20:59.806
You knew I was following you.

21:01.475 --> 21:02.768
I made it easy for you.

21:09.149 --> 21:10.734
You lured me here.

21:10.943 --> 21:12.361
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

21:12.903 --> 21:14.279
Little attitude adjuster.

21:14.488 --> 21:16.907
Think I'm gonna need
a little more adjusting.

21:17.699 --> 21:19.618
What's this about?

21:22.788 --> 21:24.748
- Do you remember this case?
- Yeah.

21:24.957 --> 21:27.376
Ray Speltzer, he was guilty as fuck...

21:27.584 --> 21:30.253
...probably of two murders
but we couldn't prove it.

21:30.420 --> 21:32.339
I think he's getting ready
to do it again.

21:32.547 --> 21:35.175
- What are you talking about?
- He shaved his head today.

21:37.803 --> 21:40.806
His head had been recently shaved...

21:41.014 --> 21:44.476
...when he was questioned
about Ann Feig's disappearance...

21:44.643 --> 21:47.729
...and when he was arrested
for Nina Fleischer's murder.

21:47.938 --> 21:51.108
I think it's part of his killing ritual.

21:51.775 --> 21:55.153
I think he's hunting his next victim
right now.

21:55.362 --> 21:57.656
How the fuck would you know that?

22:05.414 --> 22:07.416
Christ on a fucking cracker, Dexter.

22:07.624 --> 22:10.002
You got me here
to help you stalk Speltzer...

22:10.210 --> 22:12.796
-...so you could kill him?
- I don't need you to help me.

22:12.963 --> 22:15.340
- I just need you to understand--
- Goddamn it.

22:15.549 --> 22:17.843
- Deb, sit down.
- This is not what we agreed to.

22:18.051 --> 22:21.263
- You fucking lied to me.
- Not here. Come on.

22:23.015 --> 22:25.559
Get the fuck off.

22:28.145 --> 22:30.188
Deb, I lured you here
because I thought...

22:30.355 --> 22:32.524
...maybe if I let you in
on my process...

22:32.691 --> 22:35.861
...you'd appreciate that there
is some value to what I do.

22:36.028 --> 22:38.155
I don't believe this.
You want my approval?

22:38.947 --> 22:41.700
I wanna continue
to be honest with you, Deb.

22:41.908 --> 22:43.493
I have to be free to be who I am.

22:43.702 --> 22:46.121
It is a capital of fence
to be who you are, Dexter.

22:46.288 --> 22:48.623
I'm taking out the trash.

22:48.790 --> 22:51.835
Trash that would otherwise
be left to putrefy.

22:52.044 --> 22:55.047
I know I've said this,
but there is a legal system for that.

22:55.213 --> 22:57.591
Speltzer got off.
That doesn't mean it doesn't work.

22:57.799 --> 23:00.969
If it worked as well as you think it does,
I wouldn't be so busy.

23:01.970 --> 23:03.889
Dad knew that.

23:04.097 --> 23:06.224
Dad taught me that.

23:08.977 --> 23:11.229
What is it about your personal law...

23:11.438 --> 23:15.484
...that is so much better than the one
that the rest of us agree to live by?

23:15.650 --> 23:18.236
- Sometimes it is.
- How?

23:18.445 --> 23:22.574
Speltzer would have to murder somebody
for you to arrest him. I can stop him.

23:22.783 --> 23:26.203
Are you trying to tell me that's why
you do this, so you can save lives?

23:27.496 --> 23:30.165
End result is the same.
Some girl is gonna be dead soon...

23:30.373 --> 23:34.377
-...if I don't take Speltzer out.
- Based on what fucking evidence, Dexter?

23:34.586 --> 23:35.629
A haircut?

23:36.546 --> 23:38.048
Dexter, you can't kill people...

23:38.256 --> 23:40.926
-...you think might murder.
- That is not how I do things.

23:41.134 --> 23:43.261
You can't prove
that he killed Nina Fleischer.

23:43.470 --> 23:45.222
I will. I'm not done vetting him yet.

23:45.430 --> 23:47.682
- Vetting?
- I am trying to tell you...

23:47.891 --> 23:51.853
...that I will not kill Speltzer until
I am absolutely sure that he is guilty.

23:52.020 --> 23:55.148
Oh, fuck. No. I...

23:55.607 --> 23:56.650
This is done.

23:58.026 --> 24:01.988
And nothing better happen
to that bald piece of shit over there.

24:10.539 --> 24:12.916
<i>I'm not done with Speltzer.</i>

24:13.083 --> 24:15.001
<i>I've been out roaming free and I like it.</i>

24:17.003 --> 24:19.881
<i>I just have to find the proof
that will convince Deb.</i>

24:26.972 --> 24:29.724
<i>Speltzer went in that mausoleum
20 minutes ago.</i>

24:33.728 --> 24:36.106
<i>Since when does a groundskeeper
keep the grounds...</i>

24:37.190 --> 24:40.402
<i>...inside a private tomb?</i>

24:55.333 --> 24:58.003
<i>Why is this mausoleum so special?</i>

25:15.353 --> 25:18.064
<i>The last body interred here
was over 50 years ago.</i>

25:18.273 --> 25:21.818
<i>If it was a friend of Speltzer's,
then Ray is holding up really well.</i>

25:29.993 --> 25:31.703
<i>- Hey, Deb.
- Why aren't you at work?</i>

25:31.912 --> 25:33.955
- I'm kind of in the middle of--
- I <i>need</i> you.

25:34.122 --> 25:36.958
Okay, okay. Yeah, I'll be right there.

25:37.167 --> 25:39.753
<i>- Now, Dexter.</i>
- Bye.

25:50.847 --> 25:52.140
What's up?

25:52.307 --> 25:54.601
Fortunately, we set up
a secure cloud framework...

25:54.768 --> 25:56.353
...that syncs up to the receivers.

25:56.561 --> 25:58.897
You're able to reconstruct
the GPS tracking points?

25:59.105 --> 26:00.815
Now get to the point, the bracelet.

26:01.399 --> 26:03.360
Chip kept moving
after the girl was dead.

26:03.568 --> 26:05.487
- Where?
- Viktor's apartment.

26:06.238 --> 26:09.574
- And from there?
- Miami airport.

26:09.783 --> 26:11.868
Then a marina.

26:13.536 --> 26:17.040
Then eight miles out to sea,
where the signal stopped.

26:19.251 --> 26:22.045
Maybe he took a boat offshore
to avoid the police...

26:22.254 --> 26:25.382
-...and then he threw the bracelet--
- He's dead.

26:25.882 --> 26:28.176
He was dumped in the ocean
like a load of garbage.

26:30.053 --> 26:33.056
Whoever killed him
left from this marina.

26:36.101 --> 26:38.061
Can you pinpoint the exact slip?

26:38.812 --> 26:39.896
I'll need some time.

26:43.358 --> 26:45.235
It's worth the wait.

26:49.364 --> 26:51.533
Okay, I'm here.

26:52.409 --> 26:54.828
You don't have to fire me.

26:56.162 --> 26:58.373
Tell me you weren't stalking
Ray Speltzer.

26:58.915 --> 27:01.501
I was at the cemetery
where he works as a groundskeeper.

27:01.668 --> 27:02.711
Goddamn it, Dexter.

27:02.877 --> 27:07.090
He was lingering inside a mausoleum,
treating it like it was sacred ground.

27:07.257 --> 27:09.092
I think he's hiding something
in there...

27:09.259 --> 27:12.929
-...something that may prove his guilt.
-"I think he may." That's not evidence.

27:13.138 --> 27:16.224
I'd already have the evidence
if you hadn't ordered me back here.

27:16.433 --> 27:19.728
But even without it,
I can tell Speltzer's gonna kill again.

27:19.936 --> 27:22.731
An alarm is going off
inside my lizard brain.

27:22.939 --> 27:25.066
Great, now my brother
has a lizard brain.

27:25.275 --> 27:28.486
The amygdala. The most primitive part
of the brain that senses danger.

27:28.695 --> 27:31.281
- Harry taught me to listen to mine.
- You'll excuse me...

27:31.489 --> 27:33.742
...if I don't put my faith
in your amygdala.

27:33.950 --> 27:38.038
But you already have, Deb,
dozens of times.

27:38.246 --> 27:40.332
All the murderers
I've helped you catch...

27:40.540 --> 27:43.209
...who got brought down
because of my hunches.

27:44.127 --> 27:46.921
My lizard brain has been
your secret weapon all along.

27:47.088 --> 27:49.132
You just didn't know it.

27:51.718 --> 27:55.180
- You're fucking with my head.
- Don't take it on faith. I'll give you proof.

27:55.388 --> 27:57.390
I'll go break into the mausoleum
right now.

27:57.557 --> 28:00.143
No. If you're right
and get the evidence illegally...

28:00.352 --> 28:03.855
-...then I can't use it in court.
- That doesn't make it any less true.

28:04.064 --> 28:08.401
- Which is why you need to let me do it.
- No, we follow the law, remember?

28:08.568 --> 28:09.778
I'll get a search warrant.

28:09.944 --> 28:13.031
If evidence is there, I'll put him away
before he can hurt anyone.

28:13.239 --> 28:15.116
You're not listening. There isn't time.

28:15.325 --> 28:17.994
I just said that I will take care of this.

28:19.079 --> 28:22.082
Do not fuck with me on this,
or I swear to God...

28:22.290 --> 28:23.708
...I will take us both down.

28:25.543 --> 28:27.420
Am I being clear this time?

28:27.629 --> 28:29.506
- Yeah, that's pretty clear.
- Good.

28:29.714 --> 28:31.925
Now I have a job for you.

28:32.133 --> 28:34.511
I need you to go with Batista
to visit Hannah McKay.

28:34.719 --> 28:37.931
- What?
- Randall's sidekick from his killing spree.

28:38.098 --> 28:40.433
If we're gonna find those bodies,
we need her help.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.435
That's the detective's job.
Why do I go?

28:42.602 --> 28:45.605
I need her DNA. She was a minor
at the time of the crime...

28:45.772 --> 28:47.982
...so she was able
to get her record expunged.

28:48.191 --> 28:50.568
You're giving me work
to keep me away from Speltzer.

28:50.735 --> 28:52.529
It's important we find those bodies.

28:52.737 --> 28:55.615
And yes, I am trying to keep you
away from Speltzer.

28:57.492 --> 29:00.495
- Dexter, ready to roll?
- Yeah.

29:02.580 --> 29:05.166
We just gotta make a quick stop
on the way.

29:19.806 --> 29:21.182
You piece of shit.

29:21.391 --> 29:23.601
I know what you people
did to Tony Rush.

29:24.936 --> 29:26.771
Excuse me.

29:27.522 --> 29:31.276
You wanna talk to me?
How about we do it in my office?

29:46.249 --> 29:49.127
You're making me nervous.
Why don't you sit down?

29:49.335 --> 29:52.881
- I'm waiting for someone.
- Aren't we all?

29:53.047 --> 29:55.758
Doesn't mean we can't enjoy ourselves
in the meantime.

29:55.925 --> 29:58.094
Have a drink, or a lap dance...

29:58.303 --> 30:00.805
...or festoon a thong
with neatly folded dollar bills.

30:01.014 --> 30:02.098
Yeah, I'm fine.

30:02.932 --> 30:06.769
So you're not interested in alcohol
or looking at naked women.

30:07.395 --> 30:09.731
You may be in the wrong place.

30:10.773 --> 30:13.067
I could say the same of you.
What brings you here?

30:13.276 --> 30:18.364
- Me? I'm looking for something.
- Aren't we all?

30:20.783 --> 30:24.287
- So we're both here just killing time.
- Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing.

30:24.496 --> 30:26.664
Killing time.

30:29.375 --> 30:32.378
Ironic, isn't it? We're both here
for a different reason...

30:32.587 --> 30:35.882
...than these other leering cretins
and yet the net result is the same.

30:37.091 --> 30:38.259
And what's that?

30:40.637 --> 30:42.555
We're frustrated.

30:51.523 --> 30:53.441
Let's go.

30:53.900 --> 30:56.528
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

31:05.912 --> 31:08.540
So Hannah McKay.

31:08.748 --> 31:10.542
Were you around
for the spree killings?

31:10.750 --> 31:13.169
I was still in uniform
but I remember it pretty well.

31:13.378 --> 31:16.130
Hannah was, like, 15
when she ran off with Randall.

31:16.339 --> 31:19.801
She wasn't in on the murders,
just a kid who fell for the wrong guy.

31:20.009 --> 31:22.887
She testified against him
for a reduced sentence.

31:23.096 --> 31:25.223
Did six years in juvie.

31:25.431 --> 31:28.476
Since she got out, she's laid low.
Now she owns this nursery.

31:28.685 --> 31:31.229
Sounds like she really managed
to change her life.

31:31.437 --> 31:35.149
Yeah, I think I envy her.

31:35.358 --> 31:37.777
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

31:37.986 --> 31:39.821
Since Mike's death,
I've been thinking...

31:40.029 --> 31:43.491
...maybe there's more to life.
I used to think murder police was it.

31:43.658 --> 31:47.328
Maybe there's something else out there
for me. Something new and exciting.

31:47.537 --> 31:49.664
<i>And sometimes
there's nothing more exciting...</i>

31:49.872 --> 31:52.834
<i>...than getting back
what you had and lost.</i>

31:53.042 --> 31:54.669
Can I help you?

31:56.588 --> 31:58.506
- Ms. McKay?
- That's right.

32:00.842 --> 32:02.719
Sergeant Batista, Miami Metro.

32:02.927 --> 32:05.096
I'd like to talk to you
about Wayne Randall.

32:05.305 --> 32:07.390
What a surprise.

32:08.057 --> 32:10.101
He's the detective. What are you?

32:10.310 --> 32:12.353
- Lab geek.
- This just gets better and better.

32:12.562 --> 32:15.356
I'm sorry, I'm a sergeant
and this is Dexter Morgan.

32:15.565 --> 32:17.650
He's a forensic analyst.

32:17.859 --> 32:21.112
I've said everything I have to say
about Wayne Randall.

32:21.321 --> 32:24.198
It was a long time ago
and I just wanna put it behind me.

32:24.407 --> 32:27.035
Ma'am, this is very important.

32:27.243 --> 32:29.537
Now, I could bring you
in to the station house...

32:29.704 --> 32:32.165
...but I'd rather not put you out
if I don't have to.

32:32.332 --> 32:35.752
Fine. But I have work to do.

32:42.342 --> 32:44.510
So you know nothing
about these other people...

32:44.719 --> 32:46.929
...that Wayne claimed to have killed
and buried?

32:47.138 --> 32:50.308
- How is that possible?
- We weren't joined at the hip.

32:50.516 --> 32:53.519
I don't know what he did
when I wasn't with him.

32:55.396 --> 32:57.940
Careful. The leaves are sharp.

33:01.736 --> 33:03.237
How do you stand this humidity?

33:03.446 --> 33:05.782
If it bothered me,
I'd be growing cacti.

33:05.990 --> 33:08.660
- Are we done?
- Not quite.

33:09.577 --> 33:12.205
Wayne's mother recently
brought in a bag of mementos...

33:12.372 --> 33:14.666
-...from your time together.
- Lovely woman.

33:14.874 --> 33:16.668
Mind taking a look at these photos...

33:16.834 --> 33:19.128
...and letting me know
if you recognise anything?

33:19.295 --> 33:21.172
Yes. Yes, I would mind, detective.

33:21.339 --> 33:24.175
- Sergeant.
- Sergeant, I'm sorry.

33:25.093 --> 33:27.595
Look, I feel terrible
about what happened back then.

33:27.804 --> 33:33.685
It's something that I have to live with
for the rest of my life and I deserve that.

33:34.143 --> 33:37.313
But the only way that
I have been able to survive...

33:37.522 --> 33:39.107
...is to move on with my life.

33:40.566 --> 33:42.777
What about the families of the victims?

33:42.985 --> 33:45.321
Don't you think
they deserve some closure?

33:45.530 --> 33:48.866
Absolutely, but they're not
gonna get it from me.

33:49.075 --> 33:50.785
I've told you everything that I know.

33:50.993 --> 33:55.498
Now I would appreciate it
if you would both just leave me alone.

33:56.791 --> 33:58.459
Fine.

33:59.085 --> 34:01.796
But before we go, my colleague
has to get a DNA sample...

34:01.963 --> 34:03.798
-...from you to exclude--
- I understand.

34:04.006 --> 34:07.260
I understand more about police work
than I care to.

34:07.885 --> 34:11.639
You wanna show me that court order
in your back pocket, Mr. Morgan?

34:19.856 --> 34:21.816
Dexter's fine.

34:22.066 --> 34:24.026
If I were you,
I'd stick with "Mr. Morgan."

34:25.570 --> 34:26.654
Please be quick.

34:28.906 --> 34:30.867
I Will.

34:34.662 --> 34:38.207
If you don't mind, I'm gonna go
and crank up the AC in the car.

34:38.416 --> 34:40.126
Nice to meet you, Ms. McKay.

34:44.297 --> 34:47.967
All right, I'm just gonna
get a quick swab from your cheek.

34:48.176 --> 34:49.343
This won't hurt.

34:49.552 --> 34:52.847
But then you probably know that.

34:59.020 --> 35:00.772
Shit.

35:00.980 --> 35:02.356
You do this for a living?

35:04.484 --> 35:06.152
Sorry.

35:25.338 --> 35:26.756
Okay.

35:31.886 --> 35:32.970
That should do it.

35:33.679 --> 35:35.264
Thanks, Ms. McKay.

35:36.182 --> 35:38.684
- Hannah.
- No, you were right.

35:38.851 --> 35:41.979
I think we should keep things
on a last-name basis.

35:53.533 --> 35:56.202
How would you like
to catch this fuck?

36:01.791 --> 36:03.084
Ray Speltzer.

36:03.584 --> 36:07.046
- I still lose sleep over this one.
- He's hiding something in a mausoleum...

36:07.255 --> 36:09.674
...that might connect him
to Nina Fleischer's murder.

36:09.882 --> 36:12.051
I can't get Judge Perez
to sign a warrant...

36:12.260 --> 36:15.555
...so I need you to wet the wheels
a little bit.

36:15.763 --> 36:17.974
What was your probable cause?

36:18.182 --> 36:20.518
There's some circumstantial stuff.

36:20.726 --> 36:23.145
It's thin...

36:23.354 --> 36:25.773
...but basically,
Speltzer is setting off an alarm...

36:25.982 --> 36:27.066
...in my lizard brain.

36:28.526 --> 36:29.652
Interesting.

36:30.736 --> 36:32.446
So you'll talk to Perez?

36:32.655 --> 36:35.908
No, not on behalf of your lizard brain.

36:36.909 --> 36:40.079
- I know it sounds fucked up.
- Look, Debra...

36:40.288 --> 36:41.706
...I think you're a good cop.

36:41.914 --> 36:44.417
If you think this is worth pursuing,
I trust you...

36:44.584 --> 36:47.253
...but that's not gonna get you
a warrant.

36:47.461 --> 36:49.463
Tried getting permission
from the family...

36:49.672 --> 36:52.091
-...who owns the mausoleum?
- I can't track them down.

36:52.300 --> 36:57.096
- Stay on it. You'll find someone.
- If you knew there was a murderer...

36:57.263 --> 37:00.099
...and you could do something
to stop him before he killed...

37:01.183 --> 37:02.810
...could you let it go?

37:05.313 --> 37:07.440
We're the police, Debra.

37:08.441 --> 37:09.817
We have to follow the law.

37:17.992 --> 37:20.077
You could put a patrol car on Speltzer.

37:20.661 --> 37:22.163
Watch him.

37:22.371 --> 37:24.790
But I better not see it on the budget.

37:46.187 --> 37:47.813
That one.

37:55.154 --> 37:57.907
Nice boat, you arrogant asshole.

37:58.115 --> 38:00.743
Too bad it won't be afloat too long.

38:00.952 --> 38:03.871
Kiss my ass, you ginger freak.

38:04.664 --> 38:06.415
Is this your boat?

38:07.500 --> 38:10.378
Yeah, this is my boat.
That's why I'm on it.

38:13.631 --> 38:14.674
Who are you?

38:15.508 --> 38:18.302
Are you a cop
or some kind of security?

38:18.928 --> 38:19.971
Who are you?

38:20.846 --> 38:23.224
I don't have to tell you anything.
Show me a badge.

38:23.391 --> 38:26.519
- Why did you kill Viktor?
- What? What are you talking about?

38:26.727 --> 38:29.230
- Hey, just get the fuck out of here.
- I want answers.

38:29.397 --> 38:31.440
I will call the cops--

38:36.862 --> 38:38.739
I am gonna put your eyes out.

38:38.948 --> 38:42.827
Now, the trick is,
to keep from drilling into your brain.

38:48.124 --> 38:50.334
Look, look, I don't...

38:51.127 --> 38:53.879
Look, I don't know anything.

38:54.088 --> 38:56.924
Look, I didn't kill anyone. I swear.
This isn't even my boat.

38:58.676 --> 39:00.553
Why did you say it was?

39:00.761 --> 39:03.055
It belongs to this douchebag
named Dexter Morgan.

39:03.264 --> 39:04.598
I hate this guy's guts.

39:04.807 --> 39:06.642
I came down so I could sink his boat.

39:07.643 --> 39:10.229
- Who is Dexter Morgan?
- Like I said, he's just a jerk...

39:10.396 --> 39:12.982
...who works for Miami Metro Homicide.

39:18.529 --> 39:21.365
Now, can I please go?

39:25.661 --> 39:27.121
Yes.

39:31.584 --> 39:33.377
Get rid of him.

40:15.086 --> 40:17.129
<i>- Morgan.
- Lieutenant. This is Officer Hewitt.</i>

40:17.296 --> 40:18.798
<i>We followed Speltzer home.</i>

40:19.006 --> 40:21.008
<i>There's been no activity
for over two hours.</i>

40:21.217 --> 40:24.220
<i>Seems like he's in for the night.
We just got dispatched on a 211.</i>

40:24.428 --> 40:27.139
<i>Can we take it?
Or do you want us to stay on Speltzer?</i>

40:27.348 --> 40:29.058
Negative on Speltzer. Take the 211.

40:29.266 --> 40:31.852
<i>- Copy that. Good night, lieutenant.
- Good night.</i>

40:33.395 --> 40:36.107
This is a waste of fucking manpower.

40:36.315 --> 40:39.819
My father worked sometimes
three jobs to take care of us so...

40:40.027 --> 40:43.114
...I decided the best way I could help
was to leave home...

40:43.280 --> 40:46.117
...so he has one less mouth to feed.

40:47.076 --> 40:50.121
He'd be so ashamed if he knew
what I do to make money.

40:50.329 --> 40:53.874
Hey. You're not gonna be stripper
your whole life, right?

40:54.083 --> 40:56.877
No, I have big dreams.

40:57.545 --> 41:00.631
I want to start my own
dog-walking business.

41:02.383 --> 41:06.387
No matter what happens,
rich people will always be lazy...

41:06.595 --> 41:08.722
...and they will always have dogs.

41:12.643 --> 41:13.686
What's wrong?

41:13.894 --> 41:17.106
I like you, Joey.
I don't want to lie to you.

41:19.191 --> 41:20.818
About what?

41:22.862 --> 41:25.948
My bosses at the club...

41:26.824 --> 41:29.618
...they ordered me to get close to you...

41:29.827 --> 41:33.497
...so I could find out
what the police know about...

41:33.706 --> 41:36.458
...Viktor Baskov
and their business dealings.

41:36.667 --> 41:38.627
So that's why you said yes
to the date?

41:38.836 --> 41:41.547
No, I said yes before
they told me to do this.

41:42.506 --> 41:46.760
- So then you do really like me?
- Yes.

41:47.219 --> 41:49.471
But I'm scared.

41:49.805 --> 41:52.433
These men are dangerous.

41:52.641 --> 41:54.894
I can't go back to them with nothing.

41:55.102 --> 41:56.187
Don't be scared.

41:56.395 --> 41:58.606
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

42:01.734 --> 42:03.194
Look...

42:06.405 --> 42:09.867
...maybe there's a way
we could help each other out.

42:10.534 --> 42:11.869
What do you mean?

42:12.077 --> 42:15.206
Well, I could give you
enough information...

42:15.414 --> 42:18.876
-...to keep your bosses happy.
- What if the other cops find out?

42:19.084 --> 42:20.544
They won't.

42:21.170 --> 42:25.216
And, in return, if you hear anything
around the club...

42:25.424 --> 42:28.052
...about Mike Anderson's murder...

42:28.260 --> 42:30.804
...you pass it along to me.

42:31.722 --> 42:32.765
I can do that.

42:34.516 --> 42:35.851
I'm still worried for you.

42:36.018 --> 42:38.604
You should not get involved
with the Koshka Brotherhood.

42:38.812 --> 42:40.940
Don't worry about me.

42:41.523 --> 42:44.818
If I can protect you
and catch a cop killer...

42:45.027 --> 42:47.863
...it's worth sticking my neck
out a little.

42:50.532 --> 42:52.243
It is a nice neck.

43:26.110 --> 43:28.153
Hey, Ray. I got off work early...

43:28.362 --> 43:30.281
...thought I'd take you up
on your offer.

43:31.240 --> 43:35.160
Well, you will not be disappointed.
I make the best mojito in Miami.

43:35.369 --> 43:36.912
Awesome.

43:59.310 --> 44:03.063
<i>Looks like Speltzer's taken over
the family shrine.</i>

44:05.816 --> 44:07.484
<i>Nina Fleischer's missing earring.</i>

44:07.693 --> 44:12.031
<i>She didn't lose it in the struggle.
Speltzer took it as a trophy.</i>

44:12.239 --> 44:14.950
<i>If I take it, he'll know I was here.</i>

44:15.617 --> 44:17.953
<i>But I can still show it to Deb.</i>

44:27.880 --> 44:30.382
<i>No cell service in a mausoleum.</i>

44:37.014 --> 44:38.057
Goddamn it.

44:42.102 --> 44:43.604
<i>This is Dexter. Leave a message.</i>

44:43.771 --> 44:45.689
Dex, it's me.
I just wanna let you know...

44:45.856 --> 44:47.775
...I'm gonna be late
getting home tonight.

44:47.983 --> 44:51.653
You've got me paranoid about Speltzer
so I'm gonna drive by his house...

44:51.862 --> 44:54.073
...make sure he's tucked in
for the night.

44:54.281 --> 44:57.242
Thank you for fucking up
my evening, bro.

45:03.582 --> 45:07.294
So how long did you say
you've been here?

45:07.461 --> 45:08.504
A few days.

45:09.588 --> 45:12.257
I promise I'm going furniture
shopping this weekend.

45:12.466 --> 45:14.968
I mean, you could have
at least taken the plastic off.

45:15.177 --> 45:16.387
I'll get around to it.

45:16.595 --> 45:18.389
Have a seat.

45:20.140 --> 45:21.433
Okay.

45:27.147 --> 45:30.275
- How about some music?
- Soon.

45:31.860 --> 45:33.320
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

45:34.029 --> 45:35.948
I'll get us a drink.

46:08.063 --> 46:09.982
- Ray.
- Yeah?

46:10.190 --> 46:13.402
I gotta be honest with you.
This mojito sucks.

46:13.569 --> 46:16.155
There's, like, no alcohol in it.

46:16.363 --> 46:18.824
Well, you have to be in control
of your faculties.

46:19.032 --> 46:20.993
Otherwise, there's no challenge.

46:22.369 --> 46:25.122
Well, you certainly are confident.

46:34.590 --> 46:35.757
You look strong.

46:37.301 --> 46:38.760
Thanks.

46:38.969 --> 46:40.929
I guess.

46:47.352 --> 46:48.937
I like it when they're strong.

46:52.441 --> 46:54.443
What are you talking about?

46:57.529 --> 47:00.032
Let's play a game.

47:05.746 --> 47:08.081
Night-night, fuckface.

47:39.696 --> 47:41.865
<i>Hey, Dex, it's me.
I just wanna let you know...</i>

47:42.032 --> 47:43.992
<i>...I'm gonna be late
getting home tonight.</i>

47:44.159 --> 47:47.412
<i>You've got me paranoid about Speltzer.
Gonna cruise by, make sure...</i>

47:47.621 --> 47:49.665
<i>- Shit.
-...he's tucked in for the night.</i>

49:00.736 --> 49:03.530
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

49:52.287 --> 49:54.081
Freeze!

50:15.936 --> 50:17.854
Oh, fuck!

50:39.501 --> 50:40.711
- Deb.
- Motherfucker.

50:40.919 --> 50:43.714
He has a girl in here.
We have to find her.

50:55.726 --> 50:56.893
Beat the shit out of her.

50:57.102 --> 51:01.189
Speltzer took her earring as a trophy,
just like he did with Nina Fleischer.

51:01.982 --> 51:03.400
I found hers at the mausoleum.

51:25.088 --> 51:28.175
Put a BOLO out on Speltzer
but there's nothing yet.

51:28.341 --> 51:30.385
House was a foreclosure
that he broke into...

51:30.594 --> 51:32.929
...to set up his fucked-up maze.

51:34.598 --> 51:36.266
We found burned plastic in the oven.

51:36.475 --> 51:39.811
Explains why there weren't any prints
or DNA on the things we found.

51:41.354 --> 51:43.315
I sent some unis
over to the mausoleum...

51:43.523 --> 51:45.525
...and the door was open.

51:45.734 --> 51:48.695
Nina Fleischer's earring
was missing.

51:50.197 --> 51:52.240
I think he's in the wind.

51:55.702 --> 51:57.245
Behind you.

52:59.724 --> 53:05.146
Oh, you're up early.
The coffee is fresh, if you want.

53:08.608 --> 53:10.402
You were right.

53:10.902 --> 53:13.655
If I'd let you do things your way,
Speltzer would be dead.

53:13.822 --> 53:19.411
That girl would be alive.
But he's out there, free to kill again.

53:21.204 --> 53:23.540
Well, you can't change
the way you think overnight.

53:23.748 --> 53:25.792
I haven't.

53:26.877 --> 53:29.838
I mean, I have but I haven't.

53:32.465 --> 53:34.092
I get it.

53:34.718 --> 53:38.138
What you do. I hate it but I get it.

53:43.059 --> 53:44.728
So you accept it?

53:51.276 --> 53:53.403
I understand it.

53:53.612 --> 53:56.406
I understand that it might be...

53:58.241 --> 54:00.201
Might be...

54:00.577 --> 54:02.245
...a necessary evil.

54:04.080 --> 54:07.751
But what I don't understand
are the blood slides.

54:09.502 --> 54:12.172
They're trophies.
They're like Speltzer's earrings.

54:12.380 --> 54:15.425
- I'm nothing like Speltzer.
- But on some level, Dexter...

54:15.634 --> 54:18.053
...you like to kill.

54:20.680 --> 54:23.308
I like the way it makes me feel.

54:23.516 --> 54:25.644
Same thing.

54:26.353 --> 54:29.689
Deb, I can't change who I am.

54:31.775 --> 54:33.443
I know.

54:34.110 --> 54:37.030
And I can't change who I am.

54:38.031 --> 54:39.658
What are you saying?

54:39.866 --> 54:41.868
I don't know what I'm saying.

54:45.372 --> 54:46.998
But I think you should move out.

54:47.207 --> 54:49.626
I think you should move back
to your place.

54:54.422 --> 54:55.548
Okay.

54:59.970 --> 55:01.513
Deb...

55:02.722 --> 55:06.393
...I'm still your brother.
Nothing's changed.

55:08.478 --> 55:10.438
Everything's changed.

55:10.647 --> 55:14.025
I don't know
if it can ever be the same again.

55:24.536 --> 55:27.288
<i>I'm finally out of my cage.</i>

55:30.166 --> 55:32.919
<i>But freedom comes with a cost.</i>
