00:10.517 --> 00:11.643
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

00:11.810 --> 00:14.104
- Where's your lug wrench at?
- No!

00:16.314 --> 00:20.068
We are investigating the homicide
of a Miami Metro Police officer.

00:20.235 --> 00:21.986
<i>Viktor left on an evening flight.</i>

00:22.153 --> 00:25.573
He arrives in Kiev at 5:25 p.m.,
your time.

00:25.740 --> 00:27.659
What about the dead police officer?

00:27.826 --> 00:29.828
<i>- I'll</i> make it go away.
- Good.

00:30.036 --> 00:32.497
- Hello, Viktor.
-ls there anything I can do...

00:32.664 --> 00:34.457
-...to keep you from killing me?
- No.

00:35.667 --> 00:38.586
In my game,
you can be the serial killer.

00:38.795 --> 00:40.422
I think this is offensive.

00:41.589 --> 00:44.050
Who would choose
to be a serial killer?

00:44.259 --> 00:47.470
It's a bad idea. Do something else.

00:48.555 --> 00:51.975
Only one person who ever worked
at Miami Metro ever took blood slides.

00:52.142 --> 00:54.894
Sergeant Doakes,
the Bay Harbour Butcher.

00:57.272 --> 01:00.525
What happened was too strong.
It got into you too early.

01:00.734 --> 01:03.278
You mustn't ever tell Debra
the truth about yourself.

01:03.445 --> 01:04.946
If you think she's upset now...

01:05.155 --> 01:09.367
...that's nothing compared to how
she'd feel if she learned what you are.

01:11.661 --> 01:13.621
Dexter, what the fuck?

01:13.830 --> 01:16.082
You said Travis came at you
with a sword.

01:16.249 --> 01:18.877
Where did you get the knives?
There was a roll of them.

01:19.043 --> 01:20.879
I'm just trying to put this together.

01:32.182 --> 01:33.725
Are you a serial killer?

01:35.477 --> 01:36.519
Yes.

04:03.082 --> 04:06.002
<i>I've dreaded this moment
my whole life.</i>

04:07.378 --> 04:09.923
<i>But I never pictured it like this.</i>

04:10.673 --> 04:13.551
Don't you fucking touch me.

04:15.053 --> 04:17.180
I just want to know you're okay.

04:17.347 --> 04:19.891
I am not okay.

04:20.099 --> 04:25.855
- I am never gonna fucking be okay.
- Just try to take it easy.

04:26.189 --> 04:28.650
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

04:30.985 --> 04:33.488
How long have you been doing this?

04:34.072 --> 04:36.908
How long have you been
fucking doing this?

04:40.787 --> 04:42.372
Since I was 20.

04:44.832 --> 04:48.127
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter.

04:51.381 --> 04:53.800
Those blood slides
that I found in your apartment...

04:53.967 --> 04:56.427
...they look like the ones
we found in Doakes' car.

04:56.594 --> 04:57.887
Deb.

04:59.597 --> 05:01.140
Are you the Bay Harbour Butcher?

05:01.307 --> 05:03.935
This is not the place
to talk about this.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.146
Deb.

05:10.108 --> 05:12.360
- I only kill certain kinds of people...
- Oh, God.

05:12.527 --> 05:13.736
...like Travis.

05:17.198 --> 05:19.534
Deb, Dad taught me.

05:22.245 --> 05:24.163
He gave me a code.

05:25.415 --> 05:27.291
Dad knew?

05:28.292 --> 05:30.712
It was his idea. He knew everything.

05:33.423 --> 05:35.133
- Oh, fuck.
- Deb.

05:41.389 --> 05:43.641
Please, just...

05:44.851 --> 05:47.228
Just come back inside with me.

05:47.395 --> 05:49.147
Please.

06:01.367 --> 06:05.038
Harry found me sitting in a pool
of my mother's blood.

06:06.122 --> 06:08.875
He understood why I had these...

06:10.084 --> 06:12.003
...urges.

06:12.211 --> 06:16.132
A lot of horrible things happen
to a lot of people.

06:16.716 --> 06:19.177
And they don't turn out like you.

06:19.343 --> 06:21.554
I don't know about other people.

06:22.221 --> 06:26.392
But I have this need...

06:27.810 --> 06:30.063
...deep inside me.

06:34.025 --> 06:37.278
I call it my dark passenger.

06:38.029 --> 06:40.490
You gave it a name?

06:42.492 --> 06:46.245
Harry said it got in me too early
and too deep.

06:46.412 --> 06:48.790
He said I couldn't change it.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.168
And so...

06:53.586 --> 06:54.796
...he thought up the code.

06:54.962 --> 06:59.175
He said if I had to kill, I might
as well kill people who deserved it.

06:59.383 --> 07:04.347
You make it sound like it's okay,
like you're the victim here.

07:06.182 --> 07:09.936
The people in that box, Dexter...

07:11.771 --> 07:13.689
...they're the victims.

07:13.898 --> 07:15.942
Victims?

07:23.533 --> 07:27.620
A choir director
who raped and murdered little boys?

07:29.872 --> 07:34.627
A married couple smuggling refugees
who killed the ones who couldn't pay?

07:34.836 --> 07:35.962
A psychiatrist...

07:36.712 --> 07:39.132
...who manipulated women
into taking their own lives?

07:39.298 --> 07:43.386
There's this place
called the police department.

07:43.594 --> 07:48.766
Sometimes the system doesn't work.
Killers fall through the cracks.

07:50.643 --> 07:53.187
Don't I fucking know it?

07:54.856 --> 07:57.483
I'm talking to one right now.

08:08.536 --> 08:11.956
I am the worst fucking detective
in the world.

08:13.833 --> 08:14.876
You're my own brother.

08:15.042 --> 08:17.170
How could I not see
what you were doing?

08:17.795 --> 08:22.216
- You're not responsible for this.
- Well, I am now.

08:22.633 --> 08:25.678
I helped you cover up
Travis' murder.

08:27.889 --> 08:30.099
- I'm an accomplice.
- You walked in on me.

08:30.266 --> 08:33.769
- I had to think on my feet.
- Well, fuck me for ruining your night.

08:35.021 --> 08:37.023
What am I supposed to do here?

08:37.231 --> 08:40.443
My name has the word "lieutenant"
in front of it.

08:40.651 --> 08:43.446
I can't turn my back on this.

08:47.617 --> 08:51.120
All of this is very, very fucking wrong.

08:55.499 --> 08:57.001
So...

09:02.590 --> 09:04.675
...what are you gonna do?

09:18.231 --> 09:21.359
I never wanted her to go through this,
Dex.

09:22.068 --> 09:23.611
Neither did I.

09:23.819 --> 09:26.822
Then you should have been
more careful.

09:28.032 --> 09:30.326
At least she didn't arrest me.

09:30.493 --> 09:32.370
Not yet.

09:52.390 --> 09:54.934
What is this doing here?

09:59.021 --> 10:01.023
Is it some kind of message?

10:04.026 --> 10:06.737
Maybe someone else is on to me.

10:22.837 --> 10:25.423
According to FBI Special Agent
Frank Lundy:

10:25.631 --> 10:29.010
"it's almost certain that the butcher
is still at work.

10:29.218 --> 10:32.054
Serial killers have an addiction...

10:32.263 --> 10:35.474
...and will continue to kill
until they're caught."

10:48.154 --> 10:50.197
<i>If the ITK hand in my apartment
is genuine...</i>

10:50.364 --> 10:52.700
<i>...then it can't still be in Evidence.</i>

11:04.170 --> 11:05.963
<i>Not here.</i>

11:06.172 --> 11:08.674
<i>Then I was sent the real thing.</i>

11:11.761 --> 11:13.846
<i>No record of it being checked out.</i>

11:14.055 --> 11:16.265
<i>Could it have been stolen?</i>

11:18.184 --> 11:19.352
Sorry.

11:20.019 --> 11:23.689
Sorry. Saw you come in here.
I just got curious.

11:25.608 --> 11:28.402
- Now I wish I hadn't.
- Why?

11:28.611 --> 11:31.572
You're looking for the hand,
aren't you? Look, I can explain.

11:31.781 --> 11:34.450
Look, remember
my former intern Ryan?

11:34.658 --> 11:38.329
Blond, stacked and the cause
of many sleepless nights?

11:38.537 --> 11:40.664
- Yeah.
- Well, she needed some extra dough...

11:40.831 --> 11:44.168
...so she stole the hand
and auctioned it online.

11:44.377 --> 11:46.504
That's why I fired her.

11:46.712 --> 11:49.673
- Who won the auction?
- Don't know.

11:49.882 --> 11:53.386
- I put Louis on the case to find out.
- Louis?

11:53.594 --> 11:56.889
Not even with all his digital skills,
he couldn't dig up a name.

11:57.098 --> 12:00.017
At least he was able
to erase the electronic trail.

12:00.226 --> 12:03.062
<i>Did Louis find the hand
and keep it?</i>

12:03.687 --> 12:05.314
No one needs to know, right?

12:05.523 --> 12:08.984
<i>But why send the work
of a serial killer to me?</i>

12:09.193 --> 12:10.903
<i>Does Louis know what I am?</i>

12:11.112 --> 12:12.154
Dex?

12:13.030 --> 12:14.156
What?

12:14.365 --> 12:16.033
We're cool, right?

12:16.200 --> 12:17.701
Yeah. No one needs to know.

12:18.702 --> 12:20.704
Oh, thank God.

12:22.164 --> 12:25.084
- I was ready to blow you.
- Not necessary.

12:26.502 --> 12:29.880
- Briefing. You coming?
- Yeah.

12:34.009 --> 12:36.053
<i>I have to find out
what Louis knows about me.</i>

12:36.220 --> 12:38.472
<i>Some time alone with him
and he'd open</i> up...

12:38.639 --> 12:40.307
<i>...one way or another.</i>

12:40.516 --> 12:43.936
<i>But I need to put out fires,
not start new ones.</i>

12:50.776 --> 12:52.653
Remember him?

12:53.195 --> 12:55.489
It's been three days
since Mike was gunned down.

12:55.656 --> 12:59.076
The son of a bitch that pulled
the trigger is still walking the streets.

12:59.285 --> 13:00.327
Where are we?

13:00.536 --> 13:03.539
We're continuing to hit the club
where Miss Soroka was employed.

13:03.747 --> 13:07.418
Someone there must've seen
something related to her death.

13:07.585 --> 13:11.088
We think it's our best shot at a lead,
Gonna shut them down every night.

13:11.255 --> 13:14.508
You know, those places do
big business during lunch too.

13:15.634 --> 13:18.012
- Just saying.
- Start shutting them down twice a day.

13:18.179 --> 13:21.307
- With pleasure.
- Moving on.

13:22.516 --> 13:25.269
This pretty face belongs
to Wayne Randall.

13:25.436 --> 13:28.022
Fifteen years ago,
Randall and his teenage girlfriend...

13:28.189 --> 13:31.525
...went on a three-state killing spree
that ended here in Miami.

13:31.692 --> 13:34.862
He's currently serving
two consecutive life terms at Dade.

13:35.070 --> 13:38.032
Randall now claims to have evidence
on three other murders...

13:38.199 --> 13:41.285
...that he committed in the Miami area,
and he wants to come clean.

13:41.452 --> 13:44.371
He wants to lead investigators
to where he buried the bodies.

13:44.580 --> 13:45.623
That's nice of him.

13:45.831 --> 13:47.833
He says he wants
to clear his conscience.

13:48.042 --> 13:50.336
His lawyers are just trying
to swing a deal.

13:50.544 --> 13:51.587
What's he telling us?

13:51.754 --> 13:54.423
He told us about one victim,
a brunette in her mid-20s...

13:54.590 --> 13:58.594
...that matches a missing persons
report from that time, a Janice Dubois.

13:58.802 --> 14:01.263
There's a chance
he's not completely full of shit.

14:01.472 --> 14:03.140
County has requested
one detective...

14:03.307 --> 14:05.768
...and one lab tech to help them
process the scene.

14:05.935 --> 14:07.394
- Miller?
- Yeah.

14:07.561 --> 14:09.355
- You're volunteer number one.
- I'll go.

14:09.522 --> 14:11.065
No.

14:11.273 --> 14:14.109
- I want Masuka on this.
- I don't to work a dumpsite.

14:14.276 --> 14:16.195
Come on, I'm up to my ears
on Mike's case.

14:16.362 --> 14:17.947
I'm sorry. You're with Miller.

14:18.113 --> 14:20.783
Contact info will be in your boxes.
You'll start tomorrow.

14:20.950 --> 14:22.785
That's it. Thank you.

14:33.671 --> 14:35.756
Can I talk to you outside
for a second?

14:41.512 --> 14:44.473
I was this close to arresting you
this morning.

14:48.018 --> 14:50.980
I even thought about
what I would say to the press.

14:51.188 --> 14:54.149
I wouldn't want to have to write
that speech.

14:54.358 --> 14:55.901
I don't know what to do.

14:56.110 --> 14:58.487
Every alternative I can think of...

14:59.697 --> 15:01.949
...is fucking crazy.

15:02.157 --> 15:03.993
Such as?

15:04.994 --> 15:06.495
It's fucked up.

15:06.662 --> 15:08.706
Try me.

15:09.623 --> 15:13.669
They say people like you
are addicts.

15:14.837 --> 15:16.589
Like drugs.

15:16.755 --> 15:18.507
It's not untrue.

15:18.674 --> 15:22.386
Well, when addicts want to get better,
they go to rehab.

15:24.722 --> 15:27.016
I don't think there are clinics
for what I've got.

15:27.182 --> 15:29.143
We can make one.

15:29.310 --> 15:31.687
I could be your clinic.

15:31.895 --> 15:35.065
- How?
- You move in with me.

15:35.274 --> 15:39.987
I watch you 24/7 and make sure
that there's no way in hell you can...

15:42.489 --> 15:44.783
...do what you do...

15:45.868 --> 15:48.912
...and if it is an addiction,
then maybe...

15:49.538 --> 15:51.874
Maybe you can get over it.

15:54.752 --> 15:56.629
You're right. It's crazy.

15:56.837 --> 16:00.257
Dexter,
if you can channel your urges...

16:00.424 --> 16:03.010
...why can't you control them?

16:05.638 --> 16:08.515
What if Dad had taught you
how to quit...

16:08.724 --> 16:11.435
...instead of teaching you
how to live with it?

16:11.644 --> 16:15.439
- He fucked up.
- There's a big problem with this idea.

16:17.358 --> 16:18.400
What?

16:18.567 --> 16:20.319
I've tried stopping before.

16:20.486 --> 16:22.363
It didn't work.

16:23.155 --> 16:25.366
Well, now you have me.

16:26.450 --> 16:30.287
Someone who loves you more
than you will ever fucking know.

16:32.331 --> 16:37.753
And in spite of all of this,
I still believe that there is good in you.

16:41.423 --> 16:44.259
Maybe more that's in most people.

16:45.636 --> 16:47.846
What if it doesn't work?

16:49.890 --> 16:51.600
I don't...

16:53.227 --> 16:55.646
I don't want to think about that.

16:58.691 --> 17:01.402
And how much choice
do I have here?

17:05.280 --> 17:06.824
None.

17:10.369 --> 17:11.995
Okay.

17:14.873 --> 17:17.126
Thanks for getting back to me
so quickly.

17:17.334 --> 17:19.753
<i>I'm curious.
Your facilities are state-of-the-art.</i>

17:19.962 --> 17:22.423
<i>Why go through a private lab?</i>

17:22.631 --> 17:27.136
Just trying to lighten the load.
It's been a hectic few months.

17:27.344 --> 17:29.513
Look, just to confirm...

17:29.680 --> 17:32.015
...the blood you sampled
from the glass fragment...

17:32.182 --> 17:35.310
...is a positive match
with Travis Marshall's?

17:35.519 --> 17:37.271
<i>No question about it.</i>

17:39.606 --> 17:43.819
Thank you. Thanks.
Remember, keep this confidential.

17:44.027 --> 17:48.407
And when you send back the findings,
address them to me personally, okay?

17:48.574 --> 17:51.577
- No problem.
-Great. Thanks.

18:08.427 --> 18:11.847
- Yes, captain?
- Regional FBI office, please.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.995
We are back!

18:35.162 --> 18:38.332
Hey! I won't allow this to go on.
This is harassment.

18:38.499 --> 18:41.668
No, this is an inconvenience. We're
working our way up to harassment.

18:41.835 --> 18:45.047
I told you the last time you were here,
I don't know who killed Kaja.

18:45.214 --> 18:46.882
I don't know who shot
your policeman.

18:47.049 --> 18:49.218
Kaja was clubbed to death in the
parking lot...

18:49.384 --> 18:51.970
-...15 yards from where we are.
- No one saw anything.

18:52.137 --> 18:54.431
- Sell that somewhere else.
- What are you gonna do?

18:54.598 --> 18:56.642
Gonna keep coming every day
and shut me down?

18:56.809 --> 18:58.310
No, I'm coming back tonight too.

18:58.477 --> 19:01.355
- What the fuck do you want from me?
- I want the shooter.

19:01.522 --> 19:03.524
You rack your brain
and give me something...

19:03.690 --> 19:06.944
...or I'm gonna turn this place
into a fucking monastery.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.322
You got that list?

19:11.198 --> 19:12.533
Follow me.

19:13.867 --> 19:16.620
You know, the money we make here
is all we have to live on.

19:16.829 --> 19:18.455
What you're doing is really unfair.

19:20.082 --> 19:21.124
What's your name?

19:21.959 --> 19:24.670
- Nadia.
- Come here.

19:32.636 --> 19:33.846
Have a drink.

19:34.054 --> 19:36.515
We're not supposed to drink
while we're working.

19:36.723 --> 19:38.934
Come on.
You hear any music playing?

19:42.604 --> 19:45.399
Now, what you said isn't true.

19:45.607 --> 19:47.568
I do care who killed Kaja...

19:47.776 --> 19:49.820
...but no one around here
seems interested...

19:50.028 --> 19:52.614
...in helping me find out who it is.
Okay?

19:52.823 --> 19:56.076
Do you know anybody who might be
interested in hurting your friend?

19:58.078 --> 20:00.873
You've been told
not to cooperate with us?

20:03.083 --> 20:04.960
Kaja was dating someone.

20:05.168 --> 20:09.006
Tony Rush.
He's one of the bouncers here.

20:09.214 --> 20:11.466
They were on and off,
but Tony is a good guy.

20:11.675 --> 20:13.719
Can you point Tony out to me?

20:13.886 --> 20:16.013
He's not here today.

20:17.264 --> 20:19.558
I really hope you catch the person
who did this...

20:19.725 --> 20:21.602
...and put a bullet through his head.

20:21.810 --> 20:25.355
That's not generally how we work,
but I get where you're coming from.

20:25.564 --> 20:28.442
Here, if you can think of anything
to help, give me a call.

20:28.650 --> 20:31.987
I will, Detective Quinn.

20:32.195 --> 20:35.198
- Joey.
- Excuse me. Joey.

20:36.742 --> 20:38.911
- Tell me you got the shooter.
- Possibly.

20:39.119 --> 20:41.830
One of the bouncers hasn't come
to work since the murders.

20:42.039 --> 20:43.832
Tony Rush.

20:44.041 --> 20:46.168
- How'd you know?
- He and Kaja were an item.

20:46.376 --> 20:49.963
Suspicious timing, don't you think?
The sudden absence?

20:50.172 --> 20:51.673
Come on.

21:05.270 --> 21:06.730
Hey.

21:14.446 --> 21:16.949
You're gonna sleep in the bedroom.

21:18.408 --> 21:20.077
I'm not gonna put you out.

21:20.243 --> 21:21.453
Yes, you are.

21:21.662 --> 21:23.622
I'm sleeping out here.

21:24.081 --> 21:25.123
Deb, that's ridiculous.

21:25.290 --> 21:27.334
This isn't a fucking pyjama party,
Dex, okay?

21:27.501 --> 21:28.961
You're gonna take my bedroom...

21:29.127 --> 21:31.421
...and I'm gonna sleep out here
on the couch.

21:32.798 --> 21:35.801
- Between me and the front door?
- I will be by the door.

21:41.264 --> 21:44.101
You've really thought this through.

21:44.309 --> 21:46.186
Yeah, well, I found this website:

21:46.395 --> 21:48.563
"How to cure a serial killer
in ten easy steps."

21:48.730 --> 21:51.316
And this is the first step.

21:54.736 --> 21:57.447
You'll have to print me out a copy.

21:57.990 --> 22:00.867
I'm figuring this out as I go along,
Dexter.

22:01.076 --> 22:03.745
But if we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it all the way.

22:03.912 --> 22:06.832
We're gonna eat together,
we're gonna watch TV together...

22:07.040 --> 22:10.252
...we're gonna drive
to fucking work together.

22:11.003 --> 22:13.505
Hope you got a big shower.

22:14.965 --> 22:18.093
Why don't you go unpack.
I'll heat us up something to eat.

22:21.638 --> 22:24.933
You have to be completely honest
with me.

22:25.142 --> 22:27.436
That is the first rule.

22:29.730 --> 22:31.857
<i>My new code.</i>

22:56.131 --> 22:59.301
Don't you think Deb has gone through
enough without you lying to her?

22:59.468 --> 23:01.636
I'm not lying.

23:01.845 --> 23:03.889
You're a killer, Dex.

23:04.347 --> 23:06.266
Deb didn't raise you.

23:06.516 --> 23:08.143
I did.

23:08.351 --> 23:11.188
She never saw
what you were really like.

23:11.354 --> 23:13.148
I did.

23:13.732 --> 23:16.902
I was right to channel your urges
instead of trying to suppress them.

23:17.110 --> 23:20.197
You think I can just walk out of here
and call the whole thing off?

23:20.363 --> 23:23.033
If it were this simple,
watching you for 24 hours a day...

23:23.200 --> 23:25.327
...don't you think
I would have tried it?

23:26.369 --> 23:28.538
Maybe you should've.

23:38.673 --> 23:40.926
How does it feel?

23:42.010 --> 23:45.180
This need to kill?

23:45.347 --> 23:47.099
What do you call it?

23:48.141 --> 23:50.685
My dark passenger.

23:53.188 --> 23:56.316
You make it sound like
you're possessed or something.

23:58.026 --> 24:01.404
That's how it feels sometimes.

24:04.116 --> 24:06.034
Do you know how many assholes
in prison...

24:06.201 --> 24:09.538
...blame their actions
on someone or something else?

24:09.704 --> 24:14.459
I'm not copping a plea, Deb.
I'm giving you honesty.

24:17.587 --> 24:19.965
It's rule number one, right?

24:21.800 --> 24:23.760
How's the spaghetti?

24:29.015 --> 24:30.809
Overcooked.

24:32.644 --> 24:33.770
First rule.

24:34.646 --> 24:37.149
So how does it feel?

24:43.530 --> 24:45.740
It starts with blood.

24:46.867 --> 24:48.410
Blood?

24:50.245 --> 24:52.622
Yeah, the image of it...

24:55.834 --> 24:59.421
...trickling down the back
of my eyelids.

25:02.757 --> 25:07.846
The trickle becomes a stream
and then a flood.

25:10.348 --> 25:12.392
It fills me up...

25:13.894 --> 25:16.605
...all my empty spaces.

25:19.316 --> 25:22.360
But then the blood
isn't red anymore.

25:24.070 --> 25:26.656
- What is it?
-It's black.

25:31.411 --> 25:33.455
And pressing.

25:36.917 --> 25:39.836
It feels like my head
is gonna explode.

25:42.339 --> 25:43.924
And...

25:45.133 --> 25:47.052
...the only way
to relieve the pressure...

25:47.219 --> 25:49.679
...is to open the floodgates...

25:51.181 --> 25:53.391
...let it spill out.

25:58.230 --> 26:00.732
I can't believe you're like this.

26:01.942 --> 26:04.819
You're a sick fuck, Dexter.
Jesus Christ.

26:04.986 --> 26:06.947
Well, maybe we shouldn't talk
about it.

26:07.113 --> 26:10.283
Yeah, maybe not while I'm serving
fucking tomato sauce.

26:14.204 --> 26:16.081
Are you seeing blood now?

26:16.248 --> 26:18.583
Nope, just spaghetti.

26:19.542 --> 26:22.545
Well, if you start seeing red,
will you fucking call me?

26:22.712 --> 26:26.049
And say what?
"Deb, I'm seeing blood"?

26:28.677 --> 26:30.929
Say, "I really feel...

26:33.014 --> 26:35.892
...like wrapping someone up in plastic
and stabbing them."

26:36.059 --> 26:39.187
And I can say, "No, Dexter, don't."

26:43.066 --> 26:44.859
Second rule.

26:47.195 --> 26:50.991
There have to be families out there
that are more fucked up than us.

26:52.951 --> 26:55.829
But I sure as hell wouldn't
wanna meet them.

27:00.292 --> 27:02.043
What the fuck am I doing here?

27:05.088 --> 27:09.426
- What you think's right.
- Right would be turning you in.

27:10.677 --> 27:12.971
I'm doing this
because I can't stand the idea...

27:13.138 --> 27:16.099
...of you living the rest of your life
in prison.

27:18.101 --> 27:20.061
Or worse.

27:28.236 --> 27:31.614
<i>I told Deb I'd be honest with her,
but it's not like I'm stalking a kill.</i>

27:31.781 --> 27:33.742
<i>I just need to get
into Louis' penthouse...</i>

27:33.908 --> 27:36.244
...and <i>find out what he knows
about me.</i>

27:44.669 --> 27:46.338
You Okay?

27:46.713 --> 27:49.924
-It's late.
- Yeah. I'm just doing some work.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.388
I'll sit with you.

27:55.555 --> 27:58.433
Deb, I'm fine.

27:58.641 --> 28:00.810
No, you shouldn't be alone
right now.

28:01.478 --> 28:04.022
I mean, awake and alone.

28:09.569 --> 28:13.698
Yeah, maybe I should try
to get some sleep.

28:19.579 --> 28:22.415
Just know that I'm here for you.

28:25.710 --> 28:27.962
<i>How could I forget?</i>

28:28.755 --> 28:30.382
<i>Now that Deb is my Siamese twin...</i>

28:30.548 --> 28:34.928
<i>...getting into Louis' penthouse
is going to be next to impossible.</i>

28:36.304 --> 28:38.515
<i>But how long can I wait?</i>

28:40.308 --> 28:42.602
You know, for the tenth time...

28:42.811 --> 28:45.814
...I barely saw Kaja that night.
I was working.

28:46.022 --> 28:49.818
She got off at <i>2</i> a.m. and I don't know
what she did after that.

28:50.026 --> 28:53.947
Whatever you decide to get into
after this, forget writing...

28:54.114 --> 28:58.243
...because you could not make up
a story to save your fucking life.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.543
Security tapes back him up.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.337
- Shit. Are you sure?
- No doubt.

29:09.546 --> 29:12.048
He was at the club all night working.

29:14.467 --> 29:18.471
Well, it looks like some
of what you said wasn't bullshit.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.932
You were working
when Kaja was killed.

29:21.141 --> 29:25.186
We still don't like the fact that
you vanished the day after she died.

29:25.353 --> 29:28.064
Smells like guilt to me.

29:28.231 --> 29:31.192
- You could have had someone do it.
- No way.

29:31.359 --> 29:33.528
What happened?
She start sleeping around on you?

29:34.028 --> 29:36.823
- Kaja was loyal.
- Loyal, huh?

29:36.990 --> 29:39.242
So she was doing you.

29:39.659 --> 29:41.202
At least we're getting somewhere.

29:42.579 --> 29:45.999
The problem is now we know
you've been lying to us...

29:46.207 --> 29:47.834
...about you and Kaja.

29:48.001 --> 29:49.711
And that's bad form, Tony.

29:49.878 --> 29:52.005
We tend to get cranky
when people bullshit us.

29:52.172 --> 29:55.091
Now, if you think what we're doing
to the club is bad...

29:55.258 --> 29:57.135
...wait till we start on you.

30:00.763 --> 30:02.390
She was with Viktor.

30:02.557 --> 30:04.434
Say again?

30:04.642 --> 30:07.228
The night that Kaja died...

30:08.062 --> 30:09.606
...she left the club with Viktor.

30:09.772 --> 30:13.276
- Fucking sleazebag.
- Who the fuck is Viktor?

30:15.695 --> 30:17.363
Hey, how's it going out there?

30:17.530 --> 30:18.573
Don't ask.

30:18.740 --> 30:20.325
Bad as you thought?

30:20.492 --> 30:22.202
Worse.

30:22.702 --> 30:26.164
We sit in the sun waiting
for the diggers to find a body.

30:26.331 --> 30:28.750
I mean, so far they've uncovered
a telephone cable...

30:28.917 --> 30:30.251
...and a bag of used diapers.

30:31.002 --> 30:33.087
I mean, all this waiting around...

30:33.296 --> 30:35.924
...it's like dating a born-again
Christian.

30:36.716 --> 30:38.760
<i>If I don't have Deb
watching my every move...</i>

30:38.927 --> 30:41.679
<i>...it'll be a lot easier to slip away
to Louis' apartment.</i>

30:41.846 --> 30:43.389
I'm getting a little stir crazy.

30:43.556 --> 30:45.683
- I wouldn't mind a day out of the lab.
- Dude.

30:46.184 --> 30:48.603
Oh, my God,
I would be eternally grateful.

30:48.811 --> 30:50.897
But you'd have to clear it
with your sister.

30:51.064 --> 30:53.525
For some reason,
she really wants me out there.

30:54.442 --> 30:58.404
- You think she secretly hates me?
<i>- I'll</i> see what I can do.

31:03.034 --> 31:05.787
Masuka's miserable on this whole
Wayne Randall thing.

31:05.995 --> 31:08.998
He's begging me to take over
for him today.

31:09.207 --> 31:10.458
Okay. Great.

31:11.376 --> 31:12.919
Great.

31:13.127 --> 31:14.504
I'll drive.

31:15.755 --> 31:19.175
- You'll drive?
- I could use some fresh air. Let's go.

31:19.384 --> 31:21.886
- Just got a break on Mike's shooting.
- What?

31:22.053 --> 31:24.556
The last person to see Kaja alive
was Viktor Baskov.

31:24.722 --> 31:27.767
He's a Russian expat. We couldn't find
anything on him in here...

31:27.934 --> 31:29.978
...but we got a hit
on the Interpol database.

31:30.144 --> 31:31.980
He's a member
of the Koshka brotherhood.

31:32.146 --> 31:33.398
Known for narcotics...

31:33.565 --> 31:35.608
-...and human trafficking.
- Hold on.

31:37.110 --> 31:40.321
I have to take care of this.
Are we good?

31:40.530 --> 31:44.492
Deb, I'll be surrounded by federal
marshals. I think I'll be okay.

31:49.914 --> 31:52.625
It was 15 years ago.
Give me a fucking break.

31:52.792 --> 31:55.837
Where are the bodies, Wayne?

31:56.004 --> 31:57.547
Closer to the road.

31:57.755 --> 32:01.009
- Why'd you tell us to dig here?
- Because this place looks different.

32:01.217 --> 32:02.927
Look at these mini-malls.

32:03.136 --> 32:07.682
You think I like being out here with you
in the fucking heat?

32:08.266 --> 32:10.184
- All right. Listen. We're moving.
- Damn.

32:10.351 --> 32:12.228
Strike this.

32:15.648 --> 32:18.109
One more wit,
he'd be a fucking half-wit.

32:19.694 --> 32:21.362
God.

32:21.571 --> 32:24.032
Oh, it's hot as a pig's asshole.

32:24.657 --> 32:26.200
All this asphalt.

32:28.161 --> 32:30.330
You know, this used to be
a real pretty place.

32:30.538 --> 32:32.707
Field.

32:32.874 --> 32:34.751
Trees.

32:35.543 --> 32:37.337
Now look at it.

32:38.004 --> 32:40.715
Yeah, nothing stays the same.

32:40.882 --> 32:42.967
That's the truth.

32:43.843 --> 32:46.220
Well, at least the Frosty Swirl
is still here.

32:51.684 --> 32:53.686
You surprised a lot of people.

32:55.772 --> 32:58.650
- How's that?
- Leading us to these bodies.

32:58.858 --> 33:00.693
Why the change of heart?

33:01.527 --> 33:03.321
Why do you care?

33:03.529 --> 33:05.615
I'm just curious.

33:05.782 --> 33:08.326
People say you grew a conscience.

33:11.287 --> 33:12.747
It was always there.

33:13.498 --> 33:16.709
It was just buried
under a lot of Wayne Randall.

33:16.918 --> 33:19.045
I just surrendered.

33:19.712 --> 33:22.215
- Surrendered?
- All right. Let's break for lunch.

33:22.382 --> 33:23.758
We'll pick this up in an hour.

33:23.925 --> 33:25.593
Oh, here we go.

33:25.802 --> 33:29.931
<i>Getting to Louis' penthouse
and back in an hour will be tight...</i>

33:30.139 --> 33:33.643
<i>...but I'm not exactly flush
with options.</i>

33:45.988 --> 33:49.075
<i>I can appreciate the mind-set
of a collector...</i>

33:49.242 --> 33:50.702
<i>...but toys?</i>

33:50.910 --> 33:53.913
<i>Seems like a waste
of a good obsession.</i>

34:14.767 --> 34:16.686
<i>My charge card numbers?</i>

34:17.353 --> 34:20.189
<i>So Louis killed my credit cards.</i>

34:20.356 --> 34:23.067
<i>Why is he messing with my life?</i>

34:32.118 --> 34:34.203
<i>It features 29 points of articulation...</i>

34:34.370 --> 34:36.622
<i>...five more than the last figure
they put out...</i>

34:36.789 --> 34:39.125
...so <i>at least they're listening
to the collectors.</i>

34:40.334 --> 34:42.170
<i>Still, they could have--</i>

34:44.839 --> 34:47.717
<i>Idea: a video diary app.</i>

34:47.925 --> 34:52.847
<i>One touch, device starts recording.
Tap again and it uploads directly to...</i>

34:53.514 --> 34:55.224
<i>Still waiting.</i>

34:55.391 --> 34:56.934
<i>Yeah, I'm almost done.</i>

34:57.143 --> 35:00.772
<i>Your hour's almost up.
I'm only thinking of you.</i>

35:02.940 --> 35:04.859
<i>Oh, God.</i>

35:05.818 --> 35:08.112
<i>There'll never be an app for this.</i>

35:08.321 --> 35:10.156
<i>Jesus.</i>

35:11.741 --> 35:13.910
<i>This is going to be worse
than Bob Henley.</i>

35:14.118 --> 35:15.787
<i>He got off easy.</i>

35:15.995 --> 35:19.290
<i>I want to see Dexter lying
in his own piss and vomit...</i>

35:19.457 --> 35:22.627
<i>...and I won't stop until that
represents the high point of his day.</i>

35:22.794 --> 35:25.379
<i>No one fucks with me.</i>

35:25.546 --> 35:27.089
<i>No one.</i>

35:27.298 --> 35:31.385
<i>Now, on to more important things.</i>

35:32.303 --> 35:34.055
<i>Four-ninety--</i>

35:35.932 --> 35:38.434
<i>Bob Henley.</i>

35:47.735 --> 35:53.157
"Henley arrested after the FBI found
child pornography on his workstation.

35:53.366 --> 35:56.702
Skanda tech has announced
his dismissal...

35:56.911 --> 36:01.374
...pending charges
which could fetch up to 15 years."

36:01.582 --> 36:04.210
<i>Is this how Louis took control
of his software company?</i>

36:04.377 --> 36:08.798
<i>By setting this guy up?
What's he planning for me?</i>

36:26.566 --> 36:30.361
<i>With Deb on my case, I don't know
when I'll have this chance again.</i>

36:46.127 --> 36:49.505
- Why are you fucking with me, Louis?
- God, please, don't hurt me.

36:49.714 --> 36:51.549
Give me a good reason
not to hurt you...

36:51.716 --> 36:53.885
...because right now
I want to break your neck.

36:54.051 --> 36:57.555
- Why'd you send me the hand?
- It was a stupid joke.

36:57.763 --> 37:00.391
I just, you know, the lifelines,
you know, time is short.

37:00.558 --> 37:02.727
It was a clue.
I was screwing with you.

37:03.603 --> 37:04.729
Why?

37:04.896 --> 37:09.358
Because I came to you for help
with my game and you said no.

37:10.651 --> 37:12.945
Your game?

37:13.946 --> 37:16.574
Yes, I swear that's the reason.

37:23.998 --> 37:26.375
This is about your game?

37:26.584 --> 37:32.089
I spent five years on that game
and you shit all over it.

37:32.298 --> 37:34.342
And now I'm too depressed
to even look at it.

37:34.508 --> 37:36.510
It was my whole world!

37:41.140 --> 37:43.684
I never wanna see you again.

37:44.477 --> 37:47.688
Work. Jamie.

37:48.940 --> 37:50.232
Do you understand?

37:52.234 --> 37:55.196
I'm done. I'm totally done.

38:03.955 --> 38:05.623
Where the fuck have you been?

38:05.790 --> 38:07.041
Running an errand.

38:07.249 --> 38:08.459
What errand?

38:08.626 --> 38:10.169
Deb, <i>I</i> didn't kill anybody.

38:10.378 --> 38:13.589
How the fuck do I know that?
I've been calling you and calling you.

38:13.756 --> 38:16.717
- I didn't get the messages.
- Well, check your fucking phone.

38:16.884 --> 38:18.803
I need to know where you are
at all times.

38:18.970 --> 38:22.848
- That is what we agreed on, right?
- It won't happen again.

38:23.057 --> 38:26.268
Finish what you need to do here
and we'll go visit Harrison together.

38:26.435 --> 38:27.687
Okay.

38:28.270 --> 38:29.313
Here you are.

38:31.273 --> 38:34.402
Seems you rode that wagon
till the wheels came off.

38:34.610 --> 38:37.780
- Trouble in paradise?
- No, she's my sister.

38:37.989 --> 38:39.573
Also my boss.

38:42.076 --> 38:44.578
Congratulations.
You just redefined hell.

38:45.579 --> 38:47.707
What crawled up her ass?

38:48.958 --> 38:50.876
It's a long story.

38:51.669 --> 38:55.506
Randall, what'd you mean earlier
when you said "surrendered"?

38:56.799 --> 39:00.469
I just accepted my situation,
you know...

39:00.636 --> 39:02.555
...of being where I am.

39:02.763 --> 39:06.475
Prison. People watching
your every move.

39:07.018 --> 39:08.978
It is what it is.

39:09.186 --> 39:11.439
Once I stopped fighting it...

39:11.605 --> 39:15.443
...the anger just fell off...

39:16.110 --> 39:18.237
...like a bad scab.

39:18.446 --> 39:22.616
Left me open
to try and make things right.

39:26.287 --> 39:28.998
They still use real ice cream.

39:29.999 --> 39:32.418
At least everything hasn't gone
to hell.

39:39.258 --> 39:41.635
We're still not getting anywhere,
George.

39:41.844 --> 39:43.637
I mean, you must like us
coming here.

39:43.846 --> 39:47.224
- There's nothing I can do about it.
- Stop protecting Viktor Baskov.

39:47.391 --> 39:49.310
- I told you--
- Yeah, he doesn't work here.

39:49.477 --> 39:51.604
Just comes in for a drink
now and then.

39:51.812 --> 39:53.856
- That's all I know.
- Right.

39:54.523 --> 39:55.983
We'll see you soon.

39:56.650 --> 40:00.404
I might even bring a portable
polygraph next time.

40:01.030 --> 40:04.366
You know how long it would take
to poly everyone in here?

40:11.540 --> 40:14.877
Okay, everybody get your asses
back to work.

40:28.015 --> 40:30.935
- Rough day?
-lsaak.

40:31.936 --> 40:34.021
Mr. Sirko.

40:34.939 --> 40:36.732
What are you doing here?

40:37.733 --> 40:38.776
I heard the police.

40:38.943 --> 40:43.364
It would appear that I'm here
for the same reason, to find Viktor.

40:43.989 --> 40:46.659
Yeah, I swear I...

40:46.826 --> 40:48.994
I have no idea
how they got his name.

40:49.161 --> 40:50.412
I'm sure of it.

40:52.039 --> 40:53.874
But we'll get to that.

40:56.210 --> 40:59.338
Anyway, I thought he was in Kiev
with you.

40:59.547 --> 41:02.007
If Viktor was in Kiev...

41:02.174 --> 41:04.218
...why would I be here?

41:05.511 --> 41:07.555
Viktor never made his flight.

41:07.721 --> 41:09.014
I checked.

41:09.223 --> 41:11.308
Well, I don't understand.

41:11.475 --> 41:12.935
Where is he, then?

41:18.107 --> 41:20.901
Viktor's caused us some problems.

41:21.068 --> 41:23.070
I won't deny it.

41:24.029 --> 41:26.532
Shooting a policeman
is never good for business.

41:30.035 --> 41:32.037
I can't help but wonder...

41:32.246 --> 41:37.376
...if someone in the brotherhood
decided to make an example of him.

41:37.585 --> 41:41.297
Without your approval? No.

41:42.047 --> 41:44.633
Oh, no. Viktor was impulsive, yes.

41:44.842 --> 41:47.595
He did a stupid thing, yes.

41:47.803 --> 41:52.349
But he was one of us
and we would always protect him.

42:01.275 --> 42:02.443
You're in luck.

42:03.777 --> 42:05.237
Why?

42:06.447 --> 42:08.407
I believe you.

42:12.578 --> 42:15.122
I've had a long flight.

42:19.960 --> 42:24.840
We have a lot to discuss.

42:27.259 --> 42:28.594
<i>- Hello?
-Hello, Joey?</i>

42:28.802 --> 42:30.638
It's Nadia from the Fox Hole.

42:31.472 --> 42:34.183
Yeah, how many Nadias
do you think I know?

42:34.391 --> 42:37.811
- What's up?
-My car won't start.

42:38.020 --> 42:41.607
I was wondering if maybe you could
give me a ride home tonight.

42:41.815 --> 42:45.110
Yeah, sure.
What time do you get off?

43:43.544 --> 43:44.795
-Hey.
-Hey.

43:44.962 --> 43:47.631
We were just having a little dinner.
Look who's here.

43:47.798 --> 43:50.384
Hey, bud, I missed you today.
How was school?

43:50.592 --> 43:54.263
- We had toy share.
- Toy share?

43:54.471 --> 43:58.350
- Did you bring your train set?
- Fire truck.

43:58.726 --> 44:01.687
- Fire truck beat out the train set?
- Yes.

44:01.895 --> 44:04.398
Oh, hey, Dex.

44:05.274 --> 44:09.236
Just grabbing one for the road. I know
you don't like me being on this side...

44:09.403 --> 44:11.989
...but it's all right when Jamie's here,
right?

44:14.074 --> 44:16.744
- Why not?
- Sweet.

44:16.952 --> 44:20.080
This is such a great place
to hang out. Right by the bay.

44:20.289 --> 44:22.166
- Yeah.
- I love coming over here.

44:23.542 --> 44:27.004
Well, I better get going.
I'll see you tomorrow.

44:33.677 --> 44:35.304
And...

44:36.388 --> 44:39.099
...I'll catch you at work, right? Yeah.

44:49.360 --> 44:51.987
<i>He's not scared of me at all.</i>

44:52.654 --> 44:54.823
<i>And he's not going to quit...</i>

44:55.908 --> 44:58.243
<i>...unless I stop him.</i>

45:00.162 --> 45:04.792
You're a lifesaver.
Not all cops are so nice to strippers.

45:05.376 --> 45:09.213
To tell you the truth, I was hoping
you had something more for me.

45:09.421 --> 45:12.674
- More for you?
- About the murders.

45:13.926 --> 45:18.472
What? You think this is just some ploy
so I could get you alone...

45:18.680 --> 45:19.890
...and spill my guts?

45:22.601 --> 45:25.062
Look, I told you everything
that I knew.

45:25.270 --> 45:28.148
My car really did break down.
I'm sorry.

45:28.357 --> 45:31.485
- I could pay you for the gas.
- Stop it. It's fine.

45:32.194 --> 45:35.948
It's the least I could do
after all I'm costing you in tips.

45:36.156 --> 45:40.160
You'll have to do a lot more than
give me a lift to make up for that.

45:42.538 --> 45:44.623
This is it. On the left.

45:48.127 --> 45:51.588
What'd you have in mind
as far as compensation?

45:52.339 --> 45:54.883
I don't know. Use your imagination.

45:55.426 --> 46:00.347
Well, you're gonna have to give me
a hint. I'm very unimaginative.

46:01.390 --> 46:03.142
Okay.

46:03.934 --> 46:07.855
George says the problem with my car
could be the transmission.

46:10.524 --> 46:15.946
It means it's going to be in the shop
for at least a few days.

46:16.155 --> 46:17.531
Yeah.

46:18.949 --> 46:22.369
Well, maybe you could
pick up the bill.

46:23.120 --> 46:25.247
I'd really appreciate it.

46:35.966 --> 46:38.510
You're awfully quiet tonight.

46:38.677 --> 46:41.096
Anything you wanna talk about?

46:41.305 --> 46:43.265
Anything I can do?

46:44.975 --> 46:46.560
Yeah.

46:46.727 --> 46:48.270
What?

46:49.062 --> 46:50.772
Do you have any A-1?

46:53.108 --> 46:54.151
I think so.

46:56.820 --> 46:59.531
<i>Just enough for a good night's sleep.</i>

46:59.698 --> 47:01.742
<i>That's all I need.</i>

47:03.452 --> 47:06.663
- Success!
- Thank you.

47:32.147 --> 47:34.691
Just finishing what you started.

47:55.379 --> 47:57.798
<i>I promised Deb.</i>

48:15.274 --> 48:16.900
Hello?

48:20.904 --> 48:22.656
Where are you?

48:28.704 --> 48:31.665
Sorry. I got here as fast as I could.

48:31.873 --> 48:35.168
Almost drove off the road.
I'm so fucking tired.

48:36.670 --> 48:38.630
What are you doing here?

48:41.300 --> 48:45.554
I snuck out of the house
while you were asleep.

48:46.054 --> 48:48.640
- Dexter, what the fuck did you do?
- Nothing.

48:51.977 --> 48:54.688
I couldn't go through with it,
but I wanted to.

48:54.855 --> 48:56.690
I needed to.

48:56.898 --> 48:59.901
I didn't care about anything else.

49:00.569 --> 49:03.864
I lost control.
All I could see was blood.

49:04.031 --> 49:09.870
All I could feel was the pressure
in my head. Fuck!

49:13.999 --> 49:18.670
It is too deep inside me.
Harry was right. I am a monster.

49:22.466 --> 49:25.719
You should arrest me.
You should take me in.

49:25.927 --> 49:28.055
Get me off the street.

49:28.221 --> 49:29.806
Dex.

49:30.807 --> 49:32.851
Dad was wrong.

49:35.270 --> 49:40.150
The fact that we're here tonight
proves that you are in control.

49:40.359 --> 49:42.778
- But I wasn't.
- But you stopped.

49:43.403 --> 49:45.572
That's what's important.

49:46.281 --> 49:48.575
It must've been so hard
for you to call me...

49:48.784 --> 49:51.370
...but you did,
and that's a huge step.

49:54.414 --> 49:57.709
It makes me think
maybe you can control this.

49:58.585 --> 50:00.545
You really believe that?

50:00.712 --> 50:02.673
I didn't.

50:03.340 --> 50:05.384
But maybe now I do.

50:11.139 --> 50:13.350
What happened tonight
is a good thing.

50:13.558 --> 50:16.269
It was really, really good.

50:18.146 --> 50:20.232
I'm not gonna give up.

50:21.650 --> 50:24.069
And I'm not gonna let you give up.

50:29.866 --> 50:33.036
- Are you okay to drive?
- No, I'm gonna stay with you.

50:33.245 --> 50:37.165
I just need to be alone
for a couple of minutes.

50:37.708 --> 50:39.918
Nothing's gonna happen.

50:40.544 --> 50:41.586
Okay.

51:10.282 --> 51:11.742
<i>You'll wake up with a headache.</i>

51:11.908 --> 51:13.952
<i>Probably have a decent idea
how you got here.</i>

51:14.619 --> 51:16.872
<i>Maybe that's a good thing.</i>

51:29.176 --> 51:31.678
<i>I still have to get you out of my life.</i>

51:31.845 --> 51:34.347
<i>But not by taking yours.</i>

51:56.369 --> 51:58.455
What the fuck?

52:00.081 --> 52:01.541
Who the fuck are you?

52:01.750 --> 52:05.253
I'm your employer or rather,
former employer.

52:05.462 --> 52:07.422
I believe you recently gave notice.

52:07.631 --> 52:10.926
Bullshit. I work for George.
Well, worked.

52:11.134 --> 52:12.260
And he works for me.

52:12.844 --> 52:14.095
My name is Isaak.

52:14.304 --> 52:17.474
I'm the owner of the Fox Hole chain
of gentlemen's clubs...

52:17.682 --> 52:19.226
...amongst other enterprises.

52:19.392 --> 52:21.269
What do you want'?

52:21.478 --> 52:24.815
It would appear that George neglected
to do your exit interview.

52:25.023 --> 52:28.235
It's company policy and I'm a stickler
when it comes to rules.

52:29.402 --> 52:30.987
You got to be kidding, right?

52:31.196 --> 52:34.407
Keeping good employees is essential
to running a successful business.

52:34.616 --> 52:36.618
Your feedback is important.

52:36.827 --> 52:38.620
Would you mind telling me
why you quit?

52:38.829 --> 52:42.165
Well, I trust it wasn't the hostile
working environment.

52:42.374 --> 52:43.416
No, I...

52:46.044 --> 52:48.672
I just felt it was time to move on.

52:48.880 --> 52:52.259
So it was nothing to do with
the tragic death of one of our dancers?

52:52.467 --> 52:54.386
Kaja, I believe her name was.

52:55.679 --> 52:58.640
Because if it did,
I would completely understand.

52:58.849 --> 53:01.101
It must have been quite
a traumatic loss for you.

53:01.309 --> 53:02.519
What do you mean?

53:02.727 --> 53:05.689
Yeah. Maybe that's why you talked
to the police.

53:05.856 --> 53:08.692
- No way.
- I had you followed.

53:09.985 --> 53:12.654
You know what?
I didn't say a word. I swear.

53:13.780 --> 53:16.283
I lied. I didn't have you followed.

53:18.159 --> 53:20.912
You were just
the most likely candidate.

53:24.165 --> 53:25.959
You loved her, didn't you?

53:26.126 --> 53:27.168
What?

53:27.335 --> 53:30.338
Kaja. You were in love with her.

53:31.840 --> 53:34.426
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

53:34.634 --> 53:39.264
It's the one thing
that gives meaning in this life.

53:40.891 --> 53:44.102
I would have done the same thing
if I was in your position.

53:47.397 --> 53:50.942
It's terrible to lose someone
you love.

54:23.850 --> 54:26.603
You still thinking about last night?

54:26.811 --> 54:29.981
Actually, I'm thinking about how much
I could go for a Frosty Swirl.

54:30.190 --> 54:31.858
That's good.

54:32.692 --> 54:35.362
A sudden craving for sugar is good?

54:36.529 --> 54:38.365
If you're thinking
about normal things...

54:38.531 --> 54:41.284
...then maybe you're becoming
more normal.

54:41.493 --> 54:44.537
I'm never gonna be normal, Deb.

54:45.622 --> 54:46.665
Yeah.

54:47.749 --> 54:49.084
None of us really are.

54:51.795 --> 54:53.046
Where you going?

54:53.713 --> 54:56.591
I want a Frosty Swirl.
I'll bring you one.

54:57.425 --> 55:00.929
<i>She'll always be watching me,
but maybe that's okay.</i>

55:01.554 --> 55:03.932
<i>If Wayne Randall can make peace
with his sentence...</i>

55:04.099 --> 55:05.225
<i>...who am I to complain?</i>

55:05.934 --> 55:08.228
<i>Especially considering
the alternative.</i>

55:08.436 --> 55:10.188
Well, well.

55:10.605 --> 55:13.483
Looks like you two are ready
to eat each other's shit.

55:14.234 --> 55:16.569
Oh, yeah.
We kind of patched things up.

55:18.947 --> 55:20.907
I'm happy for you.

55:21.741 --> 55:24.285
I never got to do that with Hannah.

55:25.870 --> 55:29.457
It's Robin to my Batman.

55:30.959 --> 55:34.921
I was never as alive
as I was when I was with her.

55:36.214 --> 55:40.677
Every day was like Christmas Day...

55:41.594 --> 55:42.971
...unwrapped present.

55:45.140 --> 55:48.184
I wish I had a chance to tell her
how I felt.

55:49.310 --> 55:51.521
You can still tell her.

55:52.230 --> 55:53.690
Yeah.

55:54.774 --> 55:57.277
I'm afraid the clock has run out.

56:02.741 --> 56:04.159
Damn.

56:05.827 --> 56:10.832
I sure as fuck gonna miss that.

56:12.959 --> 56:17.088
Hannah used to think
I was something special.

56:18.840 --> 56:21.718
Now she sees me as just a killer.

56:24.220 --> 56:25.889
And you know what?

56:27.265 --> 56:28.808
She's not wrong.

56:30.518 --> 56:34.189
There's just one last person
I need to kill.

57:14.270 --> 57:17.023
<i>He never cared
if anyone found the bodies.</i>

57:17.232 --> 57:21.528
<i>He just wanted a couple of days
of sunshine and Frosty Swirl.</i>

57:23.238 --> 57:28.201
<i>Randall didn't change,
and he couldn't take life in prison.</i>

57:31.538 --> 57:33.164
<i>Can I?</i>
