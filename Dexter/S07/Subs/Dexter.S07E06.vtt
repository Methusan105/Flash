00:10.100 --> 00:11.434
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

00:11.601 --> 00:14.646
LaGuerta found a blood slide
with Travis Marshall's blood on it...

00:14.813 --> 00:15.980
...at the fucking church.

00:16.147 --> 00:19.734
Talked her into letting me help with the
Bay Harbour Butcher investigation...

00:19.901 --> 00:21.820
...so I can keep tabs
on what's happening.

00:21.986 --> 00:23.446
You what?

00:24.364 --> 00:27.450
<i>That toy isn't bringing back memories
of being scared.</i>

00:27.659 --> 00:29.619
She was straddled by her assailant.

00:32.914 --> 00:36.042
Wayne didn't kill that woman.
Well, it was someone smaller.

00:36.251 --> 00:38.878
Stabbed the woman
until the knife got so bloody...

00:39.087 --> 00:42.090
...her hand slipped along
the edge of the sharp blade...

00:42.298 --> 00:44.050
...cutting her palm very deeply.

00:44.217 --> 00:46.177
Everything you've said is a lie.

00:47.053 --> 00:49.180
That's my story...

00:49.681 --> 00:51.891
...and I'm sticking to it.

00:52.100 --> 00:53.685
Did you get the blood report back?

00:53.893 --> 00:56.187
From the bodies from the dig?

00:56.354 --> 00:57.814
Yeah.

00:58.022 --> 00:59.649
Anything I should know?

01:01.317 --> 01:02.527
Nope.

01:02.736 --> 01:04.320
Just forget about work.

01:05.029 --> 01:07.782
Joey Quinn. Used to have
an understanding with him.

01:07.991 --> 01:12.036
Leave a bag of cash in his car
and he'd do whatever we asked.

01:17.584 --> 01:20.086
He drew his gun as the attacker fired.

01:22.589 --> 01:25.008
This blood
is from a defensive wound.

01:27.093 --> 01:31.264
So you got arrested, there'll be a trial,
you'll go to prison for a long time.

01:31.806 --> 01:33.308
Does that mean this is over?

01:34.642 --> 01:35.810
No.

03:34.596 --> 03:38.391
<i>Hannah McKay.
She stabbed a woman five times.</i>

03:38.600 --> 03:42.562
<i>And since I found out, all I can think
about is giving her what she deserves.</i>

03:42.770 --> 03:44.772
Maybe she deserves a little slack.

03:44.981 --> 03:47.483
When she killed that woman,
she was only 15.

03:47.692 --> 03:51.571
Scared of Wayne. On the run.
It could have been a one-time thing.

03:51.779 --> 03:56.159
I saw the way she touched
her trophies. Nostalgic.

03:56.701 --> 03:59.203
And when you like to kill,
you don't just stop.

03:59.412 --> 04:01.497
She must have killed again
since Wayne.

04:01.706 --> 04:03.374
You have no evidence
to support that.

04:04.042 --> 04:06.210
Her husband died
of a heart attack at 40.

04:06.419 --> 04:08.296
Perfect health, no family history.

04:08.504 --> 04:11.633
- Seems suspicious.
- You're really reaching here, Dexter.

04:11.841 --> 04:13.885
I know she killed her husband.
I can feel it.

04:14.636 --> 04:16.554
I just need proof.

04:16.763 --> 04:18.514
Don't you have
more pressing concerns?

04:18.723 --> 04:20.934
Debra, LaGuerta, Isaak.

04:21.142 --> 04:23.102
Why do you think I need a kill
so badly?

04:28.816 --> 04:31.736
- Where do you think you're going?
- To talk to her.

04:31.945 --> 04:35.198
Get her to slip up about her husband.
Give me a lead.

04:35.406 --> 04:37.784
What makes you think
she'll tell you anything?

04:37.992 --> 04:40.453
Last time you saw her,
you accused her of murder.

04:41.621 --> 04:43.373
Good point.

04:44.123 --> 04:46.501
I need a peace offering.

04:48.378 --> 04:50.630
And this is a big opportunity
for the department.

04:50.797 --> 04:53.549
Arresting the head
of the Koshka Brotherhood is good.

04:53.716 --> 04:55.218
Sorry I'm late.

04:58.388 --> 05:00.765
<i>I can't even be late
without making Deb angry.</i>

05:00.974 --> 05:02.475
You all did great work.

05:02.684 --> 05:04.936
The arraignment went well.
Sirko was denied bail.

05:05.144 --> 05:08.982
He has a small army of lawyers, and
they're putting his bail up for review.

05:09.190 --> 05:10.233
No way he'll get out.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.735
- Not on three counts of murder.
- Hope you're right.

05:12.902 --> 05:16.489
<i>So do I. As long as Isaak's behind bars,
I'll have time to deal with Hannah.</i>

05:16.656 --> 05:19.158
Of course he's right.
The guy killed three Colombians.

05:19.325 --> 05:21.703
Plus, we have evidence
that puts Sirko at the scene.

05:21.911 --> 05:23.162
None of that will matter...

05:23.329 --> 05:26.082
-...if his team claims self-defence.
-It's a solid case.

05:26.249 --> 05:27.583
We still need to make sure...

05:27.750 --> 05:30.628
...the captain is prepared
for any questions the DA may ask.

05:30.795 --> 05:34.465
Look, we have all seen cases that we
thought were a sure thing go south.

05:34.632 --> 05:37.760
The right lawyers, the right jury,
anything can happen.

05:37.969 --> 05:40.555
Which is why the DA wants
to make sure it doesn't.

05:51.691 --> 05:54.819
<i>At least I can make a peace offering
to one woman in my life.</i>

05:56.779 --> 05:58.906
<i>If I want Hannah to give</i> me
<i>the time of</i> day...

05:59.073 --> 06:01.159
...I <i>need to show her I'm not</i> a <i>threat.</i>

06:01.325 --> 06:03.494
And how do you intend to do that?

06:03.661 --> 06:06.664
I haven't filled out the blood report
for those bodies we dug up.

06:06.873 --> 06:08.624
I could fudge it.
Omit some key facts.

06:09.625 --> 06:13.921
Forget to run the blood on
the victim's dress for Hannah's DNA.

06:14.130 --> 06:16.591
The cops think Wayne Randall
killed those people.

06:16.758 --> 06:19.427
If I don't tell them otherwise,
they won't know different.

06:19.594 --> 06:21.137
Didn't you promise your sister...

06:21.304 --> 06:23.264
...you wouldn't take cases
from the police?

06:23.431 --> 06:25.391
Hannah has immunity.

06:27.268 --> 06:30.271
Nothing the cops can do.
Telling Deb will only make her crazy.

06:31.147 --> 06:34.859
Then what? You think you'll just show
Hannah this report and she'll confess?

06:35.026 --> 06:37.361
Tell you she killed her husband?

06:37.987 --> 06:40.531
What other choice do I have?

06:55.505 --> 06:57.799
You're blocking my view.

07:01.427 --> 07:03.179
It's a wall.

07:03.679 --> 07:05.807
To you, perhaps.

07:06.182 --> 07:09.769
To me, it's a blank canvas.
A projection screen for the mind.

07:10.478 --> 07:13.231
You killed three of our boys, smartass.

07:13.439 --> 07:17.318
You're not gonna sound so smart
when you're bleeding like a stuck pig.

07:23.032 --> 07:24.242
Right.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.706
You and your Colombian friends
haven't really thought this through.

07:30.915 --> 07:34.293
Now, as a businessman, I've found
you have to weigh short-term gains...

07:34.460 --> 07:36.045
...against long-term consequences.

07:36.963 --> 07:40.633
True, you and your men could retaliate.
In the short-term, I'd be dead.

07:40.842 --> 07:43.094
But I'm not the only member
of the Koshkas.

07:43.261 --> 07:48.141
I could have 100 men here should
anything happen to me, understand?

07:49.350 --> 07:50.476
Yeah.

07:51.394 --> 07:54.397
We outnumber you. We out gun you.

07:54.605 --> 07:56.482
Quite frankly,
we're smarter than you.

07:57.024 --> 08:00.570
So I'm afraid in the long-term...

08:00.736 --> 08:02.613
...your plan falls a little short.

08:06.576 --> 08:09.871
Now, the art of any deal
is negotiation.

08:10.079 --> 08:11.789
Have we come to terms?

08:13.416 --> 08:15.042
Yeah.

08:32.310 --> 08:35.730
<i>Hi, you've reached George Novikov.
Leave me a message.</i>

08:35.938 --> 08:40.610
George, it's Isaak. I need you
to pay me a visit. It's urgent.

08:49.118 --> 08:52.330
<i>Hannah should be on her way back
from the flower mart right about now.</i>

08:52.538 --> 08:54.707
<i>I'll be able to catch her
before I go to work.</i>

09:01.631 --> 09:05.801
<i>I've watched her for days.
She never changes her schedule.</i>

09:29.492 --> 09:30.618
Hannah.

09:31.202 --> 09:33.704
Great, you're a stalker.

09:35.498 --> 09:38.918
- What happened to Peter Cottontail?
- Poison.

09:39.543 --> 09:42.088
Rabbits kill my plants, so I kill them.

09:42.255 --> 09:44.257
You could just trap them
and let them go.

09:44.423 --> 09:47.927
When you do that, they come back.
I do what I have to do.

09:48.928 --> 09:52.223
Remind me to never show up
on your property uninvited.

09:52.807 --> 09:54.308
Too late.

09:54.517 --> 09:58.145
So you've accused me of murder,
animal cruelty.

09:58.354 --> 10:02.400
- Anything else?
- Actually, I came to apologise.

10:04.193 --> 10:08.906
It's a copy of the blood report
from the bodies you helped us find.

10:09.615 --> 10:11.075
Wayne Randall's victims.

10:13.494 --> 10:14.787
Wayne's victims, huh?

10:14.996 --> 10:19.333
The blood evidence was inconclusive.
I realised it when I got back to my lab.

10:19.542 --> 10:21.919
I shouldn't have accused you.
I'm really sorry.

10:22.420 --> 10:24.255
Thanks.

10:25.798 --> 10:28.259
It takes a real gentleman
to admit when he's wrong.

10:34.849 --> 10:36.934
- What?
- You have a little...

10:40.521 --> 10:41.564
Dirt.

10:42.398 --> 10:46.652
Occupational hazard.
I can get pretty dirty.

10:47.528 --> 10:48.571
Right.

10:50.239 --> 10:52.783
<i>Remember why you're here.
Dead husband.</i>

10:52.992 --> 10:56.037
Since I'm here, I could use
a plant for my apartment.

10:56.245 --> 10:58.456
Really? A plant?

11:01.083 --> 11:02.376
Follow me.

11:10.968 --> 11:16.015
- Any idea what you're looking for?
- Just a plant. Something planty.

11:16.223 --> 11:18.225
You're the expert.

11:18.642 --> 11:21.312
Well, why don't you tell me
about your place?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.064
So I can get a better idea.

11:23.272 --> 11:28.527
It's a one bedroom on the water,
lots of sunlight.

11:28.694 --> 11:30.988
- You live alone?
- Currently, yeah.

11:31.197 --> 11:33.741
- You?
- Currently, yeah.

11:33.949 --> 11:36.827
- And before?
- I was married for a little while.

11:38.496 --> 11:40.289
Unfortunately, he passed away.

11:42.416 --> 11:43.709
How about this one?

11:43.876 --> 11:46.170
If you take good care of it,
it'll last for years.

11:46.337 --> 11:49.423
Really? I always figured
once you took flowers home...

11:49.590 --> 11:51.258
...they had already started to die.

11:51.467 --> 11:53.886
- That's kind of a morbid outlook.
- Is it?

11:54.053 --> 11:57.473
Yeah, I guess I'm kind of
maybe a morbid guy.

12:00.976 --> 12:03.437
So how'd he die, your husband?

12:04.188 --> 12:06.941
Heart attack, but we really don't need
to talk about it.

12:10.486 --> 12:15.574
We can though if you want to.
I mean, I understand. My wife died too.

12:16.784 --> 12:18.244
Oh, what happened?

12:19.078 --> 12:20.246
She was murdered.

12:20.454 --> 12:21.664
Oh, God, that's...

12:21.831 --> 12:23.499
That's awful.

12:24.041 --> 12:25.668
Yeah.

12:25.960 --> 12:29.547
Different from your situation,
obviously.

12:30.089 --> 12:31.590
Yeah.

12:31.757 --> 12:34.385
All this doom and gloom.

12:34.552 --> 12:37.346
You mind if we change the subject?

12:37.555 --> 12:41.183
<i>I do, actually. If her husband's
off-limits, I'll have to take another tack.</i>

12:41.350 --> 12:45.020
- So how long have you had this place?
- About a year.

12:45.229 --> 12:47.148
Worked for the previous owner
before that.

12:47.356 --> 12:49.608
Beverly Grey, amazing woman.

12:49.775 --> 12:52.486
I've kept the business exactly the same
as when she ran it.

12:52.653 --> 12:55.990
Same clients, same schedule.
I even kept her handyman on.

12:56.198 --> 12:59.452
- Where is she now? Retired?
- She passed away about a year ago.

12:59.660 --> 13:01.829
That's when I took over.

13:02.037 --> 13:03.956
<i>Dead husband, dead mentor.</i>

13:04.165 --> 13:07.585
It was actually a really sad time,
so I'd...

13:07.751 --> 13:09.086
I'd rather not talk about it.

13:09.253 --> 13:11.714
Sorry, I wasn't going
for more doom and gloom.

13:11.922 --> 13:13.841
Seems you have a knack.

13:17.636 --> 13:21.348
- I should get going. I gotta get to work.
- But you still haven't picked a plant.

13:24.059 --> 13:25.102
That one.

13:26.020 --> 13:28.772
Pink. Really?

13:31.775 --> 13:33.777
What do I owe you?

13:36.238 --> 13:37.406
Consider it a gift.

13:39.325 --> 13:41.076
Thanks.

13:41.660 --> 13:42.703
See you around.

13:43.245 --> 13:46.999
<i>Since Hannah stabbed her first victim,
two people close to her have died.</i>

13:47.208 --> 13:51.420
<i>Seems I'm not the only one
with a knack for doom and gloom.</i>

13:54.423 --> 13:57.593
<i>Beverly Grey. The deceased mentor
of Hannah McKay.</i>

13:59.261 --> 14:01.096
<i>I paid a visit to the clerk of county.</i>

14:01.305 --> 14:04.517
<i>Beverly's will listed Hannah
as her lone beneficiary.</i>

14:06.060 --> 14:09.355
Makes sense.
No children, no immediate family.

14:09.897 --> 14:12.733
Why wouldn't Beverly
leave Hannah her legacy?

14:14.068 --> 14:16.111
But if Hannah
were Beverly's heir apparent...

14:16.278 --> 14:18.697
...it'd give her motive
for murder.

14:21.450 --> 14:25.120
The question is,
is Hannah responsible for her death?

14:25.746 --> 14:29.291
- Cause of death, heart attack.
- Just like her husband.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.586
- Seems suspicious.
- Or not.

14:32.795 --> 14:35.714
Heart disease is the leading cause
of death in this country.

14:35.923 --> 14:37.883
Hell, it got me.

14:38.092 --> 14:42.263
What about poison?
That's the way women usually kill.

14:42.471 --> 14:47.101
- Safe. Detached.
- She poisons rabbits, Dexter.

14:47.309 --> 14:49.436
It doesn't mean she poisons people.

14:49.645 --> 14:52.690
Why are you so convinced
she's still a killer?

14:58.529 --> 15:00.281
<i>I know that face.</i>

15:02.950 --> 15:04.118
<i>Sal Price.</i>

15:04.743 --> 15:08.622
<i>Maybe he can tell me something
about Hannah I don't already know.</i>

15:15.212 --> 15:16.880
Hey, was that Sal Price?

15:17.047 --> 15:19.466
- Yeah. What do you care?
- I read his book. I'm a fan.

15:19.675 --> 15:21.260
Since when do you read true crime?

15:21.427 --> 15:23.762
Since we started working
on the Wayne Randall case.

15:23.929 --> 15:25.639
I'm learning new things about you.

15:26.307 --> 15:27.516
What was Price doing here?

15:27.683 --> 15:30.060
He heard we dug up more
Wayne Randall victims.

15:30.269 --> 15:33.480
He wants to reissue his book.
He asked if he could see the case files.

15:33.689 --> 15:35.733
- I said I'd have copies made.
- Shit.

15:36.358 --> 15:38.235
The case is closed.
What's the big deal?

15:38.402 --> 15:40.237
<i>I fudged the blood report
for starters.</i>

15:40.446 --> 15:43.782
No, it's just... Was he leaving?
I wanna ask him to sign my book.

15:43.991 --> 15:46.493
Went to the coffee truck
while I'm having copies made.

15:46.660 --> 15:48.078
I'm sure he'd love to.

15:54.043 --> 15:56.211
- Coffee.
- Mr. Price?

15:56.420 --> 16:00.257
Hi. Dexter Morgan. I'm a big fan.

16:00.507 --> 16:02.843
I was hoping
maybe I can get an autograph?

16:03.385 --> 16:05.554
Yeah, sure. Of course.

16:05.763 --> 16:07.389
Morgan.

16:07.681 --> 16:11.143
- Any relation to the lieutenant?
- Yeah, she's my sister.

16:11.352 --> 16:14.980
She says you're writing an update
on the new bodies. That's exciting.

16:15.189 --> 16:17.149
Is she single?

16:17.316 --> 16:19.485
Yeah, last time I checked.

16:20.444 --> 16:23.614
Look, I should warn you, since we're
talking about a solved crime...

16:23.781 --> 16:25.949
...I didn't put much time
into my blood report.

16:26.116 --> 16:29.703
That's okay, I usually have my own guy
take a look. Just in case.

16:29.912 --> 16:31.872
What are you hoping to find?

16:32.498 --> 16:33.707
I have a little theory...

16:33.874 --> 16:36.627
...that Hannah McKay deserves
her own sequel.

16:36.835 --> 16:39.213
So does your sister date, or--?

16:39.421 --> 16:41.298
You're writing a book
about Hannah McKay?

16:41.507 --> 16:43.342
What are the highlights?

16:44.343 --> 16:47.054
Come on, give me something.
Just a teaser for a fan.

16:49.932 --> 16:52.643
Only if you put in a good word
for me with your sister.

16:52.851 --> 16:54.436
Sure.

16:54.603 --> 16:56.271
So? Hannah McKay?

16:57.147 --> 16:58.691
Right, so get this.

16:59.775 --> 17:02.486
Right out of juvie,
Hannah moves into a halfway house.

17:02.695 --> 17:05.364
Seems like all's well
until she accuses some counsellor...

17:05.531 --> 17:07.408
...of abusing her sexually.

17:08.117 --> 17:10.828
- So, what happened?
- Nothing. Guy gets a slap on the wrist.

17:11.036 --> 17:14.081
But a couple of weeks later,
he drops dead.

17:14.289 --> 17:15.624
Rat poisoning.

17:16.166 --> 17:18.544
Sound like a coincidence to you?

17:18.711 --> 17:19.878
Wow, I don't know.

17:20.087 --> 17:22.589
<i>Three makes a pattern.
Maybe they all got in her way.</i>

17:22.798 --> 17:26.301
Well, that's all you're getting out of me.
You want the rest, read the book.

17:27.428 --> 17:30.764
I'm gonna go check on those files.
Pleasure to meet you, Dexter Morgan.

17:34.727 --> 17:36.979
<i>I will read your book, Mr. Price.</i>

17:37.146 --> 17:39.648
<i>But I won't be waiting
for it to come out in hard copy.</i>

17:40.232 --> 17:42.401
You are now officially
my favourite lieutenant.

17:42.568 --> 17:45.404
Can I buy you an adult beverage
as a token of my appreciation?

17:45.571 --> 17:47.573
Some place dark and not too loud?

17:47.740 --> 17:48.866
That sounds like a date.

17:49.032 --> 17:51.952
Not to me. it sounds
like a beautiful police lieutenant...

17:52.119 --> 17:55.247
...sharing an evening
with a handsome crime writer.

17:55.414 --> 17:57.124
Can I take a rain check?

17:57.708 --> 17:59.501
- Sorry.
- Don't be. I get it.

17:59.710 --> 18:01.170
Me coming here, asking you out.

18:01.336 --> 18:03.172
You think I'm trying
to write your story.

18:03.338 --> 18:05.299
- Which, I'm not by the way.
- My story?

18:05.507 --> 18:07.217
Being engaged
to the Ice Truck Killer.

18:07.384 --> 18:09.553
- I'm sure you got--
- That hadn't occurred to me.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.346
- That what you're doing?
- I wasn't.

18:11.513 --> 18:13.474
How do I know
that's not some tactic?

18:13.682 --> 18:15.058
Are you always this defensive?

18:17.936 --> 18:22.983
Sorry, I didn't mean to be defensive.
I'm just not really in a dating mode.

18:23.192 --> 18:25.652
Dating mode. That's a thing.

18:25.861 --> 18:28.530
My life is really fucking complicated.

18:28.739 --> 18:32.743
Fine, but for the record,
I like complicated.

18:32.951 --> 18:37.164
So if you happen
to change your mind, give me a call.

18:52.471 --> 18:55.307
Oh, sorry, had garlic for lunch.

18:55.474 --> 18:56.892
You have gum in here, yes?

18:59.770 --> 19:00.813
What is that?

19:01.355 --> 19:04.107
George left it in my car
the last time I was at the club.

19:04.274 --> 19:05.484
Figured you knew about it.

19:06.193 --> 19:08.237
Why would he do that?

19:10.447 --> 19:12.616
He used to give me cash
to look the other way...

19:12.783 --> 19:14.451
...when I worked Narcotics.

19:17.037 --> 19:19.873
I thought you were joking
when you said you were a dirty cop.

19:20.082 --> 19:23.544
I was joking. I'm a good cop.

19:24.044 --> 19:26.630
- I also like money.
- Joey.

19:26.839 --> 19:28.423
I know.

19:29.383 --> 19:32.052
I figured George was gonna
ask me for something small...

19:32.261 --> 19:34.680
...but now that lsaak's been arrested
I'm not sure...

19:34.847 --> 19:38.475
...I wanna do whatever it is
they're gonna ask me to do.

19:38.642 --> 19:40.227
You're sure you didn't know?

19:40.394 --> 19:43.438
If I did, I would have told you
to give it back.

19:44.898 --> 19:47.901
- You're giving this back, right?
- I'm thinking about it.

19:48.110 --> 19:49.820
Joey, these are dangerous people.

19:50.028 --> 19:52.114
You know,
there's like 10 grand in that bag.

19:52.322 --> 19:55.701
What good is money if you're dead?

20:08.881 --> 20:10.966
I'm not for sale.

20:12.467 --> 20:14.386
Take care of yourself.

20:24.396 --> 20:28.108
<i>Price is going through my evidence
at the police station.</i>

20:28.317 --> 20:30.777
<i>Turnaround is fair play.</i>

20:40.245 --> 20:43.832
<i>Hopefully his thoughts about Hannah
are a little more organised.</i>

20:54.676 --> 20:56.845
<i>Looks like Price and I
share an obsession.</i>

20:57.679 --> 21:00.474
<i>But he's had years
to follow Hannah's every move.</i>

21:01.934 --> 21:02.976
<i>I need to catch up.</i>

21:15.948 --> 21:17.991
<i>Price's source material.</i>

21:18.200 --> 21:20.369
<i>I'll have to come back to see what
he has on me.</i>

21:20.577 --> 21:23.205
<i>Right now, I have to get in
and get out.</i>

21:28.835 --> 21:31.046
<i>A blood test
for Hannah's mentor Beverly Grey.</i>

21:33.799 --> 21:36.426
<i>Whatever it means,
I'll bet Price wrote about it.</i>

21:55.153 --> 21:57.614
Yeah, I'm good. Fine, fine.

21:57.823 --> 22:00.325
- So have you heard from Louis?
- No.

22:00.534 --> 22:02.369
Thank God.

22:02.744 --> 22:05.163
I mean, hookers?

22:05.330 --> 22:07.666
Gross. Who does that?

22:09.751 --> 22:11.378
Yeah.

22:12.087 --> 22:13.588
Gross.

22:14.089 --> 22:16.508
So, what do you think of this place?

22:17.968 --> 22:19.011
I guess it's cute.

22:20.220 --> 22:21.304
Kind of a dive.

22:21.513 --> 22:23.974
Because the owner's thinking
about selling...

22:24.182 --> 22:25.726
...and I'm thinking about buying.

22:25.934 --> 22:28.437
How are you gonna find
the time to run a restaurant...

22:28.603 --> 22:30.188
...with all the hours you put in?

22:30.355 --> 22:34.192
I could just retire.
I've put in my 20 years.

22:34.401 --> 22:36.987
- So you're just gonna quit?
- Retire.

22:37.195 --> 22:39.322
- Do something else?
- Yeah.

22:39.531 --> 22:44.077
Look, Angel, you're my brother
and I love you.

22:44.453 --> 22:46.997
But this is a big decision.

22:47.205 --> 22:49.332
And we both know you're impulsive.

22:49.541 --> 22:52.002
You get these crazy ideas,
like, you wanna buy a--

22:52.169 --> 22:54.546
- I don't get--
- You do and then you end up divorced.

22:54.713 --> 22:59.342
With a broken down Trans Am and
barely enough money to pay the rent.

23:11.521 --> 23:12.606
I see you brought Jurg.

23:12.773 --> 23:15.609
So good to see you both getting on
in my absence.

23:15.776 --> 23:17.694
You kidding?
Since you've been arrested...

23:17.861 --> 23:20.572
...can't take a shit without Lurch
breathing down my neck.

23:20.739 --> 23:23.825
Well, someone has to keep an eye
on you while I'm in here.

23:26.536 --> 23:28.371
So, what's the big emergency?

23:28.580 --> 23:31.833
You need to get me out of here
as soon as humanly possible.

23:32.793 --> 23:36.254
- What happened?
- Nothing. Yet.

23:36.463 --> 23:40.008
But I'd really like
to avoid killing anyone in here.

23:41.051 --> 23:43.804
It would get in the way
of my being released.

23:46.306 --> 23:48.642
Have you heard
from Detective Quinn?

23:50.310 --> 23:52.104
He...

23:52.312 --> 23:53.438
He gave back the money.

23:55.732 --> 23:59.152
Which is weird, because he's never
turned down a payoff before.

24:03.532 --> 24:05.283
George.

24:06.368 --> 24:08.578
Do not disappoint me.

24:30.016 --> 24:31.226
Hi.

24:31.393 --> 24:33.353
Quinn. Reservation for two.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.147
Your other party's already arrived.

24:35.313 --> 24:37.440
- Right this way, Mr. Quinn.
- Okay.

24:47.075 --> 24:48.201
Enjoy your dinner.

24:52.414 --> 24:54.749
What the fuck is this?
Where's Nadia?

24:57.878 --> 25:01.882
If you hurt her, I will put a bullet
through your motherfucking head.

25:02.090 --> 25:04.509
Easy, detective. Don't make a scene.

25:05.844 --> 25:08.430
Nadia is a valuable commodity.

25:08.597 --> 25:12.058
We wouldn't do that.
Not unless we had to.

25:22.527 --> 25:26.740
- What do you want from me?
- I don't want shit. But Isaak Sirko...

25:26.907 --> 25:30.285
...he wants you to lose the blood
evidence linking him to the murders.

25:30.452 --> 25:33.455
- Why the fuck would I do that for you?
- You took our money.

25:33.622 --> 25:36.082
And I gave it back.
I don't owe you shit.

25:36.291 --> 25:38.001
Not the way Isaak sees it.

25:38.210 --> 25:41.254
Now, he did you a favour by taking out
those Colombian scumbags.

25:41.463 --> 25:44.132
As soon as you let him go,
he'll head back to the Ukraine.

25:44.341 --> 25:46.134
You'll never hear from him again.

25:46.343 --> 25:48.678
-It's not that big a deal.
- Then find someone else.

25:48.887 --> 25:52.182
Now, why would we do that
when we have you?

25:54.809 --> 25:58.188
Joey, come on.
You know we got you.

26:01.608 --> 26:03.318
What happens if I don't cooperate?

26:05.528 --> 26:09.950
I'm thinking of transferring Nadia
to one of our sex clubs in Dubai.

26:10.158 --> 26:12.202
But she's a strong girl.

26:12.410 --> 26:15.080
She'll last a couple weeks
before she slits her wrists.

26:18.166 --> 26:20.210
If I do this...

26:21.544 --> 26:23.964
...Nadia's a free woman.

26:24.297 --> 26:27.133
You give me her fucking passport,
understand?

26:27.717 --> 26:29.344
Deal.

26:29.636 --> 26:32.973
And I'll do you one better.
You can even keep the cash.

26:38.103 --> 26:40.647
See, Joe? Just like old times.

26:59.582 --> 27:01.376
<i>It's Nadia. Leave a message.</i>

27:01.584 --> 27:04.838
Nadia, it's Joey.
Call me as soon as you get this.

27:11.678 --> 27:13.638
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

27:16.641 --> 27:19.686
- How was the meeting with the DA?
- Fine.

27:19.894 --> 27:22.772
He's confident that we have
enough evidence to put Sirko away.

27:23.690 --> 27:25.650
Thank the sweet fucking
baby Jesus.

27:25.859 --> 27:27.986
That's not what I wanted
to talk to you about.

27:31.323 --> 27:34.284
I had my last two interviews
yesterday.

27:34.492 --> 27:36.369
With families
of the missing persons...

27:36.536 --> 27:39.331
...who could have been victims
of the Bay Harbor Butcher?

27:39.539 --> 27:41.041
And? Any leads?

27:41.583 --> 27:42.709
Not a one.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.045
It's frustrating.

27:45.211 --> 27:48.298
So I started looking into open cases.

27:49.007 --> 27:53.094
I figure a lot of homicide suspects
vanish into thin air.

27:53.261 --> 27:56.139
What if the Butcher
took some of them out?

27:57.390 --> 27:59.476
That's good thinking.

27:59.976 --> 28:03.313
- Did you find anything?
- Maybe.

28:03.730 --> 28:05.231
Remember the barrel girls?

28:05.440 --> 28:09.069
A swamp full of blonds in barrels,
all of them...

28:09.277 --> 28:12.697
...raped, electrocuted and embalmed?
Yeah, how could I forget it?

28:12.906 --> 28:17.660
All five suspects, including
self-help guru Jordan Chase...

28:17.869 --> 28:20.705
...went missing before we could build
a case against them.

28:20.914 --> 28:23.583
You're thinking
the Butcher could have killed them.

28:23.875 --> 28:28.463
- There were two vigilante killers.
- Maybe he took on an accomplice.

28:28.671 --> 28:32.175
One of the victims
who was looking for justice.

28:34.260 --> 28:36.554
I know it's a reach.

28:38.181 --> 28:40.100
But it's possible.

28:41.393 --> 28:44.854
Wasn't the theory that Jordan Chase
killed the accomplices...

28:45.063 --> 28:46.564
-...then fled the country?
- Yes.

28:46.731 --> 28:50.693
But even if Chase killed
the other four suspects...

28:50.902 --> 28:54.114
...the Butcher still could have
killed Chase.

29:01.955 --> 29:03.206
I don't think so.

29:04.624 --> 29:07.293
Jordan Chase was very high profile.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.462
It would be too risky.

29:10.630 --> 29:12.382
Still...

29:13.758 --> 29:15.510
It's worth looking into.

29:32.861 --> 29:35.029
Find what you're looking for?

29:35.572 --> 29:38.700
It says here Price bribed
the funeral director to get access...

29:38.908 --> 29:41.911
...to Beverly Grey's body
before she was cremated.

29:42.454 --> 29:47.250
He stole a blood sample
and ran it for aconite.

29:47.459 --> 29:48.793
Aconite?

29:49.002 --> 29:50.587
The queen of all poisons.

29:53.381 --> 29:55.341
Ingesting it causes a heart attack.

29:56.301 --> 29:59.471
Price says it's been growing on
the greenhouse property for years.

29:59.679 --> 30:02.724
Poison. You were right.

30:03.266 --> 30:05.560
- Didn't show up on the autopsy?
- It wouldn't have.

30:05.727 --> 30:08.062
Not if they didn't know
what they were looking for.

30:08.229 --> 30:10.023
Her blood test.

30:12.192 --> 30:15.737
Positive for aconite.
Proof that Beverly was poisoned.

30:15.945 --> 30:18.990
But not proof
that Hannah did the poisoning.

30:19.616 --> 30:22.702
Hannah said her handyman was there
when Beverly was still alive.

30:22.911 --> 30:25.538
That could be worth a conversation.

30:29.501 --> 30:32.879
Jesus, now she's showing up
where I live.

30:47.560 --> 30:50.522
- What are you doing here?
- You picked the wrong plant.

30:50.730 --> 30:53.274
I knew I could do better.
Hopefully you won't kill it.

30:53.858 --> 30:57.153
- What is it?
-It's a spotted phalaenopsis.

30:57.362 --> 31:00.031
See the red on the petals?
Remind you of anything?

31:00.532 --> 31:03.493
- Blood spatter.
- Which reminded me of you.

31:03.701 --> 31:06.871
You came all the way out here
just to bring me that?

31:07.705 --> 31:10.375
- How did you find me?
- Google.

31:10.583 --> 31:12.085
Now who's the stalker?

31:16.130 --> 31:18.049
<i>I should ask her to leave.</i>

31:18.258 --> 31:20.009
So you wanna come in?

31:20.218 --> 31:24.180
Yeah, sure.
I'll help you find a place for it.

31:25.181 --> 31:30.353
I need a spot near a window,
but not directly in front of it.

31:34.774 --> 31:39.320
No, that's the bedroom.
No plants in here. Not enough light.

31:39.529 --> 31:41.072
You could open the shades.

31:42.907 --> 31:44.492
I like the dark.

31:44.659 --> 31:46.035
So do I.

31:46.202 --> 31:47.870
<i>Why is she here?
What does she want?</i>

31:57.922 --> 31:59.007
There.

31:59.215 --> 32:01.759
Now you can look at it
when you wake up...

32:01.968 --> 32:04.095
...and when you go to bed.

32:08.182 --> 32:10.560
Sorry, I gotta take this.

32:12.729 --> 32:14.397
Hey, Deb. What's up?

32:14.606 --> 32:17.191
Nothing, just that LaGuerta might have
another theory...

32:17.400 --> 32:18.860
...that could royally fuck us.

32:19.402 --> 32:21.821
- Can you <i>meet</i> me?
- I'm in the middle of something.

32:22.030 --> 32:24.532
Dex, this can't wait.

32:24.699 --> 32:27.660
All right, I'll meet you in 20.

32:34.542 --> 32:37.962
I'm telling you, Dexter, LaGuerta's
not just gonna forget this one.

32:38.171 --> 32:40.256
Jordan Chase is long gone.
So are the others.

32:40.465 --> 32:42.342
There's nothing
to trace them back to me.

32:43.926 --> 32:46.304
Are you sure about that?

32:47.764 --> 32:50.016
There are no loose ends?

32:50.391 --> 32:52.810
What about the person
you were working with?

32:53.519 --> 32:56.939
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know what I'm talking about.

32:57.106 --> 32:59.817
There were two vigilante killers,
not one.

33:01.486 --> 33:03.321
Who was helping you?

33:05.448 --> 33:07.742
She wasn't helping me.
I was helping her.

33:08.493 --> 33:11.329
- Was she one of their victims?
- It doesn't matter.

33:12.288 --> 33:15.166
If LaGuerta tracks her down,
which is next to impossible...

33:15.375 --> 33:17.794
...she won't incriminate herself
or me.

33:18.002 --> 33:20.838
- How do you know that?
- Trust me, I just do.

33:24.050 --> 33:26.177
Motherfucker.

33:29.138 --> 33:31.224
You were together.

33:33.351 --> 33:34.394
Like a couple.

33:37.522 --> 33:40.108
I remember having a thought...

33:40.316 --> 33:43.736
...that whoever was doing this
was doing it for love.

33:45.321 --> 33:47.865
That was right after Rita died.

33:48.908 --> 33:53.371
You had that tenant
with that weird fucking name.

33:54.288 --> 33:55.373
Lumen.

33:57.041 --> 33:59.293
- It was her, wasn't it?
- It doesn't matter.

33:59.502 --> 34:01.087
It was.

34:01.295 --> 34:03.881
Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter.

34:04.090 --> 34:07.176
You moved your girlfriend
into the house...

34:07.385 --> 34:10.221
...where Trinity murdered your wife...

34:11.931 --> 34:16.394
-...so you could kill together?
- It wasn't like that.

34:16.853 --> 34:19.105
I felt guilty
about what happened to Rita.

34:19.313 --> 34:23.401
I thought
that maybe if I helped Lumen...

34:27.238 --> 34:30.324
- I was trying to make things right.
- Of course.

34:30.867 --> 34:33.578
By murdering five other people.

34:38.750 --> 34:42.211
Why can't the past stay in the past?
Do we have to keep talking about this?

34:42.378 --> 34:44.672
We do, as long as LaGuerta
has a bug up her ass.

34:44.881 --> 34:48.593
Let me worry about LaGuerta, please!

34:48.760 --> 34:52.221
You just worry about yourself.

34:55.183 --> 34:57.977
Go out. Have fun.

34:58.144 --> 35:00.104
Go on a date.

35:01.272 --> 35:04.442
That guy, Sal Price. He was into you.

35:04.609 --> 35:06.444
Get out of my house.

35:06.652 --> 35:08.196
What did I say?

35:20.208 --> 35:22.418
<i>I really need to kill someone.</i>

35:28.090 --> 35:31.219
<i>Hannah's become a real thorn
in my side.</i>

35:33.095 --> 35:37.767
<i>Maybe her handyman can give me
what I need to finally fix my problem.</i>

35:37.975 --> 35:39.685
Excuse me.

35:39.852 --> 35:40.895
Is Hannah here?

35:42.480 --> 35:44.482
- She's at the flower market.
- Oh, man.

35:44.690 --> 35:47.151
I drove all the way.
You know when she'll be back?

35:47.360 --> 35:50.446
An hour or so. It might be sooner.

35:50.655 --> 35:52.406
You could wait.

36:04.627 --> 36:07.004
How long have you been
working here?

36:09.382 --> 36:10.800
About 10 years.

36:10.967 --> 36:12.927
So you knew the previous owner.

36:13.135 --> 36:14.512
Beverly Grey?

36:14.679 --> 36:16.597
Hannah said she passed away.

36:16.806 --> 36:19.016
Heart disease. Sad story.

36:19.225 --> 36:22.854
Yeah, Hannah said they were close.
It must have been hard on her.

36:23.729 --> 36:27.191
I'm sure it was,
but she never let it show.

36:27.400 --> 36:30.236
- Not the emotional type, huh?
- I never saw anything like it.

36:30.444 --> 36:32.905
Even when Beverly got sick,
Hannah never complained.

36:33.114 --> 36:34.991
Never asked for help.

36:36.117 --> 36:37.743
Help with what?

36:37.910 --> 36:39.537
Taking care of Beverly.

36:39.745 --> 36:42.290
Hannah bathed her, fed her,
took her to the doctor's.

36:42.874 --> 36:43.916
All alone?

36:45.126 --> 36:46.294
She was stubborn, man.

36:46.961 --> 36:50.131
I figured it had something to do
with growing up on a farm, you know?

36:50.339 --> 36:53.384
Just ploughing through.
Look, I tried to help out.

36:53.593 --> 36:56.387
Hannah dug her heels in.
Wouldn't let anybody near Beverly.

36:56.596 --> 37:00.516
<i>Which means Hannah was the only one
who had the access to poison her.</i>

37:05.813 --> 37:09.901
Hey, Hannah mentioned a purple
wildflower that grows on the property.

37:10.067 --> 37:11.903
Thought it would look great
in my place.

37:12.069 --> 37:14.655
I'm thinking I could take a look
while I wait.

37:15.239 --> 37:18.576
All the wildflowers are over
in the southwest corner.

37:37.845 --> 37:39.639
Aconite.

37:39.805 --> 37:42.433
Price is right. Yet again.

37:42.642 --> 37:46.103
Beautiful and dangerous.
Just like Hannah.

37:51.025 --> 37:52.902
She's harvested it.

37:53.110 --> 37:55.780
Maybe she's set her sights
on a new target.

37:55.988 --> 37:57.406
You're after her.

37:57.615 --> 38:00.034
Who's to say she isn't after you?

38:00.576 --> 38:01.619
But Why?

38:04.413 --> 38:06.999
She doesn't think I'm a threat.
She accepted my apology.

38:07.208 --> 38:08.292
Don't be naive, Dexter.

38:08.501 --> 38:11.295
You think she's a killer
but not a liar?

38:11.504 --> 38:12.880
Dexter?

38:14.215 --> 38:16.133
What are you doing here?

38:16.300 --> 38:18.803
I was in the neighbourhood.

38:20.388 --> 38:22.848
Well, come on in.
I'll make some coffee.

38:35.653 --> 38:37.613
Careful, it's hot.

38:40.992 --> 38:43.411
<i>And potentially deadly.</i>

38:46.205 --> 38:49.041
Hannah, I wish I had more time,
but I gotta get to work.

38:49.834 --> 38:52.378
You know, I don't understand you,
Dexter.

38:52.586 --> 38:55.339
I can't figure out what it is
that you really want.

38:55.548 --> 38:58.092
- Nothing. I don't want anything.
- You want something.

38:58.259 --> 39:01.345
- You keep making excuses to see me.
- They weren't excuses.

39:01.554 --> 39:03.848
It's getting creepy
that you keep coming by.

39:04.056 --> 39:05.808
Creepy? You came to my place too.

39:06.017 --> 39:08.853
Why don't you just save us
both the trouble and spit it out?

39:09.061 --> 39:10.896
I wanna take you out.

39:11.063 --> 39:12.940
On a date?

39:13.482 --> 39:16.819
- That'll work.
- Well, that's sweet.

39:18.029 --> 39:20.072
But I don't date.

39:23.367 --> 39:24.827
- I get too attached.
- Really?

39:24.994 --> 39:28.289
- You don't strike me as the type.
- Well, I'm not who people think I am.

39:28.456 --> 39:29.707
So who are you?

39:30.791 --> 39:32.001
On the inside?

39:34.003 --> 39:37.882
Probably still that 15-year-old girl
who ran away with Wayne Randall.

39:38.090 --> 39:40.634
<i>The girl who stabbed a woman
in cold blood.</i>

39:40.843 --> 39:42.887
Except now I know better.

39:43.888 --> 39:45.306
What do you mean?

39:45.848 --> 39:48.434
I mean, he promised me everything.

39:48.893 --> 39:53.022
He was gonna take me to Disney
World and Santa's Holiday Adventure.

39:53.230 --> 39:57.443
Some little Christmas-themed
shithole just outside of Miami.

39:57.902 --> 39:58.944
You know it?

40:04.366 --> 40:07.578
It's the only place in Florida
where you can see the snow.

40:07.787 --> 40:09.747
I was obsessed.

40:10.956 --> 40:13.250
Then we were gonna live
in Argentina on a farm...

40:13.459 --> 40:15.544
...and have this picture-perfect life.

40:15.753 --> 40:17.421
Sounds pretty good to me.

40:17.630 --> 40:19.965
Yeah, it was all I could think about.

40:20.925 --> 40:22.426
I longed for it.

40:22.635 --> 40:25.346
I needed it,
and I knew that until I had it...

40:25.513 --> 40:27.973
...I would never be satisfied.

40:28.682 --> 40:32.353
The craziest part is that somehow
I had myself convinced that Wayne...

40:32.561 --> 40:34.647
...was the only one
who could give it to me.

40:34.814 --> 40:36.440
Wayne? Really?

40:36.607 --> 40:38.109
Why?

40:38.692 --> 40:41.570
I had it in my head
that he was the answer.

40:43.405 --> 40:46.742
That he was gonna fill
the emptiness that I felt inside.

40:48.828 --> 40:51.539
So I didn't care when he turned
out to be the bad guy.

40:52.373 --> 40:54.959
I didn't care if he shot somebody.

40:55.584 --> 40:58.587
I didn't even care
if I ended up in juvie.

40:59.380 --> 41:01.757
Not until later anyway.

41:03.384 --> 41:05.219
It was worth it...

41:06.595 --> 41:09.765
...just to hold on to the fantasy.

41:10.808 --> 41:12.059
You still feel that way?

41:16.397 --> 41:19.441
No, now I do whatever it takes
to make sure I don't lose myself...

41:19.608 --> 41:21.318
...like that again.

41:23.571 --> 41:26.740
But I do still wish
I had gotten to see the snow.

41:32.329 --> 41:34.456
You know I'm not Wayne, right?

41:42.506 --> 41:44.925
I'm not gonna land you in jail.

41:45.509 --> 41:48.554
- I still think it's a bad idea.
- Why did you come to my apartment?

41:48.721 --> 41:50.097
You know why.

41:50.639 --> 41:51.682
Go out with me.

41:54.852 --> 41:57.771
Come on,
I'm just gonna keep stalking you.

42:00.232 --> 42:02.735
I'm just-- I'm just trying
to do the right thing.

42:02.943 --> 42:04.904
Do the wrong thing.

42:07.489 --> 42:09.158
Fine.

42:09.366 --> 42:10.743
One date.

42:11.827 --> 42:14.955
- But if I end up in jail--
- I'll pick you up at 8.

42:25.257 --> 42:26.425
A date?

42:26.634 --> 42:27.927
Really?

42:28.135 --> 42:31.430
She caught me off guard.
I had to think of something.

42:38.729 --> 42:42.107
Nadia, it's Joey. I stopped by the club
last night and you weren't there.

42:42.274 --> 42:44.610
I know I've called 50 times.
I'm worried about you.

42:44.777 --> 42:48.113
Please call me back.
Let me know you're okay.

42:49.448 --> 42:50.491
You got a sec?

42:50.699 --> 42:53.410
- Not really, I--
- Do I seem impulsive to you?

42:53.619 --> 42:55.746
Jamie says I make bad decisions.

42:55.955 --> 42:59.541
But I have this opportunity,
and I'm thinking about retiring.

42:59.750 --> 43:01.085
Holy shit.

43:01.252 --> 43:03.087
- You're retiring?
- No, I didn't say that.

43:03.254 --> 43:06.548
- I'm just considering my options.
- Can we talk later? I got shit to do.

43:08.842 --> 43:11.095
Hey, you know Angel's thinking
about retiring?

43:11.262 --> 43:12.429
Masuka.

43:12.596 --> 43:13.806
Is that true?

43:13.973 --> 43:16.308
I wanna buy a restaurant.

43:17.059 --> 43:19.019
- Give us a minute?
- Yeah. For the record...

43:19.186 --> 43:22.273
...studies show that men who retire
are usually dead in five years.

43:22.481 --> 43:24.400
It's a fact. Look it up.

43:31.448 --> 43:33.158
Where is this coming from?

43:36.120 --> 43:39.123
Is this
about Mike Anderson's murder...

43:39.290 --> 43:42.751
-...because we've been through this.
- I think I'm burnt out, Deb.

43:43.627 --> 43:45.462
I don't date.

43:46.213 --> 43:48.507
I hardly see my kid.

43:48.674 --> 43:52.094
I'm so focused on work
that I forgot to have a life.

43:53.220 --> 43:55.055
And I know this may sound crazy...

43:55.264 --> 44:00.978
...but the idea of buying this restaurant
actually makes me happy.

44:05.357 --> 44:07.776
Doesn't sound crazy at all.

44:43.645 --> 44:44.730
<i>Sal Price.</i>

44:44.938 --> 44:47.524
Sal, hey, it's Debra Morgan from--

44:47.733 --> 44:50.110
<i>Lieutenant Morgan
with the potty mouth.</i>

44:50.277 --> 44:51.612
Right, with the potty mouth.

44:51.779 --> 44:54.907
<i>- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- Are you</i> still up <i>for that</i> drink?

44:55.074 --> 44:58.327
<i>Yeah, absolutely.
But I thought you said--</i>

44:58.494 --> 44:59.912
I think I need to get a life.

45:00.120 --> 45:02.164
<i>Yes, you do.</i>

45:08.587 --> 45:12.383
- Case number?
- Nine-eight-seven-six-zero.

45:13.717 --> 45:15.010
That's the Dixon case.

45:18.305 --> 45:22.101
I gotta testify in court next week.
Need a refresher on the evidence.

45:22.893 --> 45:26.230
Dry section. Bin 51, shelf four.
Third one over.

45:26.438 --> 45:28.357
Back and to the right.

45:32.319 --> 45:34.613
- Case number?
- Case 16258.

45:36.115 --> 45:38.367
It's Layva.
Should be two or three boxes.

45:38.575 --> 45:41.328
It goes to arraignment next month.

46:28.792 --> 46:30.461
Fuck me.

46:35.507 --> 46:36.550
Oral fixation?

46:38.594 --> 46:40.637
Sorry. Bad habit.

46:40.804 --> 46:42.723
When I quit drinking,
I picked up smoking.

46:42.890 --> 46:45.309
When I quit smoking,
I picked up chewing on things.

46:45.476 --> 46:47.769
Straws, pens, toothpicks.

46:47.978 --> 46:50.147
Turns out I have a problem
with moderation.

46:50.355 --> 46:52.941
Me too.
That and an obsessive personality.

46:53.150 --> 46:57.529
Which is great for work,
but it's really shitty for relationships.

46:57.738 --> 47:00.073
Are we talking about me or you?

47:02.075 --> 47:05.412
So, what are you working on right now?
You're updating your book, right?

47:05.579 --> 47:07.331
That and another project.

47:07.539 --> 47:10.542
Which I probably
shouldn't tell you about.

47:10.751 --> 47:12.336
Why? Is it a secret?

47:12.544 --> 47:16.131
- Because trust me, I can keep a secret.
- I don't know.

47:16.340 --> 47:19.885
You're the Lieutenant of Homicide, and
when I tell cops about my theories...

47:20.052 --> 47:22.012
...they tell me to go fuck myself.

47:22.221 --> 47:24.806
That won't happen here, I promise.

47:27.100 --> 47:28.560
Come on, don't be a cop-tease.

47:29.520 --> 47:32.898
A good theory
totally gives me a girl boner.

47:34.525 --> 47:36.276
Okay.

47:36.985 --> 47:38.529
Off the record.

47:39.196 --> 47:41.657
You know that stuff in my book
about Hannah McKay...

47:41.865 --> 47:43.492
...being this innocent young girl?

47:43.700 --> 47:46.370
A victim
of Wayne Randall's influence?

47:46.578 --> 47:49.540
- Yeah.
- Well, I think it's bogus.

47:50.999 --> 47:54.253
I think Hannah killed her first victim
right along with Wayne.

47:54.461 --> 47:56.421
And I think she kept right on killing.

47:56.630 --> 47:57.756
Go fuck yourself.

47:59.383 --> 48:01.760
If that's true, we're fucked.
We gave her immunity.

48:01.927 --> 48:03.053
It's true.

48:03.262 --> 48:06.348
I have evidence to back it up.
It's in my bag right now.

48:06.557 --> 48:07.849
Wait, you have it here?

48:08.016 --> 48:10.519
- Why, do you wanna see it?
- You have to show it to me.

48:10.686 --> 48:14.690
- I'm the Lieutenant of Homicide.
- Look at you. Like a dog with a bone.

48:16.024 --> 48:19.194
If you show it to me,
I'll totally make outwith you.

48:22.614 --> 48:24.908
Best first date ever.

48:27.077 --> 48:28.579
Okay.

48:29.538 --> 48:34.126
So these are the spatter photos
from the bodies you dug up.

48:34.835 --> 48:37.546
I've seen those. Dexter said
the evidence was inconclusive.

48:37.754 --> 48:39.131
My blood guy disagreed.

48:39.339 --> 48:41.550
Well, there's no way.
My brother's never wrong.

48:41.758 --> 48:44.428
My guy said the pattern
on this body indicates a killer...

48:44.595 --> 48:46.722
...much smaller than Wayne Randall.

48:46.888 --> 48:48.432
Smaller.

48:50.183 --> 48:52.144
Smaller like Hannah McKay?

48:59.735 --> 49:01.862
Fuck balls.

49:02.904 --> 49:04.448
You gotta be kidding me.

49:26.762 --> 49:29.931
I thought this place
was closed for the season.

49:30.140 --> 49:31.892
It is.

49:32.434 --> 49:34.853
So how are we gonna get in?

49:35.604 --> 49:38.732
How do you feel
about a little breaking and entering?

49:42.069 --> 49:43.570
Yeah.

49:53.246 --> 49:55.248
<i>All of us have some kind of longing.</i>

49:55.457 --> 49:58.585
<i>A need crying out to be met.</i>

50:23.860 --> 50:26.196
What is this place?

50:26.363 --> 50:27.572
Wait.

50:35.455 --> 50:37.874
<i>Some of us get what we want
and we're happy.</i>

50:38.083 --> 50:40.043
The snow.

50:42.212 --> 50:45.590
I thought maybe if you saw it,
you could finally get some peace.

50:49.469 --> 50:51.263
Thank you.

50:51.930 --> 50:53.807
Thank you.

51:02.190 --> 51:05.152
<i>But some of us are never satisfied.</i>

51:32.095 --> 51:36.266
When I said I wanted to take you out,
this is what I meant.

51:36.433 --> 51:38.727
You said you wanted to see the snow.

51:40.687 --> 51:43.690
This is what keeps me up at night.

51:46.401 --> 51:48.945
This is what I long for.

51:53.575 --> 51:56.203
This is what I need to...

51:56.995 --> 51:59.414
...fill my emptiness.

52:10.342 --> 52:12.302
Do what you gotta do.

52:45.168 --> 52:47.087
Dexter.
