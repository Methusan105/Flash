00:09.307 --> 00:10.642
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

00:10.850 --> 00:13.561
Our primary suspect
is Sergeant James Doakes.

00:15.230 --> 00:17.649
- Doakes?
- He is not your man.

00:18.775 --> 00:23.196
I think the Bay Harbor Butcher
is alive and still in Miami.

00:23.571 --> 00:26.199
Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher,
end of story.

00:26.700 --> 00:29.244
I found a blood slide
at the crime scene...

00:29.452 --> 00:33.081
...like the ones we found in Doakes'
car and Doakes never had a boat.

00:33.498 --> 00:37.627
Here is a list of Miami Metro personnel
who still do.

00:38.211 --> 00:39.879
Its point of origin...

00:40.088 --> 00:42.799
...front centre mass
burned upward, downward.

00:43.007 --> 00:44.426
Can we close the doors?

00:44.634 --> 00:48.346
This void, it's the same thing
that happened with the first car victim.

00:48.555 --> 00:51.933
"Bobby"? Maybe the victim
was letting us know who did this.

00:52.434 --> 00:53.518
You fucked my girl?

00:53.727 --> 00:58.022
You could learn a thing or two from
her. She takes her job very seriously.

01:02.026 --> 01:03.987
You always been this afraid
of the water?

01:04.195 --> 01:07.365
Ever since my father thought the best
way to teach me how to swim...

01:07.532 --> 01:10.285
...was to march me down
to the local pond and throw me in.

01:10.493 --> 01:12.078
- That's horrible.
- Six years old...

01:12.287 --> 01:15.457
and I already knew what it felt like
to be dying.

01:15.832 --> 01:18.501
- Look, I think you have the wrong idea.
- Shut up.

01:18.710 --> 01:21.087
I know who you are.
I know what you are.

01:22.672 --> 01:26.134
Dexter, you don't have to save her.
You shouldn't even be with her.

01:26.342 --> 01:28.511
It's not even like
you have a fucking future.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.431
All I know is that
when I'm with you, I feel...

01:32.056 --> 01:33.391
...safe.

03:29.632 --> 03:31.801
I saw a man,
he was coming through the flames.

03:31.968 --> 03:35.263
- He was wearing a silver-coloured suit.
- Our Phantom Arsonist.

03:35.471 --> 03:37.849
- He looked like an alien.
- Or a monster.

03:38.057 --> 03:40.476
I swear, he was 7 feet tall.

03:40.685 --> 03:45.565
<i>Monsters, aliens, phantoms,
none of them are real.</i>

03:45.773 --> 03:49.068
<i>The thought that an actual person
could do this is too awful...</i>

03:49.277 --> 03:53.239
...so <i>our imaginations create a way
to make it easier to take.</i>

03:53.615 --> 03:57.869
<i>But the strongest of imaginations can't
protect us once we know the truth.</i>

03:58.077 --> 04:00.580
I called you last night.
Wanted to go over the case.

04:00.788 --> 04:03.458
- We can go over them now.
- Where were you?

04:04.751 --> 04:07.754
Oh, you were with Hannah.

04:08.129 --> 04:12.133
- Find anything? DNA? Prints?
- Nope, nada, zip.

04:12.342 --> 04:15.511
Same accelerant as the other four fires,
though. Kerosene.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.639
He left another "Bobby" in the soot.

04:17.847 --> 04:20.224
Fuck, that's five Bobby's
in two weeks.

04:20.433 --> 04:23.770
- He's gotta be signing his name, right?
- Only thing that makes sense.

04:23.978 --> 04:27.982
None of the victims were named Bobby,
but fuckload of good that does us.

04:28.191 --> 04:31.361
There are thousands
of Bobs and Roberts in Miami.

04:31.569 --> 04:33.613
What do we know
about the latest victim?

04:33.821 --> 04:36.824
Mom took her daughter to the
bathroom. Both went up in smoke.

04:37.033 --> 04:38.493
Kid was 6 years old.

04:38.826 --> 04:42.205
What kind of sick fuck does that
to a 6-year-old kid'?

04:46.292 --> 04:50.546
<i>Maybe the kind who isn't bothered
by the sight of a dead child.</i>

04:56.010 --> 04:57.261
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:59.931 --> 05:02.141
How you feeling?
You get your stitches out?

05:02.350 --> 05:06.479
Yeah, I'm gonna have
a really sexy scar.

05:07.105 --> 05:08.940
- How was your day?
- It was fine.

05:09.399 --> 05:11.150
You don't sound fine.

05:13.778 --> 05:17.615
The Phantom started another fire
today. it killed a mother and child.

05:22.537 --> 05:24.330
- What?
- Why do I get the feeling...

05:24.539 --> 05:27.000
...you wanna wrap him up in plastic?

05:28.126 --> 05:29.168
It doesn't matter.

05:29.335 --> 05:32.130
I promised Deb I wouldn't take
any cases from the police.

05:32.338 --> 05:34.716
If you always listened to Deb,
you wouldn't be here.

05:34.882 --> 05:36.592
I can't kill him, okay?

05:36.801 --> 05:37.927
Okay, fine.

05:39.387 --> 05:42.223
Sorry. I'm just...

05:43.224 --> 05:45.143
"frustrated.

05:46.019 --> 05:47.687
As much as I wanna be here...

05:47.895 --> 05:50.481
...my Dark Passenger wants
to be somewhere else.

05:50.690 --> 05:52.859
I'm sorry. Your "dark" what?

05:54.610 --> 05:55.903
My Dark Passenger.

05:56.112 --> 05:58.656
- That's what I call my need to kill.
- Why?

05:58.865 --> 06:01.034
It's like this thing living inside me...

06:01.242 --> 06:04.037
...telling me what to do,
saying I have to kill...

06:04.245 --> 06:05.663
...not leaving me any choice.

06:05.872 --> 06:08.916
You're not a puppet.
Of course you have a choice.

06:09.125 --> 06:10.710
Actually, I don't.

06:10.918 --> 06:13.546
Come on, Dex. It's just you.

06:13.755 --> 06:17.050
You want the arsonist dead.
And I don't blame you. Who wouldn't?

06:17.258 --> 06:19.135
-It's not the same.
- What do you mean?

06:20.053 --> 06:22.263
Ignore that. I wanna understand this.

06:22.638 --> 06:23.931
How is it different?

06:24.140 --> 06:27.226
A lot of people feel they wanna kill,
but I have to follow through.

06:27.393 --> 06:31.647
I follow through
and I don't have a Dark Passenger.

06:31.856 --> 06:33.733
You don't get it.

06:33.941 --> 06:35.318
I'm trying to.

06:37.403 --> 06:38.988
But, no, I don't get it.

06:41.699 --> 06:44.285
- There's a man in the window.
- What?

06:44.494 --> 06:47.205
- Hi, banana.
- Oh, my God. That's my dad.

06:50.083 --> 06:53.920
I'm sorry if I surprised you. I didn't
even know Hannah had a boyfriend.

06:54.128 --> 06:57.090
- I haven't spoken to you since--
- Go ahead and say it.

06:57.298 --> 07:00.051
Since before I went to prison.

07:00.259 --> 07:01.928
Clint McKay, convicted felon.

07:02.136 --> 07:04.472
Nice to meet you.
No need to get nervous.

07:04.680 --> 07:08.893
I was just in for cheque kiting
and I got out early on good behaviour.

07:09.102 --> 07:12.647
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- Well, let me just get to the point.

07:13.189 --> 07:15.149
I don't know what Hannah's told you...

07:15.358 --> 07:16.776
-...about me.
- Not a lot.

07:16.984 --> 07:19.320
<i>- Well...
-Just that you almost let her drown.</i>

07:19.529 --> 07:21.697
Well, the truth is...

07:22.240 --> 07:26.828
...I was a real, genuine asshole
of a father.

07:27.036 --> 07:30.581
And I needed to admit that
to you in person.

07:30.790 --> 07:33.126
Can we please not do this
in front of Dexter?

07:33.334 --> 07:36.212
If you two are together,
then I want him to hear this.

07:36.420 --> 07:39.632
I spent a lot of time with a prison
shrink, working through my issues.

07:39.841 --> 07:43.678
It's important to take responsibility,
so that's what I'm here to do.

07:45.096 --> 07:49.183
- Okay.
- Now, I don't expect you to forgive me.

07:49.392 --> 07:53.437
Don't see any reason that you should,
not after everything I put you through.

07:54.772 --> 07:56.732
But it's important you know...

07:57.233 --> 08:00.236
...no matter what,
I always loved you.

08:02.321 --> 08:04.157
I always will.

08:09.704 --> 08:13.207
I've got something for you
in my truck.

08:13.583 --> 08:16.252
Let me give it to you
and I'll be on my way.

08:19.755 --> 08:20.840
Surprise.

08:22.592 --> 08:23.843
It's your dollhouse.

08:24.051 --> 08:27.096
Repainted and rebuilt.
It was in your Aunt Cindy's garage.

08:27.305 --> 08:31.434
I figured you loved it so much as a kid,
you might like to have it now.

08:32.935 --> 08:35.021
Dex, give me a hand?

08:45.615 --> 08:50.578
Well, I guess I'll be on my way.
Let you two get back to your dinner.

08:50.786 --> 08:54.957
There's a diner at the Purple Flamingo,
where I'm staying.

08:55.166 --> 08:57.919
They say they make
a pretty decent burger.

08:58.127 --> 08:59.754
Okay.

09:00.671 --> 09:02.256
Okay.

09:03.007 --> 09:05.259
Well,
I guess I'll see you around then.

09:07.428 --> 09:08.763
Nice to meet you, Dexter.

09:13.601 --> 09:14.810
You look good, banana.

09:15.228 --> 09:18.022
Happy-
Glad to see you're doing okay.

09:27.323 --> 09:30.993
I'm sure he meant well, but he
could not have given me a worse gift.

09:32.411 --> 09:34.956
Brings up so much shit.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.083
What kind of shit?

09:37.291 --> 09:40.503
When I was 8,
he took me to a poker tournament.

09:40.711 --> 09:44.548
Lied to my mom and said that we
were going to a county fair...

09:44.757 --> 09:47.551
...and stashed me in a motel room.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.596
Went to play cards
and didn't come back for three days.

09:53.808 --> 09:55.476
That's awful.

09:55.893 --> 09:58.271
When he came back,
he brought the dollhouse...

09:58.479 --> 10:01.691
...bragging about a big win,
saying he'd never leave me again...

10:01.899 --> 10:04.443
...and making promises
that things would get better.

10:04.652 --> 10:07.446
- And did they?
- No. Of course not.

10:11.033 --> 10:13.077
I don't know. I'm...

10:13.828 --> 10:16.372
He's trying, right? Maybe...

10:16.580 --> 10:20.626
Maybe this last stint in lockup
did him some good.

10:21.877 --> 10:23.629
Yeah, maybe.

10:27.300 --> 10:31.929
Most likely we're looking
for a male suspect.

10:32.138 --> 10:34.724
Egocentric, manipulative.

10:34.932 --> 10:38.853
Possibly in or on the outskirts
of law enforcement.

10:39.061 --> 10:40.980
He's methodical.

10:41.188 --> 10:44.275
Fastidious in his appearance,
poor social skills.

10:44.483 --> 10:47.236
This list
is by no means comprehensive.

10:48.654 --> 10:50.948
Should give you an idea
of what we're looking at.

10:51.157 --> 10:55.119
<i>Bosso's profile of the Phantom,
he may as well be describing himself.</i>

10:55.328 --> 10:57.872
<i>An arsonist
who works for the fire department.</i>

10:58.080 --> 11:00.207
<i>- It's almost too easy.</i>
- What else?

11:00.916 --> 11:03.085
Hands-on learner.

11:03.544 --> 11:05.713
Prone to self-aggrandisement.

11:05.921 --> 11:07.548
Thank you, Investigator Bosso.

11:09.008 --> 11:10.885
Where are we on tracking the suit?

11:11.093 --> 11:14.555
There's at least a hundred sites
that sell that on the Internet.

11:14.930 --> 11:16.557
Almost impossible to trace.

11:16.766 --> 11:20.186
- Are you interviewing witnesses?
- Nobody's seen the guy's face.

11:20.394 --> 11:22.646
- More coming.
- Let me know what you find.

11:22.855 --> 11:24.815
Simms, Miller, any leads
from the tip line?

11:24.982 --> 11:26.025
None so far.

11:26.192 --> 11:28.903
Mostly girlfriends trying to get back
at their exes.

11:29.111 --> 11:31.489
Keep at it.
Maybe something will come through.

11:31.697 --> 11:34.241
This fuck has killed seven people
in two weeks.

11:34.909 --> 11:37.370
Let's stop him
before he makes it to number eight.

11:41.123 --> 11:44.335
<i>Hannah's wrong.
Of course I have a Dark Passenger.</i>

11:44.543 --> 11:47.088
<i>There's no other way
to explain this compulsion.</i>

11:57.932 --> 11:59.767
<i>I hope she knows what she's doing.</i>

11:59.975 --> 12:01.936
Who's sending you hugs and kisses?

12:02.520 --> 12:04.063
No one.

12:07.817 --> 12:09.276
Bullshit. That was a girl.

12:09.485 --> 12:11.695
Was she sexting you?
You got pictures?

12:11.904 --> 12:14.448
Come on,
I gotta restock my spank bank.

12:14.657 --> 12:17.701
- Angel, know about Dexter's girlfriend?
- Hannah McKay?

12:17.910 --> 12:19.453
- How did you--?
- Jamie told me.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.290
My man.

12:24.583 --> 12:27.128
Hannah McKay.
Yeah, that is so awesome.

12:27.336 --> 12:30.673
Excuse me, what is awesome
about my brother dating a killer?

12:31.132 --> 12:34.176
You guys heard Sal Price's recording.
Hannah confessed.

12:34.385 --> 12:36.262
Come on, she was 15
when she did that.

12:36.429 --> 12:39.140
When I was 15,
my parents thought that I was retarded.

12:39.306 --> 12:41.100
Hey, hey-

12:41.392 --> 12:42.601
I get it.

12:42.810 --> 12:45.020
Hannah is an attractive girl.

12:47.565 --> 12:49.984
But you should probably be careful.

12:50.192 --> 12:53.070
Yeah,
you should definitely be careful...

12:53.279 --> 12:56.282
...of getting burned
because she's so freaking hot.

12:56.782 --> 12:59.160
Can I see you in my office, please?

13:01.328 --> 13:04.165
I didn't realise you and Hannah McKay
had gone public.

13:04.373 --> 13:05.875
We hadn't until a minute ago.

13:06.083 --> 13:08.461
That's kind of dangerous.
Don't you think?

13:08.669 --> 13:12.298
Dating someone so notorious
when trying to stay under the radar.

13:12.506 --> 13:14.758
I don't wanna talk
about Hannah right now.

13:14.967 --> 13:16.343
Can you just leave it?

13:16.552 --> 13:19.221
Fine, yeah. I'll butt out.

13:20.556 --> 13:22.850
I mean, we're all responsible adults,
right?

13:23.058 --> 13:27.271
You live your life, I'll live mine,
and Hannah will live Hannah's.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.315
Great. You'll leave Hannah alone?

13:29.523 --> 13:32.234
I'm saying that I'll stay out
of your relationship.

13:32.401 --> 13:34.778
I'm not gonna let her get away
with murder again.

13:34.987 --> 13:38.616
- That's not what I meant.
- Dexter, I am fucking serious.

13:38.908 --> 13:41.660
I have compromised the shit
out of myself for you.

13:41.869 --> 13:44.872
I am sure as fuck not gonna do it
for Hannah McKay.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.416
Fine. I get it.

13:48.417 --> 13:51.545
Why are you standing here?
We have a Phantom to catch.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.770
<i>She did say "we."</i>

14:08.562 --> 14:09.813
<i>Philip Bosso.</i>

14:10.022 --> 14:14.026
<i>In his last 27 arson investigations,
he found the fire's origin point.</i>

14:15.486 --> 14:19.573
<i>Either he's great at his job or all he
had to do was look in the mirror.</i>

14:32.670 --> 14:35.297
Okay, it says here
that you work as a janitor...

14:35.506 --> 14:39.843
...at the Y in Brickell Bay
where the Phantom set the first fire.

14:41.428 --> 14:45.182
Did you see anything suspicious
when making your rounds that night?

14:45.683 --> 14:48.686
No, I didn't even know it happened
until I saw the fire truck.

14:48.894 --> 14:50.563
It was horrible.

14:52.189 --> 14:53.440
Right, right, right.

14:53.649 --> 14:56.944
And did you see anyone
in a fireproof suit?

14:57.152 --> 14:59.822
Don't you think
I would've told you if I had?

15:04.952 --> 15:06.120
<i>Bosso's SUV.</i>

15:06.328 --> 15:09.540
<i>But where did he go?
Is he about to strike again?</i>

15:22.511 --> 15:24.305
<i>Electric fuses and camping fuel.</i>

15:26.015 --> 15:27.725
What are you doing here?

15:28.142 --> 15:29.810
<i>That's not a fireproof suit.</i>

15:30.019 --> 15:33.314
Dexter,
you a Civil War re-enactor too?

15:33.772 --> 15:35.899
You here for the battle?

15:37.568 --> 15:40.362
- Yeah.
- Which side are you fighting for?

15:41.280 --> 15:44.825
- The North.
- Oh, why you blue belly.

15:45.034 --> 15:46.827
I should buck and gag you right here.

15:50.456 --> 15:54.293
Were you there last weekend at the
sixth Maine battery cannon firings?

15:54.501 --> 15:56.962
No, damn. I guess I missed that one.

15:57.171 --> 16:00.507
It's a whole weekend affair.
I was in charge of special effects.

16:00.716 --> 16:03.177
Ground, air bursts, artillery fire.

16:03.385 --> 16:05.679
<i>Which explains what's in his car...</i>

16:05.888 --> 16:09.016
<i>...and gives him an alibi
for Saturday's fire.</i>

16:09.808 --> 16:13.020
- Wanna see some pictures?
- You bet.

16:16.982 --> 16:18.901
<i>Bosso's not the Phantom.</i>

16:19.109 --> 16:20.778
<i>He's just strange.</i>

16:20.986 --> 16:24.031
<i>But if he didn't set those fires,
then who did?</i>

16:24.448 --> 16:26.533
Hang on just one sec.

16:38.170 --> 16:41.090
<i>I guess coffee went better
than expected.</i>

16:44.093 --> 16:47.179
After coffee, Hannah wanted
to show me the flower mart.

16:47.805 --> 16:51.475
So we're walking around
and I catch a whiff of this flower.

16:51.684 --> 16:53.602
It smells just like liquorice.

16:53.811 --> 16:56.772
- I ask Hannah what it is...
- And I tell him it's anise.

16:56.980 --> 17:01.026
So I tell the lady in the booth
that her anise smells delicious.

17:02.277 --> 17:03.862
You didn't pronounce it right.

17:04.071 --> 17:06.740
Don't know what I said,
but she did not react well.

17:06.949 --> 17:08.325
Well, do you blame her?

17:08.534 --> 17:10.244
Sounds like you had quite a day.

17:11.662 --> 17:14.790
Yeah, we really did.

17:14.998 --> 17:16.875
How long are you gonna be in town?

17:17.084 --> 17:20.879
Oh, just another day or so.
And then I'm off to Louisiana.

17:21.171 --> 17:23.590
What's in Louisiana?
A poker tournament?

17:23.799 --> 17:28.178
No. I am all done with that. I am looking
for an honest way to make a living.

17:28.387 --> 17:31.223
And I think I found the perfect thing.
You ready?

17:32.516 --> 17:34.101
- Crawfish.
- Crawfish?

17:34.309 --> 17:37.354
Yeah, a crawfish farm.
I got a line on one near Lafayette.

17:37.563 --> 17:42.025
Gonna call it Big Clint's Crawdaddies
and I will ship them fresh anywhere.

17:42.234 --> 17:44.987
- There's a market for that?
- You bet there is.

17:45.195 --> 17:47.322
Hey, ain't nothing like a crawfish boil.

17:47.781 --> 17:51.201
Weddings, bachelor parties,
Fourth of July.

17:51.410 --> 17:53.412
Everybody likes crawdads.

17:53.954 --> 17:57.541
Well, I'm excited for you, Dad.
And I'm proud of you.

17:57.750 --> 18:00.335
Well, thank you, honey. Means a lot.

18:02.254 --> 18:05.758
Why don't you check out of that motel
and come and stay with me?

18:06.216 --> 18:09.136
You're starting a business.
You're gonna need to save.

18:09.344 --> 18:10.554
No. I couldn't do that.

18:10.763 --> 18:12.973
- I wouldn't wanna intrude.
- Oh, you're not.

18:13.182 --> 18:15.893
Yeah. Don't worry.
I was going home tonight anyway.

18:16.101 --> 18:20.230
Why don't I bring you guys breakfast?
Best doughnuts you ever tasted.

18:22.691 --> 18:24.234
Okay.

18:50.344 --> 18:51.970
- What are you doing, man?
- Get out!

18:52.179 --> 18:53.680
Everybody, come on!

18:53.889 --> 18:55.307
Come on! Come on!

19:07.152 --> 19:09.822
Man, it's like I died
and went to heaven.

19:10.030 --> 19:12.950
I think if I had one more of those,
I probably will.

19:13.158 --> 19:15.285
I'd like
to make an orange juice toast...

19:15.494 --> 19:18.622
...to the cutest damn couple
I have ever seen.

19:18.831 --> 19:21.250
Outside of me and Bubba in prison.

19:21.458 --> 19:23.752
- That's just a little joke.
- Right.

19:23.961 --> 19:26.338
Well, to you, Dad.

19:26.547 --> 19:27.798
The king of crawfish.

19:28.006 --> 19:29.633
There's no stopping me.

19:30.634 --> 19:33.053
I just gotta get the money together.

19:36.849 --> 19:38.433
So where are you at with that?

19:38.642 --> 19:41.144
That's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

19:41.770 --> 19:44.565
Figured you might like to get in
on the ground ﬂoor.

19:44.773 --> 19:46.525
- What do you mean?
- Well, invest.

19:46.942 --> 19:48.610
I only need about 20 grand more.

19:50.195 --> 19:51.738
No, it's a great opportunity.

19:51.947 --> 19:54.700
There's a guaranteed 10 percent a year
back on investment.

19:55.158 --> 19:57.828
I'm sorry, Dad. I can't.

19:58.203 --> 19:59.913
My money's tied up in the business.

20:00.122 --> 20:02.165
Oh, come on, now.
Not all your money.

20:02.374 --> 20:04.918
There's gotta be a little wiggle room
there somewhere.

20:05.127 --> 20:08.005
- You could re-mortgage your place.
- I don't think so.

20:08.213 --> 20:10.924
- Gotta be worth a pretty penny.
-It's not gonna happen.

20:11.466 --> 20:13.385
Well, fine.

20:13.802 --> 20:15.512
Whatever. Forget it.

20:16.763 --> 20:18.974
I'm sorry. I just don't have the funds.

20:19.182 --> 20:21.685
What kind of daughter won't even help
her own father?

20:21.894 --> 20:24.187
Jesus, Dad.

20:24.396 --> 20:27.649
Look, I need some air.
I'm gonna go for a drive.

20:27.858 --> 20:29.276
Dad, you don't have to go.

20:35.532 --> 20:37.868
You think I was wrong
telling him I couldn't?

20:38.076 --> 20:41.538
- Of course not.
- But I feel like I should help him out.

20:44.708 --> 20:46.835
- Why?
- Because he's my dad.

20:49.171 --> 20:51.715
The same dad
who almost let you drown?

20:51.924 --> 20:53.800
Who left you alone for three days?

20:54.009 --> 20:55.344
He's trying to change.

20:55.928 --> 20:56.970
I doubt it.

20:57.179 --> 21:01.266
I know he's done some bad things,
but there's good inside of him as well.

21:02.809 --> 21:07.147
Right, you've known him for 24 hours
and you think you understand him?

21:07.356 --> 21:10.609
- I have a sense for this thing.
- Oh, yeah, you and your Dark--

21:10.817 --> 21:12.736
Whatever-- Part of you.

21:12.945 --> 21:16.114
- That you don't think exists.
- Because it doesn't.

21:24.331 --> 21:26.625
I gotta go to work.
It's the arsonist again.

21:28.627 --> 21:31.213
Look, I'm just trying to help here.

21:31.421 --> 21:33.966
I know. I know.

21:34.174 --> 21:36.259
I appreciate it. I'm sorry.

21:38.011 --> 21:39.262
I'll be fine. Go.

21:41.139 --> 21:42.557
Okay.

22:12.212 --> 22:13.380
I gotta check.

22:13.588 --> 22:16.174
Sorry what happened to your sister.

22:17.259 --> 22:18.635
Another "Bobby."

22:18.844 --> 22:19.886
"It's Bobby."

22:21.346 --> 22:22.389
He added an "it's."

22:23.765 --> 22:26.018
Like we didn't know it was Bobby.

22:26.935 --> 22:28.729
Make sure you get this.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.696
Well, did you see anything?

22:37.904 --> 22:39.489
I really have no idea.

22:40.323 --> 22:42.492
Did you see Bosso?

22:42.701 --> 22:45.287
- Sniffing the body.
- Probably for accelerant.

22:45.495 --> 22:47.664
Still, it was kind of creepy, right?

22:47.873 --> 22:50.959
I mean, I know it would be
the biggest cliché in the world...

22:51.168 --> 22:55.255
...the arson investigator turned out
to be the arsonist, but does he...?

22:56.590 --> 22:58.759
Does he set off anything
in your brain?

22:58.967 --> 23:01.053
I don't think Bosso's the Phantom.

23:01.261 --> 23:02.429
He has an alibi.

23:02.637 --> 23:05.182
- You vetted him?
- I looked into him.

23:05.891 --> 23:08.060
You said
you weren't gonna take any cases.

23:08.268 --> 23:09.770
- I didn't take it.
- Fuck, Dexter.

23:09.936 --> 23:11.646
Why put yourself in that situation?

23:12.481 --> 23:14.441
<i>Good question. Why did I?</i>

23:14.649 --> 23:18.070
Hey, L.T. We got a security camera.
I'm gonna take the hard drive...

23:18.236 --> 23:20.238
...see if we can get eyes
on the Phantom.

23:20.405 --> 23:22.741
Good. We could use a break.

23:26.953 --> 23:28.121
Hey, Hannah.

23:29.498 --> 23:32.709
Wait, hold on. Slow down.
What happened?

23:34.544 --> 23:35.629
I'll be right there.

23:52.020 --> 23:53.146
What happened?

23:54.648 --> 23:58.693
I came back from the flower mart
and it was like this.

24:02.948 --> 24:05.826
Well, I had a couple of drinks
to take the edge off...

24:06.034 --> 24:08.370
...but I might have overdone it
a little.

24:08.578 --> 24:12.290
You did this to get back at me for not
giving you the money that you wanted.

24:12.499 --> 24:15.377
Oh, talk about paranoid.

24:15.585 --> 24:17.838
But then,
maybe you've got reason to be.

24:18.046 --> 24:21.174
Must be a lot of folks hate you
for all the pain you've caused.

24:21.591 --> 24:23.510
How can you even say that to me?

24:23.718 --> 24:27.305
Playing Mother Nature in here
with your stupid, little flowers.

24:27.514 --> 24:29.683
Won't even help out
your own fucking father!

24:29.891 --> 24:32.894
- I don't wanna help you!
- You got any idea what it's like...

24:33.103 --> 24:36.273
...to be the father
of the infamous Hannah McKay?

24:36.481 --> 24:39.818
You're a goddamn curse,
you ungrateful little shit!

24:40.402 --> 24:41.653
That's enough, Clint.

24:41.862 --> 24:44.030
Stay out of this.
This is family business.

24:44.239 --> 24:47.951
You know you killed your mother,
don't you?

24:48.785 --> 24:51.663
She died of a broken heart
after your spree...

24:51.872 --> 24:54.207
-...with Wayne Randall.
- I'm sorry.

24:54.416 --> 24:59.004
Everybody would've been better off if
I'd let you drown that day at the pond.

25:01.423 --> 25:02.465
Get out of here.

25:06.970 --> 25:08.555
Now.

25:11.099 --> 25:12.684
Fine.

25:15.979 --> 25:18.273
I said what I had to say.

25:24.154 --> 25:27.991
Well, it looks like
Hannah's found herself another winner.

25:28.617 --> 25:30.660
You two deserve each other.

25:43.173 --> 25:45.383
<i>I can cut a body up into pieces...</i>

25:45.592 --> 25:49.512
<i>...but how do I help Hannah
put herself back together?</i>

25:58.396 --> 26:00.190
Could you have picked
more of a dump?

26:00.565 --> 26:03.944
Come on, Maria. It's perfect
for all this cloak-and-dagger bullshit.

26:04.152 --> 26:06.821
It's the kind of place you take hookers
and ugly broads.

26:07.030 --> 26:08.114
So nobody sees you.

26:08.323 --> 26:09.491
You should know.

26:09.699 --> 26:12.744
I followed up on all the names
you identified on my list.

26:12.953 --> 26:15.747
Yes, the list
of suspicious police employees...

26:15.956 --> 26:18.250
-...who own boats.
- They were all dead ends.

26:18.458 --> 26:20.293
All except for Dexter Morgan...

26:20.752 --> 26:22.504
...who conveniently moved his boat...

26:22.671 --> 26:24.756
...when we were closing in
on his marina...

26:24.965 --> 26:27.008
...during the official investigation.

26:27.217 --> 26:30.053
You really think Dexter
is the Bay Harbor Butcher?

26:30.262 --> 26:33.348
-It's worth looking into.
- No, it's a waste of time.

26:33.556 --> 26:35.225
Now, start thinking logically.

26:35.767 --> 26:39.062
If Doakes really wasn't
the Bay Harbor Butcher...

26:39.271 --> 26:41.606
...that means
somebody probably framed him.

26:41.815 --> 26:43.942
- Right.
- That same person killed him...

26:44.150 --> 26:45.902
...the real Bay Harbor Butcher.

26:46.111 --> 26:50.156
So the best thing to do is to look
into Doakes' final days.

26:51.157 --> 26:55.203
We should start with the cabin
in the Everglades. Where Doakes died.

26:57.122 --> 26:58.623
Makes sense. First let's eat.

26:58.832 --> 27:00.500
- Okay.
- Waiter.

27:11.094 --> 27:12.887
You went all out.

27:13.096 --> 27:17.142
Well, you had a rough night.
I figured you could use a pick-me-up.

27:17.809 --> 27:19.269
Sit.

27:26.651 --> 27:28.194
You were right about my dad.

27:30.864 --> 27:32.991
I'm sorry I was.

27:33.325 --> 27:35.493
I just-- I feel like such a sucker.

27:35.702 --> 27:39.164
I don't fall for anybody's bullshit,
but when it comes to him, I--

27:39.372 --> 27:42.500
I get it. Fathers can be complicated.

27:42.709 --> 27:45.545
I just don't understand
why I keep holding on to this idea...

27:45.712 --> 27:48.173
...that, underneath it all,
he's a good person.

27:49.090 --> 27:52.510
Maybe because the idea that he's not
is just too hard to take.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.477
I just hope he's gone for good.

28:03.188 --> 28:05.899
You sure scared the shit out of him.

28:06.691 --> 28:08.693
That voice.

28:09.944 --> 28:14.032
I hadn't seen that look on your face
since you took me to see the snow.

28:16.701 --> 28:19.245
Is that what you were talking about?

28:19.704 --> 28:22.374
Your Dark Rider?

28:24.501 --> 28:26.961
Dark Passenger.

28:29.839 --> 28:32.634
Fine. it sounds a little silly
when you say it out loud.

28:32.842 --> 28:34.094
No, I get what you mean.

28:34.302 --> 28:37.263
You do seem
like a different person...

28:37.472 --> 28:40.975
...so it makes sense that you
would name that part of yourself.

28:43.895 --> 28:46.314
Does it just take over?

28:51.611 --> 28:53.613
Where do you go?

28:54.322 --> 28:58.868
Does Dexter Morgan just disappear?

29:01.204 --> 29:02.455
No, I'm still there.

29:03.832 --> 29:05.583
Do you hear a voice, or--?

29:05.792 --> 29:09.170
Not exactly. It's more like a...

29:10.213 --> 29:11.798
.“need.

29:12.257 --> 29:14.134
So it's just like a feeling.

29:27.397 --> 29:29.065
Well, I should get to work.

29:30.233 --> 29:32.402
- Unless you need me to...
- No, I'm good.

29:33.361 --> 29:34.654
I got pancakes.

29:50.670 --> 29:53.882
The good news is that we
have the Phantom entering the bus.

29:54.090 --> 29:57.051
The bad news
is that he never shows his face.

30:08.021 --> 30:11.024
<i>My promise to Deb
is getting harder and harder to keep.</i>

30:11.232 --> 30:12.984
<i>This is more than just a feeling.</i>

30:13.193 --> 30:15.987
- There's no way to ID him?
- I didn't say that.

30:19.616 --> 30:21.242
Right there.

30:22.285 --> 30:24.954
He grabs a rail bare-handed.
We might have a print.

30:25.163 --> 30:27.123
Pull the fucking print off the rail.

30:27.332 --> 30:29.876
- We might get lucky and get a match.
- Let's go, bro.

30:30.585 --> 30:32.170
Hey, baby. What's up?

30:32.378 --> 30:35.840
What? Motherfuck. I'll be right there.

30:36.257 --> 30:39.761
- What's wrong?
- Novikov's sending Nadia to Dubai.

30:39.928 --> 30:41.721
He's holding her. I gotta get her out.

30:41.930 --> 30:43.097
- Alone?
- Got no choice.

30:43.306 --> 30:45.975
- He's putting her on a flight tonight.
- Let's go.

30:48.686 --> 30:51.981
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm here to see George.

30:52.190 --> 30:54.526
Why don't you stay here with me?

31:02.408 --> 31:04.744
Well, well, if it isn't Sir Lancelot.

31:05.453 --> 31:07.789
- Where's Nadia?
- Nadia?

31:08.373 --> 31:11.084
Let me get her for you.
She's got something to tell you.

31:12.210 --> 31:13.253
Get over here.

31:17.298 --> 31:20.051
All right, tell your boyfriend
who you belong to.

31:20.260 --> 31:21.553
- Let her go.
- Tell him.

31:21.761 --> 31:22.971
Fuck you.

31:24.389 --> 31:26.391
You touch her fucking again,
you're dead.

31:26.599 --> 31:28.309
Oh, what are you gonna do?

31:28.518 --> 31:30.979
You're gonna shoot me
in my own club?

31:32.730 --> 31:34.148
Fuck.

31:34.607 --> 31:36.109
Don't move.

31:36.317 --> 31:38.278
Nadia, get behind George's body.

31:38.861 --> 31:40.697
I want you to take this gun, Nadia.

31:43.241 --> 31:46.744
I want you to shoot me in the arm.
Okay, sweetie? It's okay.

31:47.287 --> 31:49.163
Shoot me in the arm.

31:53.501 --> 31:55.420
What the--? Are you okay?

31:55.628 --> 31:57.380
He pulled a gun and shot me.

31:57.589 --> 31:59.924
I had no fucking choice.
He just grazed me.

32:00.133 --> 32:01.467
Christ.

32:01.676 --> 32:05.138
Go to the safe. Get your passport
and the money and go.

32:05.805 --> 32:09.225
What? She's a witness.
I'm not gonna let her take that money.

32:09.434 --> 32:13.062
She's earned it. She can't be a witness.
The Koshkas will kill her.

32:13.271 --> 32:14.689
And she's here illegally.

32:27.076 --> 32:31.372
- I'm sorry.
-It's okay. Go, go, now.

32:43.051 --> 32:45.011
So did you find a match?

32:45.219 --> 32:46.471
We'll see.

32:46.679 --> 32:49.641
I'm running the Phantom's prints
through AFIS now.

32:51.517 --> 32:52.935
- Nothing.
- Fuck me.

32:53.144 --> 32:54.312
So, what now?

32:54.520 --> 32:57.607
<i>You hand the whole thing over to me
and let me take care of it?</i>

32:57.815 --> 33:00.318
I can't stop thinking
about this Bobby thing.

33:00.526 --> 33:03.237
You know, that somehow
that's the key.

33:03.946 --> 33:07.367
It's a kid's name.
Nobody calls an adult Bobby.

33:07.533 --> 33:09.160
He wrote "it's Bobby" on the bus.

33:09.369 --> 33:13.122
Like Astor and Cody blaming
each other. "it's Astor." "it's Cody."

33:13.331 --> 33:15.458
The fires have to do
with his childhood?

33:15.667 --> 33:16.793
Could be.

33:17.001 --> 33:18.795
Maybe his urges started back then.

33:19.003 --> 33:23.049
I wish we could run that print against
juvie records, but that shit's sealed.

33:24.759 --> 33:26.969
Back to square one.

33:28.805 --> 33:30.556
<i>Not for me.</i>

33:54.539 --> 33:56.999
<i>Government workers
never miss a break.</i>

34:24.402 --> 34:25.528
There's your Phantom.

34:27.238 --> 34:31.075
"Arrested for burning down
his school's gym at age 12.

34:31.284 --> 34:34.537
Spent time in detention,
set his roommate's bunk on fire."

34:34.954 --> 34:38.624
Got sent to a psychiatric facility
in 2006.

34:38.833 --> 34:40.626
Just released a month ago.

34:40.835 --> 34:43.671
That explains why the fires
only just started now.

34:45.631 --> 34:47.258
Gonna turn that over to Deb?

34:47.467 --> 34:49.135
Call it in on the tip line?

34:49.343 --> 34:51.053
I'm not sure I can.

34:51.387 --> 34:55.349
Deb was right. Now that I have proof,
my urges are beyond my control.

34:55.558 --> 34:59.020
Your Dark Passenger. Where did you
come up with that, anyway?

34:59.228 --> 35:01.773
- Thought I got it from you.
- I gave you the code.

35:02.482 --> 35:05.151
The Dark Passenger was all yours.

35:06.110 --> 35:09.363
You said it got into me too early
in that shipping container.

35:09.572 --> 35:12.533
- You thought I was possessed.
- I meant you were traumatised.

35:13.201 --> 35:15.036
Not possessed.

35:15.244 --> 35:17.747
The first time you said it,
you must've been about 12.

35:18.164 --> 35:22.084
I just let it go. I couldn't let you
blame yourself for feelings...

35:22.293 --> 35:25.588
...that were too complicated
for a young boy to understand.

35:26.547 --> 35:28.090
But you're not a boy anymore.

35:28.299 --> 35:29.926
Oh, you sound like Hannah.

35:30.134 --> 35:31.844
Maybe she's right.

35:32.053 --> 35:34.472
Maybe the Dark Passenger
is just a feeling.

35:35.306 --> 35:37.767
- It can't be.
- Why?

35:37.975 --> 35:42.355
Because if there's no Dark Passenger,
then I'm responsible...

35:43.064 --> 35:45.399
...for everything I've done.

35:45.608 --> 35:48.069
It sure is simpler
to just pin all the blame...

35:48.277 --> 35:50.696
...on something else, isn't it, Dexter?

35:52.907 --> 35:54.408
It's much scarier to think...

35:54.617 --> 35:57.495
...that the Dark Passenger
is no more real than I am.

36:04.627 --> 36:07.004
- This is where the cabin used to be.
- Yeah...

36:07.213 --> 36:09.799
...before it got blown to smithereens.

36:19.183 --> 36:20.893
Juan Alonso?

36:21.102 --> 36:23.729
I'm Captain Maria LaGuerta
from Miami Metro Homicide.

36:23.938 --> 36:25.982
- This is Thomas Matthews.
- What do you want'?

36:26.190 --> 36:29.026
Were you the owner of this property
back in 2007?

36:30.403 --> 36:33.281
And did you rent it, at that time,
to a James Doakes?

36:33.489 --> 36:34.574
Bay Harbor Butcher.

36:34.782 --> 36:38.369
No, no, no. I told the cops back then
I had nothing to do with that.

36:38.578 --> 36:41.163
Then how did Mr. Doakes come
to be staying here?

36:41.706 --> 36:43.666
I was renting to Santos Jimenez.

36:44.375 --> 36:47.295
- Jimenez?
- Some kind of Colombian drug guy.

36:47.795 --> 36:50.339
Not that I knew it.
I'd never rent to a criminal.

36:50.548 --> 36:52.633
Of course not.

36:53.384 --> 36:56.429
Now, why does that
sound so familiar?

36:58.389 --> 37:01.142
Now I know why the name
Santos Jimenez rang a bell.

37:01.350 --> 37:03.394
He wasn't just a drug runner.

37:03.603 --> 37:08.649
One of the men responsible for killing
Dexter Morgan's mother, Laura Moser.

37:08.858 --> 37:10.484
- Moser?
- Yeah.

37:10.693 --> 37:12.695
Some drug lord put a hit out on her...

37:12.904 --> 37:15.865
...because he found out
that she was Harry Morgan's Cl.

37:16.657 --> 37:19.660
She was butchered by Jimenez
with a chain saw...

37:19.869 --> 37:22.204
...in front of Dexter
and his brother, Brian.

37:22.413 --> 37:24.123
Brian Moser?

37:24.332 --> 37:26.626
The Ice Truck Killer,
that was Dexter's brother?

37:27.418 --> 37:28.920
Yeah.

37:29.712 --> 37:31.797
So...

37:32.173 --> 37:35.968
...that means that Dexter
watched his mother get chopped up...

37:36.177 --> 37:39.597
...just like the Bay Harbor Butcher
chopped up his victims?

37:40.890 --> 37:42.850
So, what are you saying?

37:43.142 --> 37:45.603
- Where's Jimenez now?
- He disappeared.

37:45.811 --> 37:48.856
Murdered by the Bay Harbor Butcher?
Who was more likely...

37:49.065 --> 37:52.151
...to want Jimenez dead,
Doakes or Dexter?

37:52.360 --> 37:54.236
- Oh, come on, Maria.
- No, Tom.

37:54.445 --> 37:56.072
We can't ignore the facts.

37:56.280 --> 37:59.283
The Bay Harbor Butcher
took blood slides from his victims.

37:59.492 --> 38:02.078
Dexter is a blood spatter analyst.

38:02.286 --> 38:05.831
And Doakes always thought
there was something off about Dexter.

38:06.499 --> 38:09.585
What if Doakes was on to him?

38:10.461 --> 38:15.174
Jesus. What if Dexter
is the real Bay Harbor Butcher?

38:15.383 --> 38:17.259
What if he isn't?

38:17.843 --> 38:20.972
- I am gonna go question him.
- No, you're not gonna do that.

38:22.306 --> 38:25.643
- Now, I don't think you're right.
- Trust me, I hope I'm not.

38:26.602 --> 38:29.605
If somebody's gotta talk to Dexter,
it's gonna be me.

38:29.814 --> 38:32.483
I've known him since he was a kid.
He trusts me.

38:32.692 --> 38:35.903
What's more,
I'm a lot less likely to fuck it up.

38:40.866 --> 38:43.577
<i>The only thing between me
and killing the Phantom...</i>

38:43.786 --> 38:46.580
<i>...is a slightly deflated water wing.</i>

38:47.248 --> 38:50.209
You sure we can't talk you
into coming for a swim?

38:50.418 --> 38:53.421
I'd love to, but I got something
I gotta take care of.

38:53.629 --> 38:55.131
Put your hand through there.

38:58.050 --> 38:59.427
Do this one too.

39:01.387 --> 39:03.097
There you go.

39:08.394 --> 39:13.566
- Well, well, who's this big fella?
- That's my son, Harrison.

39:13.816 --> 39:16.694
Harrison. Isn't that fancy?

39:16.902 --> 39:18.070
And who are you?

39:18.279 --> 39:20.781
I'm Jamie, Harrison's nanny.

39:20.990 --> 39:24.493
Boy. They didn't have nannies like you
back in my day.

39:25.619 --> 39:27.621
We're gonna go swimming now.

39:27.830 --> 39:30.833
You ready? Ready, little man?

39:31.042 --> 39:32.543
Yeah.

39:34.170 --> 39:37.256
Boy, the way they coddle kids today.

39:37.465 --> 39:40.176
They're all gonna be expecting
a helping hand.

39:40.384 --> 39:41.761
The world isn't like that.

39:42.178 --> 39:45.139
It's sink or swim, sonny boy.

39:45.890 --> 39:47.516
Have fun.

39:52.438 --> 39:54.148
What do you want'?

39:55.775 --> 39:59.403
Well, Dexter, I can tell
that you care about my daughter.

39:59.570 --> 40:01.989
- I'm here to find out how much.
- Get to the point.

40:02.198 --> 40:03.491
I have information...

40:03.699 --> 40:06.118
...that could be very damaging
to Hannah.

40:06.327 --> 40:09.997
Now, I could give this information
to the police...

40:10.206 --> 40:13.000
...or you could pay me a nice, tidy sum
to keep it.

40:13.209 --> 40:14.335
What are you talking about?

40:14.543 --> 40:19.131
When Hannah got out of juvie, she
killed a counsellor at a halfway house.

40:20.674 --> 40:21.926
She fed him rat poison.

40:23.260 --> 40:26.138
Her roommate,
little gal named Arlene Schram...

40:26.347 --> 40:29.350
...saw her do it
with her own two eyes.

40:29.558 --> 40:31.936
The cops could get her
to spill her guts.

40:32.144 --> 40:34.021
You're lying.

40:34.188 --> 40:35.773
I read Sal Price's book on Hannah.

40:35.940 --> 40:38.609
He mentioned the counsellor,
nothing about the roommate.

40:38.818 --> 40:41.112
- I hadn't told him about it yet.
- What?

40:41.320 --> 40:44.782
Where do you think he was getting
all those juicy, little plums?

40:45.950 --> 40:48.911
Price was paying me
to dish dirt on my daughter.

40:49.829 --> 40:52.373
I was saving the good stuff
for a bigger payday.

40:52.581 --> 40:55.084
Then the son of a bitch
went belly-up.

40:55.292 --> 40:57.503
And...there went my meal ticket.

40:57.711 --> 41:00.840
You'd sell your own daughter out
for a crawfish farm?

41:01.048 --> 41:02.591
Fuck crawfish, man.

41:02.800 --> 41:05.678
I'm up to my ears in gambling debt.

41:05.886 --> 41:09.223
But you do what you gotta do.

41:09.431 --> 41:13.519
So you gonna give me my money...

41:14.311 --> 41:15.980
...or do I send Hannah to jail?

41:21.235 --> 41:23.696
Get out of here
before you see my bad side.

41:26.866 --> 41:29.618
You might wanna ask Hannah
about Arlene...

41:29.827 --> 41:32.663
...before you come
to a final decision.

41:33.998 --> 41:36.167
Then we'll talk numbers.

41:43.591 --> 41:46.010
What exactly were you doing here?

41:46.385 --> 41:48.929
It was a personal matter.

41:49.430 --> 41:51.765
My girlfriend works at the club.

41:51.974 --> 41:53.267
Jesus, Quinn.

41:53.475 --> 41:55.561
I came to talk to Novikov
about Nadia.

41:55.769 --> 41:57.771
The conversation got heated.

41:57.980 --> 42:01.192
He pulled out a gun, shot me.
I returned fire. Self-defence.

42:02.484 --> 42:04.361
- Plain and simple.
- Write up a report.

42:04.570 --> 42:06.906
I want it on my desk in the morning.

42:12.077 --> 42:15.164
There's a little problem
with your story.

42:15.706 --> 42:19.543
There's a time lag
between the first shot and the second.

42:20.252 --> 42:22.296
I want the truth.

42:25.216 --> 42:26.884
I told you the truth.

42:28.052 --> 42:30.012
I went down when George shot me.

42:30.221 --> 42:33.140
He started to beat the shit
out of Nadia.

42:33.599 --> 42:35.100
I reached for my gun.

42:35.309 --> 42:38.354
He wheeled around,
ready to blow my head off...

42:39.063 --> 42:40.981
...and I took him out.

42:41.190 --> 42:42.983
That's what happened.

42:47.780 --> 42:51.075
- Okay. Then we'll go with that.
- Minus Nadia.

42:54.828 --> 42:56.497
Yeah.

43:00.125 --> 43:02.795
- Hey, where's Dexter?
- I don't know.

43:03.003 --> 43:05.923
But I'd like to point out
that I am here, doing my duty.

43:06.131 --> 43:07.800
- What?
- Nothing.

43:09.760 --> 43:12.012
I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

43:12.930 --> 43:15.557
How can that be my own father?

43:24.358 --> 43:26.068
I'm sorry to have to tell you this...

43:26.235 --> 43:28.821
...but I needed to know
that he was telling the truth.

43:30.906 --> 43:33.867
Arlene Schram is the only person
who can put me in jail.

43:36.620 --> 43:39.081
She saw me put poison
in that counsellor's food.

43:41.292 --> 43:44.795
- I'm gonna have to pay him.
- That's not gonna solve anything.

43:45.004 --> 43:46.714
I don't see any other option.

43:49.675 --> 43:53.929
When other people have threatened
you, you've found other options.

43:58.058 --> 43:59.893
I can't.

44:00.894 --> 44:02.563
He's my father.

44:07.943 --> 44:10.070
I'm gonna call my bank.

44:12.323 --> 44:14.450
I know what you're thinking.

44:14.658 --> 44:17.786
I'm not thinking anything.

44:18.662 --> 44:20.456
Clint McKay doesn't meet the code.

44:24.084 --> 44:26.795
But Joseph Jensen does.

45:35.280 --> 45:38.367
It's not as much fun when you're not
wearing your suit, is it?

45:38.575 --> 45:40.202
Who are you? I can't see you.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.622
Maybe I'm a phantom.

45:44.665 --> 45:46.208
Then again, maybe not.

45:46.750 --> 45:48.585
A phantom can't hurt you.

45:49.044 --> 45:51.338
Oh, God. Please don't.

45:51.547 --> 45:54.049
- Who's Bobby?
- Let me go.

45:54.258 --> 45:57.219
Stop whining. Who's Bobby?

45:58.470 --> 46:01.932
Bobby Hamilton,
my best friend when I was 12.

46:03.392 --> 46:05.602
That's when you set your first fire.

46:05.978 --> 46:08.480
I didn't set it. Bobby did.

46:08.689 --> 46:10.607
It was all his idea.

46:10.816 --> 46:13.152
But then he died and I got caught.

46:13.360 --> 46:15.612
Sent me to the nuthouse
like I was crazy.

46:15.821 --> 46:17.865
It's all because of Bobby.
Fucking asshole.

46:18.073 --> 46:20.075
So does he still talk to you?

46:20.284 --> 46:22.786
Is Bobby the one telling you
to set these fires?

46:22.995 --> 46:26.165
No, that would make me crazy
and I'm not fucking crazy.

46:26.790 --> 46:28.709
I only hurt people because of Bobby.

46:28.917 --> 46:31.211
No, you're the one
who's setting those fires.

46:31.420 --> 46:33.255
The one who's burning people alive.

46:33.464 --> 46:36.842
You can't blame it on something
that happened when you were a kid.

46:37.050 --> 46:38.385
You're not a kid anymore.

46:39.011 --> 46:42.306
It's time for you
to take responsibility.

46:52.107 --> 46:53.150
Fuck.

47:00.657 --> 47:03.285
The caller said
they smelled kerosene.

47:04.453 --> 47:06.872
Looks like we have the right place.

47:20.594 --> 47:22.471
Holy shit.

47:24.765 --> 47:26.808
It's Joe Jensen.
I interviewed this guy.

47:27.017 --> 47:29.353
Dumb fuck must've passed out
from the fumes.

47:29.561 --> 47:31.396
He's still alive.

47:31.605 --> 47:35.025
I guess we found our Phantom.
Who'd have thought it'd be so easy?

47:36.944 --> 47:40.030
- Yeah.
- Guys, come on down.

47:49.665 --> 47:53.961
Got your call. Glad you came
to your senses. You got my money?

47:54.169 --> 47:56.380
Yeah. It's right back here.

47:59.883 --> 48:02.135
What's with all the plastic?

48:07.266 --> 48:09.142
You'll find out soon.

48:28.745 --> 48:29.830
What the hell?

48:30.038 --> 48:32.207
This isn't the way
to make a good impression...

48:32.416 --> 48:34.835
...on your girlfriend's father.

48:39.590 --> 48:41.717
But I can't allow you to hurt Hannah.

48:41.925 --> 48:43.635
Oh, please.

48:43.844 --> 48:46.888
I won't talk to the cops.
I'll leave town.

48:47.097 --> 48:49.474
I promise,
I'll never come near Hannah again.

48:49.683 --> 48:51.226
I wish I could believe you.

48:53.103 --> 48:55.439
Actually, I don't
because then I couldn't kill you.

48:55.647 --> 48:58.984
- Oh, please, you don't have to do this.
- That's what I'm realising.

48:59.192 --> 49:00.986
I don't have to.

49:02.112 --> 49:04.197
But I want to.

49:05.907 --> 49:09.328
Even though you don't meet my code,
I really--

49:10.078 --> 49:12.539
I really want to.

49:14.249 --> 49:16.418
Because unlike you,
I care about Hannah.

49:18.337 --> 49:20.505
You got the devil inside you, boy.

49:23.175 --> 49:25.844
No, I think it's just me.

49:41.568 --> 49:44.196
Sink or swim, Daddy.

49:55.874 --> 49:58.168
<i>- Hey, Deb.
- We arrested the Phantom...</i>

49:58.377 --> 50:01.755
<i>...thanks to you. Now I know
why you weren't at The Fox Hole.</i>

50:01.963 --> 50:03.840
- Consider it a gift.
Bullshit.

50:04.049 --> 50:05.550
<i>You want something in return.</i>

50:05.759 --> 50:08.470
I'm guessing it's for me to lay off
your girlfriend.

50:08.637 --> 50:11.390
- Well, now that you mention it.
- Forget it.

50:12.641 --> 50:14.935
I always give in to you.

50:15.936 --> 50:16.978
But not anymore.

50:19.147 --> 50:20.941
I understand.

50:32.577 --> 50:33.995
I got the money for my dad.

50:34.204 --> 50:37.499
I left him a message.
He should be here soon.

50:41.086 --> 50:42.337
He won't be coming.

50:42.546 --> 50:43.839
How do you know?

50:49.010 --> 50:50.721
I had a talk with him.

50:52.347 --> 50:57.227
I made it clear that I wouldn't allow him
to hurt you anymore.

50:59.187 --> 51:01.606
And I think he understood.

51:03.400 --> 51:04.651
So he's gone?

51:05.485 --> 51:08.071
He won't be bothering you again.

51:15.370 --> 51:17.080
Thank you.

51:19.583 --> 51:22.586
<i>The Dark Passenger has been with me
ever since I can remember...</i>

51:22.794 --> 51:26.840
<i>...pulling the strings,
running the show.</i>

51:27.048 --> 51:29.926
<i>But as it turns out, I'm no puppet.</i>

51:30.135 --> 51:32.137
And you should know,
you were right.

51:32.846 --> 51:33.930
About what?

51:35.682 --> 51:37.517
The Dark...

51:37.893 --> 51:39.686
...Rider.

51:42.814 --> 51:45.066
He doesn't exist.

51:51.281 --> 51:55.827
Turns out maybe you understand me
a little better than I understand myself.

52:00.040 --> 52:02.042
I love you.

52:10.675 --> 52:12.594
I think I love you too.

52:33.573 --> 52:34.741
Hey.

52:34.950 --> 52:36.493
I need your help.

52:36.952 --> 52:39.037
We need to find a woman
named Arlene Schram.

52:39.454 --> 52:40.789
Sure. Who's that?

52:41.498 --> 52:45.168
According to a message I got last night
from Hannah McKay's father...

52:45.377 --> 52:47.629
...she's a witness to a murder.
