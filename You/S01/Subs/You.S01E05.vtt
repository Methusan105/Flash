21:36.599 --> 21:38.297
- Well, I lost
all my sponsors,

21:38.340 --> 21:39.472
'cause they're all
a bunch of pussies,

21:39.515 --> 21:41.212
a third of
my Instagram followers,

21:41.256 --> 21:43.258
and the only person who tweeted
in my defense was a Kardashian,

21:43.302 --> 21:45.391
so, I mean, honestly, where
is the witch hunt for the guy

21:45.434 --> 21:46.870
who saw blackout drunk girl

21:46.914 --> 21:49.656
and decided to whip
out his camera?

21:49.699 --> 21:51.571
Where's Beck?
- At my place.

21:51.614 --> 21:53.137
She's revising
one of her pieces.

21:53.181 --> 21:54.443
She's been slammed.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.445
- Not too busy to party
with Peach though,

21:56.489 --> 21:58.404
but hey, that's Peach.

21:58.447 --> 22:00.101
Beck's her favorite puppy.

22:00.144 --> 22:01.276
- Puppy?

22:01.320 --> 22:02.625
- She treats her
like a pet, right?

22:02.669 --> 22:05.019
Every day, it's just like,
"Beck-alicious this,"

22:05.062 --> 22:06.499
and, "Beck-alicious that."

22:06.542 --> 22:08.718
And you know
Beck secretly loves it.

22:08.762 --> 22:11.808
The two of them
are so co-dependent.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.812
I'm sorry, I know
she's your girlfriend.

22:15.856 --> 22:18.641
- You know, in Beck's defense,
she really is writing.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.730
I'm pushing her
to make her deadlines.

22:20.774 --> 22:23.254
- Well, aren't
you boyfriend of the year?

22:23.298 --> 22:24.995
- I try.
- Yeah.

22:25.039 --> 22:27.433
- Hey, did Peach ever
have any real pets?

22:27.476 --> 22:29.957
Lame segue.
I need the password.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.480
- Um, Dalloway.

22:31.524 --> 22:32.829
- Dalloway?

22:32.873 --> 22:35.005
- Yeah, a purebred
Bichon Frise, obviously.

22:35.049 --> 22:38.879
Yeah, Peach was, like,
devastated when she ran away.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.229
I'm sorry, I just need
to work through this out loud.

22:41.272 --> 22:43.057
It's like,
you know who gets away

22:43.100 --> 22:46.495
with a self-deprecating joke
that's a little risqué?

22:46.539 --> 22:48.192
- And by risqué,
she means racist.

22:48.236 --> 22:49.498
- The fat girl.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.674
Everybody laughs,
because she is harmless,

22:51.718 --> 22:54.285
and drunk, and funny,
but like in a fat way.

22:54.329 --> 22:56.897
But you know who gets crucified
for that same, risqué joke?

22:56.940 --> 22:58.681
- Again, to be clear, racist.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.466
- The former fat girl
who is actually just

23:00.509 --> 23:01.858
embracing her body.

23:01.902 --> 23:05.296
I mean, girls won't
let girls just be.

23:05.340 --> 23:06.689
[phone buzzes]

23:06.733 --> 23:09.953
- Thank god.
This was a huge mistake.

23:09.997 --> 23:12.391
Sorry, it's Beck.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.218
Hey, what's up?

23:14.262 --> 23:16.438
- So, um, Peach is here.

23:16.482 --> 23:19.049
As in here,
in your apartment.

23:20.964 --> 23:23.663
Something about
a stolen laptop.

23:33.063 --> 23:34.587
- Why don't you just save us
all the embarrassment

23:34.630 --> 23:36.066
and tell me where it is?

23:36.110 --> 23:38.242
Is it in the kitchen?
Is it under the sofa?

23:38.286 --> 23:39.766
Some little hidey hole
where you squirrel away

23:39.809 --> 23:42.116
all your stolen goods?
- Stolen goods?

23:42.159 --> 23:44.031
Okay, slow down, I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:44.074 --> 23:46.729
- Yes, you do. Last night
you left halfway through.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.644
Where did you go, Joseph?
- Probably to take a piss.

23:48.688 --> 23:52.474
Peach, believe it or not,
I can afford my own computer.

23:52.518 --> 23:55.956
Beck, help me out.
- I don't know.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.827
- What do you mean
you don't know?

23:57.871 --> 24:01.222
- I don't know.
I mean, of course you didn't--

24:01.265 --> 24:04.791
I just--please, don't put me
in the middle of this.

24:08.925 --> 24:10.492
- Okay, Peach,
if your laptop is stolen,

24:10.536 --> 24:12.320
I believe you,
but the people at the party

24:12.363 --> 24:14.757
weren't exactly strapped
for cash, so I don't know.

24:14.801 --> 24:17.499
I mean, is there,
like, some other,

24:17.543 --> 24:19.283
more personal reason
someone would mess with you?

24:19.327 --> 24:22.591
- Oh, my God, Peach. Weren't
you just saying last week

24:22.635 --> 24:27.074
that you were feeling
unsafe in your own home?

24:27.117 --> 24:29.206
- Whoa.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.992
I mean, you run out
in the open every morning.

24:32.035 --> 24:34.124
You're very pretty,
you're a Salinger.

24:34.168 --> 24:37.780
What if someone's
creeping on you?

24:37.824 --> 24:39.521
- It wouldn't be
the first time.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.131
- It wouldn't?

24:41.175 --> 24:43.525
Hallelujah.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.310
- Let's just say that James
Franco and I didn't end well.

24:46.354 --> 24:47.573
- We should call the police.

24:47.616 --> 24:49.052
- And what are they gonna do?

24:49.096 --> 24:50.967
Interrogate every single
one of Peach's friends?

24:51.011 --> 24:52.752
Good luck convincing them
it's not just misplaced.

24:52.795 --> 24:54.231
I'm sorry, I have to ask,

24:54.275 --> 24:57.713
have you tried
"Find My Computer" yet?

24:57.757 --> 24:59.367
It's just this little GPS--

24:59.410 --> 25:01.674
- I don't need you to mansplain
"Find My Computer."

25:01.717 --> 25:03.937
I know how to do it.
- All right.

25:03.980 --> 25:07.680
[beeping]

25:07.723 --> 25:09.986
- Peach,
isn't that your place?

25:10.030 --> 25:11.814
- She didn't really think
I'd be dumb enough

25:11.858 --> 25:14.556
to bring her laptop
here, did she?

25:17.167 --> 25:18.560
Classy apology.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.606
- Joe, stop it.

25:20.649 --> 25:23.739
- Stop what?
That was some bullshit, Beck.

25:23.783 --> 25:25.785
And you didn't exactly
rush to my defense.

25:25.828 --> 25:27.613
- What was I supposed to do?

25:27.656 --> 25:29.658
You two are always sniping
at each other.

25:29.702 --> 25:31.355
- And breaking into
each other's places,

25:31.399 --> 25:32.879
but that's not the point.

25:32.922 --> 25:34.533
She has it out for me
from the first day we met.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.317
- No she hasn't.
- Are you blind?

25:36.360 --> 25:39.320
Maybe you can't see it, but
Peach is next level vindictive.

25:39.363 --> 25:40.843
- You know what,
if you hate my friends so much,

25:40.887 --> 25:42.018
why do you hang out with them?

25:42.062 --> 25:43.542
- Because you force me to.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.021
If I didn't,
I wouldn't see you.

25:45.065 --> 25:46.719
- You know what,
I don't have time for this.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.590
I was supposed to send
my pages to Roger Stevens,

25:48.634 --> 25:50.374
like, an hour ago.

25:50.418 --> 25:53.203
- He doesn't care, he doesn't
care, he doesn't care.

25:53.247 --> 25:55.858
He doesn't care!

25:55.902 --> 25:57.468
He's never going to sign you.

25:57.512 --> 25:58.861
Peach is setting you up
to fail.

25:58.905 --> 26:00.515
I heard them talking
at the party.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.561
Roger thinks MFAs are a waste
time, and Peach said herself

26:02.604 --> 26:04.911
she thinks that
you are not ready.

26:04.954 --> 26:07.348
I'm sorry,
I know the truth hurts,

26:07.391 --> 26:09.089
but I have to set you free.

26:09.132 --> 26:12.005
- You are an asshole.

26:13.310 --> 26:15.269
You know, if you don't
believe in me, just say so.

26:15.312 --> 26:17.401
Don't come up with some
bullshit conspiracy theory.

26:17.445 --> 26:19.229
- No, Beck. Wait, no,
I'm telling the truth.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.754
- You're allowed to be
jealous of Roger.

26:21.797 --> 26:23.451
I get it, you're a guy,
boo-hoo.

26:23.494 --> 26:25.235
He's young and successful.

26:25.279 --> 26:27.020
- No, that's not--
no, no, no, no, no.

26:27.063 --> 26:29.370
- I don't care. The last thing
I would've expected you to be

26:29.413 --> 26:31.764
was unsupportive.

26:31.807 --> 26:34.941
[tense music]

26:34.984 --> 26:36.899
- Our first fight.

26:36.943 --> 26:39.554
It was worse than
I could have imagined,

26:39.598 --> 26:41.425
and it's all thanks to Peach.

26:41.469 --> 26:44.037
I want to punish her
for coming between us,

26:44.080 --> 26:45.821
but I can't.
I'm not that guy.

26:45.865 --> 26:48.607
I'm an understanding,
supportive boyfriend.

26:48.650 --> 26:51.261
I'm barely clever enough
to have gotten away with this.

26:51.305 --> 26:52.915
The last piece
of the Peach puzzle,

26:52.959 --> 26:54.656
proof that she has it out
for you.

26:54.700 --> 26:55.788
Here we go.

26:55.831 --> 26:57.267
Dalloway.

26:57.311 --> 26:59.748
God, even the dog
is pretentious.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.707
Thanks for nothing, Annika.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.534
- "Beck-alicious this
and Beck-alicious that."

27:03.578 --> 27:05.580
- There's no way this works,

27:05.624 --> 27:08.148
but also, please work.

27:08.191 --> 27:11.151
Okay.
Officially skeeved.

27:11.194 --> 27:13.632
Not sure
what I'm looking for,

27:13.675 --> 27:15.590
but I'll know it when I--

27:15.634 --> 27:17.244
Oh, GB.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.507
Guinevere Beck?

27:19.550 --> 27:20.769
The hell?

27:20.813 --> 27:22.510
Is this blackmail?

27:22.553 --> 27:25.687
No, there's too much of this,
going too far back.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.907
I know what it's like to be
in love with you, Beck.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.778
This is not
what love looks like.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.214
This isn't how love behaves.

27:31.258 --> 27:32.912
This is the work
of a sick mind.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.305
Let's call it what it is,
perversion.

27:35.349 --> 27:38.308
Now I understand why Peach
is setting you up for failure.

27:38.352 --> 27:42.051
She's not threatened by you.
She's obsessed with you.

27:42.095 --> 27:45.359
- Oh! You know I love you
forever, right?

27:45.402 --> 27:47.622
- She wants to watch you,
have you, control you,

27:47.666 --> 27:49.537
like she controls
every other piece of her life.

27:49.580 --> 27:51.452
She wants you all to herself.

27:51.495 --> 27:52.627
- Mwah!

27:52.671 --> 27:56.196
- Beck, you've got a stalker.

27:59.068 --> 28:00.548
- ♪ What remains...

28:00.591 --> 28:03.072
- Stop me if you've heard
this one before.

28:03.116 --> 28:06.075
A girl grows up in a strict,
old money family,

28:06.119 --> 28:08.425
where any deviations
from tradition are punished.

28:08.469 --> 28:11.777
Two choices, be like them,
or be excommunicated.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.256
No love, no money.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.693
At some point
she makes a friend.

28:14.736 --> 28:16.346
That's you, Beck.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.697
She develops a harmless crush,
and it's 2018.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.090
So who gives a shit
if she's gay, or bi, or pan,

28:21.134 --> 28:23.005
or just a mortal
in the presence

28:23.049 --> 28:24.833
of your dangerous
and exceptional pheromones?

28:24.877 --> 28:26.052
I'll tell you, who.

28:26.095 --> 28:27.967
Her family, and she knows it,

28:28.010 --> 28:29.795
so she takes her normal
healthy feelings

28:29.838 --> 28:33.146
and crushes them, nurses them
in a dark, secret place

28:33.189 --> 28:36.018
for years until they mutate

28:36.062 --> 28:38.151
into an obsession,
a sickness,

28:38.194 --> 28:41.110
and now your best friend
is a stalker and a sociopath,

28:41.154 --> 28:43.722
and--oh God, a liar.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.375
Runner's high is a myth.

28:45.419 --> 28:47.682
Why the hell did
I take up jogging again?

28:47.726 --> 28:49.510
I'm in hell, Beck.

28:49.553 --> 28:51.904
Even if I could share the
proof, you'd never believe me,

28:51.947 --> 28:53.383
and now you're not
even talking to me,

28:53.427 --> 28:56.169
which means,
you're in trouble.

28:59.259 --> 29:02.610
- Look at you,
like a little literary hooker.

29:02.653 --> 29:06.353
Get in.

29:06.396 --> 29:07.746
- Hey.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.182
Oh.

29:09.225 --> 29:12.272
I so appreciate
you reading my stuff.

29:12.315 --> 29:14.404
- Thank you
for being down to ride.

29:14.448 --> 29:17.451
I've got this Met benefit
lunch downtown this afternoon.

29:17.494 --> 29:20.280
I figured you and I could
just bang it out.

29:20.323 --> 29:23.718
- Hey, office hours are
better without the office.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.198
- Well said.

29:25.241 --> 29:29.680
Hey, speaking of, these essays?
These poems?

29:29.724 --> 29:32.466
Loved, loved,
loved every page.

29:32.509 --> 29:34.381
- Oh, my God, really?

29:34.424 --> 29:35.904
- Fathers are the worst.

29:35.948 --> 29:38.298
It's like their job
is to mess us up.

29:38.341 --> 29:40.430
What if we all just had
two moms, right?

29:40.474 --> 29:42.476
There'd be no wars, none.

29:42.519 --> 29:44.260
- Oh, I know, right?

29:44.304 --> 29:47.481
- Okay.

29:47.524 --> 29:50.136
I'm gonna be real with you.

29:50.179 --> 29:54.923
I think some of your stuff
is problematic.

29:54.967 --> 29:57.534
- Wait, what do you mean?

29:57.578 --> 29:59.841
- Addiction is a disease,

29:59.885 --> 30:02.539
and you want to put
your dead dad on trial

30:02.583 --> 30:04.933
for being a victim?

30:04.977 --> 30:07.109
- I think the one
you're talking about,

30:07.153 --> 30:10.896
it's--it's meant
to be about forgiveness.

30:13.681 --> 30:16.640
- [laughs]

30:16.684 --> 30:19.643
Ah, I'm sorry,
that is my bad.

30:19.687 --> 30:21.515
I skimmed.

30:21.558 --> 30:24.170
[both chuckle]

30:27.956 --> 30:29.871
So what's your thing?

30:29.915 --> 30:32.482
Like, is it like daddy
like daughter?

30:32.526 --> 30:33.832
Ouch! Shit.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.442
- What the hell?
What are you doing?

30:35.485 --> 30:37.487
- Will you relax?
