You got to play
the spiteful ex.

43:51.193 --> 43:53.413
Now let's just say good-bye.

43:53.456 --> 43:55.981
- Yeah, I'm sure you two
will be fine.

43:56.024 --> 43:58.070
Of course, you got to know

43:58.113 --> 43:59.767
what he did to me,
one of these days,

43:59.811 --> 44:02.248
he's gonna do to you,

44:02.291 --> 44:03.379
or worse.

44:03.423 --> 44:04.685
Maybe he'll do

44:04.729 --> 45:01.344
whatever the hell he did
to Candace.
