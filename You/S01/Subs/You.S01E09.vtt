23:10.476 --> 23:13.522
- Maddie. Maddie Johnson? Why?

23:13.566 --> 23:16.612
- Because you won't tell me
anything, why do you think?

23:18.309 --> 23:22.575
She told me that Candace
cheated on you.

23:22.618 --> 23:24.533
- She did. A lot.

23:24.577 --> 23:26.448
- And the guy she was screwing,

23:26.492 --> 23:29.146
he fell off a building.

23:29.190 --> 23:31.235
And then Candace disappeared.

23:31.279 --> 23:34.456
And then you supposedly
went to Italy to chase her,

23:34.500 --> 23:36.545
but if...

23:36.589 --> 23:39.156
if she wasn't there, then...

23:41.985 --> 23:46.599
And her brother...
apparently he thinks--

23:46.642 --> 23:48.731
- He thinks Candace
is dead.

23:48.775 --> 23:50.646
And that I had something
to do with it.

23:50.690 --> 23:53.780

was convinced

23:53.823 --> 23:55.912

Or did you hear about the time

23:59.220 --> 24:01.004

with a knife?

24:01.048 --> 24:03.485
Or the six times
he tried to commit suicide?

24:03.529 --> 24:05.226
Having him committed

24:05.269 --> 24:07.446
was the single most
responsible thing

24:07.489 --> 24:09.448
Candace ever did.

He hated her for it,
and her blamed me.

show you something.

about starting over like that.

she'd do it, but...

This is Beck.

at least, what, once a week

27:35.479 --> 27:36.742
to visit you?

27:36.785 --> 27:39.875
It never gets any easier
seeing him like this.

27:39.919 --> 27:42.835
He was such a force.
You still are, of course.

27:42.878 --> 27:44.184
Now I can get a word in.

27:47.317 --> 27:50.669
Oh, sorry, Bridey.
- No worries.

He...he took me in

Paco's age.

It's my fault
he's like this.

went down with Candace,

I was trying to win her back.

to visit in a while.

he'd been lying there

And you're not alone
anymore, Joe.

at the time,
