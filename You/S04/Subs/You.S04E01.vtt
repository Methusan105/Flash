00:18.768 --> 00:19.686
<i>Love.</i>

00:19.769 --> 00:21.187
Hello.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.982
<i>It's a reason for being.</i>

00:24.065 --> 00:27.402
<i>A reason to do better, do the right thing.</i>

00:28.027 --> 00:29.863
<i>-Be brave.</i>
-I wolf you.

00:30.447 --> 00:34.159
<i>But Love burned me out completely.</i>

00:34.659 --> 00:37.412
<i>Yes, that's Love with a capital L. Wife.</i>

00:37.495 --> 00:39.372
Why don't you love me anymore?

00:39.456 --> 00:41.791
<i>-Mother of my child.</i>
-I killed Natalie for you!

00:41.875 --> 00:47.380
<i>I did my best, but she was-- I hate</i>
<i>to call a woman "crazy," but, well--</i>

00:48.423 --> 00:52.510
<i>I did everything to be a good man,</i>
<i>a good husband, a good father.</i>

00:52.594 --> 00:54.304
<i>I always do everything I can.</i>

00:57.432 --> 01:01.019
<i>Can't say I've got the most impressive</i>
<i>track record in the history of romantics.</i>

01:04.064 --> 01:07.192
<i>But my heart is in the right place.</i>

01:07.275 --> 01:11.946
<i>Love couldn't understand me,</i>
<i>but, Marienne, you understood.</i>

01:13.615 --> 01:15.116
<i>We were the same,</i>

01:15.200 --> 01:17.911
<i>meant for each other on every level.</i>

01:17.994 --> 01:20.371
-He lied to you.
-I'm sorry, what?

01:20.455 --> 01:23.625
What if I told you Joe's the one
who killed your ex?

01:23.708 --> 01:25.460
No, Ryan was mugged.

01:26.961 --> 01:29.422
You need to run. Disappear.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.883
Ryan is just the beginning
of what he's willing to do.

01:31.966 --> 01:34.844
<i>Until Love poisoned the well</i>
<i>and you ran.</i>

01:34.928 --> 01:37.055
<i>I can't blame you, Marienne.</i>

01:37.138 --> 01:39.599
<i>We both know who's to blame here.</i>

01:39.682 --> 01:44.020
<i>Because of Love,</i>
<i>my world went up in flames and I--</i>

01:44.103 --> 01:47.273
<i>Well, as people everywhere read</i>
<i>in </i>New York <i>magazine,</i> People,

01:47.357 --> 01:51.236
<i>and on Vox.com, I died by Love's hand.</i>

01:53.029 --> 01:55.990
<i>Thankfully, I knew good people</i>
<i>to watch over Henry.</i>

01:56.491 --> 01:59.285
<i>I had to leave him behind. For now.</i>

01:59.369 --> 02:02.247
<i>The hardest thing I've ever done.</i>

02:03.623 --> 02:05.208
<i>Love tests us.</i>

02:05.291 --> 02:07.210
<i>I've been tested more than most.</i>

02:07.293 --> 02:08.920
<i>Turned into a ghost.</i>

02:09.003 --> 02:12.590
<i>No home, no name, all for you.</i>

02:12.674 --> 02:14.008
<i>So I'll admit,</i>

02:14.884 --> 02:16.302
<i>when I went to find you,</i>

02:17.220 --> 02:20.557
<i>I told myself, this is the last time.</i>

02:20.640 --> 02:21.766
<i>It's you...</i>

02:22.600 --> 02:23.643
<i>or nothing.</i>

02:27.313 --> 02:31.067
<i>As a problematic man appropriating</i>
<i>a queer poet once said:</i>

02:31.151 --> 02:33.528
<i>"The heart wants what it wants."</i>

02:42.287 --> 02:44.122
<i> Love chooses us.</i>

02:44.706 --> 02:47.500
<i>The only thing we can control</i>
<i>is what we do,</i>

02:48.168 --> 02:49.711
<i>how far we go.</i>

02:50.336 --> 02:53.548
<i>In Ted Chiang's story</i>
<i>"Hell is the Absence of God,"</i>

02:53.631 --> 02:56.384
<i>Neil Fisk loses the love of his life.</i>

02:56.467 --> 02:59.429
<i>She was good. She's in heaven.</i>

03:00.930 --> 03:03.433
<i>So the only way he'll feel her love again</i>

03:03.516 --> 03:06.102
<i>is if he goes to heaven too.</i>

03:23.703 --> 03:25.955
<i>But he's not exactly a guy</i>
<i>who'd get into heaven.</i>

03:26.039 --> 03:27.874
So he's gotta find a path to redemption.

03:27.957 --> 03:30.001
I'm sorry, but no.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.546
I just think the entire premise
of the story is just pants.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.923
I disagree.

03:35.006 --> 03:38.676
It made a few nearly profound points
for a work of fantasy.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.137
-Meaning what?
-Come on, that stuff's barely literature.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.766
Not that it shouldn't be on the syllabus.
Americans do write heaps of it.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.309
Can't argue with you there.

03:47.977 --> 03:51.564
<i> The course is American Iconoclasts</i>
<i>of the Short Story.</i>

03:51.648 --> 03:55.443
<i>Dean was probably picturing more Hemingway</i>
<i>but, hey, I was a last-minute hire.</i>

03:55.526 --> 03:56.945
Nadia, you said "pants."

03:57.028 --> 03:59.781
Mm-hm, yeah, I did, to great controversy.

03:59.864 --> 04:02.450
Explain "pants" to the American, please.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.246
It's crap, rubbish, not good.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.289
<i>There are tricks</i>
<i>to being a professor, like this:</i>

04:08.373 --> 04:10.250
-Say more.
-It's not redemption

04:10.333 --> 04:13.753
-if it's for selfish reasons.
-Does it matter if he's doing good?

04:13.836 --> 04:17.674
Chiang isn't actually saying
the highest redemption is doing good.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.884
He's saying it's just love.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.928
<i>Most of my professor tricks are one trick</i>

04:22.011 --> 04:24.013
<i>I picked up spending time</i>
<i>with a girl named Ellie.</i>

04:24.097 --> 04:27.725
<i>Wind them up, let them go.</i>
<i>Teenagers will argue for you.</i>

04:27.809 --> 04:30.603
Yes, the word "love" is used
to mean something deeper.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.898
Like full civilizations, religions,
all of literature.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.900
-Hyperbole.
<i>-These two will kill each other</i>

04:35.984 --> 04:37.652
<i>or get married by the end of term.</i>

04:37.735 --> 04:40.196
Spoken like somebody that's
never felt love. How would you know?

04:40.280 --> 04:43.616
Okay, all right,
let's pause, table this one.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.369
Everybody read "The Tell-Tale Heart"

04:46.452 --> 04:50.540
and be ready to discuss
where Poe lands on what love is.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.583
All right? That's all for today.

04:56.754 --> 04:59.549
-Um, Professor Moore.
<i>-Still getting used to that.</i>

04:59.632 --> 05:02.719
-Question?
-No. But yes.

05:03.386 --> 05:06.097
Why do you keep assigning stuff
like Ted Chiang

05:06.180 --> 05:10.101
instead of all the, you know, usual
canonical, vaguely racist men that drink?

05:10.184 --> 05:12.478
The people who decided
what's important were wrong.

05:12.562 --> 05:16.566
The ones who assign those writers are lazy
and this is my class.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.360
Okay, I underestimated you.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.946
It's the accent, isn't it? Sorry.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.282
<i>-I'm good at professor-ing.</i>
-What you got?

05:24.365 --> 05:27.702
Oh, um... Rhys Montrose.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.371
What? Is he not a thing in America?

05:30.955 --> 05:33.124
Well, everyone here wants him
to run for mayor of London

05:33.207 --> 05:35.168
and ultimately save England from itself.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.670
But I guess the bar's so low,

05:37.754 --> 05:40.006
calling out hypocrisy
at the most elementary level

05:40.089 --> 05:41.632
makes you Jesus Christ in a peacoat.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.179
Read it. You'll probably like it.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.810
<i>Brits are the most literary people</i>
<i>on Earth.</i>

05:52.894 --> 05:54.604
<i>They really read here.</i>

05:54.687 --> 05:57.940
<i>I don't just mean "buy."</i>
<i>Read. Cover to cover.</i>

05:58.024 --> 05:59.275
<i>And look at the respect.</i>

05:59.358 --> 06:03.821
<i>May not own a hairbrush,</i>
<i>but does she dog-ear a page?</i>

06:03.905 --> 06:06.449
<i>If L.A. was purgatory</i>
<i>and suburbia was hell,</i>

06:06.532 --> 06:09.619
<i>London may be</i>
<i>when I finally got to the good place.</i>

06:11.204 --> 06:13.748
<i>I still miss you, Marienne. So much.</i>

06:13.831 --> 06:17.919
<i>But this feels like the European holiday</i>
<i>I desperately needed.</i>

06:18.002 --> 06:20.088
<i>Laying low is imperative.</i>

06:20.171 --> 06:23.174
<i>I needed cash, but teaching's fun</i>
<i>and London's not so bad.</i>

06:23.257 --> 06:25.259
<i>A city of art, theater, books.</i>

06:25.343 --> 06:26.344
Jonathan!

06:26.427 --> 06:28.513
<i>And the occasional douchebag.</i>

06:28.596 --> 06:30.848
-The American!
<i>-This guy.</i>

06:30.932 --> 06:34.268
-Professor Harding, hello.
-Malcolm, please!

06:34.352 --> 06:36.062
So when are you letting me

06:36.145 --> 06:37.730
-show you the real city?
<i>-Never.</i>

06:37.814 --> 06:39.440
-Soon.
-How's the flat?

06:39.524 --> 06:40.691
It's lovely, thank you.

06:40.775 --> 06:44.737
<i>Ran into him after my job interview.</i>
<i>It was 2:00 and he may have been drunk.</i>

06:44.821 --> 06:48.658
-Chuffed you're looking after the place.
-Yeah, very grateful again, so thank you.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.869
Shit. You know what,
I've got office hours, I think.

06:51.953 --> 06:56.332
Yeah, no, no, no. Go, go, go.
Rouse young minds and etcetera.

06:56.415 --> 07:00.294
Perks of the job, rumor has it.
I wouldn't possibly know.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.629
<i>I bet.</i>

07:01.712 --> 07:04.549
-We'll get those drinks.
<i>-I'd rather drink paint.</i>

07:08.761 --> 07:13.182
<i>Campus is across town from where I stay,</i>
<i>but in a city like London,</i>

07:13.766 --> 07:15.226
<i>I don't mind the walk.</i>

07:16.686 --> 07:19.522
<i>I guess you could say it keeps me young.</i>

07:19.605 --> 07:23.693
<i>I'm not sure when Gen Z became</i>
<i>actual adults, but honestly, I like it.</i>

07:23.776 --> 07:26.821
<i>This is what cities are for.</i>
<i>They make you work to keep up.</i>

07:28.573 --> 07:30.491
<i>In certain fundamental ways,</i>

07:30.575 --> 07:32.452
<i>all big cities seem the same.</i>

07:33.119 --> 07:35.538
<i>Insufferable hipsters</i>
<i>are apparently universal,</i>

07:36.080 --> 07:38.541
<i>as are the bridge-and-tunnel crowd.</i>

07:38.624 --> 07:42.879
<i>And they start drinking early.</i>
<i>Pub time and weekends are sacred.</i>

07:45.006 --> 07:46.841
<i>My first thought when I saw</i>
<i>my neighborhood was:</i>

07:46.924 --> 07:49.051
<i>I'm in a Hugh Grant movie.</i>

07:49.844 --> 07:52.346
<i>Don't get me wrong,</i>
<i>no </i>Notting Hill<i> romance for me,</i>

07:52.430 --> 07:56.559
<i>or to be precise, South Kensington,</i>
<i>but I can't deny the energy here is nice.</i>

07:56.642 --> 07:58.978
<i>Quiet. Okay, sleepy.</i>

07:59.061 --> 08:01.147
<i>Which is good.</i>

08:01.230 --> 08:02.857
<i>Perfect, even.</i>

08:05.693 --> 08:10.740
<i>I've had a lot of time to think,</i>
<i>Marienne, walking around London.</i>

08:11.240 --> 08:12.575
<i>Like a poet once said,</i>

08:12.658 --> 08:15.411
<i>"Heartbreak is our greatest teacher,</i>
<i>and if so,</i>

08:15.495 --> 08:18.039
<i>thank you for making me wise."</i>

08:25.796 --> 08:29.800
<i> All I can say is never again.</i>

08:30.593 --> 08:31.594
<i>No love.</i>

08:32.178 --> 08:33.262
<i>No people.</i>

08:34.138 --> 08:35.223
<i>Just books.</i>

08:40.228 --> 08:41.646
<i>I love this place.</i>

08:41.729 --> 08:43.564
<i>Charm, built-in bookcases,</i>

08:43.648 --> 08:45.566
<i>a fireplace in every corner.</i>

08:45.650 --> 08:48.361
<i>All due respect, Williamsburg could never.</i>

08:48.444 --> 08:51.197
<i>But it's what's happening</i>
<i>out my back window across the alley</i>

08:51.280 --> 08:53.950
<i>that is of my particular interest.</i>

08:56.410 --> 09:00.164
<i>I don't think Malcolm knew about the view</i>
<i>when he recommended this flat.</i>

09:00.248 --> 09:02.291
<i>Technical term for him is "party monster."</i>

09:04.669 --> 09:06.754
<i>And who is that?</i>

09:07.964 --> 09:09.423
<i>Is she his girlfriend?</i>

09:10.049 --> 09:12.343
<i>What kind of woman--? No. No.</i>

09:12.426 --> 09:13.803
<i>I am not interested.</i>

09:13.886 --> 09:16.180
<i>No people, not interested.</i>

09:16.264 --> 09:20.434
<i>As a man named Mooney used to say,</i>
<i>"Not my circus, not my monkeys."</i>

09:20.518 --> 09:22.353
<i>I don't want to know.</i>

09:31.404 --> 09:33.406
<i>The best way</i>
<i>to stay out of people's business</i>

09:33.489 --> 09:35.783
<i>is to know what that business is.</i>

09:36.993 --> 09:38.452
<i>She mostly works.</i>

09:38.536 --> 09:39.912
<i>He mostly plays.</i>

09:43.165 --> 09:46.794
<i>Malcolm went to all the right schools,</i>
<i>like his father and grandfather.</i>

09:46.877 --> 09:48.504
<i>He'll never have to work</i>
<i>a day in his life,</i>

09:48.588 --> 09:50.423
<i>but he likes being an academic,</i>

09:50.506 --> 09:53.509
<i>giving him an air of respectability</i>
<i>that counteracts the assumption</i>

09:53.593 --> 09:57.096
<i>that generations of wealth and inbreeding</i>
<i>mean he's just not very smart.</i>

09:57.179 --> 10:00.224
<i>Sadly, other professors mostly</i>
<i>consider him a charming bag of hair.</i>

10:00.308 --> 10:03.936
<i>Though rumor also holds remarkable in bed</i>
<i>with above average--</i>

10:04.020 --> 10:06.272
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>My classroom is in the library.</i>

10:06.355 --> 10:08.190
<i>I hear everything,</i>
<i>whether I want to or not.</i>

10:08.983 --> 10:11.402
<i>Now, how about her?</i>

10:15.740 --> 10:17.283
<i>Kate Galvin.</i>

10:17.366 --> 10:19.160
<i>Kate gives very little.</i>

10:19.243 --> 10:21.579
<i>Her online presence is curated</i>
<i>only for work.</i>

10:22.038 --> 10:25.875
<i>Gallerist, art lover, never married,</i>
<i>appears to be daughter of Greta Galvin,</i>

10:25.958 --> 10:30.212
<i>a free-spirited '90s model</i>
<i>who's now a spiritual stylist in Ibiza.</i>

10:30.296 --> 10:33.215
<i>If I had to guess,</i>
<i>she grew up her hippie mom's opposite.</i>

10:33.299 --> 10:36.469
<i>Focused, ambitious,</i>
<i>positively American work ethic.</i>

10:41.515 --> 10:44.060
<i>Everything I've learned about Malcolm</i>
<i>and Kate tells me I'm right.</i>

10:44.143 --> 10:46.062
<i>I do not need to get to know them.</i>

10:50.107 --> 10:54.403
<i>And while Malcolm is off getting smashed,</i>
<i>she's, you guessed it, still working.</i>

10:55.154 --> 10:56.906
<i>What's got her so focused?</i>

11:00.910 --> 11:05.706
<i>Okay, I don't think that's </i>Art News Daily
<i>on her screen anymore.</i>

11:05.790 --> 11:06.791
<i>Hello.</i>

11:07.375 --> 11:12.380
<i>So does Malcolm leave her unsatisfied</i>
<i>or did--? No, not watching.</i>

11:13.214 --> 11:15.758
<i>Why does the universe keep</i>
<i>doing this to me?</i>

11:23.391 --> 11:24.934
<i>I'm not getting hooked.</i>

11:25.017 --> 11:26.811
<i>She's not the first</i>
<i>sexually frustrated woman</i>

11:26.894 --> 11:29.146
<i>I've ever seen</i>
<i>forget to pull the curtains.</i>

11:29.230 --> 11:33.192
<i>I study to learn how they tick,</i>
<i>so I can avoid the circus.</i>

11:33.818 --> 11:38.030
<i>Nothing is going to stand between me</i>
<i>and my European holiday.</i>

11:39.573 --> 11:42.827
<i>But I do miss having someone out there.</i>

11:43.619 --> 11:45.287
<i>Someone worth watching.</i>

11:45.913 --> 11:47.623
<i>A puzzle worth solving.</i>

11:48.749 --> 11:49.583
<i>You.</i>

11:51.335 --> 11:54.004
<i>But missing you won't bring you back.</i>

11:56.799 --> 12:00.553
<i>I thought it would count for something,</i>
<i>how far I traveled.</i>

12:00.636 --> 12:03.973
<i>All over France, the weeks, the months.</i>

12:05.266 --> 12:08.018
<i>What I did for you.</i>

12:12.356 --> 12:14.608
<i>I went to every artist haunt in Paris.</i>

12:16.485 --> 12:18.487
<i>I visited them over and over.</i>

12:22.533 --> 12:24.034
<i>I kept feeling...</i>

12:24.702 --> 12:26.620
<i>I'd just missed you.</i>

12:26.704 --> 12:28.581
<i>Weeks went by.</i>

12:28.664 --> 12:31.167
<i>I never gave up.</i>

12:34.545 --> 12:36.213
<i>I knew I was close</i>

12:36.297 --> 12:39.550
<i>and fate finally rewarded me.</i>

12:57.401 --> 12:59.487
-May I?
-Yeah, of course.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.282
I love this artist.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.618
Do you have any more of their work
or an e-mail?

13:05.701 --> 13:07.203
Oh, yeah, an e-mail.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.205
Let me check.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.207
She may take some time to get back to you.

13:11.290 --> 13:14.084
She's in London
to visit the Acanthus art fair.

13:14.710 --> 13:15.920
<i>An art fair.</i>

13:16.587 --> 13:17.963
<i>London.</i>

13:18.047 --> 13:20.591
<i>I knew where to find you.</i>

13:30.434 --> 13:31.936
Go fuck yourself, Malcolm.

13:32.019 --> 13:34.563
Which I'm sure you'd love
'cause you're a total fucking narcissist.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.148
Kate, come back!

13:37.274 --> 13:39.401
<i>You see? You thought we had issues.</i>

13:39.485 --> 13:40.986
<i>I wonder-- No.</i>

13:41.070 --> 13:43.489
<i>I'm not-- I'm not wondering.</i>

13:45.366 --> 13:46.784
<i>Just so we're clear,</i>

13:46.867 --> 13:50.663
<i>it's not following someone</i>
<i>if you have to walk the same way home.</i>

13:55.876 --> 13:57.253
<i>And...</i>

13:59.922 --> 14:01.423
<i>They don't look friendly.</i>

14:01.507 --> 14:02.633
Grab her purse!

14:02.716 --> 14:05.010
<i>This can't be happening.</i>
<i>I can't get involved.</i>

14:05.094 --> 14:07.304
Get off me! Get off me! Help! Help!

14:07.388 --> 14:10.474
<i>Fuck. Not my circus, not my monkeys.</i>
<i>Not my circus, not my monkeys.</i>

14:10.558 --> 14:11.600
Get off!

14:14.562 --> 14:15.854
Oh, my God.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.982
-Let's go! Fuck it!

14:27.741 --> 14:29.785
-Are you okay?
-I fucking hated that watch.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.078
<i>I'll take that as a yes.</i>

14:31.161 --> 14:34.415
I should probably report it, in case
they come back and attack a student.

14:34.498 --> 14:35.708
Fuck my life!

14:35.791 --> 14:37.585
<i>Cops would not be good for me.</i>

14:39.003 --> 14:41.005
I'm sorry, it's a little awkward.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.717
What? Just say it.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.927
Can you maybe--? Don't mention me.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.514
My work visa is shaky.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.561
<i>Damn it. I just had to do it, didn't I?</i>

14:55.644 --> 14:57.938
<i>I had to go and save her.</i>

15:05.321 --> 15:08.449
<i>She insisted on driving me home,</i>
<i>not awkward.</i>

15:08.532 --> 15:12.161
<i>We exchanged some pleasantries and I</i>
<i>introduced myself as Jonathan Moore.</i>

15:13.829 --> 15:16.832
<i>I still don't know</i>
<i>if she mentioned me to the cops.</i>

15:16.916 --> 15:18.834
<i>Tonight was a wake-up call.</i>

15:18.918 --> 15:23.255
<i>From now on, no matter what, low profile.</i>

15:23.839 --> 15:27.343
<i>And most of all,</i>
<i>stay away from both of them.</i>

15:29.678 --> 15:30.721
John-Boy.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.222
Can I call you John-Boy?

15:32.306 --> 15:35.351
<i>It's like how cats sense you're</i>
<i>allergic and jump right in your lap.</i>

15:35.434 --> 15:37.519
Jesus.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.605
You can see right in our flat.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.733
Are you a Peeping Tom, John-Boy?

15:43.317 --> 15:48.072
No hand shandies over my girl,
do you hear? Any of my girls.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.657
<i>Yep, still hate this guy.</i>

15:49.740 --> 15:52.076
Thank you. For Kate.

15:53.869 --> 15:56.330
Used to be a time
when any trouble you found in London

15:56.413 --> 15:58.499
was the trouble you went looking for.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.876
Those little shits are everywhere now.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.755
I have to feel bad for people so desperate
they need to do that.

16:05.589 --> 16:06.840
Desperate?

16:06.924 --> 16:09.134
Scum from birth, you mean.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.845
They target people like us
'cause they know that no one...

16:11.929 --> 16:15.265
<i>Something tells me he's about to explain</i>
<i>how the rich are the real victims.</i>

16:15.349 --> 16:16.600
...hate the rich.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.644
We're the real victims here.

16:18.727 --> 16:22.940
You see, my family is practically royal.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.025
Royal adjacent, anyway.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.944
<i>I think that was a humblebrag?</i>

16:27.027 --> 16:30.948
We built this country,
and what thanks do we get for it?

16:31.031 --> 16:33.367
<i>Ah, yes. Definitely builder's hands.</i>

16:34.535 --> 16:37.454
But enough about the peasants.

16:38.330 --> 16:42.292
My dear friend Adam Pratt
recently opened Sundry House.

16:42.376 --> 16:45.587
It's absurdly elitist,
everyone is devastatingly smart,

16:45.671 --> 16:48.549
and the mixologist is a bloody magician.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.551
You'll come along with us tonight.

16:50.634 --> 16:55.597
-Uh, no, I have a lot of reading--
-No, no, no. That wasn't a question.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.851
You saved Kate's life.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.603
I am repaying you.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.689
We leave in half an hour.

17:03.772 --> 17:07.860
<i>And I continue to do great</i>
<i>at staying away from these people.</i>

17:11.697 --> 17:15.576
<i>Adam Pratt's Sundry House</i>
<i>is the most exclusive club in Soho.</i>

17:15.659 --> 17:19.288
<i>A hideaway for London's unfathomably</i>
<i>fortunate and privileged.</i>

17:20.080 --> 17:22.207
<i>No photos, please.</i>

17:25.502 --> 17:26.837
<i>What is all that for?</i>

17:27.421 --> 17:29.214
-Mal? Kate!
-Over here!

17:29.298 --> 17:31.508
Oh, my God, you look stunning.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.469
I'm blinded. I've died.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.305
Phoebe, Lady Borehall-Blaxworth.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.598
<i>I know.</i>

17:37.681 --> 17:40.309
<i>Of course, I researched before I got here.</i>

17:41.018 --> 17:43.854
<i>Lady Phoebe. Kate's most famous friend.</i>

17:43.937 --> 17:45.355
<i>Toxically aristocratic,</i>

17:45.439 --> 17:46.982
<i>quintessentially blonde,</i>

17:47.066 --> 17:49.651
<i>dated the captain of not one</i>
<i>but two Premier League teams</i>

17:49.735 --> 17:50.944
<i>at the same time.</i>

17:51.028 --> 17:55.199
<i>Every blunder and bikini wax documented</i>
<i>by the tabloids since she was 15.</i>

17:55.282 --> 18:00.412
<i>And yet, always gives the impression</i>
<i>of being genuinely sweet and kind.</i>

18:01.080 --> 18:02.956
<i>Could that possibly be true?</i>

18:03.040 --> 18:05.751
Who's this sad baby tarsier?

18:05.834 --> 18:08.378
Come on, Phoebs let's get you inside
before they eat you.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.721
-Lovely.
-Phoebe!

18:17.805 --> 18:19.973
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

18:20.057 --> 18:23.811
<i>So this what</i>
<i>a £25,000-a-year membership will get you.</i>

18:23.894 --> 18:26.563
<i>The gorgeous, the hip</i>
<i>and the spoiled wearing real fur</i>

18:26.647 --> 18:28.732
<i>to drink in Instagram-friendly lighting.</i>

18:28.816 --> 18:30.984
<i>It even smells rich in here.</i>

18:31.068 --> 18:33.237
<i>If a bomb dropped on this place,</i>

18:33.320 --> 18:36.740
<i>Britain's GDP would drop by 10%,</i>
<i>but it might be worth it.</i>

18:36.824 --> 18:38.867
-Jonathan!
<i>-Let the games begin.</i>

18:38.951 --> 18:41.662
<i>Which one of these people</i>
<i>will I hate the most?</i>

18:41.745 --> 18:45.666
Darling, this is Jonathan Moore.
He's American.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.918
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

18:48.001 --> 18:51.046
Blessing is a Nigerian princess.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.549
<i>Blessing Bosede.</i>

18:53.632 --> 18:56.510
<i>Princesses grow on trees at Sundry House.</i>

18:56.593 --> 19:00.055
<i>She's in tech. All of her business plans</i>
<i>feel more like pyramid schemes.</i>

19:00.139 --> 19:02.099
<i>All that and a snob.</i>

19:02.182 --> 19:05.310
Soz, not soz for interrupting. This way.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.312
<i>Oh, good, more introductions.</i>

19:07.396 --> 19:09.648
How do you feel about art, John-Boy?

19:09.731 --> 19:10.941
I like it.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.694
Well, then, this is Simon Soo.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.155
<i>I'm sure</i>
<i>Simon Soo's record-breaking art sales</i>

19:16.238 --> 19:18.574
<i>have nothing to do</i>
<i>with his dad being a billionaire.</i>

19:18.657 --> 19:22.035
<i>Simon painstakingly cultivates</i>
<i>a tortured artist persona,</i>

19:22.119 --> 19:24.413
<i>as though he's ever suffered worse</i>
<i>than a paper cut</i>

19:24.496 --> 19:27.166
<i>that Daddy's money bandaged immediately.</i>

19:27.249 --> 19:29.626
Simon, this is Jonathan Moore.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.211
I have too many friends.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.463
Come back when one is dead.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.300
-<i>Ouch.</i>
-Simon, sweetie,

19:36.967 --> 19:38.260
don't be a cunt.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.221
This is Sophie, Simon's sister.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.472
<i>Sophie Soo.</i>

19:42.556 --> 19:45.184
<i>Every item on her body</i>
<i>is a sponsorship deal.</i>

19:45.267 --> 19:48.520
<i>It's so greedy, I'm almost impressed.</i>

19:48.604 --> 19:52.900
<i>Sophie went to Oxford, then Harvard Law,</i>
<i>but while studying for the bar in Mykonos,</i>

19:52.983 --> 19:57.321
<i>realized making a career on likes</i>
<i>and follows requires a lot less reading.</i>

19:57.404 --> 19:59.865
Sophie is a jet-set influencer,

19:59.948 --> 20:03.118
a job comprised of posting bikini photos

20:03.202 --> 20:06.371
to inspire fat, council-estate plebeians.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.665
Ruthless, capitalist, illusionary.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.667
Almost sociopathic.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.377
What?

20:12.461 --> 20:13.962
I'm a fan, darling.

20:14.046 --> 20:18.759
-Fuck off and die, Malcolm.
-<i>They don't like each other either.</i>

20:18.842 --> 20:20.260
Very nice to meet you...

20:20.761 --> 20:24.056
Jonathan.
Nice to meet you too, both of you.

20:24.139 --> 20:25.182
Oh...

20:25.265 --> 20:27.184
-American, are we?
-Careful.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.061
They all have guns.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.189
<i>I wish.</i>

20:38.445 --> 20:39.655
<i>Facts about Malcolm.</i>

20:39.738 --> 20:43.867
<i>Drinks like a fish, loves his own voice,</i>
<i>has many friends, all terrible.</i>

20:43.951 --> 20:45.327
<i>Oh, there are a few more contenders</i>

20:45.410 --> 20:47.496
<i>in London's</i>
<i>greatest douchebag competition.</i>

20:47.579 --> 20:49.039
<i>Roald Walker Burton.</i>

20:49.122 --> 20:51.541
<i>Mostly known for his boats,</i>
<i>one-night stands,</i>

20:51.625 --> 20:53.418
<i>and quote, "alarming knife collection."</i>

20:53.502 --> 20:58.340
<i>Gemma Graham-Greene managed to disparage</i>
<i>Americans, trans people, the poor and Jews</i>

20:58.423 --> 21:01.343
<i>in a single sentence</i>
<i>while doing a shot of Patrón.</i>

21:01.426 --> 21:05.764
<i>Connie something, all they told me</i>
<i>is he's a lunatic and owns horses.</i>

21:05.847 --> 21:07.933
<i>I'm not sure any of these people</i>
<i>even like each other.</i>

21:08.016 --> 21:11.436
<i>They're just so obscenely rich,</i>
<i>it's like a mandatory club.</i>

21:11.520 --> 21:13.730
I'll be right back with those treats.

21:14.648 --> 21:17.609
<i>With Malcolm off to score some drugs,</i>
<i>I have a moment to breathe.</i>

21:17.693 --> 21:19.027
-Jonathan?
<i>-Or not.</i>

21:19.111 --> 21:22.572
This ridiculous beast is Adam,
my boyfriend.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.158
Potential marriage material.
But the jury's still out.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.202
Don't worry. I'll bribe the jury.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.037
<i>An American.</i>

21:29.121 --> 21:31.081
<i>Let's see</i>
<i>if you can compete with the Brits.</i>

21:31.164 --> 21:33.875
<i>Adam Pratt, owner of Sundry House.</i>

21:33.959 --> 21:35.669
<i>All of this is Daddy's money.</i>

21:35.752 --> 21:38.171
<i>Built by a rich kid</i>
<i>with no understanding of real work</i>

21:38.255 --> 21:40.549
<i>to impress other rich kids</i>
<i>with the same story.</i>

21:40.632 --> 21:44.553
And Jonathan Moore teaches literature
with Mal. And he's American!

21:44.636 --> 21:47.514
Wow. Moore.
Moore, where's your family from?

21:48.181 --> 21:49.308
All over.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.436
Loving the whole off-the-rack vibe.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.523
-What's your crypto?
<i>-Ding-a-ling. We have a winner.</i>

21:56.606 --> 21:58.066
No, wait, hold on. Let me guess.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.860
No, this is about to turn into a bet.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.946
Last time you lost your flat
in Marrakech over a bloody shoe size.

22:03.613 --> 22:05.115
Come, baby, let's mingle.

22:05.198 --> 22:08.327
I have to go mingle,
but I'll be back, Jonathan.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.787
I crave the dulcet tones
of a fellow countryman.

22:10.871 --> 22:14.082
<i>Don't hurry. Can I slip out now?</i>

22:14.166 --> 22:16.501
-Whoa, whoa, I will take you in five.
<i>-Oh, fuck.</i>

22:16.585 --> 22:18.587
Getting a cab is hopeless. Here.

22:19.880 --> 22:20.714
Hydrate.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.767
<i>Inevitable that an hour later,</i>

22:31.850 --> 22:34.352
<i>I'm drinking in the corner,</i>
<i>waiting for fucking Malcolm.</i>

22:34.436 --> 22:36.521
What could possibly be that funny?

22:39.524 --> 22:40.650
<i>Rhys Montrose.</i>

22:40.734 --> 22:43.445
<i>Everyone wants him</i>
<i>to run for mayor of London.</i>

22:43.528 --> 22:44.905
<i>What's he doing here?</i>

22:44.988 --> 22:45.822
Good book.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.157
<i>Oh, no. I sound drunk.</i>

22:48.241 --> 22:49.409
So you're the new one.

22:50.535 --> 22:53.872
Mal unfailingly adopts you lads,
back since the dormitory at...

22:53.955 --> 22:56.625
<i>Oxford, right.</i>
<i>They were all there together.</i>

22:56.708 --> 22:58.794
<i>The book is about</i>
<i>how he was born into poverty,</i>

22:58.877 --> 23:02.255
<i>raised by an unstable single mom,</i>
<i>uncomfortably relatable,</i>

23:02.339 --> 23:04.883
<i>and he was a mess,</i>
<i>then found out he's the son of a duke,</i>

23:04.966 --> 23:06.218
<i>cleaned up, went to Oxford,</i>

23:06.301 --> 23:09.387
<i>and became the author of honestly</i>
<i>one of the best memoirs I've ever read.</i>

23:09.471 --> 23:10.555
Quite a thing, that.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.683
Tell no one your sordid life story
for 30 years, then write it down,

23:13.767 --> 23:16.144
suddenly millions know your every shame.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.481
For what it's worth,
I didn't find your book sordid.

23:19.564 --> 23:20.482
Oh...

23:21.483 --> 23:23.360
Fellow man with a shit childhood, then?

23:26.321 --> 23:27.322
I see.

23:28.323 --> 23:29.699
A true shit childhood.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.494
Pleasure to meet you, brother in arms.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.959
The thing about getting money
when you had none,

23:39.042 --> 23:40.752
you never really feel you have it.

23:41.628 --> 23:44.381
-And all the people who always did--
-Another species.

23:46.550 --> 23:47.759
Exactly.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.678
<i>I actually don't hate him yet.</i>

23:49.761 --> 23:52.264
They're dancing while the world burns.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.474
Barely notice it's even burning.

23:54.558 --> 23:55.642
Why would they?

23:56.810 --> 23:58.436
Their weather's just right.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.148
<i>First real conversation</i>
<i>I've had all night.</i>

24:01.231 --> 24:04.484
And with that, I'm off to Berlin
to go on a morning show

24:04.568 --> 24:06.736
to be very coy
about whether I run for mayor.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.281
You got my vote.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.659
See you around, Jonathan.

24:12.742 --> 24:16.079
<i>And back to being alone</i>
<i>in a den of douchebags.</i>

24:17.080 --> 24:20.792
<i>Okay, enough waiting for Malcolm.</i>
<i>It's time to go.</i>

24:25.005 --> 24:27.799
<i>Oh, okay. Drunker than I thought.</i>

24:28.675 --> 24:30.760
Jonathan. Drink!

24:30.844 --> 24:32.554
-You must.
<i>-Just let me go.</i>

24:36.474 --> 24:38.101
<i>Oh, no. What was that?</i>

24:38.185 --> 24:39.561
Absinthe, baby.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.980
The wallpaper's gonna start
talking to you, sweetheart.

24:42.063 --> 24:44.983
-Now, tell us, Jonathan.
-Why are you here?

24:46.109 --> 24:48.528
<i>-Shit.</i>
-Did you kill someone?

24:48.612 --> 24:50.030
I can always tell.

24:50.113 --> 24:52.282
My cousin killed someone.
On accident, of course.

24:52.365 --> 24:56.286
It was just a homeless person. Which, God,
if she did that now, she'd be canceled.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.372
-Excuse me.
-Or did someone hurt you?

24:59.456 --> 25:02.417
Was it a woman? Is that what happened?

25:06.504 --> 25:08.256
Did she break your heart?

25:08.798 --> 25:11.509
<i>Did you break my heart, Marienne?</i>

25:13.803 --> 25:18.266
<i>When I followed you to the art fair</i>
<i>in London, I felt you, Marienne.</i>

25:27.400 --> 25:31.279
<i>You changed. The buttoned-up</i>
<i>Madre Linda librarian was gone.</i>

25:32.447 --> 25:34.282
<i>But it was you.</i>

26:06.439 --> 26:09.526
<i>Note to self, never drink absinthe again.</i>

26:13.571 --> 26:18.660
So, what's making
John-Boy so miserable, hm?

26:18.743 --> 26:20.996
<i>The pompous clown calling me John-Boy.</i>

26:21.079 --> 26:22.747
Everyone thinks it's love.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.249
So did you let her go,

26:24.332 --> 26:26.835
-or did she get away?
<i>-What's it matter?</i>

26:26.918 --> 26:28.962
I followed a woman to Paris.

26:29.045 --> 26:31.631
It's the most romantic city in the world.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.384
And then she broke my heart.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.387
-Then she wasn't the one.
-We were perfect together.

26:37.470 --> 26:41.182
My ex-wife told her things about me.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.728
That. That, the burden of our decade.

26:44.811 --> 26:46.479
Women believing women,

26:46.563 --> 26:49.566
like they don't lie and cheat and fuck.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.818
-They do it more than us.
-She wasn't like that.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.737
Let me tell you something as a friend.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.530
You're embarrassing yourself,

26:55.613 --> 26:58.033
sitting here all loved up
over some silly whore

26:58.116 --> 27:00.035
who couldn't give two shits about you.

27:00.118 --> 27:04.664
She's already riding the next cock
as we speak, so move on.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.959
Fuck the pain away.
There are plenty of whores in Soho.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.253
<i>If I could move, I'd kill this guy.</i>

27:10.337 --> 27:12.672
Sweetie, you need more absinthe.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.425
Oh, no, no, no. Don't.
You'll annihilate him.

27:15.508 --> 27:17.594
<i>Nothing matters without you anyway.</i>

27:18.636 --> 27:20.430
Whoa...

27:20.513 --> 27:22.057
<i>And not good.</i>

27:22.140 --> 27:25.935
-Did he tell you? He's royal adjacent.
<i>-What the fuck?</i>

27:26.019 --> 27:27.896
<i>How did I get here?</i>

27:27.979 --> 27:30.482
<i>What is she talking about?</i>

27:30.565 --> 27:34.402
...dated both Middletons.
Malcolm is a liar.

27:35.820 --> 27:36.905
Excuse me.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.372
<i>Get me off this ride.</i>

27:45.455 --> 27:47.874
<i>Did I make her cry? What did I do?</i>

27:47.957 --> 27:50.335
<i>I'm in hell. Where's my phone?</i>

27:50.418 --> 27:52.545
<i>-Fuck.</i>
-Time to get this one home.

28:03.723 --> 28:07.644
<i> Well, I made it home, at least.</i>

28:08.269 --> 28:12.399
<i>Do you see what trying to forget you</i>
<i>has done to me, Marienne?</i>

28:16.152 --> 28:17.278
<i>Whose coat is this?</i>

28:19.280 --> 28:22.367
Easy does it.
Time to get this one home.

28:22.450 --> 28:24.119
Couch, couch, couch.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.080
<i>Malcolm got me home.</i>

28:27.163 --> 28:28.581
<i>Do I need to thank him?</i>

28:28.665 --> 28:33.336
<i>No. If I'm rude, maybe the misogynist</i>
<i>with the drug problem will leave me alone.</i>

28:36.714 --> 28:39.592
<i>New day. No more craziness.</i>

28:39.676 --> 28:41.511
<i>Back to the quiet.</i>

28:51.271 --> 28:52.397
<i>Malcolm.</i>

28:52.480 --> 28:54.315
Scum from birth, you mean.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.860
Sitting here all loved up
over some stupid whore.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.361
<i>Wait. Did I...?</i>

29:05.118 --> 29:07.203
<i>I ran away from all this.</i>

29:07.287 --> 29:09.914
<i>I never wanted</i>
<i>to touch a bloody knife again.</i>

29:13.960 --> 29:16.337
<i>He was saying horrible things about you.</i>

29:16.421 --> 29:18.590
<i>I was angry for you.</i>

29:19.340 --> 29:21.301
<i>Somehow that just makes it worse.</i>

29:34.606 --> 29:37.066
<i>So much for Malcolm tweeting</i>
<i>that he's gone to Bermuda.</i>

29:41.738 --> 29:42.739
<i>What the...?</i>

29:49.162 --> 29:51.164
<i>Where would I put a finger?</i>

30:04.093 --> 30:06.137
<i>She reported him missing already?</i>

30:07.055 --> 30:10.308
<i>No. They must be here</i>
<i>to take her statement about the mugging.</i>

30:11.017 --> 30:12.477
<i>She's telling them all about me.</i>

30:12.560 --> 30:16.481
<i>Any sec, they'll knock on the door</i>
<i>to find a suspicious human-sized rug.</i>

30:17.273 --> 30:21.236
<i>I could run into them on their way out,</i>
<i>carrying a human-sized rug.</i>

30:21.319 --> 30:22.821
<i>New plan, hurry up.</i>

30:23.696 --> 30:25.156
<i>Fuck, he's heavy.</i>

30:25.240 --> 30:26.866
<i>Fuck this fucking carpet.</i>

30:26.950 --> 30:27.992
<i>Fuck my life.</i>

30:29.369 --> 30:33.081
<i>The classics professor did tell me</i>
<i>I could use his car in an emergency.</i>

30:35.166 --> 30:36.459
<i>Okay.</i>

30:36.543 --> 30:37.627
<i>Okay.</i>

30:37.710 --> 30:41.631
<i>I've got till dark to figure out</i>
<i>what the hell to do with him</i>

30:41.714 --> 30:44.676
<i>and mentally prepare to drive</i>
<i>on the wrong side of the road.</i>

30:49.097 --> 30:52.892
<i>Is this is what you saw</i>
<i>when you looked at me, Marienne?</i>

30:54.686 --> 30:57.188
<i>-I didn't want you to be right.</i>
-Excuse me.

31:36.811 --> 31:37.937
Marienne!

31:56.497 --> 31:59.584
Now can we please talk?

32:01.502 --> 32:02.337
Stop.

32:03.546 --> 32:06.507
-I'm not gonna hurt you.
-You're right, you're not.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.468
I will use this.

32:17.018 --> 32:17.852
I'm sorry.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.982
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

32:25.610 --> 32:26.986
I thought you loved me.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.279
I did.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.282
Well, I'm right here.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.369
-And I know a lot has happened--
-No.

32:34.994 --> 32:36.037
No.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.789
Juliette's in Paris.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.083
With a friend.

32:42.293 --> 32:44.253
She expects me home tomorrow.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.716
If I could make it home to my daughter...?

32:48.800 --> 32:50.927
Why would you ask me that?

32:51.010 --> 32:52.178
You killed Ryan!

32:52.261 --> 32:54.263
He took your child!

32:54.347 --> 32:55.807
And your wife?!

32:57.141 --> 32:59.811
If you're standing here,
Love didn't kill you.

32:59.894 --> 33:02.271
You killed her, didn't you?

33:05.191 --> 33:07.110
Tell me there haven't been more.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.199
Oh, my God.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.619
You act like it's not true.

33:16.703 --> 33:19.497
Like you're just a good man
who did a bad thing.

33:23.876 --> 33:26.087
You're a murderer, Joe.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.549
You're wrong about me.

33:29.632 --> 33:32.010
I wish. I wish I was, but--

33:32.093 --> 33:34.554
You know what? I'm gonna prove it to you.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.106
Goodbye, Marienne.

34:05.168 --> 34:08.087
<i>You looked at me with so much fear.</i>

34:08.713 --> 34:10.006
<i>I couldn't stand it.</i>

34:10.715 --> 34:12.967
<i>I let you go to prove to you</i>
<i>I'm not that man.</i>

34:13.051 --> 34:15.136
<i>I would never hurt you.</i>

34:25.688 --> 34:27.315
<i>Just a stranger in a strange land</i>

34:27.398 --> 34:29.692
<i>looking for someplace remote</i>
<i>to dispose of Malcolm.</i>

34:29.776 --> 34:33.571
<i>A sawmill sounds promising.</i>
<i>Here's hoping it's closed.</i>

34:41.496 --> 34:45.583
<i>If I get caught with this blowhard,</i>
<i>it would be poetic justice.</i>

34:57.720 --> 35:00.264
<i>Luckily, they have many of</i>
<i>the same common workshop tools here</i>

35:00.348 --> 35:01.766
<i>as they do back in the States.</i>

35:05.269 --> 35:06.979
Yeah, got a score on Putnam.

35:07.772 --> 35:09.982
Sneaking out to the pub now
for the second half.

35:15.196 --> 35:18.032
<i>Looks like I have</i>
<i>half a soccer game to do this.</i>

35:18.116 --> 35:20.034
<i>Yes, I know that's not what they call it.</i>

35:43.099 --> 35:46.602
<i>A Prince Albert. He wasn't lying</i>
<i>about being royal adjacent.</i>

35:56.028 --> 35:59.157
<i>I thought I left this behind</i>
<i>with a meat grinder and an oven.</i>

36:17.884 --> 36:19.343
<i>Goal!</i>

36:37.737 --> 36:41.657
<i>A drive around the Greater London area</i>
<i>to dump body parts in sewage pipes</i>

36:41.741 --> 36:44.869
<i>and the River Thames</i>
<i>is not how I planned to sightsee.</i>

36:44.952 --> 36:47.205
<i>So much for Jonathan doing better.</i>

36:48.873 --> 36:51.417
<i>Not that I planned to become Jonathan</i>

36:51.500 --> 36:52.877
<i>after I let you go.</i>

36:52.960 --> 36:57.673
<i>My only plan was to drown my heartache</i>
<i>and get the hell out of London.</i>

36:57.757 --> 36:59.300
Joe Quinn Goldberg.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.638
Thought you'd be more, um, I don't know...

37:05.097 --> 37:05.932
dead?

37:07.141 --> 37:10.061
<i>But then my past caught up.</i>

37:10.144 --> 37:11.229
Elliot Tannenberg.

37:11.729 --> 37:15.775
You know my employer, Ray Quinn,
your former father-in-law.

37:17.902 --> 37:20.154
So are you here to take me back?

37:20.238 --> 37:21.364
No, kill you.

37:25.409 --> 37:26.244
Thank you.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.374
Yeah, long day.

37:34.335 --> 37:36.629
<i>Then Elliot surprised me.</i>

37:38.297 --> 37:39.548
If I'm honest...

37:42.260 --> 37:43.344
I'm tired.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.514
What I'd like is to...

37:47.348 --> 37:49.183
is be done, you know?

37:50.601 --> 37:52.186
Not hurt anyone anymore.

37:54.772 --> 37:55.815
Not even you.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.025
-Oh.
-Mm-hm.

37:58.859 --> 38:00.653
But that would be complicated.

38:02.863 --> 38:06.200
-In what way?
-It would cost more than Ray pays.

38:06.742 --> 38:09.245
Like all the money Love had
in that one account.

38:09.870 --> 38:11.455
You might not know she had that.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.085
Might just be a complete coincidence
that it got emptied out

38:16.168 --> 38:18.379
the very same day you were baked in a pie.

38:18.462 --> 38:19.630
So extortion?

38:19.714 --> 38:22.800
Kind of a pejorative way
to talk about me offering to help you.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.515
This is for you.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.521
You look like a Jonathan.

38:37.940 --> 38:40.901
He's solid, went to Columbia,
good credit score, work visa.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.029
You should be able
to get any job you want.

38:43.112 --> 38:46.449
You just keep a low profile,
don't get into any shit.

38:46.532 --> 38:48.409
Just disappear.

38:49.368 --> 38:50.536
Be Jonathan.

38:51.287 --> 38:54.790
I'll assure Ray you're dead
and then fuck off into the sunset.

38:55.458 --> 38:59.503
Jonathan could be your chance too,
to make some different choices.

39:11.766 --> 39:15.353
Last thing, the girl that you follow,
Marienne Bellamy?

39:15.936 --> 39:17.313
She knows you're alive.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.191
So look.

39:21.692 --> 39:24.320
She's on the 8 a.m. train, to Paris.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.656
-Unless you stop her.
-But you just said this is...

39:28.741 --> 39:30.659
my opportunity to make different choices.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.703
Neither of us wanna hurt anybody.

39:34.163 --> 39:34.997
Yeah.

39:35.831 --> 39:36.665
So...

39:38.292 --> 39:41.837
go on there, take care of it,
walk out Jonathan Moore.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.011
Text me when it's done.

39:59.647 --> 40:02.566
<i>And I was alone in a strange city.</i>

40:03.275 --> 40:04.985
<i>Just me and my broken heart.</i>

40:05.069 --> 40:07.780
<i>I don't know what I was thinking</i>
<i>when I killed Malcolm. It's all black.</i>

40:07.863 --> 40:10.866
<i>-I just know I failed.</i>

40:11.784 --> 40:13.786
<i>You were right, Marienne.</i>

40:22.253 --> 40:24.755
Hi. I think this belongs to Adam Pratt.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.550
-Sure. I'll leave it for him.
-Yeah. Thank you.

40:37.143 --> 40:40.479
Hey. Hi. You're back from Berlin already.

40:40.563 --> 40:42.398
You're in Europe now, Jonathan.

40:42.481 --> 40:44.483
You can get anywhere
you want in three hours.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.694
How did the night turn out?

40:49.363 --> 40:50.197
Ah...

40:52.491 --> 40:54.034
They're party animals.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.662
Things tend to get out of hand.

40:57.621 --> 41:00.666
I wouldn't beat yourself up
if you made some sort of cock-up.

41:07.298 --> 41:11.802
You know, the day that you decided
to try to go to Oxford,

41:11.886 --> 41:13.721
you called it becoming newborn.

41:14.763 --> 41:16.557
Most people refer to that part of the book

41:16.640 --> 41:19.852
as when Mum died
while I was in prison for a bar fight.

41:21.270 --> 41:26.025
"Heartbreak is always the catalyst
for a new path," as you wrote.

41:26.650 --> 41:27.735
And this is yours?

41:27.818 --> 41:29.195
It was supposed to be.

41:32.156 --> 41:33.908
Honestly, I really need it to be.

41:36.076 --> 41:37.203
But you fucked up.

41:38.037 --> 41:39.872
Very, very badly, yeah.

41:43.042 --> 41:45.961
Would it help you to know that
that part of the book is a lie?

41:46.045 --> 41:49.173
I had that prison epiphany
three separate times.

41:50.132 --> 41:53.552
I kept turning around, getting trollied,
and punching people again.

41:54.053 --> 41:57.973
In my defense, writing it that way
would have been hopelessly redundant.

42:05.147 --> 42:06.857
I get a sense about you.

42:06.941 --> 42:08.192
What's that?

42:08.859 --> 42:10.194
All jokes aside,

42:11.237 --> 42:15.866
my guess is that you have had
a truly hellish life.

42:19.328 --> 42:22.748
The kind that not everyone survives.

42:24.625 --> 42:25.626
Am I close?

42:27.878 --> 42:31.006
-Yeah.
-So you're fairly deeply damaged.

42:31.090 --> 42:35.553
Therefore, you're capable
of doing real damage.

42:38.347 --> 42:41.559
I feel like I'm supposed
to be defensive right now, but I'm...

42:43.852 --> 42:44.853
I'm not.

42:44.937 --> 42:46.647
Who would I be to judge you?

42:49.358 --> 42:50.901
Okay. So, what now?

42:51.902 --> 42:54.613
Can't erase any of it,
so now I just try to do

42:54.697 --> 42:56.949
a bit of good moving forward,
just something,

42:57.032 --> 42:59.743
which includes protecting
the people that I love,

42:59.827 --> 43:02.162
getting some actual shit done
for the city of London.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.081
So you believe it's possible?

43:07.126 --> 43:07.960
Redemption?

43:09.295 --> 43:10.504
I think yes.

43:11.547 --> 43:14.049
As long as they commit
to never run from themselves.

43:14.717 --> 43:16.385
Face it all, no matter what.

43:18.971 --> 43:19.805
Easy, right?

43:24.435 --> 43:27.688
-You think I'm full of it.
-I think you're a writer.

43:32.401 --> 43:34.862
You gonna sit here,
perseverating on that cock-up?

43:39.033 --> 43:40.743
Embrace everything, Jonathan.

43:43.037 --> 43:44.455
The hangover's easier.

43:45.372 --> 43:46.915
<i>Sounds great.</i>

43:46.999 --> 43:50.461
<i>But there are things I've done</i>
<i>that I don't know if I can ever embrace.</i>

43:53.422 --> 43:58.010
<i> Passengers continuing on</i>
<i>to Nice, Cannes and Marseille,</i>

43:58.093 --> 44:01.680
<i>please ensure that you travel</i>
<i>in one of the rear compartments.</i>

44:01.764 --> 44:02.598
<i>Thank you.</i>

44:11.273 --> 44:12.733
Excuse me. Sorry.

44:12.816 --> 44:15.527
-Let me help you.
-Thank you.

44:40.010 --> 44:43.806
<i>You thought it was a pickpocket,</i>
<i>but it was me saving you.</i>

44:43.889 --> 44:46.433
<i>I was putting you on that train.</i>

44:48.686 --> 44:50.187
<i>I let you go.</i>

44:50.979 --> 44:54.149
<i>To show you I'm not what you think.</i>

44:55.526 --> 44:56.652
<i>I'm not a killer.</i>

45:08.747 --> 45:10.416
<i>To try to make that true.</i>

45:12.793 --> 45:15.254
<i>But it wasn't. And, of course.</i>

45:15.337 --> 45:16.505
Oh...

45:16.588 --> 45:18.590
Good. Perfect, you.

45:19.675 --> 45:22.302
Are you surprised I can read?
Why are you staring at them?

45:22.386 --> 45:25.055
-I'm curious what you like.
-They're for work.

45:25.139 --> 45:28.100
Feel free to deduce I like art,
Mr. Holmes.

45:29.977 --> 45:31.061
Uh--

45:31.145 --> 45:34.648
You left Sundry House with Malcolm,
the other night, didn't you?

45:35.315 --> 45:38.152
Have you seen him today?
He wasn't in his office.

45:38.235 --> 45:40.904
No. No, I haven't. Please thank him for me

45:40.988 --> 45:44.950
-for helping me into my apartment. I was--
-Pissed. Yes, we all saw.

45:45.826 --> 45:48.745
He must be at the house in Surrey,
writing poetry.

45:48.829 --> 45:51.039
Not a poetry fan. Okay, noted.

45:53.083 --> 45:56.128
I actually did need
to ask you something important.

45:56.211 --> 45:58.755
<i>-This can't be good.</i>
-Come to dinner tonight.

45:58.839 --> 46:00.966
<i>-Wait, what?</i>
-A little soiree for Simon.

46:01.049 --> 46:03.385
Well, I can't. I have papers to grade.

46:03.469 --> 46:06.472
Oh, God, you Americans
and your fetish for work.

46:06.555 --> 46:09.183
This is England. We have dinner here.

46:10.017 --> 46:11.477
Phoebe insisted I invited you.

46:11.560 --> 46:14.021
I don't know what you said to her,
but she's obsessed with you.

46:14.104 --> 46:15.564
<i>Don't know either, but--</i>

46:15.647 --> 46:18.275
Oi! Where did you go?

46:19.276 --> 46:21.069
You've been summoned, so--

46:21.153 --> 46:24.406
Americans don't do very well
with summoning either.

46:24.490 --> 46:27.493
Fine. Please come for dinner.

46:28.035 --> 46:30.913
Oh, God. Look, trust is earned.

46:31.580 --> 46:34.208
And when it comes
to randos sniffing around my friends,

46:34.291 --> 46:37.753
maybe you do want nothing,
but I won't pretend it isn't suspect.

46:37.836 --> 46:40.839
And not only do I not care
if you think I'm a bitch,

46:40.923 --> 46:43.008
I hugely prefer it.

46:43.091 --> 46:44.801
<i>Am I horrified or impressed?</i>

46:44.885 --> 46:47.054
So just say yes, or Phoebe will cry,

46:47.137 --> 46:50.057
and I'll make sure
it's in front of the paparazzi,

46:50.140 --> 46:51.391
and all of London will know

46:51.475 --> 46:53.769
-and revile your face.
<i>-Checkmate.</i>

46:53.852 --> 46:57.439
-Well then, I'd love to come.
-Love? That escalated quickly.

46:59.733 --> 47:01.443
Oh, and we're even.

47:02.110 --> 47:03.403
For my life.

47:03.487 --> 47:06.114
I told the police
I didn't see who saved me.

47:06.198 --> 47:09.785
Though I sensed his work papers
were in perfect order.

47:10.369 --> 47:11.411
You're welcome.

47:28.512 --> 47:31.807
Professor Moore.
A pleasure to have you with us again.

47:32.683 --> 47:34.726
The private event
is in the Paris social room.

47:35.269 --> 47:37.813
<i>Go in, act normal, so I'm not</i>
<i>the guy who hung out one night</i>

47:37.896 --> 47:40.399
<i>that they'll realize happens to be</i>
<i>the night Malcolm disappeared.</i>

47:44.570 --> 47:46.738
<i>Evanesce? I know this app.</i>

47:46.822 --> 47:50.117
<i>It's one of those high security chat apps</i>
<i>that erases everything you say.</i>

47:50.200 --> 47:52.035
<i>How did I get this on my phone?</i>

47:52.911 --> 47:56.081
<i>"Hello, you"? Who is this?</i>

47:56.164 --> 47:59.876
<i>"You surprised me,</i>
<i>handling Malcolm like that."</i>

48:00.669 --> 48:01.878
<i>What the...?</i>

48:06.717 --> 48:08.760
<i>"Here I thought</i>
<i>when I left him on your table,</i>

48:08.844 --> 48:10.887
<i>you'd go down for my sins."</i>

48:10.971 --> 48:12.889
<i>-I didn't do it.</i>

48:12.973 --> 48:15.058
<i>"You're not who I figured you for."</i>

48:16.602 --> 48:18.937
-<i>"Who are you?"</i>

48:19.021 --> 48:20.439
<i>Who am I?</i>

48:20.522 --> 48:22.941
<i>Who are you?</i>

48:23.025 --> 48:24.067
<i>Someone...</i>

48:24.151 --> 48:26.528
Moore. Where's your family from?

48:26.612 --> 48:30.157
<i>-...one of them...</i>
-And who's this sad baby tarsier?

48:31.241 --> 48:33.702
<i>-...killed Malcolm...</i>
-Come back when one is dead.

48:33.785 --> 48:36.705
-Fuck off and die, Malcolm.
<i>-...planned to put it on me.</i>

48:36.788 --> 48:39.666
-You kill someone?
-What you are is your problem.

48:39.750 --> 48:42.002
<i>-And now...</i>
-Why are you here?

48:42.669 --> 48:44.463
<i>...they're texting me.</i>

48:45.047 --> 48:47.633
<i>Who are you?</i>

49:15.243 --> 49:17.412
<i>And what's your next move?</i>
