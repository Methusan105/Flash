00:18.560 --> 00:19.936
<i>Previously on</i> You:

00:20.020 --> 00:22.105
<i>Lady Phoebe's country house,</i>

00:22.188 --> 00:24.107
<i>all of us under one roof.</i>

00:24.190 --> 00:26.985
<i>What they don't know is they're bringing</i>
<i>the killer with them.</i>

00:27.068 --> 00:28.445
<i>One of them is you.</i>

00:29.654 --> 00:30.905
I'm a free spirit.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.282
I like to feel.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.784
Secrets make you feel
like you're living your life.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.369
I might propose to Phoebe.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.997
If I marry her, life gets easier.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.915
Deals have not panned out.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.835
I am running out of runway.

00:43.918 --> 00:46.129
<i>Roald doesn't just love her.</i>
<i>He's obsessed.</i>

00:46.212 --> 00:48.673
<i>Roald loves Kate.</i>
<i>Kate's with Malcolm. Malcolm ends up dead.</i>

00:48.757 --> 00:51.676
<i>Simon threatens Kate's career.</i>
<i>No more Simon.</i>

00:51.760 --> 00:54.304
<i>Roald has got motive and opportunity.</i>

00:54.387 --> 00:55.930
It's funny, this game.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.932
Every year, someone gets hurt.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.603
-Kate!

01:25.668 --> 01:27.670
<i>I've been here before.</i>

01:28.838 --> 01:30.256
<i>Of course this would happen.</i>

01:30.340 --> 01:34.427
<i>Of course this woman</i>
<i>I've somehow fallen in with would be you.</i>

01:34.511 --> 01:36.471
I don't know why I grabbed this.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.682
<i>Can the sight of a corpse</i>
<i>really still upset you?</i>

01:39.766 --> 01:40.975
<i>Or is this fun?</i>

01:43.520 --> 01:45.355
Can't have anyone else walk in.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.109
I just need to think.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.612
If you're the only person who heard,
we have a minute.

01:52.695 --> 01:56.116
<i>Everything you did,</i>
<i>up to and including what I see now,</i>

01:56.199 --> 01:58.910
<i>was seduction, was to manipulate me.</i>

02:00.411 --> 02:01.830
What was she doing in my room?

02:01.913 --> 02:05.625
Did she just wander in here drunk
and then just get herself...?

02:08.670 --> 02:11.965
You... You don't think I did this?

02:12.048 --> 02:13.049
Oh, Jesus Christ.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.385
Lifetime of training
and being the one person

02:15.468 --> 02:19.013
who doesn't fall to pieces
in an emergency, and now I look...

02:23.017 --> 02:24.602
I am not a murderer.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.230
<i>Convincing but you've been convincing.</i>

02:27.313 --> 02:28.773
<i>It's all been a game.</i>

02:29.399 --> 02:32.777
Why are you worried about others coming?
Why aren't you calling for help?

02:32.861 --> 02:35.864
I can't call for help.
That would involve security.

02:39.242 --> 02:43.246
They are my father's, Jonathan.
I told you what kind of man he is.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.207
You make him sound like someone
who could take care of this.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.458
This?

02:47.542 --> 02:48.668
This...

02:48.751 --> 02:52.005
My friend who has been killed.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.923
You have to be joking. He--

02:55.300 --> 02:58.303
He would own me, and that is worse than...

03:06.936 --> 03:10.315
You know, this situation doesn't
look good for you either.

03:10.398 --> 03:11.774
<i>And there it is.</i>

03:11.858 --> 03:13.067
<i>The threat.</i>

03:13.151 --> 03:15.069
You heard what they were saying.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.654
Pointing fingers at you.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.532
<i>Roundabout way of asking</i>
<i>to help hide this body.</i>

03:19.616 --> 03:20.450
Yeah.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.702
<i>Play along it is, for the moment.</i>

03:27.957 --> 03:29.834
Okay. I think I have an idea.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.338
-You do?
-Yeah, I work well under pressure.

03:33.421 --> 03:34.714
One thing.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.507
If we do this...

03:38.134 --> 03:41.179
once we start, we have to see it through.

03:42.513 --> 03:43.598
Together.

03:43.681 --> 03:46.809
As in, I don't seize
the first opportune moment I have

03:46.893 --> 03:48.519
to pin it on you.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.855
And I don't abandon you either.

03:53.858 --> 03:54.692
Fine.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.328
<i>And once I confirm it's really you,</i>

04:06.287 --> 04:08.373
<i>I can do what needs to be done.</i>

04:29.727 --> 04:31.479
Sir, can I get you anything?

04:33.940 --> 04:36.150
Seen Jonathan Moore since dinner?

04:36.234 --> 04:38.987
He was going up to his room.
He seemed a bit, uh...

04:39.487 --> 04:40.321
wobbly.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.865
Might've been too much for him.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.078
Do let me know if and when he emerges.

04:48.246 --> 04:51.374
I'd like a private word with him
before he rejoins the group.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.042
Certainly, sir.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.105
Oh, my fucking life.

05:19.986 --> 05:20.987
Rude!

05:23.698 --> 05:25.742
You all right, mate?

05:25.825 --> 05:27.035
Perfect.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.703
I am perfect!

05:28.786 --> 05:30.496
Everything is perfect, right?

05:30.580 --> 05:31.998
I'm gonna start a new business.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.250
-I'm gonna leverage Sundry House.
-Adam.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.085
Know what your problem is?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.421
You seem to want to work.

05:38.504 --> 05:42.925
Our forebears didn't pretend to earn
what was rightly theirs.

05:43.009 --> 05:46.095
They were on another level.
Above work, above law.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.682
Hell, in the good old days,
the aristocracy were the law.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.018
Indeed. Fuck democracy.

05:52.101 --> 05:53.686
-Fuck democracy!
-Fuck democracy!

05:53.770 --> 05:55.146
No offense, Adam.

05:55.229 --> 05:56.939
I know you Americans love that shit.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.816
No. We love money.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.320
If we weren't handcuffed
by the will of the people,

06:02.403 --> 06:06.574
we could round up all of London,
draw and quarter every tenth man,

06:06.657 --> 06:10.453
and demand answers until someone
gave up the Eat The Rich Killer.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.623
-We'd catch the bastard in days.
-And we wouldn't have to cower

06:13.706 --> 06:15.166
in the country.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.959
Oh, no, I like the country.

06:17.835 --> 06:19.504
We're in control out here.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.173
Cheers.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.551
Oh, my God. That--

06:35.478 --> 06:37.605
Fuck.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.649
Toss the dagger in too.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.740
Yeah, good thinking.

06:49.909 --> 06:50.827
Now what?

06:50.910 --> 06:55.289
<i>Like I'm the one driving this.</i>
<i>Your entire performance is BAFTA-worthy.</i>

06:55.373 --> 06:58.292
We hide her while we figure it out.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.378
Somewhere low-traffic.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.463
Won't be discovered for a while.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.298
The game larder.

07:04.882 --> 07:07.343
It's where the staff break down
the animals from the hunt.

07:07.426 --> 07:08.678
<i>You've done your homework.</i>

07:08.761 --> 07:09.929
Okay, great.

07:10.012 --> 07:12.265
So we get the body to the game larder,

07:12.348 --> 07:15.601
grab cleaning supplies, and put this room
back together before anybody sees.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.524
Oh, Gemma, you were an absolute muppet,
but you didn't deserve this.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.608
I'm sorry.

07:23.192 --> 07:25.528
-Kate?

07:26.195 --> 07:27.613
Kate?

07:27.697 --> 07:30.116
I'm unlocking the door, darling.

07:30.199 --> 07:31.409
Stow your tits.

07:32.493 --> 07:33.578
Sorry.

07:33.661 --> 07:36.289
Sorry, but I need you
and have no time for boundaries,

07:36.372 --> 07:39.041
which is, of course,
why you love me, so...

07:40.126 --> 07:41.127
Jonathan.

07:41.919 --> 07:42.795
Good.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.095
I caught Adam with a servant.

07:53.723 --> 07:57.059
They were talking, but I can't shake
the energy between them.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.896
-We could talk later--
-I don't care if they're shagging.

07:59.979 --> 08:00.897
Truly.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.941
Copulating with the help is a grand
tradition among people of our status.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.860
It's not a gender thing either.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.279
His pansexuality is part of his charm.

08:08.779 --> 08:11.491
But the way he was looking at him,
why do I get this awful feeling

08:11.574 --> 08:13.743
that Adam's hiding
a piece of his heart from me?

08:13.826 --> 08:14.660
Because he is.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.705
<i>Sorry, Adam, we need her out.</i>

08:17.788 --> 08:21.918
I think there might be some things
he's embarrassed to tell you about.

08:22.001 --> 08:25.171
Nothing he should be ashamed of,
of course. Just...

08:28.758 --> 08:29.717
A kink?

08:29.800 --> 08:31.677
<i>Bingo. Thank you. Go now.</i>

08:33.012 --> 08:34.764
Tell me more. What is it?

08:36.098 --> 08:37.850
Phoebs, I adore you,

08:37.934 --> 08:41.354
but you need to leave
so that Jonathan and I can fuck.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.191
Oh.

08:45.942 --> 08:46.984
Silly me.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.611
Yeah, of course.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.446
Right.

08:50.530 --> 08:54.033
I'm off to find my other half
and spank his little booty.

08:54.116 --> 08:54.992
Wish me luck.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.090
Okay, one, two, three.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.555
Antique piece of shit.

09:15.638 --> 09:16.472
Fuck!

09:17.598 --> 09:19.225
Do you have another idea?

09:26.774 --> 09:28.609
<i>Thank you, Roald.</i>

09:28.693 --> 09:31.028
Originally, I was gonna do it
on the Riviera, right?

09:31.112 --> 09:33.823
But I feel like now,
now is the right time.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.116
Just elope.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.326
Do it seat-of-our-pants, romantic as fuck.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.705
We'll tell the family after, right?
Carpe fucking diem.

09:59.932 --> 10:03.436
It wasn't as heavy
as I expected her body to be.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.399
It's easier with two people, I suppose.

10:08.482 --> 10:09.859
<i>Why is this my pattern?</i>

10:09.942 --> 10:12.403
<i>Fall for a woman, haul corpses together.</i>

10:12.486 --> 10:15.114
<i>I think I need to go back to therapy.</i>

10:15.197 --> 10:17.408
How are you this good at hiding bodies?

10:17.491 --> 10:18.868
Who are you really?

10:18.951 --> 10:20.328
Easy. Put it down--

10:20.411 --> 10:21.996
-Did you kill Gemma?
-What?

10:22.079 --> 10:23.372
Is your plan to kill me too

10:23.456 --> 10:25.124
after manipulating me
into hiding her body?

10:25.207 --> 10:28.419
You really believe that I wanna kill you
after what I just did for you?

10:29.086 --> 10:33.591
What you just did is exactly
what a killer would do.

10:33.674 --> 10:36.135
When I found you with Gemma, I knew

10:36.218 --> 10:38.346
either you killed her

10:38.429 --> 10:41.641
or someone is trying to frame you.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.018
-Frame me?
-Yes.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.896
-Why would--?
-The same thing happened to me.

10:49.023 --> 10:49.857
With Malcolm.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.150
Oh, fuck off.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.694
The morning after my first night
at Sundry House,

10:53.778 --> 10:56.781
I woke up and I found Malcolm...

10:57.573 --> 11:00.242
on my table with a knife in his chest.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.245
-Stop!
-I'm truly sorry, but I got scared.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.040
I knew there was no way
anyone would believe I didn't do it.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.625
So I took care of it.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.252
You took care of it?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.171
Please don't make me relive the details.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.173
I've been trying
to forget them ever since.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.717
Why didn't you say anything?

11:16.801 --> 11:19.470
Because whoever did this
has been sending me messages.

11:20.930 --> 11:24.475
Threats to ensure my continued silence.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.727
They figured out I have a past.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.105
I was married once.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.526
To a woman who was rich and spoiled.

11:33.609 --> 11:36.654
She did very bad things
and I stuck it out with her for too long.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.281
For, I don't know...

11:41.200 --> 11:42.201
family...

11:42.868 --> 11:43.869
loyalty.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.206
But in the end...

11:47.998 --> 11:49.417
I had to run away.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.379
And it cost me...

11:55.506 --> 11:56.549
my son.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.186
Sorry.

12:10.729 --> 12:12.481
What's his name, your son?

12:17.611 --> 12:19.196
I'd rather not say.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.282
All I want is to start over.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.827
But this killer won't let me go.

12:24.910 --> 12:28.664
So I thought if I could stay close enough
to you and your friends, maybe I could...

12:29.832 --> 12:31.917
keep more people from getting hurt.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.462
A lot of good that's done.

12:34.545 --> 12:35.546
So you were...

12:36.213 --> 12:37.840
trying to protect me?

12:43.345 --> 12:44.513
I believe you.

12:47.349 --> 12:48.517
Do you believe me?

12:50.019 --> 12:51.020
I think so.

12:54.523 --> 12:55.858
<i>And if you're not her,</i>

12:55.941 --> 12:58.694
<i>Roald is one clever, little motherfucker.</i>

13:02.740 --> 13:04.408
What's this about, darling?

13:05.159 --> 13:07.203
I saw you with the servant boy.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.248
Let me stop you right there.

13:11.332 --> 13:15.169
-It was a dumb onetime fling--
-I know you're hiding a kink.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.589
Jonathan told me.

13:19.715 --> 13:22.176
-Jonathan? How would he know--?
-Don't be annoyed.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.386
He wants us to be happy, darling.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.056
Adam, life partners must share
everything with each other.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.599
Same page completely.

13:28.682 --> 13:29.808
So, what is it?

13:30.351 --> 13:31.936
-Hmm?
-Shall I peg you?

13:33.938 --> 13:35.439
Uh, sure.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.608
That's not it, is it?

13:38.567 --> 13:40.319
-Feet?
-No.

13:40.402 --> 13:41.737
Cake sitting?

13:41.820 --> 13:44.406
It's not that weird
falling-down-the-stairs fetish?

13:44.490 --> 13:46.534
-No.
-Sorry. It's not weird. Um...

13:47.451 --> 13:48.619
Golden showers?

13:52.957 --> 13:55.960
May I ask why this appeals?

13:59.255 --> 14:00.548
I don't know.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.718
All right, get on the floor.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.930
Do you know what?
I've hydrated quite a lot today.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.223
So kismet, really.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.101
You sure you don't wanna
just move on to pegging?

14:12.184 --> 14:16.313
-It's great. It might be better, actually.
-Don't be embarrassed.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.607
Shame has no place in the boudoir.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.611
-Shall I keep my clothes on or off?
-Up to you, darling.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.203
All right.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.414
Oh. Careful.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.916
Wait, wait, wait.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.837
Can you call me "sir"?

14:41.255 --> 14:42.840
May I wee on you, sir?

14:42.923 --> 14:43.924
Yeah!

14:44.008 --> 14:46.302
But can you be, like...

14:47.761 --> 14:49.847
forceful about it too?

14:50.764 --> 14:53.142
Um, yeah, yeah.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.977
I mean, I'm sorry.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.061
It's perfect.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.563
I love it.

14:57.646 --> 14:58.522
Do it.

14:58.606 --> 14:59.481
Okay.

15:00.524 --> 15:01.525
Mm.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.820
-Wait, what's wrong?
-Nothing.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.322
Open your eyes and look at me.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.490
I just-- I don't want it to burn.

15:09.491 --> 15:10.451
Go on.

15:10.534 --> 15:11.577
Piss on me.

15:15.623 --> 15:19.960
Phoeb. What's...? What's happening?

15:20.044 --> 15:21.503
You don't want this.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.088
What? Yes, I do.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.841
I was ready to piss on your face
to prove I'm enough for you,

15:25.925 --> 15:29.762
and you clearly don't want this
and you refuse to tell me why.

15:29.845 --> 15:33.515
Okay, it's just that
this doesn't really work with you.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.309
I knew it.

15:35.392 --> 15:36.268
It's not you.

15:36.352 --> 15:39.396
It's about the person being beneath me.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.857
But, then, at this moment...

15:42.566 --> 15:44.068
-they are--
-Above you.

15:47.237 --> 15:48.781
But it's not a big deal.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.909
You wanna do some pegging?
Let's do some pegging.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.410
It is a big deal, Adam.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.788
You think you're beneath me?

15:55.871 --> 15:59.416
No, Phoebs, you're overreacting.
I know we're equals. We're great together.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.795
Do you know where kinks come from?
The deepest parts of your mind.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.966
And the deepest part of you is telling us
exactly what we need to know.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.886
We aren't equals in this relationship.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.806
-We aren't true life partners.
-No. Slow down.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.599
We'd only end up hurting each other.

16:15.683 --> 16:19.353
We'd be married in misery and looking
outside for what we can't give each other.

16:19.436 --> 16:20.562
No, no, stop, stop.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.648
I...

16:23.524 --> 16:24.400
I love you.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.943
Baby, I love you.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.277
I love you.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.531
So for your sake...

16:31.949 --> 16:33.033
as well as mine...

16:33.701 --> 16:34.827
No.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.204
...it's over.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.122
What?

16:46.630 --> 16:47.464
Fuck.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.101
Just relax.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.185
You're bleeding.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.194
So out of curiosity...

17:10.195 --> 17:14.450
how does fucking me play into
your little secret-protector narrative?

17:15.451 --> 17:17.119
It wasn't part of the plan.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.456
And yet...

17:29.715 --> 17:31.592
We gotta get back upstairs.

17:33.802 --> 17:35.137
-Oh, no, no, no.
-What?

17:35.220 --> 17:36.638
Shit. My bracelet.

17:37.806 --> 17:40.559
It must have slipped off.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.354
What if it's in the larder?
It's got my name engraved on it.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.981
-That wouldn't be good.
-You think?

17:46.065 --> 17:48.650
Okay, get the supplies
back up to your room.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.527
I'll go back to the larder.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.697
Fine, hurry. But don't get caught.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.324
There's the young buck.

18:39.743 --> 18:44.748
I need whatever's the strongest thing
in this fucking place.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.333
And then,

18:46.416 --> 18:50.254
I need to kill a little snitch-ass spy
named Jonathan Moore.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.922
About time you came around.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.634
You know he's fucking Kate right now.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.681
So where are the other degenerates?

19:01.557 --> 19:03.350
In the drawing room, snogging.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.603
I saw Mr. Moore, sir.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.605
He was downstairs going outside.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.486
So Kate's alone upstairs.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.989
It's time to take back what's yours, man.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.242
Fuck Jonathan.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.414
Well, that explains the bloody carpet.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.498
So...

19:27.374 --> 19:29.501
Gemma is in the game larder?

19:29.585 --> 19:30.711
Temporarily.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.546
That feels karmic almost.

19:33.547 --> 19:36.884
You know she used to get her driver
to run over pheasants for fun?

19:36.967 --> 19:40.262
Now she's entombed with them.

19:41.471 --> 19:44.183
God, I'm just so relieved it wasn't you!

19:44.266 --> 19:46.226
I would die without you.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.979
Gemma's really more second-tier. I mean--

19:49.771 --> 19:51.064
I'm gutted.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.066
I really am. I don't mean to be flip.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.861
I just-- I took a bit of Ativan
after Adam--

19:55.944 --> 19:57.404
Later. Not the time.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.740
We should go down and warn everyone.

19:59.823 --> 20:00.908
Phoebs, listen.

20:02.826 --> 20:07.080
We will handle this
because we will do it properly

20:07.164 --> 20:09.708
and the same cannot be said
for the others.

20:10.584 --> 20:11.627
Do you agree?

20:13.795 --> 20:14.671
Yeah.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.884
You need to send the staff away.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.721
We don't want anyone else getting hurt
and we need privacy

20:22.804 --> 20:25.807
to deal with whatever's next
with the body.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.771
I don't understand why we aren't
bringing your father's security in.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.065
Are you kidding?

20:33.148 --> 20:35.901
I had to dodge them to get to the larder.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.654
But it's the only way
for us to be safe, Kate.

20:38.737 --> 20:42.658
Your dad needn't hear
how Gemma's not in your room now.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.827
She's just missing

20:45.911 --> 20:47.788
and we're simply all concerned.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.457
So they ought to closely guard us

20:50.540 --> 20:52.918
and be subtly made to stay away
from the game larder

20:53.001 --> 20:55.212
until we know
Jonathan isn't there anymore.

20:57.756 --> 20:58.757
You're right.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.302
-I'll go tell them.
-No, we.

21:02.970 --> 21:03.971
We will go.

21:04.763 --> 21:08.475
I need to be able to kill the murderer
with my bare teeth if they attack you.

21:11.144 --> 21:12.187
Do you know, I--?

21:14.398 --> 21:18.694
For a moment,
I really believed it was Jonathan.

21:19.194 --> 21:20.028
The killer.

21:20.862 --> 21:22.447
-Ironic.
-Yeah.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.449
I'm so glad you were wrong.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.202
And I'm so, so glad I'm on benzos.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.454
Yeah, me too.

21:41.174 --> 21:43.969
<i>Whoever you are,</i>
<i>you must be laughing right now.</i>

21:44.052 --> 21:44.886
Fuck!

21:48.932 --> 21:50.392
Stand up, Jonathan.

22:00.610 --> 22:01.445
Got you.

22:09.619 --> 22:12.956
Meet the Eat The Rich Killer.

22:15.709 --> 22:18.628
<i>They're all on a lot of drugs</i>
<i>after pulling an all-nighter.</i>

22:18.712 --> 22:21.631
<i>This could go in a number of ways</i>
<i>that aren't great for me.</i>

22:26.011 --> 22:27.262
Come off it, Roald.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.140
-Why do you have a gun in the house?
-I'm serious.

22:30.223 --> 22:32.309
The bastard killed Gemma.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.227
I found him in the game larder
with her body.

22:38.398 --> 22:40.233
Where's Phoebe?

22:40.317 --> 22:41.443
She's fine.

22:41.526 --> 22:42.736
She and Kate already know.

22:42.819 --> 22:45.322
They're sending the staff home
and mustering security.

22:45.405 --> 22:48.075
<i>Which you don't want.</i>
<i>You're taking matters into your hands</i>

22:48.158 --> 22:50.368
<i>because you've been Roald this whole time.</i>

22:50.452 --> 22:52.662
That's great. Let's get them in here.

22:52.746 --> 22:55.082
-They can vouch for me.
-Think about it.

22:55.165 --> 22:57.584
He shows up and our friends start dying.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.836
Consider this.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.090
Jonathan saves Kate from a mugging.

23:03.173 --> 23:07.260
He ingratiates himself to Malcolm,
who invites him into our circle,

23:07.344 --> 23:08.428
<i>gets drunk,</i>

23:08.970 --> 23:10.472
<i>Malcolm takes him home,</i>

23:10.555 --> 23:13.266
<i>and the minute</i>
<i>Jonathan's alone with him...</i>

23:16.686 --> 23:19.106
<i>he murders our dear friend in cold blood.</i>

23:19.189 --> 23:20.440
<i>I knew it.</i>

23:20.524 --> 23:23.026
-Fucking knew it.
-I was passed out!

23:23.610 --> 23:25.195
I couldn't have.

23:25.278 --> 23:26.780
What about you, Roald?

23:28.698 --> 23:29.866
He hated Malcolm.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.410
Jonathan, when you stabbed Malcolm,

23:32.494 --> 23:35.539
did he deflate like a hot-air balloon?

23:35.622 --> 23:40.210
Setting aside Blessing's pathological
inability to take anything seriously,

23:41.169 --> 23:42.629
I'm not finished.

23:42.712 --> 23:45.048
You'll be interested in this one, Sophie.

23:45.132 --> 23:48.468
After Simon's show,
all of us were at the party.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.304
Except for who?

23:53.682 --> 23:54.766
<i>Stop it, Roald.</i>

23:54.850 --> 23:57.060
I've heard enough.

23:58.979 --> 24:02.399
<i>You're one of them, so of course</i>
<i>they're believing you over me.</i>

24:02.482 --> 24:05.986
Sophie, I left the gallery
hours before with Kate.

24:06.069 --> 24:08.905
Roald was actually there.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.198
And Gemma?

24:11.575 --> 24:13.160
Think about what she said at dinner.

24:13.243 --> 24:16.746
<i>She'd put it all together.</i>
<i>The murders started when he came.</i>

24:22.002 --> 24:24.588
Kate? Sorry to interrupt.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.464
Just hiding out a moment.

24:27.799 --> 24:31.303
Jonathan, you absolute perv.
What are you doing here?

24:31.386 --> 24:34.264
This is ridiculous.
Why would I wanna kill them?

24:34.347 --> 24:37.225
Because you're obsessed with Kate.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.645
<i>Un-fucking-believable.</i>
<i>Framing me with your own motive.</i>

24:40.729 --> 24:44.441
I-- Roald, would you care
to show the room your camera?

24:44.524 --> 24:46.985
All of your creepy little photos of Kate?

24:47.611 --> 24:48.904
I'm an artist.

24:48.987 --> 24:52.991
Rather desperate to conflate that
with a dirty stalker like yourself.

24:53.575 --> 24:54.492
Oh.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.746
Care to see what I found in his pockets?

25:02.542 --> 25:04.085
-Is that Kate's?
-Come on, man--

25:04.169 --> 25:06.171
Oh, don't "man" me.

25:06.254 --> 25:08.298
You fuck. You're fake.

25:09.132 --> 25:11.927
Yeah, you're a fake,
and you're calculated, and you're nosy,

25:12.010 --> 25:14.554
and you sabotaged
my relationship with Phoebe.

25:14.638 --> 25:19.184
Remember what Connie said earlier
about the good old days? Con?

25:22.270 --> 25:24.814
Christ. Doesn't matter.

25:24.898 --> 25:28.193
We may not be judge, jury
and executioner anymore,

25:28.276 --> 25:30.862
but my uncle is a judge.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.573
Supreme Court Justice, in fact,

25:33.657 --> 25:36.284
and he loves me very much.

25:36.993 --> 25:43.458
If I happen to end the life of the man
that's been killing all my dear friends,

25:44.251 --> 25:47.921
-he'll make sure I get away.
-Listen to me. This is the truth.

25:48.004 --> 25:49.798
Kate can corroborate.

25:49.881 --> 25:52.550
She found Gemma's body

25:52.634 --> 25:56.596
in her room and she was afraid
that anyone might think it was her.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.265
So she asked me

25:59.307 --> 26:00.725
to help move it.

26:04.020 --> 26:05.397
This is insane.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.232
-Insane.
-I swear to you!

26:08.191 --> 26:10.944
-Roald has this wrong. Everything--
-Enough!

26:14.072 --> 26:17.575
By the power vested in me
by God and Empire,

26:17.659 --> 26:21.162
I hereby sentence you, Jonathan Moore,

26:22.163 --> 26:22.998
to death.

26:27.877 --> 26:29.337
You're not serious.

26:35.051 --> 26:37.846
Don't shoot him
in the drawing room, Roald.

26:38.513 --> 26:39.347
No.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.183
No, of course not.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.645
We always give the foxes
a chance in the hunt.

26:45.729 --> 26:46.563
Don't we?

26:48.148 --> 26:51.109
Would you like a head start, <i>monsieur?</i>

26:54.404 --> 26:58.533
Please be reasonable about this

26:58.616 --> 27:00.410
for just a second, Adam.

27:00.493 --> 27:04.789
-At least let Phoebe vouch for--
-Get her name out of your mouth.

27:04.873 --> 27:05.915
You murderer!

27:07.292 --> 27:08.209
Oh!

27:16.343 --> 27:17.594
<i>Oh, no.</i>

27:20.930 --> 27:21.931
Sit tight.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.434
I'm going peasant hunting.

27:45.038 --> 27:48.291
<i>How did I get here, hunted in</i>
<i>the countryside by a coked-up aristocrat?</i>

27:48.375 --> 27:52.045
The Crown<i> directed by Guy Ritchie.</i>
<i>Someone wake me up.</i>

27:53.338 --> 27:55.256
Here I come, Jonathan!

28:04.140 --> 28:08.061
Well, as I explained,
we've all had a long, sleepless night

28:08.144 --> 28:10.146
and we're all a bit on edge. Adam?

28:11.898 --> 28:13.900
Did you two not notice him on the floor?

28:13.983 --> 28:17.153
He's your boyfriend,
not our responsibility.

28:18.822 --> 28:21.741
Adam? Adam, wake up, darling.

28:23.827 --> 28:26.246
-Is he drunk or--?
-Sure. Annihilated.

28:26.329 --> 28:28.289
But also Jonathan attacked him.

28:29.290 --> 28:34.587
-Jonathan? Why would Jonathan attack him?
-Because he's the Eat The Rich Killer.

28:34.671 --> 28:38.633
Roald found him
with Gemma's body or something.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.887
-Where are they now?
-The woods.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.890
Roald's took a gun to kill him.

28:47.308 --> 28:50.145
Did any part of you think
that maybe you should step in?

28:52.230 --> 28:53.398
No.

28:53.481 --> 28:56.985
I say, off with his fucking head.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.111
Hear, hear.

28:59.654 --> 29:02.323
Go and find Roald
before someone gets hurt.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.242
Our job is to protect you.

29:04.325 --> 29:08.747
So you're going to cower in here with me
while Roald shoots people outside?

29:28.516 --> 29:29.559
Oh, Jonathan!

29:32.896 --> 29:36.983
Did you know English foxhounds rely solely
on their sense of smell during a hunt?

29:38.860 --> 29:41.696
I reckon I might have been
a hound in a past life

29:41.780 --> 29:44.157
'cause I can smell you now.

29:44.866 --> 29:48.369
That same peasant stench
I got a whiff of when we first met.

29:51.623 --> 29:55.251
Surely it's been frustrating
being in our company.

29:55.335 --> 29:58.171
A constant reminder of what you are.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.965
But killing us?

30:01.716 --> 30:03.927
Now that is low-class.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.277
<i>Scrappy son of a bitch.</i>

30:34.874 --> 30:36.251
Rhys.

30:39.629 --> 30:40.797
Hello, Joe.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.297
<i>The fuck?</i>

31:24.173 --> 31:27.302
<i>-Where the hell--?</i>
-Must be wondering where you are.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.514
The secret bowels of Hampsbridge House.

31:32.307 --> 31:35.143
There's no point shouting,
it's quite soundproof.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.481
Bit <i>Man in the Iron Mask,</i> isn't it?

31:42.567 --> 31:43.568
See,

31:44.611 --> 31:47.697
if you research the Borehall-Blaxworths,

31:48.281 --> 31:51.659
you'll find family members
who disappeared, children who--

31:52.535 --> 31:55.330
Well, they didn't fit the decor,
so to speak.

31:56.372 --> 31:59.334
It's quite possible
Lady Phoebe doesn't even know it exists.

31:59.417 --> 32:00.919
It's you.

32:03.171 --> 32:06.507
-It's been you.
-Apologies about the chains.

32:06.591 --> 32:10.345
I just-- I couldn't take any chances.

32:10.428 --> 32:13.723
It's very hard to predict
your moods sometimes.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.141
<i>I missed it.</i>

32:16.017 --> 32:19.187
<i>Man of the people on TV.</i>

32:19.270 --> 32:21.856
<i>To be that bold,</i>
<i>you have to be brilliant and know it.</i>

32:21.940 --> 32:23.232
I appreciate that.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.153
-Why?
-I don't mind getting into all of it.

32:27.820 --> 32:31.574
I'd have questions too.
It's just... I, honestly-- I--

32:33.409 --> 32:36.120
I wasn't prepared
for this type of face-to-face yet.

32:36.204 --> 32:39.958
But then you got yourself into a bind,
and it became clear that

32:40.041 --> 32:43.127
if I didn't intervene,
you were gonna get yourself killed.

32:43.211 --> 32:47.048
-So you're saving me?
-You're welcome. My pleasure.

32:47.715 --> 32:49.133
Is your head clear now?

32:49.634 --> 32:51.803
You ready for our plan, Joe?

32:56.641 --> 32:58.559
Roald has so many chemicals in his body,

32:58.643 --> 33:01.187
it's a miracle
he wasn't already blacked out.

33:02.647 --> 33:03.773
He's well asleep.

33:04.482 --> 33:07.110
And he's our plan, mate.

33:07.193 --> 33:10.863
We're gonna pin all the murders on him.

33:12.865 --> 33:15.076
-Pin?
-Don't be coy.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.536
I've studied you, Joe.

33:17.745 --> 33:19.914
The way you've been able
to escape scrutiny...

33:21.374 --> 33:26.004
Truly, you've been inspiring me so much
along the way in my little project.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.171
Project?

33:27.255 --> 33:29.549
And in light of what's worked
so well for you,

33:29.632 --> 33:32.176
it seems the best option
that doesn't rely on luck...

33:33.136 --> 33:38.433
involves framing a dead person
so they can't protest their innocence.

33:38.516 --> 33:39.851
So you want...?

33:40.685 --> 33:42.061
You want me...?

33:42.145 --> 33:43.521
To kill Roald, yes.

33:43.604 --> 33:46.941
And I'll take care of the other touches
that will make the story sing.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.276
I've got the note written.

33:50.778 --> 33:53.281
No one will be surprised
Roald is a killer.

33:54.073 --> 33:56.242
He's a neofascist with a knife collection.

33:56.325 --> 33:59.620
I mean, that camera,
all up-skirts of Kate.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.081
-I've seen it.
-It's obsessive, isn't it?

34:02.165 --> 34:03.624
Think of the positive.

34:04.834 --> 34:08.296
One less spoiled,
violent little shit on this Earth.

34:08.379 --> 34:11.758
<i>You really are</i>
<i>the Eat The Rich Killer. You hate them.</i>

34:11.841 --> 34:13.718
One less person on your back.

34:13.801 --> 34:15.553
One less romantic rival.

34:16.846 --> 34:19.640
<i>You have me all wrong,</i>
<i>but the only path I see out of this</i>

34:19.724 --> 34:21.976
<i>is to make you believe I'm in.</i>

34:22.060 --> 34:23.352
Thank you.

34:23.436 --> 34:25.354
For intervening.

34:25.438 --> 34:27.690
It was looking hairy and you're right.

34:29.484 --> 34:31.360
I've been so eager to meet you.

34:31.444 --> 34:34.489
I'm glad we're finally talking.

34:35.448 --> 34:37.158
So how are we gonna do this?

34:37.992 --> 34:39.368
Well, that's up to you.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.997
Strangle him, bash him over the head,
smother him.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.209
-How's that gonna look like a suicide?
-I'll handle that part too.

34:50.505 --> 34:51.714
Oh, hey, whoa!

34:52.340 --> 34:55.593
Wait, are--? I'm sorry.
Are you not gonna let me out?

34:55.676 --> 34:56.844
I'm not stupid.

34:58.846 --> 35:00.681
Be done by the time I get back.

35:07.563 --> 35:10.525
<i>Rhys Montrose.</i>

35:10.608 --> 35:13.152
<i>A good man in a cruel world.</i>

35:15.154 --> 35:18.825
<i>Disappointed doesn't even begin</i>
<i>to describe it.</i>

35:28.167 --> 35:31.546
<i>Too high for an unfashionable child</i>
<i>to escape</i>

35:31.629 --> 35:33.923
<i>or for a grown man in chains.</i>

35:40.346 --> 35:44.350
<i>Truth is, he deserves to die,</i>
<i>but that's what you want me to do.</i>

35:44.433 --> 35:46.894
<i>You fucked with me over and over.</i>

35:46.978 --> 35:48.354
<i>I'm not your puppet.</i>

35:49.105 --> 35:51.899
<i>I have to escape a dungeon</i>
<i>to save this asshole</i>

35:51.983 --> 35:53.651
<i>before the psycho gets back.</i>

35:54.360 --> 35:55.570
<i>Easy.</i>

36:09.792 --> 36:11.002
I'm going out there.

36:12.128 --> 36:14.839
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

36:14.922 --> 36:16.632
What if they're all dead?

36:16.716 --> 36:19.177
You're just walking out
into the arms of the killer.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.430
With the utmost respect,
Sophie, piss the fuck off.

36:23.097 --> 36:24.098
Wow.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.939
<i>It's got to be centuries old, right?</i>

36:34.192 --> 36:37.069
<i>Fucking excellent craftsmanship.</i>

36:44.994 --> 36:48.915
-I just thought it could be easier if I--
-Got free?

36:48.998 --> 36:51.334
Killing a man while chained to a pillar

36:52.376 --> 36:54.378
is an unreasonable ask, Rhys.

36:55.504 --> 36:57.215
I just need my hands free.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.675
I can see it in your face.

37:01.344 --> 37:04.096
I should've known
when you texted me about killing Vic.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.723
Exhilarating.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.851
And you were coming on far too strong.

37:11.646 --> 37:12.480
You lied...

37:13.147 --> 37:14.565
-to me.
-Hang on.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.943
You're in denial about yourself.

37:17.026 --> 37:19.862
-Roald didn't do anything.
-He's done plenty! They all have!

37:19.946 --> 37:22.865
-There's another way.
-My way is the only way and you know it.

37:28.037 --> 37:29.205
It's a shame.

37:29.288 --> 37:31.415
You're not the man I hoped you were.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.542
I did have a Plan A...

37:34.585 --> 37:35.962
before I knew who you were.

37:37.588 --> 37:40.341
-To frame you for Malcolm's murder.
-Rhys.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.510
I suppose I could go back.

37:42.593 --> 37:45.554
I don't want to,
but sometimes things just don't work out

37:45.638 --> 37:47.181
with the person the way you dream.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.392
If you're clever enough
to get yourself free,

37:49.475 --> 37:52.103
I'll see you back in London
and we can revisit this.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.730
Otherwise, goodbye, Joe.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.072
Rhys! Rhys!

38:14.250 --> 38:16.711
-Shh. You're okay. You're okay.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.463
What happened?

38:21.382 --> 38:22.508
It doesn't matter.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.804
All that matters is that you're all right.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.182
I love you, Phoebe.

38:31.767 --> 38:32.810
So much.

38:35.229 --> 38:36.230
I love you.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.276
I don't want to lose you ever.

38:40.359 --> 38:41.736
Does anyone else smell smoke?

38:47.700 --> 38:49.493
Oh, fuck.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.955
Wake Connie. Wake everyone.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.207
-Wake up!
-We need to get out now.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.170
Where are we going?

39:00.755 --> 39:02.298
<i>If I'm clever enough to get out.</i>

39:02.381 --> 39:05.551
<i>You left me to die in a fire</i>
<i>like some fucking Twitter troll.</i>

39:09.680 --> 39:11.265
What have you done to me?

39:12.350 --> 39:15.644
-How did we get in here?
-Now is not the time for questions, Roald!

39:25.404 --> 39:26.614
Thank God. Now me.

39:27.239 --> 39:28.115
Jonathan!

39:28.657 --> 39:30.201
Jonathan, don't leave me.

39:32.745 --> 39:35.998
<i>Fuck you, Roald.</i>
<i>An hour ago, he was hunting me.</i>

39:36.082 --> 39:37.541
Please.

39:43.089 --> 39:47.134
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Jonathan.
Wait, I'm sorry. I wasn't gonna--

39:47.843 --> 39:49.720
Hold still.

39:50.805 --> 39:54.975
<i>After everything, I'm not letting</i>
<i>you kill me with this smarmy prick.</i>

40:08.239 --> 40:10.950
-Help! Help! In here!
-Help! Help!

40:13.411 --> 40:14.245
Help!

40:23.587 --> 40:26.048
Grab on, you idiots.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.967
Fucking hell, am I glad to see you.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.734
You look like hell.

40:47.027 --> 40:50.489
Things took a turn since I saw you last.

40:53.742 --> 40:55.953
Come on. Get away from the house.

41:21.479 --> 41:24.899
<i>I thought this nightmare would be</i>
<i>over by the time I returned to London,</i>

41:24.982 --> 41:27.318
<i>but I suppose</i>
<i>I should be grateful to be alive.</i>

41:27.401 --> 41:29.153
<i>New details have emerged</i>

41:29.236 --> 41:31.614
<i>regarding this past week's</i>
<i>shocking events.</i>

41:31.697 --> 41:35.409
<i>The name of the so-called</i>
<i>Eat The Rich Killer's latest victim,</i>

41:35.493 --> 41:37.578
<i>Gemma Apollonia Graham-Greene...</i>

41:37.661 --> 41:39.955
<i>Barely got a half-assed apology</i>
<i>from the group.</i>

41:40.039 --> 41:43.125
<i>There's not much to say</i>
<i>after you extrajudicially sentenced</i>

41:43.209 --> 41:44.919
<i>an innocent man to death.</i>

41:45.002 --> 41:46.545
<i>At least they know I'm innocent.</i>

41:47.254 --> 41:52.051
<i>Gemma's body burned, along with the rest</i>
<i>of Hampsbridge House's fucked-up history.</i>

41:52.551 --> 41:54.845
<i>Police recovered just enough</i>
<i>to identify her.</i>

41:56.972 --> 42:00.142
<i>But I haven't heard a peep from you</i>
<i>since you said:</i>

42:00.809 --> 42:02.436
<i>"See you back in London."</i>

42:03.145 --> 42:04.980
<i>-Where do we go from here?</i>

42:05.064 --> 42:07.775
<i>As you said, the last</i>
<i>few days have gripped the nation,</i>

42:07.858 --> 42:09.902
<i>and now we have learned</i>
<i>the name of the victim</i>

42:09.985 --> 42:12.154
<i>of the latest grisly crime...</i>

42:24.875 --> 42:25.709
Hey.

42:28.879 --> 42:33.425
Since your things burnt up,
I figured you could use some new clothes.

42:33.509 --> 42:37.555
They're just things
Malcolm never even took the tag off of.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.223
Whatever fits.

42:39.306 --> 42:40.975
<i>A bit eerie, but hey...</i>

42:41.058 --> 42:43.602
That's very thoughtful of you. Thank you.

42:45.729 --> 42:48.691
Look, I was thinking. I've...

42:50.109 --> 42:54.697
I've never had someone go to
such great lengths to retrieve a bracelet.

42:55.447 --> 43:00.369
I owe you a pint or ten.

43:02.288 --> 43:03.872
Walk with me to the pub?

43:04.582 --> 43:06.834
<i>Is Kate Galvin trying to ask me out?</i>

43:06.917 --> 43:09.128
If you're not busy, I...

43:10.087 --> 43:12.381
I wouldn't hate the company.

43:12.464 --> 43:14.049
<i>But this is more than a beer.</i>

43:14.133 --> 43:17.136
<i>It's a door we both wanna walk through</i>
<i>and I can't.</i>

43:17.219 --> 43:19.138
<i>She knows too much about me as it is.</i>

43:19.221 --> 43:21.223
<i>It's dangerous for her to know anymore.</i>

43:21.307 --> 43:22.600
I wish I could.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.521
Seriously? It's...

43:29.648 --> 43:31.859
It's a pint, Jonathan.

43:32.776 --> 43:34.653
I think we both know it's not.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.990
And would that be so heinous?

43:38.073 --> 43:39.700
I don't wanna hurt you.

43:41.201 --> 43:43.287
You don't want to know the real me.

43:44.413 --> 43:46.749
Your past doesn't scare me.

43:48.500 --> 43:50.336
It can't be worse than mine.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.922
Jonathan, I know what I'm like.

43:54.006 --> 43:57.509
I don't let people in.
It simply isn't worth it.

43:59.511 --> 44:02.181
Except when it is.

44:04.683 --> 44:05.517
I can't.

44:06.769 --> 44:07.603
I'm sorry.

44:10.898 --> 44:12.900
Captain fucking America.

44:15.194 --> 44:17.571
<i>I've never met anyone like Kate Galvin.</i>

44:17.655 --> 44:20.616
<i>In another world, another life,</i>

44:21.408 --> 44:25.079
<i>I would run after her,</i>
<i>risk everything for her.</i>

44:26.664 --> 44:31.543
<i>But I can't because I'm already</i>
<i>in a relationship with you, Rhys.</i>

44:39.635 --> 44:41.887
<i>Many of the victims were</i>
<i>old friends of mine,</i>

44:41.970 --> 44:44.223
<i>people that I met in this classroom.</i>

44:44.306 --> 44:45.557
<i>It's a tragedy.</i>

44:45.641 --> 44:48.143
<i>This fascination</i>
<i>with the Eat The Rich Killer</i>

44:48.227 --> 44:51.188
<i>is a manifestation</i>
<i>of a larger populist anger</i>

44:51.271 --> 44:53.607
<i>of people who are sick and tired.</i>

44:53.691 --> 44:55.692
<i>You stand with a foot</i>
<i>in both worlds,</i>

44:55.776 --> 44:58.028
<i>the working class and the aristocracy,</i>

44:58.112 --> 45:02.324
<i>and none of them suspect that you're</i>
<i>a monster hiding in plain sight.</i>

45:02.408 --> 45:06.036
<i>My first day here at Oxford,</i>
<i>I sat in this very seat,</i>

45:06.120 --> 45:10.207
<i>and I thought a kid from a council estate</i>
<i>should never have been here.</i>

45:10.290 --> 45:15.170
<i>But I realize now, that unique experience</i>
<i>is what made me equipped</i>

45:15.254 --> 45:17.965
<i>to understand</i>
<i>what the great people of this city need.</i>

45:18.590 --> 45:22.511
<i>Change brought on</i>
<i>by someone who truly sees them.</i>

45:23.053 --> 45:25.180
<i>I plan to take matters into my own hands.</i>

45:25.264 --> 45:27.850
<i>By killing off the rich, one by one?</i>

45:29.476 --> 45:34.565
<i>And so it is with great pride,</i>
<i>but with greater humility,</i>

45:34.648 --> 45:40.070
<i>that I, Rhys Montrose,</i>
<i>officially announce my candidacy</i>

45:40.154 --> 45:41.905
<i>for the mayor of London.</i>

45:41.989 --> 45:45.492
-<i>You're actually doing this.</i>
<i>-I have big plans for this city.</i>

45:46.201 --> 45:48.454
<i>And if you give me your vote,</i>

45:49.288 --> 45:52.833
<i>I promise</i>
<i>you won't be sick and tired anymore.</i>

45:53.417 --> 45:56.128
<i>Whatever your big plans are,</i>
<i>I need to stop you</i>

45:56.211 --> 45:59.756
<i>before you can hurt another soul</i>
<i>and drag mine down with you.</i>

46:00.424 --> 46:03.427
<i>I know who you really are now, Rhys.</i>

46:04.428 --> 46:06.054
<i>And I'm coming for you.</i>
