00:18.017 --> 00:19.352
<i>Previously on</i> You:

00:19.352 --> 00:20.478
There's something here.

00:20.478 --> 00:23.732
- Then why are we wasting time?
-  <i>We've barely grazed the surface.</i>

00:23.732 --> 00:25.817
Surprise!

00:25.817 --> 00:27.110
We're engaged!

00:27.110 --> 00:28.027
You didn't.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.529
- What?
-  <i>When I followed you</i>

00:29.529 --> 00:32.365
<i>to the art fair in London,
I felt you, Marienne.</i>

00:32.365 --> 00:35.160
<i>The buttoned-up Madre Linda librarian
was gone.</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:36.619
Goodbye, Marienne.

00:39.414 --> 00:40.749
Look familiar?

00:40.749 --> 00:42.625
Found your old lover.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.711
Where is Marienne?

00:44.711 --> 00:46.963
I don't know anyone called Marienne.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.006
Tell me!

00:48.006 --> 00:49.466
Tell me where she is!

00:49.466 --> 00:51.009
He wasn't lying, Joe.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.302
He didn't know you.

00:52.302 --> 00:55.096
But then I wasn't lying either.

00:55.096 --> 00:58.767
We really do have Marienne in a cage.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.153
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

01:10.153 --> 01:12.781
<i>a nightingale and her little chick
shared a nest</i>

01:12.781 --> 01:15.825
<i>in a magical land called Paris, France.</i>

01:19.037 --> 01:21.039
It's not quite right yet.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.166
More shading to the beak.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.293
And more tail feathers.

01:25.293 --> 01:26.377
Okay.

01:26.377 --> 01:28.546
<i>They were so cozy in their little nest.</i>

01:29.547 --> 01:30.965
And bigger wings.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.383
Okay.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.302
Wait.

01:35.845 --> 01:36.846
Don't.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.390
She'll just fly away.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.435
Baby, she'll come back.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.270
Oh, baby.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.899
She loves her little chick too much
to be gone for long.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.193
Marienne, tea is on the table.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.653
I'll always come back.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.987
Okay? I promise.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.449
And you'll have fun with Beatrice.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.826
Thank you.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.788
It's just a couple of days.

02:01.788 --> 02:05.375
And when I get back
from the art fair, guess what.

02:05.375 --> 02:09.129
I'm gonna have so many new ideas
to draw with you.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.338
Yeah.

02:10.338 --> 02:13.842
<i>The nightingale and
little chick were so happy together.</i>

02:15.969 --> 02:19.556
I'm gonna dream about you
every night until I get back,

02:19.556 --> 02:21.474
right, little chickadee? Hmm?

02:21.474 --> 02:23.268
<i>They had everything they could dream of.</i>

02:27.772 --> 02:29.315
Good night, baby.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.745
- I love this.
- Thank you.

02:42.745 --> 02:43.913
- Beautiful.
- Thanks.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.623
<i>But one terrible day...</i>

02:48.418 --> 02:50.795
<i>the fox found the nightingale.</i>

02:53.423 --> 02:54.966
Watch where you're going!

02:54.966 --> 02:56.175
Bloody tourists!

02:56.175 --> 02:58.344
<i>She flew as fast
as her wings could go.</i>

03:01.514 --> 03:03.308
<i>But the fox was too quick.</i>

03:04.976 --> 03:07.353
Juliette expects me home tomorrow.

03:08.187 --> 03:10.398
Am I gonna make it home to my daughter?

03:14.736 --> 03:16.988
Goodbye, Marienne.

03:17.822 --> 03:20.074
<i>He surprised her
by letting her go.</i>

03:23.161 --> 03:24.495
<i>But foxes are sly.</i>

03:25.204 --> 03:26.331
<i>It was a trick.</i>

03:27.457 --> 03:30.877
- Excuse me. Pardon me.
- Let me help you. Here.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.337
Thank you.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.050
<i>He slipped a potion into her drink.</i>

03:52.815 --> 03:54.359
<i>The potion made her sleep.</i>

03:57.195 --> 03:58.613
<i>When she woke up...</i>

03:58.613 --> 04:00.782
<i>My name is Rhys Montrose.</i>

04:00.782 --> 04:02.575
<i>...she was somewhere strange.</i>

04:02.575 --> 04:05.495
<i>In honor of the paperback
of</i> A Good Man in a Cruel World,

04:05.495 --> 04:08.790
<i>I'm gonna take you to some
of my favorite haunts in London.</i>

04:08.790 --> 04:10.333
Good.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.542
You're awake.

04:20.843 --> 04:21.844
It's okay.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.471
It's okay.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.431
I'm so glad you're here...

04:28.101 --> 04:30.436
so we can give our relationship
another chance.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.346
Go ahead.

05:05.888 --> 05:07.181
You must be starving.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.101
And thirsty.

05:12.603 --> 05:15.231
<i>The nightingale knew
the fox was trying to trick her.</i>

05:18.026 --> 05:19.736
<i>But she was so thirsty.</i>

05:20.611 --> 05:22.947
<i>She couldn't help but drink the potion.</i>

05:28.328 --> 05:29.329
Thank you.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.169
Juliette loves Indian food.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.170
<i>She thought:</i>

05:37.170 --> 05:40.465
<i>"If I can say the right thing,
I can convince the fox to let me go."</i>

05:40.465 --> 05:42.884
<i>This booth is mine.</i>

05:42.884 --> 05:45.553
<i>If I catch any of you sitting in here,
we'll be having words.</i>

05:46.304 --> 05:47.889
<i>I'm joking, of course.</i>

05:47.889 --> 05:50.224
<i>My fighting days are over. Mostly.</i>

05:51.809 --> 05:54.437
<i>-But don't get on the wrong side of me.</i>
- Joe?

05:57.023 --> 05:58.858
I need to talk to my daughter.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.777
She'll be worried about me.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.117
I was supposed to be home days ago.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.579
<i>The thing about getting money
when you've never had it</i>

06:11.579 --> 06:14.832
<i>means you sort of never really feel
like you have it.</i>

06:15.917 --> 06:16.751
Joe?

06:20.713 --> 06:21.881
Joe.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.216
Don't ignore me.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.426
Joe Goldberg!

06:26.719 --> 06:29.138
<i>I am gonna show you some of my favorite--</i>

06:30.098 --> 06:33.059
Have you heard of this writer?
Rhys Montrose?

06:34.852 --> 06:36.020
Um...

06:36.938 --> 06:39.482
I think everyone in Europe
has heard of him.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.025
He's made some mistakes.

06:41.025 --> 06:43.277
He's done some bad things, but he changed.

06:43.861 --> 06:46.030
Now everybody wants him to run for mayor.

06:46.030 --> 06:48.449
I'm just saying he kind of inspires me.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.499
I need you to look at me.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.502
I just need to talk to my daughter.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.421
- I'm trying to fix--
- I need to speak to my daughter.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.882
I need to speak to my daughter. Help!

07:04.882 --> 07:07.468
- I am trying to-- There's no one around.
- Somebody help!

07:07.468 --> 07:09.595
- Please help me!
- Shh!

07:13.266 --> 07:14.142
Joe, please.

07:15.601 --> 07:19.522
The only thing
I've been trying to do is help you.

07:34.871 --> 07:38.458
 <i>The fox kept her there
all night and all the next day.</i>

07:48.301 --> 07:50.970
<i>The nightingale knew
the fox had something planned.</i>

07:52.054 --> 07:54.640
<i>It was her last chance to fly away.</i>

07:58.102 --> 08:02.106
Um, did you happen to get any naan?

08:06.819 --> 08:08.779
I did, yeah. Let me grab it.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.678
- Here.
- Thank you.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.356
<i>The nightingale pretended to sleep.</i>

08:47.443 --> 08:51.155
<i>She prayed the fox couldn't feel
how fast her heart was beating.</i>

09:01.832 --> 09:04.126
<i>She knew she had to stay calm.</i>

09:05.878 --> 09:07.213
Wake up, Marienne.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.051
<i>She had to trick the trickster.</i>

09:12.051 --> 09:13.594
Do you think you can stand?

09:17.265 --> 09:18.099
Here.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.937
Okay, we're gonna have to walk
the rest of the way.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.855
But I got you. Just be careful.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.109
<i>I was 25 years old...</i>

09:28.609 --> 09:32.029
<i>She heard the voice that
hypnotized him echoing below anew.</i>

09:32.029 --> 09:35.658
<i>He was taking her to his den
where birds cannot fly.</i>

09:35.658 --> 09:37.577
<i>This was her last chance.</i>

09:41.330 --> 09:44.625
<i>She had to pick just the right moment.</i>

09:44.625 --> 09:45.960
Just one more step.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.135
Okay.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.897
- I think it's broken.
- I would never hurt you.

10:06.897 --> 10:08.691
Need to get to my daughter.
Make this better.

10:08.691 --> 10:12.153
I'm trying to make this better!
Please don't make this harder! Please!

10:12.153 --> 10:14.905
No, please! Don't put me in there! Please!

10:18.451 --> 10:21.329
<i>He broke her wing
and locked her in a cage.</i>

10:22.330 --> 10:23.831
I didn't know you'd do this to me,

10:23.831 --> 10:26.834
that you'd hurt me
and take me away from Juliette.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.545
- I would never hurt Juliette.
- She's just a little girl, Joe.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.756
- She needs her mother.
- I'd never hurt Juliette.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.634
- If you do this, you're a monster!
- Quiet!

10:35.801 --> 10:38.721
<i>I was on the floor of my cell,
crying like a baby.</i>

10:38.721 --> 10:42.099
<i>My mother was dead
and it felt like I was dying...</i>

10:42.099 --> 10:45.353
-  This isn't me.
-  <i>The spell had grown stronger.</i>

10:45.353 --> 10:46.854
I would never hurt her.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.482
This isn't me.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.651
- Joe.
- I'm not that man.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.737
<i>His eyes were empty,
like no one was there.</i>

10:54.737 --> 10:57.406
<i>But I was determined
this wouldn't be the death of me.</i>

10:57.406 --> 10:58.658
This isn't me.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.202
<i>She tried to bring him back.</i>

11:01.202 --> 11:05.164
Joe, look at me.
If you keep me in here, I'll die.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.749
-  <i>In that moment...</i>
- She needs me.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.459
Think about Henry.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.252
<i>- ...I decided...</i>
- They need to be protected.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.671
Please, Joe.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.506
- Please.
<i>- ...to become newborn.</i>

11:21.389 --> 11:26.143
Joe, it's not too late, okay?
You can-- You can still let me out.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.355
Joe, please. Just let me out.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.816
<i>She knew the fox was in there somewhere.</i>

11:34.735 --> 11:35.903
Joe?

11:43.035 --> 11:44.036
I'm not Joe.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.334
Oh, my God.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.178
Joe, please!

12:01.804 --> 12:05.057
Please, no!
Don't leave me in here! Please!

12:31.542 --> 12:33.043
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

12:33.794 --> 12:36.464
the nightingale tried
to get back to Little Chick.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.301
She searched every corner of her cage

12:40.301 --> 12:43.053
<i>to find a flaw
that would allow her to escape.</i>

12:43.637 --> 12:47.349
<i>But the fox built the cage so well...</i>

12:48.767 --> 12:50.686
<i>he didn't make a single mistake.</i>

12:51.937 --> 12:53.731
Hello, Marienne.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.236
You're still not feeling chatty, I see.

12:59.236 --> 13:01.822
<i>The nightingale refused
to look at the fox.</i>

13:01.822 --> 13:04.074
<i>She didn't wanna give him
the satisfaction.</i>

13:04.074 --> 13:07.244
Maybe if you gave me a book or a pencil
or anything at all,

13:07.244 --> 13:09.246
maybe I'd feel like chatting.

13:10.956 --> 13:14.126
On the other hand,
I could stop bringing you food.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.586
How would that feel, princess?

13:15.586 --> 13:17.546
<i>The fox sounded different.</i>

13:17.546 --> 13:19.173
<i>She didn't know who he was now.</i>

13:19.173 --> 13:23.677
Ask me how my broken arm feels,
you heartless piece of shit!

13:32.520 --> 13:34.813
Oh, good. Saag paneer again.

13:45.282 --> 13:46.617
Oh, no.

13:46.617 --> 13:47.535
No.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.539
<i>The nightingale was in pain.</i>

13:51.539 --> 13:53.791
<i>She wanted to make the hurt go away.</i>

14:00.631 --> 14:03.968
Baby, I don't know what to do.
He's gonna break me.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.427
He's gonna win.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.596
- It's just medicine.
- It's bad for me.

14:07.596 --> 14:10.599
I'll relapse.
That's how I lost you before.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.768
He wants to keep us apart forever.

14:13.435 --> 14:14.478
Ow!

14:14.895 --> 14:16.355
He will not win.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.733
You're strong.

14:20.526 --> 14:21.777
Change the story.

14:24.780 --> 14:26.240
Okay, you're right.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.617
I think he's mad
because you're mean to him.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.540
Okay, new story.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.918
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

14:37.918 --> 14:40.629
<i>the nightingale decided to kill the fox</i>

14:40.629 --> 14:42.381
<i>with kindness.</i>

14:57.021 --> 14:58.397
Smells good.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.528
You're unusually grateful today.

15:09.491 --> 15:14.121
I know things aren't good between us now,

15:14.121 --> 15:15.289
but I mean...

15:16.457 --> 15:18.667
can't you remember when they were?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.754
You wanted us to be a family.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.089
You, me, Juliette, and Henry?

15:26.091 --> 15:27.885
It's not too late.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.430
That Joe I love is still in there.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.514
You just--

15:33.515 --> 15:35.184
You just got to let him out.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.422
I'm not Joe.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.883
I'm just keeping you here

16:07.883 --> 16:10.552

16:11.762 --> 16:13.013

Come on.

Please.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.495
Please.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.652
Once upon a time...

19:59.740 --> 20:03.160
the nightingale realized
that no more food would come.

20:07.372 --> 20:10.042
The fox had left her to starve to death.

20:21.094 --> 20:22.930
I hate you!

20:22.930 --> 20:25.724
You fucking hear me? I hate you!

20:25.724 --> 20:28.227
I hope you burn in hell, you mother--

21:00.884 --> 21:02.177
Your brain is shutting down.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.304
None of this is real.
This is a hallucination.

21:04.304 --> 21:05.639
It's not real, it's not real.

21:07.432 --> 21:08.267
<i>Mama.</i>

21:08.850 --> 21:10.060
<i>I need you.</i>

21:11.019 --> 21:12.271
Baby?

21:13.313 --> 21:14.398
Baby?

21:15.190 --> 21:16.233
Baby?

21:16.233 --> 21:17.734
Where are you, baby?

21:22.739 --> 21:23.865
Baby?

21:28.161 --> 21:29.288
Come back!

21:54.521 --> 21:57.107
<i>No. No, this isn't happening.</i>

22:01.528 --> 22:03.405
<i>I'm just having a moment.</i>

22:04.156 --> 22:05.324
<i>This is stress.</i>

22:05.324 --> 22:07.284
<i>The Eat The Rich Killer is dead, and I'm--</i>

22:07.284 --> 22:09.453
Sorry to interrupt.
I am interrupting, aren't I?

22:09.453 --> 22:12.080
You're staring straight ahead
and, I can only assume,

22:12.080 --> 22:14.666
spiraling about me and him.

22:14.666 --> 22:15.667
Understandable.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.712
He's not there.
I'm going crazy for a second.

22:18.712 --> 22:22.716
Uh, well, you've been going crazy
for quite a while.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.635
Ever since you broke Marienne's arm
and banged your head.

22:25.635 --> 22:28.680
Well, really,
ever since you kidnapped her,

22:28.680 --> 22:31.224
then tried to insist
on a relationship chat.

22:31.224 --> 22:34.227
Well, ever since you murdered your wife
and abandoned your son.

22:34.227 --> 22:36.938
This has been brewing for quite some time.

22:36.938 --> 22:39.191
I didn't touch Marienne.
I would remember that.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.110
You've got a body to bury.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.195
Chop-chop.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.451
<i>I'm in shock. That's all.</i>

22:49.451 --> 22:51.411
<i>I need to get my shit together.</i>

22:55.791 --> 22:58.585
<i>They say do anything enough
and you become an expert.</i>

22:58.585 --> 23:02.130
<i>Darcy College could pay me
to teach Body Disposal 101.</i>

23:05.592 --> 23:08.512
You haven't forgotten
about Marienne, have you?

23:14.267 --> 23:15.811
I just buried you.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.526
You're not real.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.571
We can do this all night.

23:26.571 --> 23:30.200
It's an awful waste of time, though,
especially for Marienne.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.328
I don't quite remember
when I fed her last.

23:33.328 --> 23:36.123
- What kind of sick trick is this?
- Is what? Me?

23:36.123 --> 23:37.415
Ask your brain.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.127
I emanated directly bloody from it.

23:40.127 --> 23:41.962
Here's the important bit.

23:41.962 --> 23:44.798
Marienne is really in a cage.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.091
Then tell me where she is.

23:46.091 --> 23:49.052
You already know where
because you and I are the same person.

23:49.052 --> 23:49.970
No!

23:51.596 --> 23:52.764
No.

23:55.058 --> 23:56.309
<i>Wait a second.</i>

24:00.814 --> 24:03.024
Spill. What does Lockwood claim he knows?

24:03.775 --> 24:04.985
I can prove this.

24:05.694 --> 24:06.987
I'll prove it.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.921
<i>Do you think I'm a fucking idiot?</i>

24:24.921 --> 24:26.173
No, this isn't...

24:26.173 --> 24:28.550
You and Rhys Montrose,

24:28.550 --> 24:30.969
the real Rhys Montrose, have never met.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.888
Ah-- Correction.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.974
Once, when you zip-tied his bollocks
and killed him.

24:36.808 --> 24:39.603
But I wouldn't exactly call that
a formal introduction.

24:40.645 --> 24:41.980
Don't look at me like that.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.274
If I'm amused,
it's only because there's some part of you

24:44.274 --> 24:46.735
that finds all of this deeply hilarious.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.453
I know who you are.

24:56.453 --> 24:59.206
The night I met you at Sundry House.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.625
- Good book.
-  <i>Malcolm introduced us.</i>

25:01.625 --> 25:03.126
Did he though?

25:03.126 --> 25:05.462
Malcolm commanded me to come and meet you.

25:05.462 --> 25:08.423
For what it's worth,
I didn't find your book sordid.

25:08.423 --> 25:11.426
Anyone walking past would've
seen you mumbling to a chair

25:11.426 --> 25:13.595
and assumed you were just as high
as the rest of them.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.681
But we've talked so many times
in public, with other people.

25:16.681 --> 25:19.184
In public, yes. Other people?

25:19.184 --> 25:20.852
They're party animals.

25:22.395 --> 25:25.023
give yourself too much of a hard time
if you made a cock-up.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.399
The cock-up was bad.

25:26.399 --> 25:30.528
Wasn't it always just us,
with other people sort of around?

25:31.071 --> 25:32.489
Well, no, we were at dinner.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.449
Mm-mm, mm-mm. Not all of us.

25:34.449 --> 25:36.952
You all right, Jonathan? You look sick.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.703
Oh, no. No, I'm fine.

25:39.454 --> 25:40.497
What was that?

25:40.497 --> 25:42.415
<i>Didn't talk to anyone but you, did I?</i>

25:42.415 --> 25:44.876
Remember Phoebe's flat after Simon died?

25:44.876 --> 25:46.253
I need some air.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.338
Was I really in the conversation,

25:48.338 --> 25:52.592
or was it more that I just said something
and no one responded but you?

25:52.592 --> 25:56.012
<i>Convenient how we had that heart-to-heart
on the balcony, innit? Alone?</i>

25:56.012 --> 25:58.390
- Simon's funeral...
- Right, that was Montrose.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.142
<i>He was a person.
He was friends with those twats,</i>

26:01.142 --> 26:03.311
but he was too busy to come around.

26:03.311 --> 26:06.398
He never spoke to you.
You watched from afar.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.276
He nodded lightly
because you were staring.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.486
But all the texting...

26:11.486 --> 26:13.571
You are imagining me.

26:14.155 --> 26:16.992
You don't think
you can't imagine a few texts?

26:16.992 --> 26:22.330
You are full fat, extra sugar,
deep-fried fucking insane, Joe Goldberg.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.457
- Fuck you.
- Whoa, I'm not the enemy here.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.876
I'm just the part that broke away
to do the dirty work.

26:29.838 --> 26:30.672
You're brilliant.

26:32.007 --> 26:32.841
Really.

26:32.841 --> 26:37.554
You poured all that darkness
you hated into this vessel you admired

26:37.554 --> 26:40.640
because you knew that the endgame
was facing yourself, didn't you?

26:41.182 --> 26:44.227
There you go,
all the worst bits in a little package

26:44.227 --> 26:47.188
you don't mind having a pint with.
I hope it makes it easier.

26:47.188 --> 26:50.650
- Nothing makes this easier.
- Can you at least admit they deserved it?

26:51.609 --> 26:53.194
Malcolm insulted Marienne.

26:53.194 --> 26:57.157
You're all loved up over some silly whore
who couldn't give two shits about you.

26:57.157 --> 26:58.992
Simon abused young artists.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.328
You gaslighting piece of shit!

27:01.328 --> 27:03.621
Gemma was-- She was bloody on to you.

27:03.621 --> 27:07.000
People did start dying
around the time you showed up.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.504
Right? Pity me. All the time
I had to spend trying to get you to admit

27:11.504 --> 27:14.382
that I was doing exactly what you wanted.

27:14.924 --> 27:19.095
I might be having some kind of break,
but you don't get to tell me who I am.

27:19.095 --> 27:23.058
I am not some cold-blooded psycho.

27:23.058 --> 27:26.519
No, no. Of course not.
It's much more complex than that.

27:26.519 --> 27:29.064
But I had to overcompensate
for your redemption fetish

27:29.064 --> 27:30.315
that went into overdrive.

27:30.315 --> 27:34.027
You were trying to tell yourself
you were saving them, right?

27:34.027 --> 27:36.780
A reformed man who was protecting
these inbred meat-suits

27:36.780 --> 27:38.615
from some shadow killer.

27:38.615 --> 27:39.866
You.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.747
<i>But deep down...</i>

27:54.005 --> 27:58.468
the idea of any of them
being worth saving was bullshit.

27:58.468 --> 27:59.677
Hmm.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.766
Jonathan, you perv.
What are you doing here?

28:24.035 --> 28:25.912
So Roald was right about everything.

28:25.912 --> 28:28.289
Meet the Eat The Rich Killer.

28:28.289 --> 28:30.625
Thank you. Yes.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.420
That's exactly why
I served him to you on a platter.

28:45.223 --> 28:49.686
So I locked myself
in a burning basement because...

28:50.228 --> 28:53.356
- Am I also suicidal?
- No. You're a master of denial,

28:53.356 --> 28:56.443
and I can't get through
without dangling you over the sharks.

28:58.945 --> 29:02.574
I'd love to be gentle,
but you won't listen when I tell you

29:02.574 --> 29:05.910
how you are living is unsustainable.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.956
You will end up in prison or worse.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.876
You need to embrace your truth, Joe.

29:14.753 --> 29:15.754
Hence...

29:17.046 --> 29:18.465
Marienne in a cage.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.426
My grandest opus.

29:21.426 --> 29:24.220
Our grandest opus.

29:25.221 --> 29:27.056
Admit who you really are

29:27.056 --> 29:30.310
and you'll remember
where you put her, Joe.

29:47.744 --> 29:50.747
Oh, my God.
Did Professor Moore do this to you?

29:50.747 --> 29:53.500
No, no. Goldberg.
His name is Joe Goldberg.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.084
My name is Marienne Bellamy.

29:56.503 --> 29:57.670
I'm Nadia.

29:57.670 --> 29:59.464
Right, let me help you, okay?

30:02.884 --> 30:03.968
No, don't.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.972
You put in the wrong code,
he'll know. He'll get an alert.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.809
Okay, I'm gonna call 999.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.769
You can't call the police.

30:13.853 --> 30:16.648
What? Listen, you are in shock, and--

30:16.648 --> 30:19.359
No, I'm sane. I'm calm.

30:19.359 --> 30:21.694
I'm telling you, do not call them.

30:24.322 --> 30:27.283
He killed his wife. He faked his death.

30:27.283 --> 30:31.079
That's not even close to everything.
He disappears. He comes back again.

30:33.414 --> 30:34.833
You can't call them.

30:37.293 --> 30:41.673
- Okay, but if we get him arrested, then--
- He always gets away with it.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.302
Nadia, right?

30:47.011 --> 30:47.846
Yes.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.849
Nadia, he stalked me
halfway across the world.

30:52.308 --> 30:54.143
He'll find me again.

30:55.311 --> 30:56.521
Please...

30:58.231 --> 30:59.065
Fuck.

31:00.191 --> 31:03.152
Fuck. I can't leave you in here.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.030
I'm sorry. I can't-- I can't do that.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.576
I have a daughter.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.161
Her name is Juliette.

31:13.079 --> 31:17.166
She is the only thing keeping me alive.

31:17.166 --> 31:20.003
I need to do this
in a way that keeps her safe,

31:20.003 --> 31:22.630
that gets me back to her safely.

31:22.630 --> 31:24.966
So you have to trust me, okay?

31:24.966 --> 31:26.509
I trust you.

31:27.176 --> 31:28.219
I trust you.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.222
Do you have food?

31:31.764 --> 31:33.892
Food? Yes, yes, yes. Of course.

31:33.892 --> 31:37.437
Sorry, how can I get it to you?

31:37.437 --> 31:38.605
- Yeah?
- Open it.

31:38.605 --> 31:41.399
Okay. Well, there's
some water in there. Okay?

31:41.399 --> 31:43.693
- And-- All I have is that.
- Close it.

31:43.693 --> 31:44.777
Okay.

31:50.116 --> 31:52.118
He hasn't been here to feed you, has he?

31:52.118 --> 31:53.453
Fuck.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.291
Take it.

32:00.043 --> 32:00.877
I--

32:01.669 --> 32:03.630
I've got class with him tomorrow,

32:03.630 --> 32:06.341
so I'll wait for him to leave his flat,
then I'll sneak in.

32:06.341 --> 32:08.801
- I can be five minutes--
- Sneak in? No, that's crazy.

32:08.801 --> 32:10.970
No, no. I have done it before.

32:10.970 --> 32:13.890
How do you think I'm here?
How do you think that I found you?

32:13.890 --> 32:16.476
I stole his house key, I made copies,

32:16.476 --> 32:20.021
and I just need to return everything
before he notices.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.106
How often does he come here?

32:22.106 --> 32:24.359
It's been a while, so I don't know.

32:24.359 --> 32:27.403
But he can't catch you down here.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.032
- Yeah.
- Go!

32:32.241 --> 32:33.868
I'm gonna be back tomorrow.

32:33.868 --> 32:36.454
I'll be back and bring you some more food,

32:36.454 --> 32:39.040
and I'll come back with some sort of plan.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.376
Okay?

32:43.044 --> 32:44.295
Listen to me.

32:46.839 --> 32:50.385
Do not let him find out
that you know about me, okay?

32:50.385 --> 32:52.053
He will hurt you.

32:53.429 --> 32:54.806
Be careful.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.808
I'll be back before you know it.

32:58.393 --> 32:59.227
Okay?

33:08.695 --> 33:11.781
<i>I was up all night, trying
to figure out where Marienne is.</i>

33:11.781 --> 33:14.701
<i>Now, this morning,
Rhys Montrose's disappearance</i>

33:14.701 --> 33:16.119
<i>is national news.</i>

33:16.119 --> 33:20.248
<i>So the Montrose in my head is insisting
I act normal, go to class,</i>

33:20.248 --> 33:22.041
<i>or he won't help me find her.</i>

33:22.041 --> 33:23.418
<i>I'm trapped in hell.</i>

33:25.003 --> 33:26.379
Oh, sorry.

33:26.379 --> 33:27.463
<i>Or am I?</i>

33:31.968 --> 33:34.804
<i>Hello, you.</i>

33:36.180 --> 33:40.309
<i>Rhys has been in my head,
stealing me from what--</i>

33:40.309 --> 33:43.771
<i>no, who I should have been
focusing on all along.</i>

33:43.771 --> 33:46.649
<i>Not some figment
of my wobbly mental state, no.</i>

33:46.649 --> 33:49.861
<i>You, you should be what matters, Kate.</i>

33:50.361 --> 33:52.321
I was just heading to yours.

33:53.448 --> 33:56.159
Pathetic or charming
that I bought you a croissant?

33:56.159 --> 33:58.745
- Exactly what I need.
- I was just thinking of you.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.913
I remembered you're not
on my list of problems,

34:00.913 --> 34:02.540
and I wanted to reward you.

34:04.333 --> 34:05.793
You look like shit.

34:07.253 --> 34:10.173
I like her. She doesn't fuck about.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.134
Well, I barely slept.

34:14.343 --> 34:16.429
- Same.
- What's wrong with you?

34:17.221 --> 34:21.267
Didn't you get that invitation to Phoebe
and Adam's engagement party?

34:21.267 --> 34:22.977
British Invasion-themed.

34:22.977 --> 34:24.604
Who are we invading, ourselves?

34:24.604 --> 34:27.356
Phoebe honestly needs psychiatric care.

34:27.356 --> 34:30.651
This is the worst time
to get legally bound to a leech.

34:30.651 --> 34:34.405
She's not returning my calls.
I think he's intercepting my messages.

34:34.405 --> 34:36.199
He's desperate and he's horrible.

34:38.284 --> 34:40.244
<i>I should be helping you,
not running around,</i>

34:40.244 --> 34:43.289
<i>trying to save a woman I allegedly
Mr. Hyde'd while in a blackout.</i>

34:43.289 --> 34:46.584
Sorry, I needed to vent,
but I'll figure something out.

34:47.293 --> 34:48.127
Hang on.

34:49.378 --> 34:52.924
I've never seen Phoebe wear
the same outfit twice.

34:52.924 --> 34:56.719
Any idea where she might be getting
a dress for this thing?

34:57.553 --> 34:59.514
No, but her assistant will.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.432
I'll call.

35:02.975 --> 35:04.644
You are a sharp one.

35:05.770 --> 35:09.190
You have to get to class,
and I have to find Phoebe.

35:10.399 --> 35:11.651
Let's talk later?

35:12.276 --> 35:15.530
Distract from our sorrows
with athletic sex?

35:16.155 --> 35:17.949
Later can't come soon enough.

35:30.336 --> 35:32.338
You two are adorable. Mm.

35:33.506 --> 35:35.925
Clean up your mess and you can have her.

35:36.425 --> 35:38.886
If you don't, you'll lose her forever.

35:40.555 --> 35:41.973
It's quite a conundrum.

35:48.187 --> 35:51.107
<i>I wouldn't say the Madonna-whore
complex is the engine of the story.</i>

35:51.107 --> 35:52.775
But it's part of it.

35:53.901 --> 35:56.404
Any other thoughts here?

35:56.988 --> 36:00.700
I think 19 and 17 refer
to the real-life murder victims.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.618
The story was inspired by a real killer.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.704
No, the numbers are a dirty joke.

36:04.704 --> 36:07.874
Thirty-three plus 17, plus 19, equals 69.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.709
You're projecting. No way.

36:09.709 --> 36:12.503
That's just silly.
Don't you think, professor?

36:14.463 --> 36:17.008
Nadia, would you care
to settle this debate?

36:17.008 --> 36:19.594
Deep significance or off-color joke?

36:21.387 --> 36:26.517
- Um, I didn't read it. Sorry.
-  <i>Nadia didn't do the homework?</i>

36:26.517 --> 36:29.729
I had a paper to write,
but it won't happen again.

36:30.479 --> 36:32.356
Oh, she's trouble for us, Joe.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.037
Tell her to stay.

36:48.080 --> 36:51.000
Tell her to stay
if you wanna find Marienne alive.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.631
Nadia, can you just hang back a second?

36:59.592 --> 37:02.845
Sorry that I wasn't prepared.
It's bloody Tarkovsky.

37:02.845 --> 37:06.265
I mean, I can barely watch his shit,
let alone write about it, so...

37:06.849 --> 37:08.100
Um...

37:08.100 --> 37:09.810
How are you doing?

37:09.810 --> 37:11.646
I don't mean to pry, but...

37:14.190 --> 37:16.359
To be honest, um...

37:18.236 --> 37:19.487
Edward.

37:20.321 --> 37:23.699
I've been feeling
very anxious around him lately.

37:23.699 --> 37:26.244
<i>Is that all this is?</i>

37:26.244 --> 37:29.247
It's stupid, really,
because I can't shake it off.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.874
Neither of us like labels.
I've got no idea what we are.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.836
<i>She's off because she likes a boy.</i>

37:36.462 --> 37:40.967
Well, it's not my place to say,
but however you define it,

37:40.967 --> 37:42.927
anyone can see that he's crazy about you.

37:43.636 --> 37:45.972
Well, I wish he could say that to me.

37:45.972 --> 37:48.307
He's as nervous around you
as you are around him.

37:48.307 --> 37:50.393
He's just better at hiding it.

37:52.311 --> 37:55.648
- Maybe you're right.
- Nadia. Liar, liar, pants on fire.

37:55.648 --> 37:59.277
- Well, I have to meet somebody, so...
- Okay.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.529
Why don't we catch up
during office hours, okay?

38:01.529 --> 38:04.156
Yeah, I'll, um-- I look forward to it.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.010
Pheebs?

38:24.552 --> 38:25.469
Hi.

38:25.469 --> 38:28.597
They said that you'd stepped out
of the dressing room to get some air.

38:29.223 --> 38:30.224
Are you okay?

38:30.224 --> 38:32.184
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

38:32.184 --> 38:33.602
I'm perfect.

38:33.602 --> 38:36.022
Thank God the angels are protecting me.

38:38.065 --> 38:41.027
Darling, you've been avoiding me.

38:42.570 --> 38:47.283
No. Oh, I think my messages
must have gotten lost. Sorry.

38:47.283 --> 38:48.492
Listen.

38:49.702 --> 38:54.290
I've got a car waiting at the front
to take you to get that rest we agreed on.

38:54.290 --> 38:57.585
- I do think you need it.
- Can I tell you the most delicious secret?

38:58.586 --> 39:00.796
- You know the engagement party?
- Yeah.

39:03.257 --> 39:04.717
It's really my wedding.

39:06.385 --> 39:09.972
So this, I think this is going
to be my wedding dress.

39:09.972 --> 39:14.268
- What do you think? I love it, do you?
- Pheebs, it is gorge.

39:14.268 --> 39:15.644
It really is.

39:16.562 --> 39:19.440
You've been talking about
your wedding day since you were tiny.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.026
You wanted to wear
your grandma's dress and a tiara.

39:22.026 --> 39:25.571
It'd take too long to get out of storage,
and there isn't enough time.

39:25.571 --> 39:26.864
What's the rush?

39:28.324 --> 39:29.408
Gemma.

39:30.159 --> 39:31.827
One day, she's here,

39:32.578 --> 39:33.871
now she's ashes.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.082
Why wait for anything?

39:36.082 --> 39:39.126
He says he loves me
a thousand million times a day.

39:39.752 --> 39:41.504
This should be enough, right?

39:42.129 --> 39:43.714
Yes. Yes.

39:43.714 --> 39:47.510
Just please do the done thing.

39:48.177 --> 39:49.678
- What done thing?
- Prenup.

39:49.678 --> 39:52.932
- Please tell me you've spoken to lawyers.
- Did you say lawyers?

39:54.725 --> 39:56.644
What are we talking about, prenups?

39:56.644 --> 39:59.563
Kate, don't worry.
Everything is taken care of, okay?

40:00.689 --> 40:05.319
Everything is legal to the letter.

40:05.319 --> 40:06.320
Mm.

40:09.073 --> 40:12.159
Why is it that every time you show up,
Phoebe ends up upset?

40:12.701 --> 40:14.120
Do you care about her?

40:14.120 --> 40:16.539
No, my love. She's just trying to help.

40:16.539 --> 40:20.000
Enough about her.
I have a surprise for you. Okay?

40:20.000 --> 40:21.085
- Come on.
- Okay.

40:33.472 --> 40:35.975
<i>Marienne is somewhere.</i>

40:36.725 --> 40:40.396
<i>And the answer is hidden in this flat,
a map, a key, something,</i>

40:40.396 --> 40:42.523
<i>but I can't fucking find it,</i>

40:43.274 --> 40:44.733
<i>and she's going to die.</i>

40:47.236 --> 40:49.321
There goes your security deposit.

40:49.321 --> 40:51.824
Hope it felt good
tearing the place apart, at least.

40:51.824 --> 40:54.827
So now that you got that
out of your system,

40:55.578 --> 40:59.582
ah, may I suggest
that we start searching within?

41:07.047 --> 41:08.132
Hello, you.

41:08.632 --> 41:11.260
<i>Cabin in the woods, fresh snow,</i>

41:11.802 --> 41:13.637
very strong drinks.

41:14.346 --> 41:19.226
A zillion stars overhead
and no place else to be.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.397
<i>- Can we go now?</i>
- Everything okay?

41:23.939 --> 41:25.941
Phoebe's engagement party?

41:26.692 --> 41:28.486
Not an engagement party.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.612
<i>A wedding.</i>

41:29.612 --> 41:32.323
- What are you gonna do?
<i>- I don't know yet.</i>

41:33.240 --> 41:34.742
But promise you'll come with me.

41:34.742 --> 41:37.119
I need the one sane person
in my life to be there.

41:38.287 --> 41:41.999
I'm always happy
to be your one sane person.

41:44.001 --> 41:45.252
Thank you, Jonathan.

41:50.132 --> 41:51.175
<i>See you later.</i>

41:51.175 --> 41:54.720
So a date with Kate, your <i>belle du jour.</i>

41:56.639 --> 41:59.266
Does that mean you finally
accepted that Marienne will die?

41:59.266 --> 42:03.479
Soon, I imagine, given the last time
I saw her was before we left for Hampsie.

42:04.313 --> 42:07.816
Let's Google how long a woman can go
without food and water.

42:09.235 --> 42:11.111
You're a fucking monster.

42:14.782 --> 42:18.077
I wonder how
that fake photographer woman's doing.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.161
You know.

42:19.912 --> 42:22.623
Lady Phoebe's number one fan?

42:22.623 --> 42:23.832
She's in jail.

42:25.167 --> 42:27.086
What does she have to do with any of this?

42:27.086 --> 42:29.171
So convinced
that Lady Phoebe was her friend,

42:29.171 --> 42:31.715
she tattooed her arm,
knew all the details of her life,

42:31.715 --> 42:33.759
where she lived, her favorite restaurants.

42:33.759 --> 42:36.762
Certain Phoebe was sending her messages.

42:37.555 --> 42:40.057
Kidnapped her, tortured her,

42:40.057 --> 42:41.517
accidentally killed--

42:43.102 --> 42:46.230
I'm so sorry.
I've got it all mixed up, haven't I?

42:46.230 --> 42:48.857
Cut the bullshit.
I don't know what you are saying.

42:48.857 --> 42:52.653
The real Eat The Rich Killer
is also an erotomaniac.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.369
Do you see it yet, Joe?

43:34.528 --> 43:35.904
Wonder what that's for.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.325
Still just warm, though.

43:41.243 --> 43:42.620
Keep at it, sunshine.

43:49.793 --> 43:51.211
Warmer.

44:04.892 --> 44:08.562
Nadia didn't realize she was giving
Rhys's book to his number one fan...

44:14.943 --> 44:16.904
who had already read it quite a lot.

44:18.280 --> 44:19.782
But you didn't know that either.

44:29.541 --> 44:30.542
I did this?

44:31.418 --> 44:32.419
No one else here.

44:35.506 --> 44:36.340
No.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.093
- No, I'm not--
- Obsessed?

45:03.617 --> 45:04.993
There's always a box.

45:10.707 --> 45:12.292
The usual souvenirs.

45:12.292 --> 45:14.002
Receipts, old chewing gum.

45:14.711 --> 45:16.547
That's his sweaty gym towel.

45:36.817 --> 45:40.446
<i>In honor of the paperback edition
of</i> A Good Man in a Cruel World,

45:40.446 --> 45:43.532
<i>I'll show you some
of my favorite haunts in London,</i>

45:44.074 --> 45:45.159
<i>starting with...</i>

45:47.202 --> 45:48.328
<i>Tandoori Tradition.</i>

45:48.954 --> 45:51.748
I think you'll find Marienne in time,
after all.

46:20.777 --> 46:22.112
You're getting warmer.

46:23.655 --> 46:24.865
Very warm.

46:41.048 --> 46:43.467
- That's your regular haunt?
- I'm a creature of habit.

46:55.103 --> 46:56.355
Marienne, Marienne.

46:57.564 --> 47:00.192
- I have a plan.
- Thank God 'cause I don't.

47:00.192 --> 47:01.527
But it's insane.

47:01.527 --> 47:04.238
It's so insane and it'll never work.

47:06.990 --> 47:08.534
All right, let's hear it.

47:34.268 --> 47:36.895
- Joe?
- I'm not Joe.

47:43.110 --> 47:44.278
Attaboy.

47:46.029 --> 47:47.072
I'm proud of you.
