00:18.017 --> 00:19.936
<i>Previously on </i>You:

00:20.020 --> 00:23.064
<i>You are a monster and a killer.</i>

00:23.940 --> 00:26.568
<i>One of you fuckers sent me those texts.</i>

00:26.651 --> 00:28.236
<i>"Hello, Joe."</i>

00:29.279 --> 00:32.490
<i>"You like it. How it feels. To kill."</i>

00:32.574 --> 00:34.743
Somebody's trying to frame me.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.624
You don't want to fuck.
You want to make love.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.418
You don't know who I am or what I want.

00:43.501 --> 00:47.714
You're trying to seem noble
while you hide your true motives.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.340
<i>"It's time for us to meet."</i>

00:49.883 --> 00:51.760
<i>When and where?</i>

00:53.303 --> 00:55.305
<i>This can't be good.</i>

01:04.647 --> 01:08.401
<i>Here I was, thinking you've ended</i>
<i>my second lease on life</i>

01:08.485 --> 01:10.278
<i>before it's even begun, but really,</i>

01:10.361 --> 01:12.906
<i>we were about</i>
<i>to be pulled closer than ever.</i>

01:12.989 --> 01:14.783
<i>-But first...</i>
-Professor Moore.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.744
If we might have
the briefest moment of your time.

01:18.286 --> 01:22.082
<i>I had to jump through</i>
<i>yet another insanely polite, British hoop.</i>

01:22.999 --> 01:24.751
Of course. Anything to help.

01:37.180 --> 01:40.099
It's nice to talk to somebody
comparatively sober.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.768
<i>They've grilled everyone.</i>

01:41.851 --> 01:44.687
We looked into the tip
you gave us, the artist Blue.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.190
Her story matched what you told us.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.108
Glad to hear that. Well, I'm...

01:49.818 --> 01:51.361
Of course I'm not glad.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.114
We're now pursuing
Simon's past associates.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.698
<i>Hope he had thousands.</i>

01:55.782 --> 01:59.119
Perhaps you've thought
of something else relevant.

01:59.202 --> 02:02.080
<i>So I'm off the hook</i>
<i>but not quite off the hook.</i>

02:02.163 --> 02:05.458
-Can I call you if I think of anything?
-Any time.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.545
Who knows, Jonathan,
you might have helped crack it.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.255
One can only hope.

02:11.297 --> 02:14.092
Well, until we speak again.

02:33.820 --> 02:37.031
<i>Hyenas. Disappointed nothing happened.</i>

02:37.115 --> 02:38.575
<i>Not because they care</i>
<i>their friends are dead</i>

02:38.658 --> 02:40.660
<i>but because they feel nothing.</i>

02:40.743 --> 02:42.871
<i>Their lives are so bubble-wrapped.</i>

02:43.454 --> 02:45.290
<i>They're already bored again.</i>

02:45.373 --> 02:47.625
<i>Meanwhile, you are keeping me riveted.</i>

02:47.709 --> 02:49.836
<i>Who are you, asshole?</i>

02:49.919 --> 02:51.296
<i>And how do I stop you?</i>

02:51.379 --> 02:53.464
Jonathan. Come, come.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.051
<i>Hampsie.</i>

02:57.135 --> 02:59.178
<i>Lady Phoebe's country house.</i>

02:59.262 --> 03:01.014
<i>Running away from the masses.</i>

03:01.097 --> 03:03.182
You're coming and cannot say, "No."

03:03.266 --> 03:05.476
<i>All of us under one roof.</i>

03:05.560 --> 03:08.521
It sounds a bit like a friend-group thing.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.398
We simply must have you there.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.860
<i>They don't know</i>
<i>they're bringing the killer with them.</i>

03:13.943 --> 03:16.112
<i>One of them is you.</i>

03:16.779 --> 03:18.114
Then I would love to.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.683
<i>Phoebe insisted "no gifts"</i>
<i>in the least convincing delivery</i>

03:45.767 --> 03:46.809
<i>I've ever heard.</i>

03:49.979 --> 03:52.774
<i>My rich neighbors drink</i>
<i>the kind of wine I could never afford.</i>

04:08.373 --> 04:10.375
<i>One thing is clear:</i>

04:10.458 --> 04:13.169
<i>If I'm going to seize the opportunity</i>
<i>this weekend provides,</i>

04:13.253 --> 04:15.797
<i>I need zero distractions.</i>

04:25.890 --> 04:28.101
Look, do you have the message or not?

04:28.184 --> 04:30.812
Don't leave out the part
where I tell him to keep his nose

04:30.895 --> 04:32.146
out of my business.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.233
No, I don't want to tell him.

04:35.316 --> 04:36.526
How many more years

04:36.609 --> 04:40.280
before you people understand
I do not want to speak to the man.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.782
Christ.

04:50.498 --> 04:53.042
You bled capital
on that tech venture.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.586
There's not a bank in London
you don't owe money to.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.506
There's the unpaid mortgages
in Shoreditch.

04:58.589 --> 05:01.259
Mortgages that were offered
against this club.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.513
Which I know you would hate to lose.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.770
You cannot go another day
without paying your lenders.

05:13.354 --> 05:16.482
They will come for more
than your assets. Destroy you.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.651
Ruin everything
you've worked hard to achieve.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.321
Robert, I get it.
I will call my dad if it's that bad.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.990
I recall him saying that last time was...

05:24.073 --> 05:25.742
Well, the last time.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.786
Well, yes,
but he didn't actually mean that.

05:28.870 --> 05:32.290
-Oh, shoot. I actually have to jet. Sorry.
-No, no.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.625
-Please consider staying.
-I'll call my dad from the car.

05:34.709 --> 05:38.254
Everybody is gonna
get their money on time.

05:39.672 --> 05:40.882
Enjoy the country.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.342
Thank you.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.673
<i>It's nice to think, when I return,</i>

06:22.757 --> 06:24.967
<i>I'll have put you behind me.</i>

06:25.051 --> 06:27.762
<i>Maybe life can finally return to normal.</i>

06:50.409 --> 06:54.288
<i>So this is what the Blaxworths mean</i>
<i>by "little country house."</i>

07:03.714 --> 07:04.549
Hi.

07:08.719 --> 07:11.889
<i>Seems more to me</i>
<i>like </i>Downton Abbey<i> vampire castle.</i>

07:26.863 --> 07:29.282
-Welcome to Hampsbridge, sir.
-Thank you.

07:29.365 --> 07:30.783
-Thanks.
-You.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.412
You rather stick out, don't you?

07:35.913 --> 07:39.584
So is she shagging you? Phoebe?
Or are you more decorative?

07:39.667 --> 07:40.668
<i>She is so sweet.</i>

07:40.751 --> 07:43.045
Is it true, though,
American men are better in bed?

07:43.129 --> 07:44.964
Or is it only the Jewish ones?

07:45.047 --> 07:46.257
<i>Is it legal to say that?</i>

07:46.340 --> 07:48.092
Joking! We're having a laugh.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.344
Please try and have a sense of humor.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.513
<i>I will, if she starts being funny.</i>

07:52.597 --> 07:54.807
Oh, no. My ex is here.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.686
<i>Awful enough to be you</i>
<i>if she had the smarts.</i>

07:58.769 --> 08:00.313
<i>No evidence she does.</i>

08:00.396 --> 08:03.232
The bastard gave me gonor-rona
in the Seychelles.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.942
No one had a worse 2020 than me.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.029
-Why can't the killer chop up all my exes?
-<i>Huh.</i>

08:08.112 --> 08:10.448
<i>Or Gemma, if you're taking requests.</i>

08:10.531 --> 08:11.616
<i>No. No.</i>

08:11.699 --> 08:14.327
<i>Delightful as that would be,</i>
<i>I'm here to stop you, so...</i>

08:15.995 --> 08:18.164
<i>Which one are you?</i>

08:25.213 --> 08:26.631
Well, lovely chat,

08:26.714 --> 08:29.717
but I'm off to hang myself
because you're so boring.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.887
I'm joking. But do better.

08:35.848 --> 08:38.601
Look, no one is even
noticing them, darling.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.395
I notice them. And I don't want them here.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.981
Sorry. It's not your fault.

08:44.482 --> 08:47.151
Just ignore them.
At least we know we're safe.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.779
Yes, I suppose we do.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.831
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>I can't afford distractions.</i>

09:00.915 --> 09:02.708
<i>-Not now.</i>
-Jonathan.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.043
You're here!

09:04.126 --> 09:05.878
It'll mostly be hunting.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.173
-Do you hunt?
-I have, once or twice.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.759
It's exhilarating, if you're a good shot.

09:11.842 --> 09:14.887
Didn't your own vice president
shoot someone in the face?

09:14.971 --> 09:18.474
Yeah, some may have wished
it went the other way.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.101
A wit.

09:21.852 --> 09:24.730
I've always admired a man like you who...

09:25.356 --> 09:27.191
doesn't care how he presents.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.278
I'm so pleased you're here.

09:32.905 --> 09:36.492
<i>You really could be any of these monsters.</i>

09:40.079 --> 09:41.163
Come, come.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.374
Let the festivities commence.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.458
Ooh!

09:49.005 --> 09:50.631
<i>Bring on the hunt.</i>

09:58.973 --> 10:02.018
Lord Tennyson found this
to be the best view of the grounds.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.894
He spent hours a day taking it in.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.734
You'll have trouble with that.
No service or Wi-Fi.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.569
<i>You're kidding me.</i>

10:11.652 --> 10:13.946
I'm sure if Lord Tennyson managed...

10:14.030 --> 10:15.948
Most of our guests come to appreciate it.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.658
<i>Most guests</i>
<i>don't have to communicate</i>

10:17.742 --> 10:19.160
<i>with a killer intent on texting.</i>

10:22.872 --> 10:24.999
<i>A picture emerges.</i>

10:25.082 --> 10:28.044
<i>No Internet, no security cams,</i>
<i>even the light switches are 50 years old.</i>

10:28.127 --> 10:30.796
<i>This isn't another house.</i>
<i>It's another world.</i>

10:30.880 --> 10:32.840
<i>Must feel incredibly safe to them</i>

10:32.923 --> 10:34.717
<i>and remarkably private to you.</i>

10:37.845 --> 10:39.722
-Oh.
-<i>Adjoining doors.</i>

10:39.805 --> 10:41.015
<i>Of course.</i>

10:41.098 --> 10:44.644
Someone must have fallen in favor
with the lady of the manor.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.855
The Tenny room isn't assigned
to just anyone.

10:52.068 --> 10:52.985
Hmm.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.781
A great bed for shagging.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.118
Shame that won't be happening.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.287
-Such a shame.
-Mm-hm.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.500
-Glad we have that straight.
-So glad.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.466
<i>Nice as that would be,</i>
<i>not my mission right now.</i>

11:29.814 --> 11:32.149
<i>"Portrait gallery." Did you send this?</i>

11:46.163 --> 11:47.998
<i>Is this finally it?</i>

12:58.152 --> 12:59.153
<i>Phoebe.</i>

12:59.695 --> 13:00.529
<i>Really?</i>

13:02.823 --> 13:05.784
<i>This is not the setting</i>
<i>I expected for murder talk.</i>

13:05.868 --> 13:07.036
<i>What's happening?</i>

13:08.120 --> 13:10.164
<i>Those can't be...</i>

13:10.247 --> 13:11.540
Nobs,

13:11.624 --> 13:12.791
willies,

13:12.875 --> 13:14.293
pork swords.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.546
I've made molds of all my lovers' cocks.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.299
Body-safe wax, of course.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.676
<i>I'm gonna go with she's not you.</i>

13:23.344 --> 13:25.095
How do you like my boudoir?

13:25.179 --> 13:27.556
<i>Oh, no. Is this a seduction?</i>

13:29.016 --> 13:31.143
-It's very...
-<i>Sex-robot Marie Antoinette.</i>

13:31.227 --> 13:32.061
...nice.

13:33.145 --> 13:37.149
<i>This is a situation</i>
<i>I need to delicately extract myself from.</i>

13:41.195 --> 13:45.574
Ever since the night we met,
the way you spoke to me...

13:45.658 --> 13:47.743
<i>If only I can remember what I said.</i>

13:47.826 --> 13:50.120
Oh. Hello there.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.455
I meant what I said.

13:51.539 --> 13:55.167
Yes, yes. I sensed you were
the most honest man I've ever met.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.128
Uh...

13:58.796 --> 14:00.339
Can we slow down?

14:03.092 --> 14:04.176
<i>Oh, no.</i>

14:04.260 --> 14:05.511
No, no, no. I don't--

14:05.594 --> 14:07.930
No, no. It's fine if you don't want to.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.807
-I don't not want to.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.892
What the hell was I thinking?

14:13.936 --> 14:14.770
Phoebe.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.940
-You're beautiful.
-Yes, I know.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.149
I'm a ten.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.693
You're spoken for.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.195
That's all.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.447
Anyone would want you.

14:25.531 --> 14:26.907
Everyone wants me...

14:28.409 --> 14:29.743
until they have me.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.412
<i>This is about Adam.</i>

14:31.495 --> 14:33.789
-Adam loves you.
-<i>He just also loves piss play.</i>

14:33.873 --> 14:37.001
Then why does it feel like...?
We have our fun, but...

14:37.710 --> 14:40.004
we should be moving on
to the next level, and...

14:42.506 --> 14:44.466
I don't feel like his everything.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.177
Listen.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.181
I may not have mentioned this,

14:51.265 --> 14:54.894
but I was married once, a long time ago.

14:55.811 --> 14:56.687
Oh.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.523
-Was she your everything?
-<i>Fuck, no.</i>

14:59.607 --> 15:04.194
Yes, she was,
but I had other things on my mind.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.656
I think that might have hurt her.

15:08.824 --> 15:12.286
But it had nothing to do with her.

15:13.412 --> 15:17.041
What you're sensing,
it could be a million things.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.585
It could have nothing to do
with the way he feels about you.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.212
Do you really believe that?

15:22.838 --> 15:26.050
Adam adores you.
The word he uses is "worships."

15:26.133 --> 15:29.053
<i>Nope. But here's hoping</i>
<i>the lies hold for the weekend.</i>

15:29.136 --> 15:31.764
Oh. Look at me.

15:31.847 --> 15:35.309
Sorry excuse for a hostess.
Heaping all my problems on to you.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.061
Ah. Enough of that.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.357
Oh, you kind, sweet man.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.777
Jonathan, do me one favor.

15:46.403 --> 15:47.696
This never happened.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.742
What never happened?

15:55.996 --> 15:57.790
<i>No bars. Anywhere.</i>

15:57.873 --> 15:59.917
<i>No way of knowing</i>
<i>if you've reached out to me</i>

16:00.000 --> 16:02.336
<i>in this gilded Stone Age hellscape...</i>

16:02.920 --> 16:04.713
-Oh, fuck!

16:04.797 --> 16:07.216
<i>...where the demons play croquet.</i>

16:07.299 --> 16:10.844
Oh, shit! Fucking cunt flap!

16:10.928 --> 16:13.347
No, don't be such a batty twatty loser.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.140
Now we need a new hoop.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.977
And I need a top-up. No, no.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.980
No, he's my top-up.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.065
You're my new hoop.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.318
Oh, God.

16:28.904 --> 16:29.905
Tick-tock!

16:34.201 --> 16:35.202
Just there.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.124
Uh, no, no, no.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.750
On all fours.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.545
Like a little doggie. A good doggie.
Woof, woof!

16:45.129 --> 16:47.756
<i>She's completely devoid of empathy.</i>

16:47.840 --> 16:50.092
Oh, come on, be a good sport.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.931
A little bend to it.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.352
Christ. I'll see you inside, Phoebes.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.439
<i>Kate's the only one in the real world,</i>

17:03.522 --> 17:07.151
<i>therefore gets that these are people</i>
<i>working for a living,</i>

17:07.234 --> 17:08.902
<i>not human lawn ornaments.</i>

17:11.613 --> 17:14.283
<i>Everything in me says, "Let them die."</i>

17:14.950 --> 17:16.535
<i>It's perverse.</i>

17:16.618 --> 17:18.746
<i>You've made me their protector.</i>

17:18.829 --> 17:19.913
You.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.166
Glad you're here.

17:24.793 --> 17:26.712
What do you say we grab us a real drink?

17:28.338 --> 17:30.007
It's time we got to know each other.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.428
<i>No,</i>

17:34.511 --> 17:35.679
<i>he can't be.</i>

17:42.186 --> 17:44.521
<i>This better not be another boudoir.</i>

17:45.147 --> 17:46.565
There's my boys.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.322
<i>Not calling in</i>
<i>a coked-out hit-and-run I'd buy,</i>

17:53.405 --> 17:54.782
<i>but double homicide</i>

17:54.865 --> 17:57.785
<i>-and a sadistic game of cat and mouse?</i>
-Cheers.

18:02.748 --> 18:03.665
Mm.

18:04.792 --> 18:05.834
Mother's milk.

18:08.670 --> 18:09.838
You okay?

18:11.215 --> 18:12.049
Yeah.

18:12.716 --> 18:13.717
Yeah.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.013
I'm not sure where to start.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.431
<i>"I killed Malcolm"?</i>

18:20.057 --> 18:22.267
We've become friends.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.186
-Right?
-Yeah, of course.

18:25.187 --> 18:29.108
I need some advice
and I heard you were married, right?

18:29.191 --> 18:32.820
<i>Did Phoebe tell, or did he read it</i>
<i>in an article on my wall?</i>

18:34.279 --> 18:36.198
I might propose to Phoebe.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.325
<i>Wait, that's what this is about?</i>

18:38.408 --> 18:40.619
Wow. That's exciting.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.373
Did getting married change it all?

18:47.334 --> 18:49.128
I mean, it's a piece of paper.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.632
-It's the relationship.
-Not when you're with a Blaxworth.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.342
That shit comes with rules.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.139
-Families always do.
-You see...

19:01.306 --> 19:03.809
I would have to put down...

19:05.310 --> 19:06.311
certain things.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.521
I'm a free spirit.

19:07.604 --> 19:08.689
I like to feel.

19:08.772 --> 19:09.898
I like a secret.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.860
Secrets make you feel
like you're living your life.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.987
Like a fish in a bowl,

19:15.070 --> 19:16.363
we tie the knot,

19:16.446 --> 19:18.240
I get smashed in that box,

19:18.323 --> 19:20.033
and I don't get to slip away.

19:20.868 --> 19:21.702
Ever.

19:25.038 --> 19:27.624
So advice.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.251
<i>Run for your life, bro.</i>

19:32.087 --> 19:33.088
Maybe...

19:33.881 --> 19:35.174
slow your roll.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.550
Counterpoint:

19:36.633 --> 19:39.511
If I marry her,
life gets a fuckload easier.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.347
Things have been rough lately.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.183
Deals have not panned out.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.686
How is Ashton Kutcher making a killing
investing in random shit,

19:47.769 --> 19:50.606
-and I'm getting my ass tracked?
-There's always ups and downs.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.482
There are. But I have been here before.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.944
I had to call my dad,
and he was like, "Historically,

19:56.028 --> 19:57.321
you are the family fuck-up.

19:57.404 --> 20:00.824
But look at you, kid, taking swings.
Here's some runway."

20:01.909 --> 20:04.745
I am running out of runway.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.333
I think it comes down to...

20:09.958 --> 20:11.251
do you love her

20:11.335 --> 20:13.545
-more than you love your--?
-No. No.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.464
I think it comes down to is,

20:15.547 --> 20:17.174
I know myself.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.300
<i>Questionable.</i>

20:18.383 --> 20:20.469
I know that I'm in the bubble,

20:20.552 --> 20:21.929
but I see out.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.180
So know one thing:

20:23.263 --> 20:27.517
I will never, ever be without money.
That will never be me.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.894
<i>He's doomed.</i>

20:28.977 --> 20:30.062
So we'll see.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.272
But that is fucking that.

20:34.775 --> 20:35.984
Mm.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.946
Thank you for the therapy, man.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.115
Yeah, it's always nice
to get out of the city.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.867
I appreciate Phoebe inviting me.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.327
Oh, it wasn't her idea.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.371
It was Roald's.

20:48.622 --> 20:50.457
<i>Why would Roald want me here?</i>

20:52.334 --> 20:53.752
<i>Smarmy? Yeah.</i>

20:53.835 --> 20:55.420
<i>Capable of murder?</i>

20:57.714 --> 20:59.007
I don't give a toss about orders.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.843
Was it not made clear
you are to remain outside?

21:01.927 --> 21:03.929
I don't want to have to make a phone call.

21:20.737 --> 21:21.571
Hi.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.243
I don't like spies.

21:26.326 --> 21:29.121
I'm sorry.
Sorry, it's not gonna happen again.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.459
Is there something else?

21:35.377 --> 21:36.211
No.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.468
Actually, there is something.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.638
My necklaces are tangled. Would you...?

21:47.180 --> 21:48.974
<i>I shouldn't. I should not.</i>

21:49.057 --> 21:50.517
They don't look tangled.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.644
Well, look harder.

21:52.728 --> 21:53.729
See?

21:58.275 --> 22:00.360
Don't be a prude. You can touch me.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.682
<i>Damn it, I shouldn't have. No.</i>

22:33.143 --> 22:34.186
They're good now.

22:34.269 --> 22:35.520
-Yeah, thank you.
-Anytime.

22:35.604 --> 22:36.605
<i>Never again.</i>

22:52.162 --> 22:54.289
We shouldn't. This is a bad idea.

22:54.372 --> 22:56.249
No, no, no. Terrible. Terrible.

23:03.715 --> 23:04.716
Thank you.

23:07.260 --> 23:08.261
So we're clear?

23:09.387 --> 23:11.890
-Yeah, no, yeah, we're clear.
-Mm-hm.

23:13.558 --> 23:14.392
Fuck.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.686
Not again with these twats.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.109
Oh, it's you.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.610
Good evening to you.

23:25.070 --> 23:25.904
<i>Roald.</i>

23:26.905 --> 23:27.739
Yes?

23:28.782 --> 23:29.783
Well, no hurry.

23:29.866 --> 23:33.078
I can stand here all day.
Eventually, I will get a smile out of you.

23:33.161 --> 23:35.705
Despite your crippling
personality disorder.

23:36.623 --> 23:39.417
I think you mean despite yours,
you sick man.

23:39.501 --> 23:40.919
I know, yes, pity me.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.964
A few of us are going
for a pre-dinner swim. Care to join?

23:44.047 --> 23:46.925
I'll be down in a minute, sicko.

23:48.510 --> 23:49.344
Good.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.765
<i>Might be my only chance</i>
<i>to get any useful intel.</i>

23:56.601 --> 23:58.228
I thought we were on the same page.

23:58.311 --> 24:00.939
We are. We are.
I just have a quick question.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.362
Quick, you asserted.

24:07.445 --> 24:09.156
Yeah. Roald?

24:09.739 --> 24:12.033
Uh, you're friends?

24:15.328 --> 24:16.621
He seems to hate me.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.416
I was hoping you might have tips
to make him less inclined

24:19.499 --> 24:22.502
to want to smite me with his laser eyes.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.462
<i>Also, is he capable of murder?</i>

24:25.463 --> 24:27.257
Has he really been that awful?

24:29.009 --> 24:31.511
I think when he meets people
who aren't like him...

24:31.595 --> 24:33.680
Yeah, aristocrats with 8% body fat.

24:34.306 --> 24:39.019
I think he feels you'll think he's soft,
so he acts hard.

24:39.102 --> 24:40.145
But not with you.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.648
You're a huge success,
but as far as I know,

24:43.732 --> 24:45.525
not heir to some fortune.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.485
Compared to them, you're poor.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.030
We go so far back.

24:50.113 --> 24:53.325
I suppose he's forgotten
to be a little bitch.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.622
Are you very close?

24:59.497 --> 25:01.791
Why? Will there be a duel?

25:01.875 --> 25:03.460
We're old friends.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.921
It might not have always been
what Roald wanted, but...

25:08.006 --> 25:08.840
I--

25:09.674 --> 25:11.092
I need to change.

25:11.176 --> 25:14.012
-Oh, right.
-You can let yourself out, detective.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.102
<i>Not what Roald wanted.</i>

25:21.186 --> 25:23.688
<i>Interesting. Roald loves Kate,</i>
<i>Kate's with Malcolm.</i>

25:23.772 --> 25:26.650
<i>Malcolm ends up dead.</i>
<i>Simon's behavior threatens Kate's career.</i>

25:26.733 --> 25:30.028
<i>No more Simon.</i>
<i>Roald has got motive and opportunity.</i>

25:30.111 --> 25:31.780
<i>He was around the nights both were killed.</i>

25:39.037 --> 25:41.456
<i>But motive and opportunity aren't enough.</i>

25:41.539 --> 25:43.458
<i>If I'm not getting a confession,</i>

25:44.042 --> 25:45.126
<i>I need proof.</i>

25:50.757 --> 25:52.926
<i>All right, Roald.</i>

25:53.009 --> 25:55.220
<i>Who are you and what are you hiding?</i>

25:59.140 --> 26:00.517
<i>Neat and tidy.</i>

26:01.268 --> 26:03.103
<i>Can't blame him for the weird furniture.</i>

26:06.481 --> 26:09.150
<i>Sell his watches,</i>
<i>feed a developing country.</i>

26:15.115 --> 26:17.951
<i>Okay, what are you hiding?</i>

26:20.537 --> 26:22.831
<i>Ironed T-shirts and traveling</i>
<i>with his watch collection indicates</i>

26:22.914 --> 26:26.668
<i>some sociopathy, but on their own,</i>
<i>they don't make Roald you.</i>

26:26.751 --> 26:29.546
<i>And there were no red flags</i>
<i>when I scoured the Internet.</i>

26:30.338 --> 26:32.507
<i>He's every bit of the aristocracy.</i>

26:32.590 --> 26:35.302
<i>Father built on inherited wealth</i>
<i>to become a successful land developer.</i>

26:35.385 --> 26:36.886
<i>Mother's an old-money socialite.</i>

26:36.970 --> 26:39.806
<i>For his 6th birthday,</i>
<i>Roald's parents donated 2 million</i>

26:39.889 --> 26:41.808
<i>to have a dinosaur named after him.</i>

26:41.891 --> 26:43.643
<i>"Roaldasaurus Burtei."</i>

26:43.727 --> 26:46.896
<i>In addition to making gobs</i>
<i>snatching up properties,</i>

26:46.980 --> 26:49.899
<i>Roald, quote,</i>
<i>"works as a landscape photographer,"</i>

26:49.983 --> 26:52.485
<i>hence his ever-present $20,000 camera.</i>

27:11.212 --> 27:13.923
<i>Probably all depressing pictures</i>
<i>of elm trees, but...</i>

27:14.007 --> 27:15.717
<i>Wait, what have we here?</i>

27:20.555 --> 27:22.223
<i>I know this neck.</i>

27:26.311 --> 27:29.064
<i>These are all Kate.</i>

27:29.147 --> 27:32.233
<i>Long-lens photos of bees</i>
<i>are cover for stalking her.</i>

27:32.317 --> 27:34.861
<i>Roald doesn't just love her.</i>
<i>He's obsessed.</i>

27:35.403 --> 27:37.405
<i>But then why threaten to kill her?</i>

27:37.489 --> 27:39.741
<i>Unless it was never a real threat,</i>
<i>more of a test.</i>

27:39.824 --> 27:41.826
<i>Of how far I'd go to protect her?</i>

27:41.910 --> 27:42.994
We're going upstairs.

27:50.668 --> 27:51.961
Jonathan.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.506
You missed a great swim.

27:54.589 --> 27:57.759
-Got caught up on some research.
-Oh, you academics.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.810
Right. See you boys at dinner.

28:12.899 --> 28:15.902
By the way, I heard
that this weekend was your idea.

28:16.945 --> 28:20.365
I think it's a great opportunity for us
to get to know each other better.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.954
<i>Gave him an opportunity and nothing.</i>

28:26.621 --> 28:30.542
<i>If he is you, you have other ideas</i>
<i>on how this is going to go.</i>

28:37.048 --> 28:40.802
<i>It's becoming impossible to do</i>
<i>what I came here to do.</i>

28:42.679 --> 28:44.431
<i>Last night became a hostage situation.</i>

28:44.514 --> 28:46.433
<i>Thanks to Connie's investment in Chelsea,</i>

28:46.516 --> 28:50.019
<i>I was trapped watching footy</i>
<i>with raging blotto hooligans.</i>

28:53.732 --> 28:55.734
It's so much nicer here, isn't it?

28:56.609 --> 28:59.946
I may just drink Bloody Marys
in the sunlight till I die.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.366
<i>Well, Sophie remains a tragic mess.</i>

29:03.450 --> 29:04.451
Have one.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.219
-Ow.
-Gemma!

29:25.597 --> 29:26.931
You love when I do that.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.558
Gemma, he doesn't,

29:28.641 --> 29:29.893
and neither do I.

29:29.976 --> 29:32.020
Some people deserve to be spanked.

29:33.521 --> 29:35.440
I thought you two were friends.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.985
I actually think I despise her.

29:39.068 --> 29:42.697
She was fine at uni,
but if something doesn't grow, it rots.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.199
Especially when you have means,

29:44.282 --> 29:47.452
you have to decide
not to be the absolute worst.

29:47.535 --> 29:49.287
Oh, excuse me, sir.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.837
What--? What is that look?

29:59.589 --> 30:00.590
What look?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.134
I think I know, but...

30:03.760 --> 30:06.721
I want to know
if you know what I think I know.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.724
I don't know what you mean.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.018
Mm-hm.

30:26.741 --> 30:28.701
I was thinking about some tennis.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.995
My day's full up. Sorry.

30:31.538 --> 30:32.539
Next time.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.798
<i>He did not want me to see that.</i>

30:48.847 --> 30:50.139
I think you're right.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.267
We ought to get to know each other better.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.018
Shall we hunt?

31:01.609 --> 31:04.362
<i>What could possibly go wrong</i>
<i>in this situation?</i>

31:06.155 --> 31:07.657
How's that feel for you?

31:07.740 --> 31:10.869
<i>Given that I believe in gun control,</i>
<i>pretty abhorrent.</i>

31:10.952 --> 31:12.328
It has a nice weight to it.

31:14.330 --> 31:16.875
Father used to say
you can see the true mettle of a man

31:16.958 --> 31:18.877
out in the woods with a weapon.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.462
<i>Did Father also tell you</i>
<i>it's a great time to let a man know</i>

31:21.546 --> 31:23.840
<i>you've been text-torturing him for weeks?</i>

31:23.923 --> 31:25.633
<i>No way I'm killing one of those.</i>

31:25.717 --> 31:27.927
<i>They keep them in a cage</i>
<i>and release them to be shot.</i>

31:28.011 --> 31:29.012
<i>It's deranged.</i>

31:39.355 --> 31:41.316
<i>Well, he's capable of murder.</i>

31:41.941 --> 31:43.902
So you came to us
through Malcolm, correct?

31:43.985 --> 31:45.320
More Kate, actually.

31:45.403 --> 31:47.155
She was in a bind and I...

31:47.822 --> 31:48.948
helped her out.

31:51.868 --> 31:52.994
Funny...

31:54.329 --> 31:57.540
I've never seen Katie in a bind
she's not gotten out of herself.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.501
She must've been formidable
back at Oxford?

32:01.210 --> 32:03.171
We've known each other
far longer than that.

32:04.505 --> 32:05.340
We were...

32:05.924 --> 32:07.216
God, 15.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.218
Same boarding school in Rhode Island.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.803
<i>Kate lived in the States?</i>

32:10.887 --> 32:14.223
She'd been through a rough time.
I'm sure you've heard about Greta.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.351
Yeah, her mom, the model?

32:17.644 --> 32:20.563
Greta'd cracked up,
slit her wrists over some man.

32:21.147 --> 32:23.191
Katie was sent off
when she was in hospital.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.110
She was always so together.

32:26.861 --> 32:29.280
Always had to be the mother,
so never shed a tear.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.783
Always looking
for the next little disaster to save.

32:33.201 --> 32:36.037
She still does that.
Explains Phoebe, doesn't it?

32:36.120 --> 32:37.455
<i>He's in love with her.</i>

32:38.539 --> 32:39.832
And you, I'd imagine.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.709
<i>And hates me.</i>

32:43.086 --> 32:45.880
But I'm sure you know this history,
if you know Kate at all.

32:55.890 --> 32:58.685
At any rate,
I've always looked out for her.

32:59.602 --> 33:00.603
Always will.

33:01.813 --> 33:05.149
-<i>Going how far?</i>
-It's great that she has you.

33:16.035 --> 33:18.121
Be a shame to return home
with a cold barrel.

33:18.204 --> 33:19.247
<i>Fuck.</i>

33:31.217 --> 33:32.385
<i>Fuck you, Roald.</i>

33:33.011 --> 33:33.845
<i>No.</i>

33:35.221 --> 33:36.681
Jesus, Moore.

33:36.764 --> 33:39.142
That's the worst shot I've ever seen.

33:39.767 --> 33:41.352
Not a hunter, I guess.

33:44.480 --> 33:47.400
I make it a point to get to know
those Katie becomes close with.

33:48.401 --> 33:52.363
Callous to say, but Malcolm wasn't
appropriate for a woman like her.

33:52.905 --> 33:55.825
He was a taker,
not to mention a liar and a joke.

33:55.908 --> 33:58.161
<i>This has taken an interesting turn.</i>

33:58.244 --> 33:59.245
And Simon,

34:00.204 --> 34:02.165
she wrongly believed that he was a genius,

34:02.248 --> 34:05.793
and there she goes pouring her energy
down a black hole.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.254
<i>Okay, seething ball of rage. Noted.</i>

34:09.630 --> 34:11.841
I just couldn't bear to watch it.

34:11.924 --> 34:13.176
<i>So, you did what?</i>

34:15.094 --> 34:18.681
In all honesty, she really does have
the worst taste in companions.

34:18.765 --> 34:20.266
<i>Is this a confession?</i>

34:20.349 --> 34:22.810
Lucky for her, they seem to wind up dead.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.282
Jonathan, you go on ahead.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.117
We'll catch up.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.079
<i>Well, he won't hurt her,</i>

34:41.162 --> 34:43.289
<i>but what am I going to do about him?</i>

34:55.093 --> 34:56.511
Always were a good shot.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.387
Found someone new to bully, have you?

34:58.471 --> 34:59.472
Oh, come on.

35:00.181 --> 35:03.226
If he can't take it,
he really is a worthless bag of mush.

35:03.309 --> 35:04.560
You're armed.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.562
So is he. So are you.

35:06.646 --> 35:09.148
So, too, are we all.
One to one's not fair?

35:12.819 --> 35:15.613
-Why do you do this to yourself?
-Oh, God.

35:16.781 --> 35:19.117
Whatever it is you think
you want to say, don't.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.451
Boys.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.078
Lost little boys.

35:22.161 --> 35:23.663
It was fine for a while.

35:23.746 --> 35:26.082
And continues to be none of your business.

35:26.165 --> 35:28.417
I beg to differ,
with a murderer on the loose.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.921
Are you telling me I need a man?

35:32.672 --> 35:34.590
A big, strong man to protect me?

35:34.674 --> 35:36.884
No. I'm saying you need an equal.

35:37.510 --> 35:39.095
And that's you.

35:39.178 --> 35:40.346
Well, yes.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.393
It's who we are,
but it's also what we are.

35:45.476 --> 35:48.521
-That is rubbish.
-No. It's simply how things work.

35:49.272 --> 35:52.775
Roll your eyes, but if you ever want
to finally be happy,

35:52.859 --> 35:54.861
you can do it by claiming your place.

35:54.944 --> 35:57.530
I won't let you sneer because it's true.

35:57.613 --> 36:00.700
The stupid world
of stupid brutes is burning,

36:00.783 --> 36:05.037
and I can't watch you burn with them
based on some stupid principle.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.372
You actually--?

36:07.206 --> 36:10.334
How about stopping it from burning?

36:11.085 --> 36:14.505
Instead of suggesting
we watch from our thrones

36:14.589 --> 36:16.215
on your yacht on the moon.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.967
The two aren't mutually exclusive.

36:18.551 --> 36:21.762
Doing any real good is predicated
on having real power.

36:22.763 --> 36:26.434
-You have cut yourself off at the knees.
-I'll take it under advisement.

36:26.517 --> 36:29.020
I love your stubbornness, luckily for you.

36:30.521 --> 36:31.939
And your good heart.

36:33.107 --> 36:35.651
-I don't have one of those.
-You do.

36:36.277 --> 36:37.987
And it tortures you.

36:42.783 --> 36:43.826
But I can wait.

36:44.702 --> 36:45.786
I'm good at that.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.457
I'm not like you,

36:50.082 --> 36:52.210
or your family, or your bloodline.

36:52.293 --> 36:55.046
That is your fantasy

36:55.129 --> 36:57.006
and it always has been.

37:27.495 --> 37:28.496
Hopeless.

37:30.623 --> 37:31.624
Hand them over.

37:54.063 --> 37:56.607
<i>No, no. Definitely not going there.</i>

37:56.691 --> 37:58.234
Hold still. What's wrong with you?

38:00.695 --> 38:02.571
<i>No, really. Stop.</i>

38:06.867 --> 38:08.536
Stop fussing.

38:27.805 --> 38:29.181
-We should stop.
-Yeah.

38:33.269 --> 38:34.103
We should.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.357
-Okay.
-Yeah.

38:38.441 --> 38:39.734
-Stopping.
-Yeah, stopping.

38:39.817 --> 38:41.277
In a second.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.738
Oh, fuck.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.896
"How do we taste?" is the question.

39:16.979 --> 39:19.482
Like expensive booze, naturally,

39:19.565 --> 39:21.067
but with the effect of poison.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.444
I think anything they taste is bitter

39:23.527 --> 39:25.988
because they're consumed with resentment.

39:29.116 --> 39:31.452
It's why they love Rhys so much.
He banters.

39:31.535 --> 39:33.871
What a bloody coward, skipping out on us.

39:33.954 --> 39:38.334
Admit that you are better than them
and that's why you should run things.

39:38.417 --> 39:40.211
They do it to themselves.

39:40.294 --> 39:42.213
Poverty consciousness makes you poor.

39:42.963 --> 39:44.715
Says the born princess.

39:44.799 --> 39:47.051
I was very positive in a past life.

39:49.470 --> 39:52.181
-<i>Someone drop a bomb on this house.</i>
-Excuse me.

39:53.265 --> 39:55.559
Talk about nice things.

40:02.817 --> 40:04.068
I do wonder, though.

40:05.194 --> 40:06.195
Jonathan?

40:08.406 --> 40:10.950
Do you harbor resentment for what we have

40:11.033 --> 40:12.993
that people like yourself do not?

40:13.744 --> 40:16.205
<i>What, pompousness, black hearts?</i>

40:20.167 --> 40:22.002
I'm pretty happy with my life.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.713
-Are you?
-What if...

40:25.631 --> 40:28.801
Jonathan were the killer?

40:28.884 --> 40:31.220
<i>Okay, someone needs to cut her off.</i>

40:33.389 --> 40:36.434
People did start dying
around the time you showed up

40:36.517 --> 40:40.229
with your whole bargain-bin
Colin Firth thing.

40:42.481 --> 40:44.984
Aw. Do you resent us, Jonathan?

40:45.609 --> 40:47.403
Do you wish us all dead?

40:47.486 --> 40:49.238
Give it a rest, Gemma. You--

40:53.033 --> 40:54.743
Here's what I find peculiar.

40:55.995 --> 40:58.247
That the one among us
racing to the defense

40:58.330 --> 41:02.501
of the impoverished professor
would be the first to the guillotine.

41:04.336 --> 41:07.214
I worry you've had some sort of episode.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.299
Amnesia.

41:08.883 --> 41:12.136
Because you seem to truly believe
you're not one of us.

41:16.056 --> 41:17.391
<i>What's happening?</i>

41:20.728 --> 41:21.854
Oh, please.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.024
Tell me he knows.

41:29.403 --> 41:31.363
Why hide it from him?

41:34.158 --> 41:35.576
He's no one.

41:36.869 --> 41:38.204
That's enough.

41:38.287 --> 41:40.706
Oh, it just seems like such work.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.417
God, all those lies.

41:43.501 --> 41:44.919
And to think,

41:45.002 --> 41:47.463
Daddy's not even watching.

41:54.970 --> 41:58.557
Pardon the interruption, sir,
but I have some terrible news.

41:58.641 --> 41:59.975
Lady Phoebe...

42:00.768 --> 42:01.602
is dead.

42:05.773 --> 42:08.776
Out of respect, I recommend
we retire to the library at once.

42:08.859 --> 42:09.735
The drawing room.

42:09.818 --> 42:14.448
We retire to the drawing room at once
to discuss how we might find her killer.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.450
<i>You've got to be kidding me.</i>

42:16.534 --> 42:17.701
Before he kills again.

42:18.327 --> 42:21.288
Before he kills again.

42:27.920 --> 42:28.754
<i>Okay.</i>

42:28.837 --> 42:31.423
So, in the envelopes you were given
on the way in,

42:31.507 --> 42:34.760
you have to find out
what weapon you've been assigned.

42:34.843 --> 42:35.886
Yeah.

42:35.970 --> 42:38.847
Lazy sods over there, listen up.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.683
All right, cunty two flaps.

42:41.308 --> 42:44.562
We know the rules
because we play it every time.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.065
Anyway, if the murderer pokes you...

42:48.148 --> 42:50.693
<i>They're playing</i>
<i>a "find the killer" parlor game.</i>

42:50.776 --> 42:52.945
<i>-Unironically.</i>
-...with style, okay?

42:53.028 --> 42:53.862
Ready?

42:53.946 --> 42:55.155
-Ready!
-Go!

42:58.659 --> 43:01.870
<i>I need to make the most of the cover</i>
<i>provided by their horrifying game,</i>

43:01.954 --> 43:05.958
<i>go back to Roald's room,</i>
<i>finish the job, find proof he's you.</i>

43:15.342 --> 43:17.803
I guess it's safe to assume
neither one of us is the murderer.

43:19.847 --> 43:20.681
Uh...

43:21.807 --> 43:22.808
I don't know...

43:23.642 --> 43:26.687
what that was down there...

43:27.896 --> 43:29.398
but it didn't seem nice.

43:31.817 --> 43:33.068
Who promised nice?

43:34.570 --> 43:38.365
Getting away from a killer, yes,
but being any less awful to one another,

43:39.241 --> 43:40.618
what fun would that be?

43:41.493 --> 43:42.953
You know, Roald, I--

43:43.037 --> 43:44.079
I get.

43:45.247 --> 43:47.583
But Gemma is just...

43:49.084 --> 43:50.085
vile.

43:50.878 --> 43:52.463
No, that's cheating!

43:54.673 --> 43:57.343
I suppose you have questions.

43:57.968 --> 44:01.096
No, I was just hoping
I could hide behind you, if that's cool.

44:01.764 --> 44:02.890
Right.

44:07.102 --> 44:08.854
My father is...

44:10.689 --> 44:11.940
Tom Lockwood.

44:12.941 --> 44:14.610
I don't know who that is.

44:14.693 --> 44:18.197
<i>My search yielded a vivid picture of Mom</i>
<i>but no firm bead on Dad.</i>

44:18.280 --> 44:20.282
<i>Could've been a champion surfer,</i>
<i>or the stone,</i>

44:20.366 --> 44:23.327
<i>or one of several artists</i>
<i>and nightclub promoters.</i>

44:23.410 --> 44:25.954
He's what's called an activist investor.

44:26.038 --> 44:27.831
-Activist--?
-Corporate raider,

44:27.915 --> 44:31.043
butcher, Attila, Solomon.

44:31.126 --> 44:33.504
There isn't an industry
he hasn't had hands in.

44:33.587 --> 44:36.590
He's one of the more powerful men
on the planet.

44:36.674 --> 44:39.760
<i>And I thought she was</i>
<i>the only one here who needed a job.</i>

44:39.843 --> 44:42.554
That's what Roald was getting at
when he said I'm like him.

44:42.638 --> 44:44.640
My family are wealthier than any of them,

44:44.723 --> 44:47.726
and, well, on that side anyway.

44:48.394 --> 44:49.978
You don't go by Lockwood.

44:50.062 --> 44:52.272
Yes. There's something about
how he makes money

44:52.356 --> 44:54.316
stripping businesses for parts,

44:54.400 --> 44:57.236
destroying workers' lives
for shareholder profit.

44:57.319 --> 44:58.529
-Right.
-That's not the worst.

44:58.612 --> 45:02.574
It's the backroom deals
to sic police on protesters,

45:02.658 --> 45:07.037
or the cleansing of a CEO's record
of sexual assault.

45:07.121 --> 45:08.414
All the time, he...

45:10.416 --> 45:15.379
paid to have
well-water toxicity reports falsified.

45:17.673 --> 45:19.133
No one found out,

45:19.216 --> 45:22.302
and several children got cancer,

45:22.386 --> 45:25.931
and the company made 400 million pounds.

45:29.726 --> 45:31.937
My father is the worst man alive,

45:32.020 --> 45:34.731
and I'm his favorite daughter.

45:35.274 --> 45:38.569
<i>Everything about her suddenly makes sense.</i>

45:42.322 --> 45:43.365
We've--

45:43.449 --> 45:46.452
We've been estranged since I was 20.

45:48.412 --> 45:50.998
I wrapped my head around what he is

45:51.081 --> 45:54.626
and what he made me be a part of,

45:54.710 --> 45:56.420
and I cut all ties.

45:57.045 --> 46:01.675
-So these security guys outside your--
-Yes, you're very perceptive.

46:01.758 --> 46:02.593
He...

46:03.760 --> 46:06.805
I said no, but he sent them anyway.

46:06.889 --> 46:11.226
A killer is a perfect excuse
for him to protect me...

46:12.102 --> 46:14.897
aka, get in my life.

46:23.739 --> 46:25.741
I just want to make my own way, Jonathan.

46:25.824 --> 46:29.786
I just want to be a person
and not even a great one, just decent.

46:29.870 --> 46:32.998
Then someone comes along
to remind me how foolish I am

46:33.081 --> 46:37.377
to think I could ever be anything
other than Tom Lockwood's daughter.

46:40.005 --> 46:41.256
I get that.

46:41.340 --> 46:43.383
Thank you, but that's--

46:43.467 --> 46:46.303
You can't possibly.

46:47.179 --> 46:50.641
Oh, no, I can't possibly know
what it's like to feel cursed

46:50.724 --> 46:52.893
by your past and your blood.

46:53.685 --> 46:57.773
And to see every little slip as proof
that you can never get away.

46:59.316 --> 47:00.651
What happened to you?

47:03.278 --> 47:05.781
My story isn't as exciting
as yours, but...

47:08.367 --> 47:09.493
I know the feeling.

47:15.541 --> 47:16.542
I actually...

47:17.709 --> 47:18.961
I believe you.

47:20.003 --> 47:21.129
Well, I believe

47:21.964 --> 47:24.967
you can be the person you want to be.

47:27.052 --> 47:30.222
In fact, I think you're already her.

47:33.559 --> 47:35.936
<i>No. What is happening?</i>

47:40.566 --> 47:43.277
<i>No. No, this can't be happening.</i>

47:43.360 --> 47:44.945
<i>I can't fall for her.</i>

47:45.779 --> 47:47.948
Fuck a duck!
What is all of this?

47:48.824 --> 47:50.951
You two slugs, back in the game.

47:54.705 --> 47:56.915
-We should get back in the game.
-Of course.

48:07.676 --> 48:10.512
Bloody tossers killed me!

48:12.264 --> 48:13.599
I'll take that, mate!

48:18.520 --> 48:21.440
There you are. I was wondering
when you'd find me.

48:24.401 --> 48:26.320
-We can't.
-Since when?

48:26.403 --> 48:27.738
Since now, okay?

48:27.821 --> 48:29.990
-Things are different, I can't--
-Can't do what?

48:32.826 --> 48:33.702
I mean it.

48:35.495 --> 48:36.330
Sorry.

48:45.255 --> 48:48.634
<i>I missed something</i>
<i>searching Roald's room: proof it's you.</i>

48:56.642 --> 48:58.894
<i>Okay, where is it?</i>

48:58.977 --> 49:01.355
<i>The thing that proves to me you are him.</i>

49:02.773 --> 49:05.400
<i>New mysterious box.</i>
<i>Okay, that's something.</i>

49:11.657 --> 49:13.492
<i>What's in here, Roald?</i>

49:14.117 --> 49:17.287
<i>Is your phone in here?</i>
<i>The weapon you used to harass me?</i>

49:17.371 --> 49:18.664
Help you with that?

49:20.624 --> 49:22.125
What are you doing in my room?

49:22.209 --> 49:24.169
-Not what it looks like.
-It's you, isn't it?

49:24.252 --> 49:27.547
-You kill Malcolm because you love Kate?
-No. Did you?

49:28.173 --> 49:32.344
You know, it's funny, this game.
Every year, someone gets hurt.

49:47.150 --> 49:49.611
<i>Ah. Ow.</i>

50:05.877 --> 50:08.380
<i>Must have known that wouldn't kill me.</i>

50:08.463 --> 50:11.299
<i>I'd wager the goal was more sadistic.</i>

50:12.342 --> 50:13.343
<i>Pain.</i>

50:14.302 --> 50:16.722
<i>Hmm. And humiliation.</i>

50:17.681 --> 50:18.682
<i>Fucker.</i>

50:22.894 --> 50:24.354
<i>I'm getting too old for this.</i>

50:28.358 --> 50:29.735
<i>Fuck all of them.</i>

50:31.027 --> 50:34.364
<i>I guess somebody won,</i>
<i>and they're back to booze and blow.</i>

50:39.745 --> 50:42.205
<i>At least all the screaming is over,</i>
<i>so I can think.</i>

50:45.167 --> 50:46.668
<i>Fuck, that sounded real.</i>

50:54.551 --> 50:55.635
<i>Where's Kate?</i>

50:59.931 --> 51:01.224
Kate!

51:04.019 --> 51:05.020
Kate!
