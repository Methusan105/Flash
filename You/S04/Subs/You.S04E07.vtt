00:18.017 --> 00:19.310
<i>Previously on</i> You:

00:19.310 --> 00:22.981
This woman kidnapped me, then she tried
to carve up my arm and kill Jonathan.

00:22.981 --> 00:26.943
- Phoebe, will you marry me? I need you.
- Me or my money? Sort your problems out.

00:26.943 --> 00:32.490
My father is Tom Lockwood, he's really one
of the more powerful men on the planet.

00:32.490 --> 00:36.327
I have a past too, Jonathan,
with another name.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.872
All I want is to never be her again.

00:39.873 --> 00:43.126
Find someone to frame for it.
Otherwise you're going down for all of it.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.336
She's the Eat The Rich Killer.

00:46.129 --> 00:49.132
He's the kind of man
who knows more than he lets on.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.885
- One last thing. Tom Lockwood.
-  Kate's father.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.053
We're gonna have so much fun killing him.

01:02.645 --> 01:05.774
<i>Things I've learned about Kate
on our first real date:</i>

01:07.734 --> 01:10.528
<i>She's unpretentious,
just wanted to go for a walk in the city.</i>

01:13.406 --> 01:15.492
<i>Doesn't take herself too seriously.</i>

01:15.492 --> 01:16.868
<i>Really listens.</i>

01:16.868 --> 01:18.995
<i>And has almost a psychic ability to call--</i>

01:18.995 --> 01:21.539
I can hear you thinking. Spit it out.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.293
I'm just admiring the view.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.337
Oh, God, you are a clichÃ©.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.509
- Do normal girls fall for that?
- You tell me, are you seduced?

01:32.509 --> 01:35.011
Yes, of course,
because I'm the height of normalcy.

01:38.890 --> 01:41.684
Jonathan, darling, is this it?

01:41.684 --> 01:44.103
-  Is this what?
- Our future neighborhood.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.608
Where we start our normal family.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.567
Ah.

01:49.567 --> 01:52.612
After our normal wedding
and live our normal lives.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.031
- Should we put an offer in on a house?
- I don't know.

01:55.031 --> 01:58.660
It's a tough commute
from your thriving, independent gallery.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.577
Yes.

01:59.577 --> 02:02.831
Uh, although, cycling distance
from the university.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.958
- And my rare bookstore.
- Yes. Yes.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.628
Which, against all expectations,
is also thriving.

02:10.755 --> 02:13.424
This merely supports
our joint charity for...

02:13.424 --> 02:14.551
Mm.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.594
- For?
- For orphans.

02:16.594 --> 02:17.887
Orphans. Mm-hm.

02:18.513 --> 02:19.806
Uh, we teach them to read.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.141
And swim.

02:21.766 --> 02:22.851
And make art.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.855
- Lucky fucking orphans.
- I've always thought so.

02:27.605 --> 02:31.401
<i>Underneath the jokes, the armor,
she's a romantic.</i>

02:33.653 --> 02:36.698
<i>It's bittersweet
that this feels like our first real date</i>

02:36.698 --> 02:39.659
<i>and our last night on earth.</i>

02:40.535 --> 02:42.787
<i>Tomorrow, Kate's father comes to town.</i>

02:43.538 --> 02:45.498
<i>Tom Lockwood, the devil.</i>

02:45.498 --> 02:47.250
We're gonna have so much fun killing him.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.334
No.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.421
No, I am done.

02:52.046 --> 02:56.050
I framed an innocent woman
for what you did.

02:56.050 --> 02:59.596
Did you also frame her
for all of your Stateside oopsies, Joe?

03:00.305 --> 03:03.516
You are the only reason to blame

03:03.516 --> 03:06.102
for all of the leverage I have over you.

03:06.728 --> 03:07.729
Look.

03:08.897 --> 03:12.275
By any measure,
the world's better off without Lockwood.

03:12.275 --> 03:15.069
He steals, destroys, causes cancer,

03:15.069 --> 03:17.864
and he'd love to shove his fist
up the London infrastructure.

03:17.864 --> 03:22.118
He is the breed of influence-peddling
corruption I'm trying to expunge.

03:22.118 --> 03:26.706
- You can't murder your way into office.
- That's for the voters to decide.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.626
- What does he have on you?
- Joe.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.796
I have nothing to hide.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.090
The man is untouchable.

03:36.090 --> 03:39.093
- What am I supposed to do? Sink his yacht?
- You'll figure it out.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.262
Rhys, it's a military opera-- What?

03:41.846 --> 03:45.350
I'll make you this promise,
this is the last thing I ever ask of you.

03:46.100 --> 03:50.939
Let the black blood of Tom Lockwood wash
all the other blood from your hands.

03:52.565 --> 03:58.112
You won't only make London a better place,
you'll be balancing your karmic scales.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.281
Forever.

04:01.741 --> 04:02.909
<i>Aha.</i>

04:02.909 --> 04:05.328
<i>All I want is to tell the world
the truth about you,</i>

04:05.328 --> 04:08.206
<i>but you'd tell them about me.
So I need to know.</i>

04:08.206 --> 04:11.501
<i>Why are you really afraid of Lockwood?</i>

04:13.503 --> 04:16.214
<i>I need to get closer to Kate's dad
to find out how to take you down.</i>

04:20.510 --> 04:22.679
- Well?
- It's fine?

04:26.849 --> 04:30.270
No, I'm sorry.
I mean, it's actually subpar at best.

04:30.270 --> 04:34.190
All the Indian restaurants in London,
that's your regular haunt?

04:34.190 --> 04:36.359
- Well...
- Crappy place around the corner from--

04:37.068 --> 04:39.070
What is that? A condemned bomb shelter?

04:39.988 --> 04:41.906
Okay, all right, fine.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.909
Take me somewhere better.
I'm a creature of habit.

04:44.909 --> 04:48.079
- Take me somewhere better.
- Can't believe you're still eating that.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.916
Okay. All right,
you pick the food forever, fine.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.045
What are you doing tomorrow?

04:57.505 --> 05:00.591
<i>A really long pause,
traditionally not a great sign.</i>

05:02.635 --> 05:05.805
- What?
- Oh, I would really love to,

05:06.431 --> 05:09.392
but I have to go out of London tomorrow.

05:10.935 --> 05:14.272
<i>To visit her secret husband
she's about to tell me about?</i>

05:14.981 --> 05:16.316
My father's coming in.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.944
<i>And here's my opening.
Cue the surgical precision.</i>

05:21.738 --> 05:22.864
Does that work?

05:24.282 --> 05:26.367
Icing him out?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.995
In that I avoid him. Yes.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.125
Can I make a tiny suggestion?
Or I can shut up.

05:34.125 --> 05:38.171
No, no, no. I mean,
I'm not exactly a Zen master about this.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.714
What if...

05:41.215 --> 05:42.633
you just went to dinner?

05:43.134 --> 05:44.927
Show him you're secure...

05:45.762 --> 05:46.763
and happy...

05:47.680 --> 05:49.307
and past it all.

05:49.307 --> 05:53.644
Use your fake boyfriend. He'll help
underscore the secure and happy bit,

05:53.644 --> 05:58.024
and he can, you know, reach under
the table and hold your hand.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.109
You'd do that for me?

06:02.070 --> 06:03.613
I would do a lot for you.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.870
I'm gonna need you
to change the subject by kissing me.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.041
<i>I didn't know it would be like this.</i>

06:20.129 --> 06:22.173
<i>We've barely grazed the surface.</i>

06:36.270 --> 06:38.940
Take me home,
you bland-palate'd white knight.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.860
<i>So despite how complicated
her feelings about him are,</i>

06:43.986 --> 06:45.905
<i>I really hope
I don't have to kill her father.</i>

07:03.464 --> 07:07.635
-  Do something to your hair?
- Um, no, same as it always is.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.347
So much coverage
on this Eat The Rich Killer,

07:11.347 --> 07:14.058
but there's so little actual information.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.144
Everyone just loves a crazy woman.

07:16.894 --> 07:19.105
What more do you need? We were there.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.190
I was there.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.985
You, fuffing about by the open bar.

07:23.985 --> 07:27.613
People draw hasty conclusions
in the name of a good story.

07:28.573 --> 07:31.742
- I get the sense we're not going to lunch.
- Oh, shit.

07:31.742 --> 07:33.953
No, no, it's fine.

07:35.037 --> 07:39.167
Tell me what you're working on.
I know that face. Some puzzle.

07:40.334 --> 07:41.169
Um...

07:43.045 --> 07:46.841
Okay, right. Let's say
that I was writing a whodunit

07:47.425 --> 07:50.928
based on a bunch
of celebrity-level socialites.

07:50.928 --> 07:53.222
- Good idea.
- Right? So wouldn't the suspect

07:53.222 --> 07:56.601
being an erotomaniac be
a little bit too obvious?

07:57.226 --> 08:00.146
A better twist would be
an average Joe kind of--

08:00.730 --> 08:02.106
Someone like Professor Moore?

08:04.901 --> 08:06.777
I never said that, but...

08:09.447 --> 08:10.823
Too bonkers to be plausible.

08:10.823 --> 08:14.869
It's just, it's this nagging feeling
I have that he knows something.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.622
It's annoying me
that it's distracting me so much.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.917
- So theoretically...
- Theoretically.

08:20.917 --> 08:27.215
...if-- if I were to try and disprove
my own stupid conspiracy theory,

08:27.215 --> 08:29.467
like, how would I get close
to Professor Moore?

08:30.843 --> 08:31.844
You could shag him.

08:34.013 --> 08:37.517
Theoretically. Sorry, I was joking.
I wasn't talking about--

08:37.517 --> 08:39.101
It was a Freudian slip.

08:39.101 --> 08:41.979
Glad I trusted you,
so you can just forget it.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.649
- Wait. Wait, Nadia.
- Forget all of it.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.276
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that. Nadia.

08:54.325 --> 08:58.871
<i>Tonight, I meet Tom Lockwood
face-to-face as Kate's boyfriend.</i>

09:00.540 --> 09:03.042
<i>Classic rom-com setup.
Hopefully it doesn't end in death.</i>

09:03.042 --> 09:07.588
<i>But to arm myself, I need a fuller
portrait of the ruthless, amoral CEO.</i>

09:08.172 --> 09:11.801
<i>This is him?
He looks like a country-club golf pro.</i>

09:11.801 --> 09:15.346
<i>Scholarship kid, athlete, first in
his class at everything. CEO at 26.</i>

09:16.597 --> 09:18.724
<i>And once he came into his own, well,</i>

09:19.267 --> 09:22.103
<i>Kate told me
some atrocities he's committed.</i>

09:26.482 --> 09:30.194
<i>What's most terrifying is
how underreported all those things are</i>

09:30.194 --> 09:33.072
<i>and the speed at which
I'm redirected to charity work.</i>

09:33.072 --> 09:36.784
<i>Evidently the more foundations a man names
after himself, the more he has to hide.</i>

09:37.285 --> 09:40.621
<i>I've never found so little
about a figure so public.</i>

09:41.372 --> 09:43.207
<i>Does this guy control the Internet?</i>

09:45.501 --> 09:47.753
- Yeah?
- Hey, professor.

09:48.296 --> 09:51.757
Um, I was wondering if you had a chance
to read my story.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.259
<i>Shit. I never opened it.</i>

09:53.259 --> 09:57.597
I'm sorry it's been crazy. I started it
and then I got distracted, and--

09:57.597 --> 09:59.390
Okay, no, it's fine.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.476
I'm glad because I think
I still need another twist.

10:02.476 --> 10:06.147
Um, so I've been riffing off
of what happened at Sundry House.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.648
 <i>I know where this is going.</i>

10:07.648 --> 10:10.735
You were in the room.
Did you get any sense

10:10.735 --> 10:13.613
of Dawn Brown's motivation
for killing Malcolm or cutting him up?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.031
<i>Shut it down. Shut it down.</i>

10:15.031 --> 10:18.576
- Or Simon. Why keep--?
- I don't wanna hurt your feelings,

10:18.576 --> 10:21.495
but the reason I couldn't finish
your story is because,

10:21.495 --> 10:23.623
by page 15, you'd already lost me.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.082
It's too complicated.

10:25.082 --> 10:30.171
Just figure out what you are trying to say
before you throw in any more plot twists.

10:30.171 --> 10:34.008
<i>Pains me to sting her, but I can't have my
smartest student asking smart questions.</i>

10:34.759 --> 10:37.762
Okay. Well, thanks for giving me a shot.

10:37.762 --> 10:38.804
Yeah.

10:43.225 --> 10:47.355
Could I just ask, did you get
why Miranda needed to leave home?

10:47.355 --> 10:49.440
- Did that make sense?
- Of course.

10:49.440 --> 10:53.027
No, your character work is great,
always, but just simplify.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.071
Mm.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.489
Thanks.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.832
<i>Dinner with Kate's dad,</i>

11:08.250 --> 11:11.003
<i>moral support for her
while sizing him up for you.</i>

11:12.088 --> 11:14.632
Remember, he's pure evil
and you're going to love him.

11:25.601 --> 11:26.435
Katherine.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.980
- Wow, it's been too long.
- Dad.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.026
I forgot how you light up a room.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.863
Dad, this is Jonathan.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.032
He teaches literature at Darcy College,

11:40.032 --> 11:42.701
we're seeing each other and it's serious.

11:42.701 --> 11:45.204
So I thought he ought to meet
the infamous patriarch.

11:45.830 --> 11:46.831
Shall we sit?

11:49.917 --> 11:50.751
Serious, huh?

11:51.419 --> 11:54.672
Well, looking forward
to getting to know you.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.299
Joe.

11:58.926 --> 11:59.927
<i>No.</i>

12:08.269 --> 12:09.103
Thank you.

12:09.103 --> 12:12.398
<i>Okay, he knows my real name.
So he knows about Madre Linda.</i>

12:12.398 --> 12:16.235
<i>No guarantee he knows everything
about me. Not like you.</i>

12:17.528 --> 12:21.031
<i>She's working to give him nothing,
but he's charming his way under her skin.</i>

12:21.031 --> 12:24.869
Well, how are you really, honey?
I know it's been tough.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.830
So sorry about your losses.

12:27.830 --> 12:31.459
You mean, my murdered boyfriend?
Or my other dead friends?

12:31.459 --> 12:33.669
Yeah, it's been tough.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.629
Tragic is what I mean.

12:36.714 --> 12:37.548
Painful.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.552
Sad, unfair, I'm just very sorry.

12:43.345 --> 12:46.307
It's fine, Dad.
Talk about literally anything else.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.766
<i>Kate was right.</i>

12:47.766 --> 12:50.811
<i>He's deceptively down-to-earth,
likable even.</i>

12:50.811 --> 12:52.563
So, Jonathan...

12:53.772 --> 12:55.149
what is it you teach?

12:55.149 --> 12:59.195
- Light on interrogation, please.
- No, no, it's fine, it's fine.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.198
Um, American short fiction currently.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.742
Ah. I'm a nonfiction man myself.

13:05.701 --> 13:10.122
I guess Roosevelt's <i>Rough Riders</i>
is my own personal bible.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.041
<i>Manifest Destiny, white savior.</i>

13:12.041 --> 13:13.459
But if I'm being honest,

13:13.459 --> 13:17.630
yeah, a great work of fiction
exposes something deeper,

13:17.630 --> 13:20.758
gets to the truth
of who a person really is. Right?

13:21.133 --> 13:22.635
- Hmm.
-  <i>Ouch.</i>

13:24.303 --> 13:27.473
Take Katherine.
I knew she'd be a true philanthropist.

13:28.307 --> 13:31.060
She tell you about the time
she adopted every single pit bull

13:31.060 --> 13:32.561
in a rescue in Los Angeles?

13:32.561 --> 13:34.563
- No. No.

13:34.563 --> 13:39.652
The lady's like, "Well, pits,
they can be a little harder to adopt."

13:39.652 --> 13:43.781
Katherine, she's probably 10,
she gets this look on her face.

13:44.406 --> 13:48.160
She demands my phone,
proceeds to call every one of my contacts,

13:48.160 --> 13:52.248
and tell them
that I'm personally giving them a dog.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.290
Yes.

13:53.290 --> 13:57.628
I'm not surprised. She takes
very good care of everything she loves.

14:02.383 --> 14:07.221
I'm still just knocked Barbra Streisand
turned that puppy down. Yes.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.057
-  I think it's amazing...
-  <i>No wonder she ran away</i>

14:10.057 --> 14:14.436
<i>from a dad who's proud of her goodness
and a remorseless corporate vulture.</i>

14:14.436 --> 14:15.688
- Yes.
- Dinner, sir?

14:15.688 --> 14:17.690
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.401
Sir.

14:20.401 --> 14:23.195
<i>What does he have on you, Rhys?</i>

14:23.195 --> 14:24.405
<i>And on me?</i>

14:29.451 --> 14:32.162
<i>Four courses later
and I still don't know Tom's game.</i>

14:34.331 --> 14:36.292
<i>Or why you need him dead.</i>

14:36.292 --> 14:37.918
Ah. Time for dessert.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.423
Thank you.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.803
Presenting the Lockwood Museum.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.682
As in Katherine Lockwood.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.894
Oh, yeah, New York City,

14:55.603 --> 14:59.940
Lower East Side, paperwork's all done,
endowments, the works.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.860
<i>Wouldn't be a devil
without a classic temptation.</i>

15:02.860 --> 15:04.445
What are you playing at?

15:05.321 --> 15:06.780
It's your dream, honey.

15:07.364 --> 15:10.993
My collection's sitting
in a vault somewhere. Take it.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.872
You can feature your emerging artists.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.124
They profit. You shine.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.586
I-- Just think about it.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.630
That's all I ask.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.301
I will. In the loo.

15:35.601 --> 15:39.563
So let's get down to brass tacks, Joseph.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.317
What can you tell me about Love Quinn?

15:43.317 --> 15:44.652
<i>And here we go.</i>

15:44.652 --> 15:46.820
My former wife was deeply troubled.

15:49.156 --> 15:51.533
My greatest regret is
that I couldn't help her.

15:51.533 --> 15:52.660
Did you kill her?

15:54.370 --> 15:57.331
She killed herself and nearly... me.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.749
You ever kill anyone?

15:58.749 --> 16:00.000
<i>Okay, enough.</i>

16:00.000 --> 16:03.045
I understand
you worry about Kate. I do too.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.965
I had some bad luck at one point.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.387
But I'm a quiet guy,
and I only want a quiet, academic life.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.934
Don't hurt Kate
or you'll meet the real me.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.148
Ah. Thank you.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.904
Hey, you know a Rhys Montrose?

16:30.280 --> 16:32.491
Hangs out in Kate's circle?

16:33.117 --> 16:34.159
<i>Jackpot.</i>

16:34.159 --> 16:35.077
We met, yeah.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.454
Mm. What can you tell me about him?

16:39.540 --> 16:41.083
Why? You're not a fan?

16:41.083 --> 16:42.960
He's a threat to my interests.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.379
I'm here to whip him,

16:46.088 --> 16:47.506
politically speaking.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.591
Press is running a story.

16:49.591 --> 16:52.136
That memoir of his is--

16:52.720 --> 16:54.054
It's an embellishment.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.848
<i>Once a liar, always a liar.</i>

16:55.848 --> 16:58.559
- That sounds bad.
- Well, maybe not fatal.

16:59.435 --> 17:05.190
So if you can tell me anything,
I'd be grateful.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.777
<i>Maybe Joe Goldberg can't out you
as a serial killer, but...</i>

17:10.612 --> 17:14.324
Bring me something real, Joe.
I promise you, I'll protect you.

17:14.324 --> 17:17.161
<i>The enemy of my enemy is my frenemy.</i>

17:18.162 --> 17:21.915
<i>Sorry, Rhys,
I'm not gonna kill Tom Lockwood.</i>

17:23.250 --> 17:25.753
<i>I'm going to use him to put you in prison.</i>

17:36.972 --> 17:37.806
Kate.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.227
Kate.

17:44.271 --> 17:45.814
You wanna come up?

17:45.814 --> 17:47.441
<i>Or say a word to me?</i>

17:48.484 --> 17:51.070
You know, no, I have to check on Phoebe.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.780
She's texting me.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.075
She's a bit dodgy
since the whole, you know--

17:56.784 --> 17:57.618
Yeah.

18:02.664 --> 18:06.376
Thank you for tonight.
You were a real support.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.339
I'm sorry, I'll be myself when he's gone.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.841
Just so you know, I saw through him.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.512
The museum is too good to be true.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.973
No, it's true.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.602
It's exactly what I want. When I want it.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.355
I almost said "yes" on the spot.

18:27.356 --> 18:32.277
Ugh. Dinner was a-- Was a bad idea.
He knows me like he knows himself.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.614
Then he knows that you're not him
and you never will be.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.658
Look at you right now.

18:38.534 --> 18:44.123
You're foregoing mind-blowing sex to check
on your friend and that's who you are.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.209
So this offer, take it or don't,

18:47.209 --> 18:51.130
but it's what you do with it that matters
most and you would do good things.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.388
Have a good night.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.182
<i>Lockwood's been in town one night
and he's already doing damage.</i>

19:02.766 --> 19:05.853
<i>I'm starting to see why you want him dead.</i>

19:07.187 --> 19:09.106
<i>But I'm coming for you first.</i>

19:18.574 --> 19:21.243
Sorry, I texted so late.
Sure I'm not intruding?

19:21.243 --> 19:24.371
Don't be daft.
You can stay as long as you like.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.456
The security company was supposed
to upgrade my flat,

19:26.456 --> 19:30.210
but I caught one of them using the loo,
so I just fired them.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.504
Could've done anything in there.

19:33.338 --> 19:36.216
Like pinhole cameras, two-way mirrors.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.134
Oh, God.

19:37.134 --> 19:40.262
Given what you've been through,
some paranoia is reasonable.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.805
Bella says I must be cursed.

19:41.805 --> 19:45.058
She knows a psychic that can break
any curse for only 8,000 pounds.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.185
Tell me you didn't.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.146
No. I fired her. Fired everyone.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.939
I might just sell the flat.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.150
- What about Pembrokeshire?
- For...?

19:53.150 --> 19:54.943
It's almost potato season.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.570
Doesn't that sound lovely?

19:56.570 --> 19:58.572
Smell of the earth, wind in my hair.

19:58.572 --> 19:59.948
Maybe that's my calling.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.826
Pheebs. Just take a breath.

20:02.826 --> 20:05.996
I would like a trade, you know? I would--

20:07.331 --> 20:11.084
I would like to be capable of something.

20:11.668 --> 20:15.589
- You are capable of a great deal.
- I do nothing. I handle nothing.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.549
I'm like this big, long baby.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.176
- It's disgraceful.
- No.

20:21.887 --> 20:26.099
Your friends were killed.
Phoebe, you were bloody kidnapped.

20:26.099 --> 20:29.937
The most capable woman
on Earth would have PTSD.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.022
PTSD?

20:33.023 --> 20:35.984
Oh, no, I don't want that.
How do I get that out?

20:35.984 --> 20:38.070
- No, well, I think...
- I hate this.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.364
...maybe a mental health professional.

20:40.364 --> 20:44.117
- Oh, I'm already taking all the pills.
- Maybe we take a look at those.

20:44.117 --> 20:47.496
Just rebalance under observation.

20:48.121 --> 20:51.124
You need rest.
Phoebe, there is no shame in it.

20:51.124 --> 20:54.086
No, Kate. The press could find out.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.756
I will handle it.
I mean, I've done it for others.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.508
Famous artists.

21:00.342 --> 21:03.428
I mean, fuck,
I've done it for my own mother.

21:04.805 --> 21:08.392
Just a discrete, brief stay.

21:08.392 --> 21:12.062
We can go tonight. I'll make some calls.
All you have to do is pack.

21:15.857 --> 21:18.819
Yes. And make sure you use a nom de plume.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.530
We'll be there in 40.

21:24.491 --> 21:25.325
Thank you.

21:32.249 --> 21:35.335
- What are you doing here?
- Kate, I'm homeless.

21:35.335 --> 21:38.922
- Ugh. This isn't a good time.
- Look, wait, just listen.

21:38.922 --> 21:41.842
I was asleep on a bench
in Bloomsbury Square

21:41.842 --> 21:44.136
and I was attacked by crackheads.

21:45.178 --> 21:48.765
They had a crack dog.
I swear, it was on crack.

21:48.765 --> 21:51.727
- I... I have a bruise.
- No, you don't.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.645
Okay. Is Phoebe still up?

21:53.645 --> 21:56.481
You are the last thing she needs.
Adam, she's not well.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.859
- What?
- I'm taking her to Welder Hill Hospital.

21:58.859 --> 22:01.987
If you care about her,
let me get her the help she needs.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.489
- I'll drive.
- I thought you were homeless.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.825
- I have the Aston for one more day.
- Oh, my God.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.703
Kate, look, look,
I know I was a little shit.

22:11.038 --> 22:15.917
I know that I hurt her,
but this morning, when I lost everything--

22:15.917 --> 22:18.003
- Not everything.
- Everything that matters.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.547
My club,

22:21.757 --> 22:23.884
my reputation, my girl.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.845
I had an awakening, okay?

22:26.845 --> 22:29.389
But, Kate, give me a chance
to do the right thing,

22:29.389 --> 22:31.349
and I promise you, I will not hurt her.

22:34.561 --> 22:35.687
I'm nothing without her.

22:37.898 --> 22:38.732
Okay.

22:43.111 --> 22:44.446
It's only a drive.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.285
I trust him.

22:55.874 --> 22:56.875
I miss you.

22:58.251 --> 22:59.669
I'm so glad you're okay.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.926
<i>Jonathan Moore can't tell
the police you're a killer</i>

23:05.926 --> 23:08.178
<i>because of the small issue
of being Joe Goldberg.</i>

23:08.178 --> 23:11.681
<i>But if I can get a taped confession,
give it to Lockwood,</i>

23:11.681 --> 23:15.227
<i>he can use his connections
to take you down.</i>

23:15.227 --> 23:18.605
<i>So dangle some bait to get you here.</i>

23:20.565 --> 23:22.818
I can see why you want TL dead.
Given what he has on you.

23:29.491 --> 23:30.909
<i>I knew you'd bite.</i>

23:40.794 --> 23:41.795
All right, spill.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.714
What does Lockwood claim he knows?

23:48.969 --> 23:50.303
What do you think he knows?

23:51.638 --> 23:52.639
Don't be coy.

23:52.639 --> 23:53.557
<i>Watch me.</i>

23:53.557 --> 23:54.850
Was it about a book?

23:54.850 --> 23:59.020
Who hasn't taken liberties
with their own story? It's called writing.

23:59.020 --> 24:01.731
That's what you're most afraid of?
People finding out?

24:05.610 --> 24:07.571
- What?

24:09.447 --> 24:10.448
You smell that?

24:13.535 --> 24:16.580
Smells like a fucking rat.

24:16.580 --> 24:17.497
<i>Shit.</i>

24:20.125 --> 24:22.794
You think I'm a fucking idiot? Hmm?

24:24.838 --> 24:28.300
When are you going to understand?
I'm smarter than you.

24:35.765 --> 24:36.600
Look familiar?

24:40.854 --> 24:41.688
Yes, Joe.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.691
I found your old lover.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.443
She's a feisty one.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.738
- How...?
- Repeat after me.

24:49.738 --> 24:53.992
I'm smarter than you.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.203
Is she dead?

24:56.203 --> 24:59.414
How would that be smart?
No one even knows she's gone.

24:59.414 --> 25:01.625
I texted her babysitter friend
from her phone.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.585
"Oops. I tripped and fell
on a heroin needle.

25:03.585 --> 25:04.920
Please look after my daughter."

25:04.920 --> 25:06.546
Whatever her name is.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.300
Her name is Juliette
and she needs her mother!

25:10.300 --> 25:13.094
Oh, easy. I'd stay right there, mate.

25:13.094 --> 25:17.098
Driver's outside, campaign staff know
my whereabouts. Let's keep it civil.

25:17.098 --> 25:18.600
- Shall we?
- Where is she?

25:18.600 --> 25:22.812
She's tucked away. Kill Lockwood
and I'll release her immediately.

25:22.812 --> 25:25.774
However,
if Lockwood isn't dead in 24 hours,

25:25.774 --> 25:29.694
I'll send you Marienne Bellamy's teeth
in a fucking fruit basket.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.959
<i>It's impossible.</i>

25:43.959 --> 25:45.710
<i>Where are you holding her?</i>

25:45.710 --> 25:48.421
<i>I watched her get on the train.</i>

25:48.421 --> 25:49.547
<i>Fuck.</i>

25:49.547 --> 25:51.007
<i>This is all my fault.</i>

25:55.512 --> 25:56.930
Clock's ticking...

25:59.224 --> 26:01.059
I WANT HIS BALLS IN A
NEAT LITTLE PACKAGE

26:01.059 --> 26:02.560
<i>Good morning to you too.</i>

26:03.311 --> 26:05.522
<i>Why do you seem extra sadistic today?</i>

26:10.485 --> 26:12.445
<i>And Tom Lockwood drops his bomb.</i>

26:12.445 --> 26:14.197
<i>Don't say I didn't warn you.</i>

26:14.781 --> 26:16.866
<i>The people of London are shaken to learn</i>

26:16.866 --> 26:19.286
<i>you fabricated parts
of</i> A Good Man In A Cruel World

26:19.286 --> 26:22.038
<i>to make yourself more good
and the world more cruel,</i>

26:22.038 --> 26:24.624
<i>but not one accusation of murder.</i>

26:24.624 --> 26:27.210
<i>You've got more super fans than Elon Musk.</i>

26:27.210 --> 26:30.338
<i>Maybe your approval rating dips,
but my gut says you survive this.</i>

26:30.922 --> 26:32.841
<i>"Requests for comment
have not been returned.</i>

26:32.841 --> 26:35.302
<i>Montrose has fled his home in London."</i>

26:36.094 --> 26:38.972
<i>Of course you vanish. Coward.</i>

26:38.972 --> 26:42.934
<i>While you use an innocent woman
to force me to do your dirty work.</i>

26:44.185 --> 26:46.187
<i>I have to kill Tom today...</i>

26:47.731 --> 26:48.898
<i>to save Marienne.</i>

26:49.941 --> 26:50.775
<i>How?</i>

26:57.324 --> 26:58.742
You didn't sleep either.

26:58.742 --> 27:02.954
<i>The last person I need right now
and the only one I want to see.</i>

27:07.083 --> 27:09.127
I was up all night thinking.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.671
My stupid brain.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.051
About?

27:16.801 --> 27:17.635
Us.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.264
How great we are.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.642
And how we've been doomed from the start.

27:26.436 --> 27:27.437
We need to talk.

27:27.437 --> 27:29.522
<i>Uh-oh. Did her dad say something?</i>

27:44.371 --> 27:47.207
Remember when I told you
how when I worked there,

27:47.207 --> 27:52.420
my father gave a load of kids cancer
to get a pipeline built?

27:53.922 --> 27:54.923
He didn't.

27:56.424 --> 27:57.425
I did.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.762
I was 19. They called me the Prodigy.

28:00.762 --> 28:05.683
They said I was the best they'd ever seen
since, well, Tom Lockwood.

28:08.895 --> 28:10.814
And it didn't even eat me alive.

28:10.814 --> 28:12.315
I just compartmentalized

28:12.315 --> 28:15.693
and I could have gone on
making compartments forever.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.320
<i>So that's the truth.</i>

28:17.320 --> 28:19.322
<i>Tom pushed her to be monstrous.</i>

28:19.322 --> 28:20.824
<i>So she thinks she's a monster.</i>

28:20.824 --> 28:23.326
I'm not judging, I'm listening.

28:23.326 --> 28:24.953
You should judge.

28:27.539 --> 28:31.501
I'm not scared of being my dad.
I'm already worse.

28:32.335 --> 28:35.839
I was so busy proving I was
the strongest girl alive

28:35.839 --> 28:37.715
that I didn't care.

28:41.261 --> 28:42.762
And that is still in me.

28:45.014 --> 28:47.100
We all have something bad in us.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.936
- Not this bad.
- You were a teenager.

28:49.936 --> 28:52.313
Okay, stop trying to rationalize this.

28:52.313 --> 28:53.398
I'm not, I'm not.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.151
- I'm not.
- Look, let's be real.

28:56.151 --> 28:59.028
You and I, we don't stand a chance

29:00.071 --> 29:03.199
because I will never
not be Katherine Lockwood.

29:14.210 --> 29:18.798
Look, if I thought
I was doomed to repeat my past,

29:18.798 --> 29:21.426
we never would have even met.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.769
You know
what my favorite thing about love is?

29:35.523 --> 29:37.192
It gives you second chances.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.991
You know, I had this fantasy last night...

29:48.119 --> 29:52.207
that we could escape,
a different city every year,

29:52.999 --> 29:56.920
eat amazing food,
have sex in exotic locales,

29:56.920 --> 29:59.464
and do good work,

30:00.215 --> 30:03.092
just change people's lives for the better.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.429
What a stupid idea, right?

30:11.309 --> 30:12.685
Never say never.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.987
This was supposed to be
a one-night stand. During the day.

30:24.489 --> 30:25.490
True.

30:29.744 --> 30:31.830
I do want this, Jonathan.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.457
I just want to say...

30:36.626 --> 30:38.545
let the fantasy continue.

30:40.046 --> 30:41.422
<i>I wish.</i>

30:41.422 --> 30:44.425
<i>Because the reality is no matter
how much Kate loathes her father,</i>

30:44.425 --> 30:47.762
<i>killing him is only
gonna make everything worse for her.</i>

30:51.432 --> 30:54.018
<i>But it's him or Marienne.</i>

30:55.895 --> 31:00.525
Thanks for meeting me. Do you mind
if he waits outside so we can have a word?

31:00.525 --> 31:03.695
- Just be a minute.
- Sure. Meet you out in the car?

31:05.905 --> 31:07.407
<i>You may be thinking I don't have</i>

31:07.407 --> 31:09.701
<i>a good exit strategy here
and you'd be right.</i>

31:10.577 --> 31:11.619
<i>I have a bad one.</i>

31:13.037 --> 31:15.748
<i>Thanks to the misguided trust
of English academia,</i>

31:15.748 --> 31:17.584
<i>no security or cameras here.</i>

31:17.584 --> 31:19.252
- Wow.
- Yeah.

31:20.962 --> 31:24.799
- What's with the tarps?
- They're doing something with the molding.

31:24.799 --> 31:26.467
<i>Easy enough to get a body out,</i>

31:26.467 --> 31:29.637
<i>giving me just enough time
to pray and run like hell.</i>

31:31.598 --> 31:35.184
First, are you by chance
a fan of Winston Churchill?

31:36.811 --> 31:38.187
I thought you might be.

31:38.187 --> 31:42.483
So we here at Darcy have
a rare first edition of <i>My Early Life</i>

31:43.067 --> 31:45.361
notated by the man himself.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.323
Well, I'll be.

31:50.825 --> 31:52.368
That is incredible, Joe.

32:03.713 --> 32:04.547
You okay?

32:06.799 --> 32:08.134
You seem a little nervous.

32:08.134 --> 32:09.093
Hmm.

32:10.261 --> 32:11.387
I think I know why.

32:13.681 --> 32:14.682
Rather, who.

32:16.017 --> 32:17.310
Rhys Montrose.

32:18.394 --> 32:20.104
- I don't know what you mean.
- You do.

32:20.104 --> 32:22.315
Got a little hit
when I mentioned his name.

32:23.358 --> 32:28.071
And I'd like for you to feel safe enough
to tell me everything.

32:28.988 --> 32:31.282
<i>I wish,
but Marienne will be dead by morning.</i>

32:31.991 --> 32:35.119
I think you're scared
to tell me the truth, son.

32:35.119 --> 32:38.206
<i>Fuck, this dad act really works.</i>

32:38.206 --> 32:40.750
- Not at-- Not at all.
- That's okay.

32:40.750 --> 32:44.087
I got an idea to deal
with all the fallout concerns.

32:44.087 --> 32:48.591
What I do is assess a person to better
understand what they're capable of.

32:48.591 --> 32:51.135
Now, I'm gonna take you, for example.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.805
You seem like a nice guy,

32:53.805 --> 32:56.349
thoughtful, caring,

32:57.809 --> 32:59.519
and I think you did kill Love Quinn.

33:00.520 --> 33:04.148
It's okay. She seemed like a maniac.
The point is, you did it.

33:04.899 --> 33:07.568
When push comes to shove, you can do it

33:07.568 --> 33:10.363
and do it well enough
to get off scot-fucking-free.

33:13.574 --> 33:14.701
I can help you.

33:16.035 --> 33:16.869
How?

33:16.869 --> 33:22.542
Well, that news story and scandal
was not meant to ruin Montrose's run,

33:22.542 --> 33:25.003
it was to drive him into hiding.

33:26.421 --> 33:27.255
Part one.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.841
- You know where he is.
- Yeah.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.760
He's out in the country at his ex's.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.429
He's trying

33:34.429 --> 33:39.392
to broker support
to put his campaign back on wheels.

33:42.478 --> 33:43.479
He's all alone.

33:44.397 --> 33:45.606
Unprotected.

33:45.606 --> 33:49.152
<i>Somehow this IZOD-wearing warlock
is delivering me</i>

33:49.152 --> 33:52.613
<i>the thing I want most in the world, you.</i>

33:53.197 --> 33:55.199
- Part two is you.
- Me?

33:59.579 --> 34:01.873
You want me?

34:04.208 --> 34:06.669
To kill Rhys Montrose. That's right.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.298
I mean, we know you can.

34:10.298 --> 34:11.591
I think you want to.

34:12.633 --> 34:15.720
And the alternatives aren't great, right?

34:16.888 --> 34:18.598
You're dating my daughter.

34:20.183 --> 34:24.687
Living out there with some assumed name.
I'd take it all away, Joe.

34:24.687 --> 34:25.772
Everything.

34:27.607 --> 34:31.110
Of course, now that I'm standing here,
I realize there is a third option.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.695
You could just stab me.

34:35.948 --> 34:36.949
Right through the heart.

34:37.742 --> 34:38.743
But trust me,

34:39.327 --> 34:41.913
the choice I'm offering you
is the best one.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.251
This is where you'll find him.

34:52.507 --> 34:53.966
Go be your best self.

35:06.854 --> 35:09.982
Pheebs, when you get a chance,
can you let me know you're checked in?

35:09.982 --> 35:12.151
You can text. Just let me know.

35:33.673 --> 35:34.799
-"Kate."

35:37.093 --> 35:38.427
Surprise!

35:39.554 --> 35:41.639
- We're engaged!
- You didn't.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.766
- What?
- You had one fucking job.

35:43.766 --> 35:46.561
- No. Don't blame him.
- No one's allowed to be happy.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.312
It was-- It was my idea.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.272
Look.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.150
The fuck even is this ring?

35:52.150 --> 35:54.485
Some twine that I found
on the floor of the pub.

35:55.194 --> 35:57.113
That's how much money
doesn't matter to me.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.114
Yeah, same.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.616
I got down on one knee
and I told her the truth,

36:00.616 --> 36:05.621
we will never ever be equals
because I can't compete with perfection.

36:06.581 --> 36:09.167
- I literally swooned.
- Of course you did. You're trolleyed.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.420
You're not thinking clearly,
you're not stable.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.088
Kate, Kate, Kate.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.675
We appreciate your help so much. Right?

36:17.675 --> 36:21.596
It's truly nothing short of a lot.

36:21.596 --> 36:23.806
But there's nothing wrong
with Pheebs, okay?

36:23.806 --> 36:27.185
A diamond's flaws
just make it sparkle even brighter.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.687
- Catch me, Daddy, is that me again?
- Uh-oh.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.194
Oh, my God.

36:37.403 --> 36:40.156
I lost the key
and I said I'd water his plants.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.074
Oh, thank you so much.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.827
Give my love to Uncle Dev.

36:44.827 --> 36:48.247
- I can't believe I did that.
- Stay out of trouble, Nadia.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.500
Oh, my God.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.547
I have lost my bloody mind.

37:03.471 --> 37:05.097
Okay. Um...

37:26.285 --> 37:27.954
You seem like a rare book.

37:45.554 --> 37:46.639
Uh--

37:56.274 --> 37:58.859
<i>I'm a wanker. I'm sorry, Nad. Forgive me.</i>

37:58.859 --> 38:00.945
<i>As a peace offering,
I thought you'd wanna see this.</i>

38:00.945 --> 38:03.155
<i>Maybe you were on to something
about Professor Moore.</i>

38:03.155 --> 38:06.075
<i>These photos were leaked to my dad
from the crazy woman's flat.</i>

38:06.701 --> 38:07.618
For your eyes only!

39:05.509 --> 39:07.636
<i>You're in there,
begging your ex-wife</i>

39:07.636 --> 39:09.597
<i>to stand by you in the press?</i>

39:10.222 --> 39:13.434
<i>I wonder how she'd feel to know
you kidnapped an innocent young mother.</i>

39:14.018 --> 39:16.645
<i>Five minutes with you is all I need.</i>

39:17.855 --> 39:18.856
<i>Here we go.</i>

39:19.482 --> 39:21.776
Emma, wait! What happened
was such a long time ago.

39:21.776 --> 39:24.862
It doesn't matter. Why can't we talk
about this properly? Emma!

39:24.862 --> 39:27.073
Please, why can't we just talk?

39:27.073 --> 39:28.699
It doesn't fucking matter!

39:28.699 --> 39:29.784
Fuck off!

39:49.345 --> 39:50.930
- Sorry, do I know you?
- Really?

40:08.197 --> 40:09.907
Tom Lockwood wants you dead.

40:09.907 --> 40:13.661
Did you know that? Despite
what either of you think, I'm not...

40:15.204 --> 40:17.706
a killer,
so I'm not gonna kill you, but...

40:19.500 --> 40:20.835
will I apply pressure?

40:22.503 --> 40:25.965
Sadly, yes.
It's time for you to tell the truth, Rhys.

40:27.341 --> 40:28.217
Do you know...

40:29.218 --> 40:30.928
all the awful shit...

40:32.346 --> 40:35.808
I had to read
to learn how to do this to you?

40:36.392 --> 40:39.478
All because you had to go
and touch Marienne.

40:43.357 --> 40:44.442
This won't be fun.

40:45.526 --> 40:48.821
But I'm only interested
in getting what I need and being done.

40:49.488 --> 40:51.157
So I hope you feel the same.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.430
<i>I'm gonna take this gag off.</i>

41:14.430 --> 41:18.309
And when I do, you're gonna
confess everything, starting with:

41:18.309 --> 41:21.896
Where is Marienne?

41:24.523 --> 41:28.110
I don't know anyone called Marienne.
I don't know what you're talking about.

41:30.613 --> 41:32.323
I wish you would stop acting.

41:36.202 --> 41:37.036
Fuck.

41:38.120 --> 41:38.954
Where is she?

42:03.687 --> 42:05.564
<i>Stop gaslighting me.</i>

42:05.564 --> 42:09.860
You know who I am.
You know what you've had me do for you!

42:11.195 --> 42:12.530
I let her go.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.406
I'd stepped away!

42:14.406 --> 42:16.492
I was starting over!

42:17.117 --> 42:18.911
- Where is she?

42:20.663 --> 42:23.165
Tell me where she is!
Tell me or I'll kill you!

42:23.165 --> 42:24.875
You fucking psychopath!

42:25.459 --> 42:26.835
Tell me!

42:47.398 --> 42:48.899
<i>What did I do?</i>

42:49.400 --> 42:52.278
<i>It was an accident. I lost it.</i>

42:52.278 --> 42:55.698
<i>Marienne, I'm so sorry.
I'll find a way. I will find you.</i>

42:55.698 --> 42:58.534
Well, isn't this a pickle?

43:04.290 --> 43:05.583
Uh...

43:09.044 --> 43:10.045
Uh...

43:10.671 --> 43:13.215
Okay. I'm hallucinating.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.803
- I--
- Killed me? Yes.

43:19.305 --> 43:22.349
But not before a shocking amount
of military-grade ball torture.

43:27.688 --> 43:28.939
<i>He wasn't lying, Joe.</i>

43:28.939 --> 43:30.357
He didn't know you.

43:33.944 --> 43:36.071
But then I wasn't lying either.

43:37.072 --> 43:40.451
We really do have Marienne in a cage.
