<i>Previously on </i>You:

00:19.185 --> 00:21.563
<i>"Hello, you."</i>
<i>Of course you're using Evanesce.</i>

00:21.646 --> 00:25.525
<i>No reverse lookup,</i> <i>messages disappear</i>
<i>after they've been read.</i>

00:25.608 --> 00:27.444
<i>A favorite of the elite and the paranoid.</i>

00:27.527 --> 00:30.947
I suppose I'll see you
at that stupid art show, professor.

00:31.865 --> 00:32.949
<i>Kate Galvin.</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:34.701
-Go away.
-<i>Kate gives little.</i>

00:34.784 --> 00:36.578
That jacket makes you look like a waiter.

00:36.661 --> 00:39.289
You are a hollow nobody
with no life of his own.

00:39.372 --> 00:42.459
-Malcolm. He made us call him that.
-<i>Was she just a student?</i>

00:42.542 --> 00:44.753
-What do you want?
-<i>Nadia was right.</i>

00:44.836 --> 00:46.921
<i>The first suspect is usually</i>
<i>the second victim.</i>

00:47.005 --> 00:49.132
<i>"I'll figure you out soon enough."</i>

00:54.721 --> 00:56.222
<i>"Hello, Joe."</i>

01:02.312 --> 01:06.483
<i>It's times like these I can't help</i>
<i>but wonder, where did I go wrong?</i>

01:08.359 --> 01:09.903
<i>All I wanted was a holiday</i>

01:10.487 --> 01:12.989
<i>to start my new life, good,</i>

01:13.073 --> 01:16.910
<i>honest, peaceful,</i>
<i>but you've destroyed that.</i>

01:16.993 --> 01:18.828
<i>You violated my safe haven,</i>

01:18.912 --> 01:22.332
<i>dredging up the me</i>
<i>I've been trying hard to leave behind.</i>

01:27.045 --> 01:30.507
<i>"Am I right?</i>
<i>Are all those articles about you?"</i>

01:32.425 --> 01:34.761
<i>Obviously, I can't say yes.</i> <i>Come on.</i>

01:34.844 --> 01:36.846
<i>My name is Jonathan Moore.</i>

01:39.140 --> 01:41.476
<i>"Come on, Joe. Tell me the truth."</i>

01:45.855 --> 01:49.234
<i>I refuse to fuel</i>
<i>your sick and misguided fixation.</i>

01:50.902 --> 01:54.030
<i>I'm supposed to be finding you,</i>
<i>not changing my locks.</i>

01:58.701 --> 02:02.413
<i>But I have to keep you out</i>
<i>of my flat, of my mind.</i>

02:06.751 --> 02:08.002
<i>"Are you ignoring me?</i>

02:09.838 --> 02:11.339
<i>You're hurting my feelings, Joe.</i>

02:12.465 --> 02:13.550
<i>Are you there?"</i>

02:13.633 --> 02:14.926
<i>Are you there?</i>

02:15.009 --> 02:16.719
<i>You've left me no choice.</i>

02:18.012 --> 02:19.722
<i>I gotta ghost you, stalker.</i>

02:23.726 --> 02:25.395
<i>In Poe's "Man of the Crowd,"</i>

02:25.937 --> 02:28.398
<i>the narrator sees a random stranger</i>
<i>in a caf√©</i>

02:28.481 --> 02:30.441
and becomes obsessed with him.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.361
So he follows the stranger
through the streets of London.

02:33.444 --> 02:34.362
He's making deductions.

02:34.445 --> 02:37.657
But why he's interested remains,
oh, ambiguous.

02:37.740 --> 02:41.578
So thoughts on what this story
is saying about obsession?

02:42.328 --> 02:44.581
That it goes hand in hand
with the urge to protect.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.083
The narrator follows the stranger
because he sees him

02:47.167 --> 02:49.627
-hiding a dagger under his clothes.
-<i>Correct. But obvious.</i>

02:49.711 --> 02:52.422
-Interesting. What else?
-It's about love.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.383
-Sure you read the right story?
-It's about the kind of love

02:55.466 --> 02:58.928
that you have for something
you'll never fully understand.

02:59.554 --> 03:03.391
-This is about fixation.
-Who says they're mutually exclusive?

03:03.474 --> 03:07.562
The narrator wants to connect
and to know and to be known, right?

03:07.645 --> 03:12.650
-That's why he stalks a stranger.
-Sorry, but it's about Professor Harding.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.819
Fuck me. He's been murdered.

03:14.903 --> 03:18.156
They think it's connected
to the Simon Soo art-gallery murder.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.115
<i>Oh, no.</i>

03:19.198 --> 03:21.659
They're calling him
the "eat-the-rich killer." Catchy.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.581
<i>Malcolm Harding's finger was sent</i>
<i>to </i>The London Dispatch

03:26.664 --> 03:29.959
<i>with a note discerning, "This is not</i>
<i>a kidnapping. This is a murder."</i>

03:30.543 --> 03:31.920
<i>Well, fuck.</i>

03:33.421 --> 03:35.715
<i>You didn't keep Malcolm's pinkie</i>
<i>as a trophy,</i>

03:35.798 --> 03:37.884
<i>you're using it to force me</i>
<i>to play your game.</i>

03:37.967 --> 03:40.094
<i>-This is very, very bad.</i>

03:41.054 --> 03:43.348
<i>"Now do I have your attention?"</i>

03:51.397 --> 03:53.733
<i>Okay, asshole, you've made your point.</i>

03:54.317 --> 03:57.195
<i>I've canceled the rest of my class,</i>
<i>so my students can process their shock,</i>

03:57.278 --> 04:01.783
<i>aka gossip about the eat-the-rich killer</i>
<i>targeting these well-to-dos.</i>

04:02.742 --> 04:05.578
<i>So, yes, you have my attention.</i>

04:06.162 --> 04:08.915
<i>The question is, "What do you want?"</i>

04:11.167 --> 04:12.835
<i>"Admit you're Joe Goldberg."</i>

04:12.919 --> 04:16.589
<i>Ah, well, that's not happening,</i>
<i>but I also can't refuse to engage.</i>

04:16.673 --> 04:18.800
<i>So: "I'm not.</i>

04:19.550 --> 04:22.136
<i>But if I was,</i>
<i>what</i> <i>would</i> <i>you</i> <i>want</i> <i>from</i> <i>me?"</i>

04:27.392 --> 04:29.894
<i>"For starters,</i>
<i>why'd you kill all those people?</i>

04:31.229 --> 04:33.898
<i>Should mention, still have Simon's ear.</i>

04:33.982 --> 04:36.234
<i>Shall I send</i>
<i>with a note signed 'Jonathan Moore'?"</i>

04:36.317 --> 04:38.319
<i>And there it is, blackmail.</i>

04:38.861 --> 04:42.156
<i>Okay. Okay, say as little as possible.</i>

04:43.032 --> 04:45.201
<i>"If I had done these things,</i>

04:45.285 --> 04:48.579
<i>it could only have been</i>
<i>because I had no other options."</i>

04:51.499 --> 04:53.251
<i>"Ah. It was life or death."</i>

04:53.918 --> 04:55.503
Imagine opening that box.

04:55.586 --> 04:59.424
Apparently, the finger reeked so badly,
a copywriter passed out.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.718
<i>This is what happens</i>
<i>when the owner of the newspaper</i>

05:01.801 --> 05:03.261
<i>has a blabbermouth brat for a son.</i>

05:03.344 --> 05:05.471
What else did your dad tell you?

05:05.555 --> 05:07.682
Everyone's worried
what else they'll find in their mail.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.059
The killer took Simon Soo's earring
and God knows what else.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.062
Next, they'll open a box with his cock
and the alleged Prince Albert.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.442
What is wrong with you?
He was murdered. That was our professor.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.319
<i>Who I suspect she was sleeping with.</i>

05:19.402 --> 05:20.737
Whoa. Relax. I was just--

05:20.820 --> 05:23.823
Just being crass about another human being
getting chopped to bits.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.326
No, it's pointless. You are disgusting.

05:28.411 --> 05:32.498
<i>She needs to talk to someone,</i>
<i>but I've got my hands full with you.</i>

05:37.003 --> 05:41.382
<i>Three hours since your last text.</i>
<i>Are you tired of playing with me already?</i>

05:42.258 --> 05:45.053
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>I'm looking for clues wherever I can.</i>

05:47.096 --> 05:50.016
<i>It's the same news on a loop,</i>
<i>and until I've found you,</i>

05:50.099 --> 05:53.019
<i>I'm reminded</i>
<i>I'm not the only one looking for you.</i>

05:54.395 --> 05:57.523
<i>...which he frequented</i>
<i>along with many of his close friends.</i>

05:58.775 --> 06:03.279
<i>I assume the police are asking Kate</i>
<i>if Malcolm had enemies.</i> <i>Simon as well.</i>

06:03.362 --> 06:04.906
<i>And come to think of it,</i>

06:04.989 --> 06:08.910
<i>from the way she's acting, she'll be lucky</i>
<i>if they don't start suspecting her.</i>

06:08.993 --> 06:11.996
<i>Not a tear.</i>
<i>And she didn't even offer them tea.</i>

06:13.790 --> 06:14.791
<i>Ooh. Shit.</i>

06:24.634 --> 06:27.970
<i>What is that American expression?</i>
<i>Mind your own fucking business.</i>

06:28.054 --> 06:31.307
I'm sorry, the news about Malcolm...

06:31.390 --> 06:33.059
<i>Must be a terrible shock.</i>

06:35.520 --> 06:37.355
I wanted to offer condolences.

06:37.438 --> 06:40.358
<i>Save your breath. You'll need it</i>
<i>for when the police arrive.</i>

06:42.735 --> 06:44.695
-<i>She didn't.</i>

06:44.779 --> 06:46.155
<i>Oh, she did.</i>

06:50.743 --> 06:52.912
When was the last time
you saw Malcolm Harding?

06:55.915 --> 06:57.917
Ah, about a week ago.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.085
I think--

06:59.168 --> 07:03.422
He brought me home from a club.
His girlfriend might have mentioned that.

07:03.881 --> 07:08.302
Also at that club was Simon Soo.
Is that right?

07:09.679 --> 07:13.641
And you were at his show opening
the night he was killed.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.269
<i>What else did Kate tell them,</i>
<i>my favorite cereal?</i>

07:16.352 --> 07:17.186
That's right.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.231
You've become a fast fixture
in this social circle.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.818
Miss Galvin mentioned
you've been avoiding the police.

07:24.485 --> 07:25.611
<i>Of course she did.</i>

07:25.695 --> 07:30.658
That's-- Well, I thought
there might be a slight work-visa issue,

07:30.741 --> 07:34.620
-but the papers are in order now.
-It's not really our department.

07:36.164 --> 07:39.834
So when Professor Harding took you home,

07:39.917 --> 07:44.964
if I'm not mistaken, that makes you
the last person to see him alive.

07:45.047 --> 07:47.842
<i>Shit. Time to start dancing</i>
<i>as</i> <i>fast</i> <i>as</i> <i>I</i> <i>can.</i>

07:47.925 --> 07:49.760
Not sure that's true, actually.

07:51.512 --> 07:52.930
This is embarrassing.

07:53.014 --> 07:57.852
We both had too much to drink,
and Malcolm was telling me things

07:57.935 --> 08:00.229
that maybe he didn't mean to,

08:00.313 --> 08:02.440
like he found out Simon

08:02.523 --> 08:05.693
had been coercing artists
into making his paintings.

08:05.776 --> 08:10.781
I guess Malcolm gambled and was strapped,
so he was going to make Simon fix it.

08:10.865 --> 08:13.201
I took that to mean "blackmail."

08:14.994 --> 08:17.997
It feels wrong
to be speaking ill of the dead,

08:18.080 --> 08:22.376
but the news has been saying
this could be a serial killer, so...

08:24.879 --> 08:27.215
Maybe the real story is closer to home.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.513
-Anyone who can corroborate this?
-Blue Cahill, yeah.

08:33.596 --> 08:38.017
She's one of the artists
who Simon was taking advantage of.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.103
I heard she might be in rehab.

08:45.441 --> 08:48.152
Well, thanks again for the tea.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.865
If you think of anything else,
you'll let us know.

08:52.949 --> 08:56.410
Yeah, of course. Of course, yeah.
I'll show you out.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.879
<i>"That bitch sent the police</i>
<i>straight to you."</i>

09:06.963 --> 09:09.715
<i>What the fuck? Where the fuck are you?</i>

09:13.177 --> 09:15.680
<i>Show yourself, you coward.</i>

09:16.806 --> 09:18.641
<i>-"Kate's a threat.</i>

09:18.724 --> 09:20.851
<i>Life or death, one might say.</i>

09:22.103 --> 09:23.938
<i>You should take care of her."</i>

09:24.981 --> 09:27.733
<i>And here it is, your real game.</i>

09:29.694 --> 09:31.571
<i>You want me to kill Kate.</i>

09:35.116 --> 09:37.034
<i>No sign, no surveillance equipment.</i>

09:37.118 --> 09:40.246
<i>How many times am I gonna tear</i>
<i>my place apart for you?</i>

09:43.291 --> 09:45.751
<i>Obviously, I'm not going to kill Kate.</i>

09:45.835 --> 09:47.670
<i>But is she your next target?</i>

09:48.421 --> 09:51.090
<i>Last thing I need is playing bodyguard</i>
<i>to the ice witch who hates me.</i>

09:52.842 --> 09:54.844
<i>Keep it generic, noncommittal.</i>

09:57.346 --> 09:58.889
<i>"Kate won't be a problem."</i>

10:00.683 --> 10:02.977
<i>But if your eyes are on her,</i>

10:03.060 --> 10:04.645
<i>mine have to be too.</i>

10:06.689 --> 10:09.775
<i>I go where she goes.</i> <i>And I find you.</i>

10:24.165 --> 10:25.333
Nadia.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.126
Oh. Uh...

10:30.463 --> 10:31.297
Hi.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.176
-What are you doing here?
-I live around the corner.

10:35.259 --> 10:37.803
What are you doing sneaking around
the building of a murder victim?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.600
I'm looking for Malcolm's hide-a-key.

10:43.225 --> 10:46.896
-<i>She needs someone she can trust.</i>
-You left something in there?

10:47.438 --> 10:49.440
Fuck. Fuck.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.985
-Did he tell you?
-I guessed.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.820
I don't think it's common knowledge.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.035
I've written him something. Um...

11:02.787 --> 11:06.457
I've written him a letter
that I shouldn't have and it's in there.

11:06.540 --> 11:10.753
It's amongst all his things,
it's gonna be found and end up a headline.

11:10.836 --> 11:14.924
And then where does it leave me?
I'm completely publicly destroyed.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.178
-Smash my way in it is--
-No, don't. Don't do that.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.096
Um...

11:21.389 --> 11:24.183
-I'm friends with Kate.
<i>-Hardly, but I'll figure it out.</i>

11:25.434 --> 11:27.103
I'll get the letter for you.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.234
I won't break in.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.278
I won't break in yet.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.078
<i>Been there.</i>

11:47.623 --> 11:51.627
<i>Congratulations, the eat-the-rich killer</i>
<i>has managed to go viral.</i>

11:51.710 --> 11:54.672
<i>Unintended consequence</i>
<i>or did you mean to start a movement?</i>

11:54.755 --> 11:57.591
<i>More importantly,</i>
<i>how do I find you at Simon's funeral</i>

11:57.675 --> 12:00.469
<i>in a crowd adept at acting one way</i>
<i>when</i> <i>the</i> <i>cameras</i> <i>are</i> <i>on</i>

12:00.553 --> 12:02.346
<i>and another when they're in private?</i>

12:06.475 --> 12:11.772
<i>So the question becomes, "Whose grief</i>
<i>doesn't feel entirely genuine?"</i>

12:12.982 --> 12:16.610
<i>-Take Sophie Soo, for example...</i>
<i>-Please, in lieu of flowers,</i>

12:16.694 --> 12:20.698
<i>donate to hashtag "smiles for Simon Soo."</i>

12:20.781 --> 12:23.284
<i>...blatantly using grief</i>
<i>to gain followers and donations</i>

12:23.367 --> 12:25.744
<i>for an underprivileged</i>
<i>children's dental charity</i>

12:25.828 --> 12:28.914
<i>that doesn't seem to exist outside</i>
<i>of a hastily put-together website.</i>

12:30.541 --> 12:33.669
<i>Doesn't make her a killer,</i>
<i>but it does make me wonder.</i>

12:33.752 --> 12:39.008
<i>Of course, there's Kate. Must keep her</i>
<i>out of your crosshairs. From a distance.</i>

12:39.550 --> 12:43.179
<i>Then there's Phoebe whose years</i>
<i>of media experience</i> <i>have done little</i>

12:43.262 --> 12:47.099
<i>-to help her publicly process her grief.</i>
<i>-If you're watching this,</i>

12:47.600 --> 12:50.769
<i>help me find the remains</i>
<i>of my friend Malcolm.</i>

12:50.853 --> 12:54.231
<i>He liked corgis and soup.</i>

12:54.940 --> 12:59.195
<i>If you find any bits that belong to him,</i>

12:59.278 --> 13:00.946
<i>please call 999,</i>

13:01.655 --> 13:05.117
<i>and I promise you</i>
<i>you'll be heavily rewarded.</i>

13:05.201 --> 13:07.786
<i>She's a medicated mess</i>
<i>but not a murderer.</i>

13:08.412 --> 13:09.413
<i>What about Adam?</i>

13:09.497 --> 13:13.375
<i>Hard to get a read on him</i>
<i>and I know he's one to keep a secret.</i>

13:14.126 --> 13:16.504
<i>So which is he,</i>
<i>typical stunted American male</i>

13:16.587 --> 13:18.130
<i>or secret serial killer?</i>

13:18.881 --> 13:21.592
<i>Oh, and then there's Rhys Montrose.</i>

13:21.675 --> 13:25.137
<i>Allegedly days away</i>
<i>from declaring his candidacy</i> <i>for mayor.</i>

13:25.221 --> 13:26.680
<i>Savvy political move.</i>

13:26.764 --> 13:28.599
<i>Manipulating the public</i>
<i>by crying over a friend.</i>

13:28.682 --> 13:31.060
<i>Or is he here to manipulate me?</i>

13:50.704 --> 13:53.290
<i>I missed my funeral in Madre Linda,</i>
<i>but from what I read,</i>

13:53.374 --> 13:56.585
<i>it was a low-key affair,</i>
<i>so the exact opposite of this.</i>

14:00.839 --> 14:03.509
-You're here.
-<i>Now's my chance for a truce.</i>

14:03.592 --> 14:05.511
I have no desire
to hear what you have to say,

14:05.594 --> 14:06.929
and I don't know why you've come.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.389
Phoebe invited me.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.684
<i>So much for a ceasefire.</i>

14:14.311 --> 14:18.691
<i>Away from the paparazzi,</i>
<i>they seem more terror-stricken than sad.</i>

14:18.774 --> 14:21.485
If this is a murder-the-rich-
to-get-back-at-the-poor thing,

14:21.569 --> 14:24.113
I hope you know
I inherited nothing but the castle.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.948
<i>Gemma, never not horrible,</i>

14:26.031 --> 14:28.701
<i>but hard to imagine her rousing</i>
<i>the ambition to murder.</i>

14:28.784 --> 14:32.204
<i>Then again, if she's you,</i>
<i>it's all an award-winning act.</i>

14:32.288 --> 14:34.331
Start wearing bulletproof vests.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.001
And destroy this silhouette?
I'd rather be dead.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.503
This is nonsense.
No one's trying to kill us.

14:39.587 --> 14:43.007
<i>Roald, he's not afraid</i>
<i>because he's you</i>

14:43.090 --> 14:45.843
<i>or just too arrogant</i>
<i>to see himself as mortal.</i>

14:47.803 --> 14:50.598
-How are you faring?
-Fine.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.391
You get Malcolm squared away?

14:53.017 --> 14:55.769
We managed to find a spot
near his grandmother

14:55.853 --> 14:58.772
where we can inter the finger.

15:00.274 --> 15:03.944
-I'm so very sorry--
-No, Roald, can we not? Showtime.

15:08.866 --> 15:12.202
<i>Protective or is it you taunting me?</i>

15:14.663 --> 15:16.916
How could I be friends with Simon Soo?

15:19.126 --> 15:24.381
Sure, you may have seen an interview
where he said something wildly off-color.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.092
Doubtless while naked.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.682
But we all wear different masks,
depending.

15:34.600 --> 15:38.145
And of course, parts of us
we can't bear to show to anyone.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.064
<i>What's behind Rhys's mask?</i>

15:40.731 --> 15:43.192
<i>He told me it doesn't take long</i>
<i>to get here from Berlin</i>

15:43.275 --> 15:45.736
<i>-so I can't rule him out.</i>
-What would it have done

15:45.819 --> 15:49.657
to the reputation of an edgy,
purportedly egomaniacal genius

15:49.740 --> 15:53.619
if you also knew he gave a third
of his earnings to charity?

15:54.536 --> 15:56.372
Or do anything for his sister?

16:01.293 --> 16:04.338
-Joan Didion wrote of mourning...
-<i>And he's about to run for mayor.</i>

16:05.005 --> 16:06.090
<i>Call me crazy.</i>

16:06.173 --> 16:09.385
<i>Feels like that will complicate lurking</i>
<i>anonymously to kill people.</i>

16:09.468 --> 16:11.053
"When we mourn our losses,

16:12.638 --> 16:15.015
we also mourn for better or for worse...

16:17.685 --> 16:19.353
-ourselves."
-<i>Fuck.</i>

16:19.436 --> 16:21.063
<i>You have me thinking in circles.</i>

16:21.146 --> 16:23.691
<i>Rhys could be you.</i>
<i>You could be any of them.</i>

16:30.197 --> 16:34.159
<i>Is this how they mourn? How can</i>
<i>I tell what</i> <i>any</i> <i>of them are feeling</i>

16:34.243 --> 16:38.080
<i>when they're high on a cocktail</i>
<i>of grief, fear and designer speed?</i>

16:41.834 --> 16:43.210
Smashing service, eh?

16:45.045 --> 16:47.047
Gathering material for your book?

16:47.131 --> 16:51.051
-<i>Here comes another shakedown.</i>
-It won't be like this for us.

16:52.553 --> 16:53.554
What do you mean?

16:53.637 --> 16:56.724
You know, all this--
I don't know, flashy bollocks.

16:56.807 --> 16:59.727
<i>He thinks we're alike, outsiders.</i>
<i>Is it you?</i>

17:00.644 --> 17:02.396
Fucks with your head, right?

17:03.647 --> 17:07.484
Being so close to it
and watching how they piss it all away,

17:07.568 --> 17:11.113
knowing no matter how hard you work,
this is never gonna be yours.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.782
-Is that how you feel?
-<i>What? No.</i>

17:13.866 --> 17:17.828
-No, I mean you working for--
-No, you see, I love my job.

17:17.911 --> 17:21.123
Lady Phoebe, she treats me like my family,

17:21.206 --> 17:24.293
but being the kindhearted soul
that she is,

17:24.376 --> 17:27.046
she has a tendency
to take in waifs and strays.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.422
So you being here...

17:29.757 --> 17:31.842
isn't a surprise at all, really.

17:32.885 --> 17:38.390
What I find dodgy about you, mate,
is absolutely fucking everything.

17:38.974 --> 17:42.853
<i>Or we have another detective</i>
<i>and it's time to shut this chat down.</i>

17:43.353 --> 17:45.856
Take these concerns up with Lady Phoebe.

17:45.939 --> 17:47.524
I might well do that.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.194
Have a lovely wake.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.877
<i>"Why haven't you killed Kate yet?"</i>

18:10.464 --> 18:12.132
<i>Fuck. Where did she go?</i>

18:26.980 --> 18:28.899
<i>Be nice so I can keep her close.</i>

18:28.982 --> 18:32.486
I think we've somehow gotten off
on the wrong foot. Sorry.

18:32.569 --> 18:38.200
For spying? Or for being put out
when I sent the police to your door?

18:38.283 --> 18:42.121
-It wasn't the most neighborly move.
-Might be important for them

18:42.204 --> 18:44.957
to speak to one of the last people
who saw Malcolm alive.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.710
-Or do you have something to hide?
-No, of course not.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.964
Then all I did was expedite
the clearing of your name.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.342
What I meant was thank you.
You keep helping me.

18:55.425 --> 18:56.426
<i>De-escalate.</i>

18:56.510 --> 18:57.344
God.

18:58.595 --> 19:03.016
As much as I love sarcastic banter
with faux-polite American egotists...

19:03.100 --> 19:06.019
-<i>Egotist?</i>
-...today is not convenient.

19:06.103 --> 19:06.937
You know...

19:08.105 --> 19:09.106
all the death.

19:10.566 --> 19:14.903
So, cooperate with the police,
don't look in my window.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.989
And where is this bloody car?

19:17.906 --> 19:18.907
Enough of this.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.244
Have a lovely afternoon. Or don't.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.669
<i>Damn it. I have to follow her.</i>
<i>She's gonna love this.</i>

19:41.847 --> 19:44.224
<i>Investigation continues</i>
<i>into the suspected murder</i>

19:44.308 --> 19:48.645
<i>of Malcolm Harding,</i>
<i>literature professor at Darcy College.</i>

19:48.729 --> 19:50.772
<i>In a statement, Professor Harding's family</i>

19:50.856 --> 19:54.193
<i>expressed devastation</i>
<i>at the loss of their beloved son...</i>

19:54.276 --> 19:56.570
<i>How do boxers do this</i>
<i>round after round?</i>

19:57.112 --> 19:58.989
-The fuck are you doing?
-<i>Saving</i> <i>her</i> <i>life</i>

19:59.072 --> 20:01.992
<i>-so</i> <i>she</i> <i>can</i> <i>keep</i> <i>being</i> <i>rude to me.</i>
-Sorry I was a dick before.

20:02.075 --> 20:04.578
You want the police to just do their job.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.496
-For you?
-No, he's not staying.

20:06.580 --> 20:11.376
Everything aside, there's an actual killer
on the loose targeting people near you,

20:11.460 --> 20:16.840
-and I don't think it's good to be alone.
-Why? Because I'm a fragile damsel?

20:16.924 --> 20:20.844
Oh, God. It's Captain America here,
if you would like an autograph.

20:22.512 --> 20:23.347
Fuck.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.766
This must be surreal for you.

20:25.849 --> 20:29.895
-You following me like a puppy?
-That's not what I'm talking about.

20:31.521 --> 20:35.192
Your friends pretending nothing's wrong
when any one of them might've--

20:36.068 --> 20:37.110
Might...?

20:37.736 --> 20:38.779
One of them.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.242
Are you serious?

20:43.325 --> 20:45.827
You think one of my friends is the killer,

20:46.453 --> 20:49.873
not the thousands
who would like nothing more

20:50.540 --> 20:52.125
than to eat them alive.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.712
-Still playing shitty Sherlock.
-<i>She's not gonna help figure out</i>

20:55.796 --> 20:58.840
<i>-who you are, that's clear.</i>
-Let's bottom-line this.

20:58.924 --> 21:02.302
Why are you following me?
Is it to fuck me?

21:06.014 --> 21:06.848
No.

21:07.391 --> 21:10.519
To kill me, then?
Is that why you're stalking me?

21:10.602 --> 21:11.979
<i>Don't bite. Don't bite.</i>

21:12.062 --> 21:15.357
You've got it. I've got a thing
for stalking and murder.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.401
This has nothing to do
with wanting to help you.

21:17.484 --> 21:20.279
Why? Why would you even care?

21:20.362 --> 21:22.114
What if I just do?

21:23.365 --> 21:24.992
Whether you like it or not.

21:33.917 --> 21:35.585
Were you an emotional child?

21:38.213 --> 21:40.090
At times, I guess.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.386
When I was young,

21:44.469 --> 21:48.598
my mother forbade me from crying.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.143
If I skinned my knee--

21:51.810 --> 21:53.854
Fuck, when my grandparents died,

21:55.063 --> 21:56.440
she wouldn't look at me

21:57.566 --> 21:59.901
unless I was perfectly stoic.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.990
Hide all feeling...

22:06.283 --> 22:07.284
and it just--

22:08.952 --> 22:10.495
Just became default.

22:13.665 --> 22:16.501
And I'm supposed to be
the grieving girlfriend.

22:17.377 --> 22:18.795
I get it. I really do.

22:19.504 --> 22:23.592
I can say from experience,
it gets messier the more you push it away.

22:27.262 --> 22:28.388
So, what do you do?

22:30.515 --> 22:33.185
Me, personally, if it gets really bad,

22:33.268 --> 22:36.855
I have a cathartic ritual.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.191
I burn something.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.153
It helps.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.114
What if it doesn't work?

22:46.198 --> 22:47.240
What if I just...

22:48.325 --> 22:49.993
can't get it up for Malcolm?

22:51.953 --> 22:53.455
Then grieve for yourself.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.500
You make it sound
like investing was a mistake.

22:57.626 --> 23:02.631
Do you think I didn't know
he was fucking around behind my back?

23:04.216 --> 23:06.802
-I didn't say that.
-Think that's the relationship we had?

23:13.100 --> 23:14.768
Let me show you our favorite spot.

23:15.393 --> 23:17.979
<i>Okay, now she's inviting me</i>
<i>to follow her.</i>

23:21.233 --> 23:22.859
<i>She's not making that easy.</i>

23:23.944 --> 23:25.362
<i>Oh, this is fun.</i>

23:25.445 --> 23:26.279
Kate!

23:32.369 --> 23:33.203
Kate!

23:42.379 --> 23:44.798
Kate, will you please just wait?

23:44.881 --> 23:48.301
-This is not a time for you to run around.
-No one is paying you to do this.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.929
If you're not enjoying yourself,
you are free to go.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.430
It's not safe.

23:52.514 --> 23:53.473
Oh, God.

23:55.142 --> 23:59.479
Quite sweet, you galloping around after me
like some sort of white knight.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.569
You're going to be so disappointed
when you realize

24:05.652 --> 24:09.072
that women in the 21st century
can take care of themselves.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.409
<i>Fuck my life.</i>

24:22.460 --> 24:24.087
<i>Perfect. A secret garden.</i>

24:24.838 --> 24:27.132
<i>So many places for a killer to hide.</i>

24:28.175 --> 24:30.260
<i>Kate really likes to tempt fate.</i>

24:32.596 --> 24:33.597
Still here.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.434
Okay, so what,
you and Malcolm used to get wasted?

24:37.517 --> 24:40.687
-Can we please get the fuck--?
-Shush! Shush.

24:40.770 --> 24:45.025
The neighbors, they'll call the police.
Malcolm and I didn't just drink.

24:45.775 --> 24:48.069
-<i>Is she coming on to me?</i>
-Come on.

24:48.820 --> 24:51.781
There is something to the idea
that you might be watched.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.492
-Ever felt like that?
-Can't say that I have.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.664
If you want to be useful,

25:00.957 --> 25:04.085
I have had a truly awful day.

25:04.794 --> 25:06.922
Distract me, won't you?

25:08.173 --> 25:11.551
<i>I'm pretty sure bodyguards are not</i>
<i>supposed to sleep with clients.</i>

25:11.635 --> 25:13.053
God, you like to think.

25:16.223 --> 25:18.975
You know, I think I--
I think I understand you.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.062
You're a romantic.

25:23.104 --> 25:27.234
I'm too up-front. You don't want to fuck,
you want to make sweet love.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.985
<i>She says that like it's a bad thing.</i>

25:29.069 --> 25:30.612
You don't know who I am or what I want--

25:30.695 --> 25:34.783
I can see you're trying to seem noble
while you hide your true motives.

25:35.700 --> 25:41.456
Come on, Jonathan. You really haven't been
following me because, deep down, you do...

25:41.539 --> 25:42.916
-<i>No. Nope.</i>
-...want...

25:42.999 --> 25:44.709
-<i>No, I don't.</i>
-...to fuck me.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.002
<i>It's a bad idea. No.</i>

25:52.092 --> 25:54.302
So much for my fox-like seduction.

25:55.720 --> 26:00.600
Well, as far as women falling on me goes,
it was pretty gentle, to be honest.

26:05.438 --> 26:06.273
<i>Shit.</i>

26:07.607 --> 26:11.111
<i>No, we're not doing this.</i>

26:13.488 --> 26:15.282
<i>Things are complicated enough.</i>

26:17.284 --> 26:18.743
I can say something...

26:19.953 --> 26:22.038
romantic if you like.

26:25.375 --> 26:29.504
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>this keeps her in my sight, right?</i>

26:30.672 --> 26:32.215
<i>What am I thinking?</i>

26:32.841 --> 26:33.967
<i>No. Fuck.</i>

26:38.763 --> 26:40.515
Don't kiss me, we might fall in love.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.185
<i>This is staying close.</i>

26:44.936 --> 26:46.771
<i>A little distraction for her.</i>

26:47.981 --> 26:49.441
<i>No harm in it.</i>

27:07.292 --> 27:08.543
<i>Oops.</i>

27:08.626 --> 27:11.629
<i>Of all the things I thought might happen</i>
<i>trying to protect Kate,</i>

27:11.713 --> 27:13.548
<i>none of this was on the list.</i>

27:15.633 --> 27:16.801
<i>Shit, where is she?</i>

27:28.938 --> 27:30.148
<i>Still breathing.</i>

27:30.815 --> 27:34.861
<i>I have a small window to help</i>
<i>Nadia solve her love-letter problem.</i>

27:45.330 --> 27:46.581
<i>No letters.</i>

27:46.664 --> 27:49.167
<i>And no pictures of Kate or anyone.</i>

27:50.210 --> 27:52.045
<i>That big, glaring exception.</i>

27:52.796 --> 27:54.381
<i>Surprised it's not a nude.</i>

27:56.925 --> 28:01.763
<i>Leave it to someone as basic as Malcolm</i>
<i>to hide something behind his own portrait.</i>

28:08.603 --> 28:09.729
What are you doing?

28:13.358 --> 28:16.611
One of my students asked me
to find something she wrote.

28:16.694 --> 28:18.780
Is that why you came home with me?

28:18.863 --> 28:23.576
To find a letter from one
of Malcolm's many mindless side-fucks?

28:23.660 --> 28:25.328
No, that would be insane.

28:25.412 --> 28:28.123
-I woke--
-Is this why you think I'm in danger?

28:28.206 --> 28:30.875
Because of some deranged schoolgirl?

28:30.959 --> 28:32.377
-What's her name?
-<i>Fuck.</i>

28:32.460 --> 28:35.213
-No, that's not why.
-I want you to leave. Now.

28:35.296 --> 28:37.298
<i>I can't leave her because of you.</i>

28:37.382 --> 28:40.802
Kate, I know I keep saying it,
but it happens to be true.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.224
It's not safe.

28:51.229 --> 28:55.608
I would rather be cut up
into a thousand tiny pieces

28:55.692 --> 28:58.695
than spend another second alone with you.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.574
Get out.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.466
<i>Kate's driver has been</i>
<i>parked out here all day.</i>

29:20.425 --> 29:24.262
<i>She's closed her blinds</i>
<i>as I stand here slowly starving to death.</i>

29:30.935 --> 29:32.771
<i>"Been watching you 'protect' her."</i>

29:32.854 --> 29:34.314
<i>Fuck you.</i>

29:37.317 --> 29:41.446
<i>"I've figured you out. I think you kill</i>
<i>to protect the things you love.</i>

29:41.529 --> 29:44.157
<i>Kate's not love. Yet." Ever.</i>

29:44.908 --> 29:46.868
<i>"But she did help me see your pattern."</i>

29:46.951 --> 29:50.497
<i>Is this the big insight? What decent man</i>
<i>wouldn't help protect people?</i>

29:51.372 --> 29:54.793
<i>"You like it. How it feels. To kill."</i>

29:54.876 --> 29:56.836
<i>That's insane.</i>

29:56.920 --> 29:59.672
<i>"The life going out of their eyes.</i>
<i>The</i> <i>power.</i>

29:59.756 --> 30:01.549
<i>Bet it makes your dick hard.</i>

30:01.633 --> 30:04.594
<i>Bet it's hard right now</i>
<i>just</i> <i>thinking</i> <i>of</i> <i>it."</i>

30:04.677 --> 30:07.013
<i>"You're insane."</i>

30:07.096 --> 30:08.473
<i>"I'll show you."</i>

30:08.556 --> 30:10.141
<i>Show me how?</i>

30:12.602 --> 30:13.436
<i>No.</i>

30:15.021 --> 30:16.314
Hey, hey, hey! You!

30:36.960 --> 30:39.963
<i>Next on Kate's tour of the best places</i>
<i>to</i> <i>get murdered in</i> <i>London,</i>

30:40.046 --> 30:42.382
<i>a 700-year-old crypt.</i>

30:51.015 --> 30:54.936
<i>Only one way in or out. You'll</i> <i>have</i>
<i>to</i> <i>go</i> <i>through me to get to</i> <i>her.</i>

30:55.770 --> 30:56.771
Oh, Malcolm.

30:58.273 --> 31:01.818
You'd find this absurd,
me speaking to a box

31:01.901 --> 31:03.987
where your little finger were buried.

31:04.070 --> 31:08.074
Jesus. You'd make some wicked joke
about necrophilia.

31:08.700 --> 31:12.370
Try making me feel guilty
for not giving you more blowjobs.

31:16.749 --> 31:18.293
You were a pompous,

31:19.210 --> 31:20.753
lazy slut.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.883
But you made me forget my family.

31:27.176 --> 31:28.344
You made me laugh.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.889
You cared about me.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.352
Surely that's worth a tear or two.

31:39.981 --> 31:40.982
Goddamn it.

31:57.874 --> 31:58.917
Hiya.

32:00.418 --> 32:03.630
Do yourself a favor
and don't make me pull the trigger.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.924
-Okay.
-So, what are you up to?

32:06.007 --> 32:08.801
Sneaky, little fucker. Ay?

32:09.802 --> 32:11.429
Is she your next victim?

32:11.512 --> 32:13.681
No. She's in danger.

32:16.476 --> 32:17.477
Hello.

32:21.981 --> 32:23.316
That's Malcolm's ring.

32:28.738 --> 32:29.572
<i>How?</i>

32:34.911 --> 32:36.996
Somebody's trying to frame me.

32:40.500 --> 32:44.170
I'm sure the old Bill is gonna love
hearing all about it.

32:44.253 --> 32:45.672
And Lady Phoebe.

32:52.053 --> 32:54.138
<i>That would have hurt</i>
<i>if I still had toes there.</i>

33:21.749 --> 33:22.750
<i>You're wrong.</i>

33:23.543 --> 33:26.421
<i>You are wrong.</i>
<i>My</i> <i>dick's</i> <i>never</i> <i>been</i> <i>softer.</i>

33:27.880 --> 33:30.341
<i>I hated that. I am nothing like you.</i>

33:30.425 --> 33:32.510
<i>You don't know me as well as you think.</i>

33:45.064 --> 33:46.607
<i>I've gotten too good at this.</i>

33:47.483 --> 33:50.778
<i>Vic was wrong.</i> <i>He thought</i>
<i>he'd</i> <i>never</i> <i>get</i> <i>pomp</i> <i>and</i> <i>circumstance,</i>

33:50.862 --> 33:53.656
<i>but he's being buried</i>
<i>with</i> <i>Simon's gold-plated coffin.</i>

33:53.740 --> 33:54.949
<i>Not too shabby.</i>

33:56.909 --> 34:01.080
<i>I'd say a few words,</i>
<i>but</i> <i>I</i> <i>doubt</i> <i>Vic</i> <i>was</i> <i>a</i> <i>Didion fan.</i>

34:07.378 --> 34:08.796
<i>At least I knew him well enough</i>

34:08.880 --> 34:11.966
<i>to</i> <i>write</i> <i>an effusively grateful letter</i>
<i>of</i> <i>resignation to Lady Phoebe.</i>

34:12.467 --> 34:14.719
<i>They were like family, after all.</i>

34:31.235 --> 34:34.155
<i>I vowed, never again.</i>

34:36.240 --> 34:37.617
<i>I was on a new path.</i>

34:39.368 --> 34:40.369
<i>Until you.</i>

34:45.500 --> 34:46.918
<i>You set me up.</i>

34:48.252 --> 34:50.880
<i>You planted that ring,</i>
<i>so</i> <i>Vic</i> <i>would</i> <i>find</i> <i>it.</i>

34:52.673 --> 34:54.425
<i>"I was right, wasn't I? You liked it."</i>

34:54.509 --> 34:57.136
No! You sick fuck!

34:58.054 --> 35:01.516
<i>"The only thing you've accomplished</i>
<i>is making me determined to end you.</i>

35:01.599 --> 35:03.893
<i>I may not enjoy it,</i>
<i>but</i> <i>the</i> <i>world</i> <i>will</i> <i>be</i> <i>better,</i>

35:04.477 --> 35:06.270
<i>and no one will mourn you--"</i>

35:10.691 --> 35:14.112
<i>Wait. Is that why you're fixated on me?</i>

35:14.695 --> 35:15.988
<i>Are you lonely?</i>

35:17.240 --> 35:20.618
<i>Poe's narrator searching</i>
<i>for</i> <i>connection</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>crowd.</i>

35:23.663 --> 35:24.914
<i>You want a friend.</i>

35:24.997 --> 35:26.791
<i>You want us to be the same.</i>

35:26.874 --> 35:28.042
<i>Kindred</i> <i>spirits.</i>

35:29.043 --> 35:30.503
<i>And if you think we are,</i>

35:31.504 --> 35:34.132
<i>maybe you'll wanna take this IRL.</i>

35:36.175 --> 35:40.346
<i>"You were right. That was exhilarating."</i>

35:52.483 --> 35:54.944
<i>After I laid Vic to rest,</i>
<i>I tracked Kate home.</i>

35:56.612 --> 35:57.989
<i>She hasn't left since.</i>

35:58.072 --> 36:01.701
<i>Probably exhausted, considering</i> <i>how</i> <i>many</i>
<i>people in her life you've murdered lately.</i>

36:02.410 --> 36:03.786
<i>Anyway, she's in there.</i>

36:05.705 --> 36:07.999
<i>Meanwhile, you're ghosting me.</i>

36:09.584 --> 36:12.253
<i>Many have begun to suspect</i>
<i>that</i> <i>Professor</i> <i>Harding's murder</i>

36:12.336 --> 36:14.839
<i>was related to another high-profile death,</i>

36:14.922 --> 36:19.051
<i>that of artist Simon Soo,</i>
<i>who</i> <i>was</i> <i>a</i> <i>friend</i> <i>of Professor Harding</i>

36:19.135 --> 36:20.511
<i>and whose body was allegedly--</i>

36:21.596 --> 36:24.390
<i>Was I wrong?</i>
<i>Did I come on too strong?</i>

36:25.057 --> 36:27.143
<i>Or will you take the bait</i>
<i>and suggest we meet?</i>

36:31.189 --> 36:34.275
<i>Great. I'm in purgatory. You won't talk</i>
<i>to</i> <i>me, Kate won't talk to</i> <i>me.</i>

36:34.358 --> 36:37.570
<i>So I'm still watching her window.</i>
<i>This is perfect. Thank you.</i>

37:06.098 --> 37:08.601
<i>I guess I'm not the only one in purgatory.</i>

37:19.320 --> 37:23.282
<i>If she can't shed a tear, at least</i>
<i>she can destroy that heinous portrait.</i>

37:48.224 --> 37:49.558
<i>I hope it helps.</i>

37:51.769 --> 37:52.937
<i>Shit.</i>

38:11.247 --> 38:14.875
<i>-There you are-- Shit, it's just Phoebe.</i>

38:25.052 --> 38:27.513
Oh. Come on in. Just give me a second.

38:27.596 --> 38:30.224
<i>With all this mystery</i>
<i>and ambiguity you stuck me in,</i>

38:30.308 --> 38:34.020
<i>I can at least do one simple good thing</i>
<i>for a good person.</i>

38:34.103 --> 38:37.231
-My God, thank you.
-Don't worry. I didn't read it.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.901
Well, I wouldn't care if you had.
It's very well-written.

38:43.446 --> 38:47.366
I was reminded of this recently.
I think it might help you.

38:47.450 --> 38:48.326
Joan Didion.

38:52.455 --> 38:53.998
I can't believe he's dead.

38:56.083 --> 38:58.669
I've never known anyone
that's died before.

39:00.963 --> 39:03.174
-It feels awful.
-Yeah, it does.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.177
Until it doesn't.

39:09.388 --> 39:10.473
When will that be?

39:10.973 --> 39:13.642
I think that looks different on everybody.

39:14.810 --> 39:17.146
The guilt only makes it worse.

39:17.229 --> 39:19.523
I don't think you should feel guilty
for loving anybody.

39:20.232 --> 39:21.525
I didn't love him.

39:22.485 --> 39:23.986
Okay, caring, then.

39:24.570 --> 39:29.492
Sometimes we care for the wrong people
and it doesn't make us bad, only human.

39:33.746 --> 39:34.580
Thank you.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.543
I'll see you in class.

39:39.627 --> 39:40.669
Okay.

39:48.427 --> 39:52.348
<i>I need to follow my own advice.</i>
<i>Stop feeling so guilty.</i>

39:53.349 --> 39:56.310
<i>I've made mistakes, but I can do better.</i>

40:01.107 --> 40:03.776
<i>"I think it's time for us to meet."</i>
<i>It</i> <i>worked.</i>

40:03.859 --> 40:06.278
<i>And now I understand how to talk to you.</i>

40:07.279 --> 40:08.906
<i>"One condition.</i>

40:08.989 --> 40:11.158
<i>Leave Kate alone. She's mine."</i>

40:13.244 --> 40:15.329
<i>"There's the Joe I've been looking for."</i>

40:15.413 --> 40:18.874
<i>Now that Kate's off-limits and I don't</i>
<i>need to run around bodyguarding her...</i>

40:18.958 --> 40:20.960
<i>"When and where?"</i>

40:23.421 --> 40:24.505
<i>"Details soon."</i>

40:30.302 --> 40:31.804
<i>How soon?</i>

40:33.431 --> 40:35.933
<i>No more texting, no more games.</i>

40:41.439 --> 40:43.232
<i>This can't be good.</i>

40:51.031 --> 40:54.702
Professor Moore. If we might have
the briefest moment of your time?

40:56.078 --> 40:58.247
Or course. Anything to help.
