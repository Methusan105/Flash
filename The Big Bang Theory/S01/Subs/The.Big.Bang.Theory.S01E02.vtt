WEBVTT

00:02.794 --> 00:05.005
Here you go. Pad Thai, no peanuts.

00:05.172 --> 00:06.423
Does it have peanut oil?

00:06.590 --> 00:07.633
I'm not sure.

00:07.799 --> 00:11.762
Everyone keep an eye on Howard
in case he starts to swell up.

00:11.929 --> 00:15.098
Since it's not bee season,
you can have my epinephrine.

00:15.641 --> 00:18.352
- Any chopsticks?
- Don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.853
Here we go.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.148
Thailand has had the fork
since the latter half of the 19th century.

00:23.315 --> 00:27.069
They don't put the fork in their mouth,
they use it to put the food on a spoon...

00:27.236 --> 00:29.446
Which then goes into their mouth.

00:29.613 --> 00:32.115
Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.450
[Knocking on door]

00:33.617 --> 00:34.952
I'll get it.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.788
Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.249
- Hey, Leonard.
- Oh, hi, penny.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.458
- Am I interrupting?
- No.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.085
Sheldon:
You're not swelling, Howard.

00:43.252 --> 00:45.652
Howard: No, look at my fingers,
they're like Vienna sausages.

00:46.255 --> 00:49.508
- Sounds like you have company.
- They're not going anywhere.

00:50.342 --> 00:53.136
So you're coming home from work.
That's great. How was work?

00:53.303 --> 00:55.055
You know, it's a cheesecake factory...

00:55.222 --> 00:57.558
People order cheesecake
and I bring it to them.

00:57.724 --> 01:02.729
So you kind of act
as like a carbohydrate delivery system?

01:03.689 --> 01:06.233
Yeah, call it whatever you want,
I get minimum wage.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.737
I was wondering
if you could help me out...

01:10.904 --> 01:13.031
-Yes.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.534
Okay, great, I'm having
some furniture delivered...

01:15.701 --> 01:18.036
And I may not be here, so, oh...

01:21.164 --> 01:23.250
[Speaks in Russian]

01:24.626 --> 01:25.669
I'm sorry?

01:25.836 --> 01:29.172
Haven't you ever been told
how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?

01:29.339 --> 01:31.925
- No, I haven't.
- Get used to it.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.177
Yeah, I probably won't.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.305
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hi.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.181
Hey, raj.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.476
Still not talking to me, huh?

01:41.643 --> 01:43.687
Don't take it personally,
it's his pathology.

01:43.854 --> 01:46.648
- He can't talk to women.
- He can't talk to attractive women.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.318
Or in your case,
a cheesecake-scented goddess.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.446
- There's gonna be some furniture delivered?
- Yeah.

01:52.613 --> 01:56.199
If it gets here and I'm not here,
could you sign for it and put it in?

01:56.366 --> 01:58.702
- Yeah, no problem.
- Great, here's my spare key.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.495
Thank you.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.040
- Penny, wait.
- Yeah?

02:06.376 --> 02:08.045
If you don't have any other plans...

02:08.211 --> 02:11.381
Do you wanna join us for Thai food
and a Superman movie marathon?

02:11.548 --> 02:14.343
A marathon? Wow, how many
Superman movies are there?

02:14.760 --> 02:17.638
You're kidding, right?

02:17.804 --> 02:20.515
I do like the one where
Lois Lane falls from the helicopter...

02:20.682 --> 02:21.975
And Superman catches her.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.561
- Which one was that?
- One.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.565
You realize that scene was rife
with scientific inaccuracy?

02:28.732 --> 02:30.484
Yes, I know, men can't fly.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.152
No, let's assume that they can.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.238
Lois Lane is falling.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.866
Accelerating at an initial rate
of 32 feet per second.

02:38.033 --> 02:41.078
Superman swoops down to save her
by reaching out two arms of steel.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.996
Miss Lane, who is now traveling...

02:43.163 --> 02:45.582
At approximately
120 miles an hour, hits them...

02:45.749 --> 02:48.710
And is immediately
sliced into three equal pieces.

02:50.045 --> 02:53.423
Unless Superman
matches her speed and decelerates.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.300
In what space, sir? In what space?

02:55.467 --> 02:56.885
She's 2 feet above the ground.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.097
If he really loved her,
he'd let her hit the pavement.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.599
- It would be a more merciful death.
- That doesn't...

03:02.766 --> 03:06.520
Excuse me, your entire argument
is predicated on the assumption...

03:06.687 --> 03:09.022
That Superman's flight
is a feat of strength.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.607
Are you listening to yourself?

03:10.774 --> 03:12.943
Superman's flight is a feat of strength.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.362
An extension of his ability
to leap buildings...

03:15.529 --> 03:17.656
An ability he derives
from exposure to sun...

03:17.823 --> 03:19.700
How does he fly at night?

03:19.866 --> 03:21.993
A combination
of the moon's solar reflection...

03:22.160 --> 03:25.205
And the energy storage capacity
of Kryptonian skin cells.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.291
I'm just gonna go wash up.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.293
I have 2600 comic books in there.

03:30.460 --> 03:34.047
I challenge you to find a single reference
to Kryptonian skin cells.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.466
Challenge accepted.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.721
We're locked out.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.056
Also, the pretty girl left.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.332
Okay.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.753
Her apartment's on the fourth floor,
elevator is broken, you're gonna...

04:12.919 --> 04:15.464
Oh, you're just gonna be done?
Okay, cool, thanks.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.677
- I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.
- I hardly think so.

04:21.386 --> 04:22.804
Why not?

04:22.971 --> 04:24.556
Well, we don't have a Dolly...

04:24.723 --> 04:28.477
Or lifting belts,
or any measurable upper-body strength.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.313
We don't need strength.
We're physicists.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.815
We are the intellectual
descendents of Archimedes.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.526
Give me a fulcrum and a lever
and I can move the earth.

04:36.693 --> 04:39.362
It's just a matter... I don't have this!
I do not have this!

04:40.322 --> 04:43.074
Archimedes would be so proud.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.582
Do you have any ideas?

04:50.749 --> 04:53.877
Yes, but they all involve
a green lantern and a power ring.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.965
Easy. Easy.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.805
Okay. Now we've got an inclined plane.

05:04.971 --> 05:08.433
Force required to lift is reduced
by the sine of the angle of the stairs...

05:08.600 --> 05:10.477
Call it 30 degrees, so about half.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.562
Exactly half.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.106
Exactly half.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.401
Let's push.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.780
Okay.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.032
See, it's moving. This is easy.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.617
It's all in the math.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.246
- What's your formula for the corner?
- What?

05:31.748 --> 05:33.708
Oh, okay.

05:35.377 --> 05:38.964
Okay, yeah, no problem.
Just come up here, help me pull and turn.

05:43.301 --> 05:46.972
Oh, gravity, thou art a heatless bitch.

05:48.223 --> 05:50.100
You do understand
that our efforts here...

05:50.267 --> 05:54.771
Will in no way increase the odds of you
having sexual congress with this woman?

05:55.272 --> 05:57.816
Men do things for women
without expecting sex.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.068
Yeah, those would be men
who just had sex.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.655
I'm doing this to be a good neighbor.

06:04.656 --> 06:07.993
In any case, there's no way
it could lower the odds.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.788
Almost there.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.790
Almost there.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.625
- Almost there.
- Sheldon: No, we're not.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.003
- No, we're not. No, we're not.
- I'm sorry.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.589
- Watch your fingers.
- Yeah.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.216
Oh, god, my fingers!

06:24.885 --> 06:26.970
- You okay?
- No, it hurt...

06:27.137 --> 06:30.348
Great Caesar's ghost, look at this place.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.393
So penny is a little messy.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.228
A little messy?

06:35.395 --> 06:38.315
The mandelbrot set
of complex numbers is a little messy.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.608
This is chaos.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.735
Excuse me.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.194
Explain to me a system...

06:43.361 --> 06:46.531
Where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid?

06:46.698 --> 06:48.658
I'm just inferring that this is a couch...

06:48.825 --> 06:52.787
Because the evidence suggests the
coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.

06:53.663 --> 06:57.000
Did it occur to you that not everyone
has the compulsive need to sort...

06:57.167 --> 06:59.628
Organize and label
the entire world around them?

07:03.089 --> 07:04.299
Well, they don't.

07:04.466 --> 07:05.926
Hard as it may be to believe...

07:06.092 --> 07:10.597
Most people don't sort their breakfast
cereal numerically by fiber content.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.351
Excuse me, but I think
we've both found that helpful at times.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.814
- Come on, we should go.
- Hang on.

07:20.732 --> 07:23.652
- What are you doing?
- I'm straightening up.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.695
Sheldon, this is not your home.

07:25.862 --> 07:29.449
This is not anyone's home.
This is a swirling vortex of entropy.

07:31.368 --> 07:34.704
When the transvestite lived here,
you didn't care how he kept the place.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.081
Because it was immaculate.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.249
I mean, you open that man's closet...

07:38.416 --> 07:43.713
It was left to right, evening gowns,
cocktail dresses and his police uniforms.

07:44.297 --> 07:48.093
- What were you doing in his closet?
- I helped him run some cable for a webcam.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.053
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, penny.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.347
This just arrived.
Brought this up. Just now.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.724
Great. Was it hard getting up the stairs?

07:56.226 --> 07:59.896
-No.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.065
- We'll get out of your hair.
- Okay, great.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.275
Thank you again.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.946
Penny?

08:08.113 --> 08:10.991
I just want you to know
that you don't have to live like this.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.785
I'm here for you.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.247
What's he talking about?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.000
- It's a joke.
- I don't get it.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.584
Yeah, he didn't tell it right.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.507
[Door opens and closes]

08:51.072 --> 08:52.699
Hello?

09:14.345 --> 09:16.973
- [Whispering] Sheldon?
- Shh!

09:17.974 --> 09:19.642
[Whispering] Penny's sleeping.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.188
Are you insane?

09:23.354 --> 09:26.983
You can't break into a woman's apartment
in the middle of the night and clean.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.151
I had no choice.

09:28.318 --> 09:31.821
I couldn't sleep knowing that just
outside my bedroom was our living room...

09:31.988 --> 09:34.282
And outside our living room
was that hallway...

09:34.449 --> 09:37.744
And immediately adjacent
to that hallway was this.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.914
Do you realize that if penny wakes up...

09:41.081 --> 09:43.917
There is no reasonable explanation
as to why we're here?

09:44.334 --> 09:46.836
I just gave you a reasonable explanation.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.798
No, no. You gave me an explanation.

09:49.964 --> 09:53.301
It's reasonableness will be determined
by a jury of your peers.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.763
Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.807
Sheldon, we have to get out of here.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.850
[Penny snoring]

10:02.143 --> 10:04.938
You might want to speak
in a lower register.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.773
What?

10:06.940 --> 10:10.401
Evolution has made women sensitive
to high-pitch noises while they sleep...

10:10.568 --> 10:12.695
So that they'll be roused
by a crying baby.

10:12.862 --> 10:16.950
If you want to avoid waking her,
speak in a lower register.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.202
That's ridiculous!

10:19.369 --> 10:21.204
[Penny snores]

10:22.622 --> 10:27.043
[In deep voice]
No, that's ridiculous.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.256
[In deep voice] Fine.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.343
I accept your premise.
Now, please let's go.

10:35.510 --> 10:38.513
- I'm not leaving until I'm done.
- Oh, no.

10:42.058 --> 10:45.854
If you have time to lean,
you have time to clean.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.317
Oh, what the hell.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.990
[Humming]

10:58.700 --> 11:00.118
Good morning.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.870
Morning.

11:02.036 --> 11:05.373
I have to say I slept splendidly.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.751
Granted not long,
but just deeply and well.

11:08.918 --> 11:09.961
I'm not surprised.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.921
A well-known folk cure for insomnia...

11:12.088 --> 11:14.883
Is to break
into your neighbor's apartment and clean.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.427
Sarcasm?

11:17.594 --> 11:18.761
You think?

11:19.470 --> 11:22.056
Granted, my methods
may have been somewhat unorthodox...

11:22.223 --> 11:25.018
But the end result
will be a measurable enhancement...

11:25.185 --> 11:26.936
To penny's quality of life.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.607
You've convinced me, maybe we should
sneak in and shampoo her carpet.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.693
- You don't think that crosses a line?
- Yes.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.320
For god's sake, Sheldon...

11:35.486 --> 11:39.282
Do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?

11:39.449 --> 11:42.285
You have a sarcasm sign?

11:44.078 --> 11:46.623
No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.208
You want some cereal?

11:48.374 --> 11:51.836
I feel so good today, I'm gonna choose
from the low-fiber end of the shelf.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.297
Hello, honey puffs.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.507
Penny: Son of a bitch!

11:57.467 --> 11:59.302
Penny's up.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.513
Penny: You sick, geeky bastards!

12:03.473 --> 12:05.475
How did she know it was us?

12:06.559 --> 12:09.103
I may have left
a suggested organizational schematic...

12:09.270 --> 12:10.980
For her bedroom closet.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.148
Penny: Leonard?

12:12.315 --> 12:13.441
This is gonna be bad.

12:13.608 --> 12:16.736
Goodbye, honey puffs. Hello, big bran.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.530
You came into my apartment
while I was sleeping?

12:19.697 --> 12:20.865
Yes, but only to clean.

12:21.032 --> 12:24.535
Really more to organize,
you're not actually dirty, per se.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.871
Give me back my key.

12:27.830 --> 12:28.831
I'm very, very sorry.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.292
Do you understand how creepy this is?

12:31.459 --> 12:33.503
Yes, we discussed it at length last night.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.172
In my apartment? While I was sleeping?

12:36.339 --> 12:39.342
And snoring.
And that's probably just a sinus infection.

12:39.509 --> 12:43.096
But it could be sleep apnea. You might
wanna see an otorhinolaryngologist.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.558
The throat doctor.

12:48.726 --> 12:52.188
And what kind of doctor
removes shoes from asses?

12:52.897 --> 12:54.065
Depending on the depth...

12:54.232 --> 12:59.487
That's either a proctologist,
or a general surgeon.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.248
- God!
- Okay, look. No, penny...

13:10.415 --> 13:13.293
I think what you're feeling is valid
and maybe later today...

13:13.459 --> 13:16.671
When you're feeling less,
for lack of a better word, violated...

13:16.838 --> 13:18.381
Maybe we can talk about this.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.009
- Stay away from me.
- Sure. That's another way to go.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.219
Penny, penny, hold on.

13:23.386 --> 13:24.721
Just to clarify...

13:24.887 --> 13:28.766
Because there will be a discussion
when you leave.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.895
Is your objection solely to our presence
in the apartment while you were sleeping...

13:33.062 --> 13:37.650
Or do you also object to the imposition
of a new organizational paradigm?

13:42.739 --> 13:43.740
[Door slams]

13:43.906 --> 13:46.159
Well, that was a little non-responsive.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.871
You are going to march yourself
over there right now and apologize.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.664
[Sheldon laughs]

13:54.667 --> 13:56.210
What's funny?

13:56.377 --> 13:58.338
That wasn't sarcasm?

14:00.548 --> 14:03.843
Boy, you are all over the place
this morning.

14:07.013 --> 14:10.808
I have a master's and two ph. Ds,
I should not have to do this.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.602
What?

14:12.769 --> 14:15.104
I'm truly sorry
for what happened last night.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.106
I take full responsibility.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.859
I hope that it won't color
your opinion of Leonard...

14:20.026 --> 14:26.115
Who is not only a wonderful guy, but
also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.010
Hey, raj.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.477
Hey, I don't know if you heard about
what happened with Leonard and Sheldon...

14:54.644 --> 14:56.312
But I'm really upset about it.

14:56.479 --> 14:59.649
I mean, they let themselves into my place,
and then they cleaned it.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.610
Can you even believe that?
How weird is that?

15:02.777 --> 15:05.029
Rajesh [in voice-over]:
She's standing very close to me.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.657
Oh, my. She does smell good.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.159
What is that? Vanilla?

15:10.326 --> 15:11.327
You know?

15:11.494 --> 15:14.705
Where I come from, someone comes
into your house at night, you shoot.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.666
Okay? And you don't shoot to wound.

15:16.833 --> 15:21.504
I mean, all right, my sister shot her husband,
but it was an accident, they were drunk.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.714
What was I saying?

15:23.881 --> 15:25.508
She's so chatty.

15:26.676 --> 15:30.304
Maybe my parents were right. Maybe
I 'd be better off with an Indian girl.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.348
We 'd have
the same cultural background...

15:32.515 --> 15:36.018
And my wife could sing to my children
the lullabies my mother sang to me.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.603
It's obvious they meant well.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.856
I'm having a really rough time.
Like I said...

15:40.022 --> 15:42.358
I broke up with my boyfriend
and it's freaking me out.

15:42.525 --> 15:44.861
[Rajesh singing in foreign language
in voice-over]

15:47.071 --> 15:50.491
I mean, just because most of the men
I've known happened to be jerks...

15:50.658 --> 15:53.661
Doesn't mean I should just assume
Leonard and Sheldon are.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.163
Right?

15:55.329 --> 15:58.207
She asked me a question.
I should probably nod.

16:00.168 --> 16:01.586
That's exactly what I thought.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.088
Thank you for listening. You're a doll.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.634
Uh-oh. Turn your pelvis.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.431
[Dance music plays on TV]

16:21.898 --> 16:25.067
Grab a napkin, homey,
you just got served.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.779
It's fine. You win.

16:30.573 --> 16:31.741
What's his problem?

16:32.241 --> 16:34.911
His imaginary girlfriend
broke up with him.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.414
Been there.

16:41.584 --> 16:45.004
Sorry I'm late, but I was in
the hallway, chatting up penny.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.589
Really? You?

16:46.756 --> 16:48.925
Rajesh Koothrappali spoke to penny?

16:49.258 --> 16:52.136
Actually,
I was less the chatter than the chattee.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.639
What did she say? Is she still mad at me?

16:54.805 --> 16:56.265
Well, she was upset at first...

16:56.432 --> 16:59.936
But probably
because her sister shot somebody.

17:01.312 --> 17:05.149
Then there was something about you,
and then she hugged me.

17:05.316 --> 17:08.611
She hugged you? How did she hug you?

17:16.494 --> 17:18.955
Is that her perfume I smell?

17:20.289 --> 17:22.291
Intoxicating, isn't it?

17:38.766 --> 17:41.435
-Hi.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.145
What's going on?

17:45.523 --> 17:47.483
Here's the thing:

17:51.529 --> 17:57.577
"Penny, just as Oppenheimer came to regret
his contributions to the first atomic bomb...

17:57.743 --> 17:59.996
So too I regret my participation
in what was...

18:00.162 --> 18:02.957
At the very least, an error in judgment.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.168
The hallmark
of the great human experiment...

18:06.335 --> 18:08.588
Is the willingness
to recognize one's mistakes.

18:08.754 --> 18:12.508
Madam curie's discovery of radium
turned out to have great potential...

18:12.675 --> 18:16.971
Even though she would later die a siow,
painful death from radiation poisoning.

18:18.681 --> 18:21.309
Another example,
from the field of ebola research..."

18:21.475 --> 18:23.019
Leonard.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.770
Yeah?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.858
We're okay.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.338
- Leonard: Six two-inch dowels?
- Check.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.757
- One package Philips head screws?
- Check.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.884
Guys, seriously, I grew up
on a farm, okay?

18:55.051 --> 18:57.261
I rebuilt a tractor engine
when I was, like, 12.

18:57.428 --> 19:00.014
I think I can put together
a cheap Swedish media center.

19:00.181 --> 19:03.017
Please, we insist.
It's the least we can do, considering...

19:03.184 --> 19:04.268
Considering what?

19:04.435 --> 19:07.271
How great this place looks?

19:07.647 --> 19:10.066
- Oh, boy, I was afraid of this.
- What?

19:10.232 --> 19:12.735
These instructions
are a pictographic representation...

19:12.902 --> 19:15.738
Of the least imaginative way
to assemble these components.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.741
This right here
is why Sweden has no space program.

19:20.076 --> 19:23.162
- It looked pretty good in the store.
- It is an inefficient design.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.929
For example,
penny has a flatscreen TV...

19:25.081 --> 19:27.124
Which means all this space
behind it is wasted.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.919
- We could put her stereo back there.
- And control it how?

19:30.086 --> 19:34.382
Run an infrared repeater,
photocell here, emitter here, easy-peasy.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.468
- Good point. How will you cool it?
- Guys, I got this.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.804
- Hang on, penny.
- How about fans?

19:39.970 --> 19:43.391
- Here and here.
- Also inefficient, and might be loud.

19:43.557 --> 19:46.102
How about a liquid cooler?
A little aquarium pump here.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.770
Run some quarter-inch pvc...

19:47.937 --> 19:49.772
Guys, this is actually really simple.

19:50.481 --> 19:52.108
Hold on, honey, men at work.

19:54.485 --> 19:57.947
Pvc comes here. Maybe a little
corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.

19:58.114 --> 20:01.575
Show me where we put a drip tray,
a sluice and a overflow reservoir?

20:01.742 --> 20:04.662
If water's involved,
we'll ground the crap out of the thing.

20:04.829 --> 20:08.499
Guys, it's hot in here.
I think I'll just take off all my clothes.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.964
Oh, I've got it.

20:15.965 --> 20:20.720
What if we replaced panels a, b and f and
crossbar h with aircraft-grade aluminum?

20:20.886 --> 20:23.055
- Entire thing's one big heat sink.
- Perfect.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.809
Leonard and Sheldon, go to the junkyard
and pick up 6 square meters of aluminum.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.770
- Raj and I will get the oxyacetylene torch.
- Meet in an hour?

20:29.937 --> 20:31.689
- Done.
- Got it.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.861
Okay, this place does look pretty good.
