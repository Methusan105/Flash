00:03.170 --> 00:05.756
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking
about time travel again.

00:05.923 --> 00:08.759
Why? Did you hit a roadblock
with invisibility?

00:10.093 --> 00:11.470
Put it on the back burner.

00:12.429 --> 00:15.641
Anyway, it occurs to me,
if I ever did perfect a time machine...

00:15.807 --> 00:17.935
I'd go into the past
and give it to myself.

00:18.101 --> 00:21.647
Thus eliminating the need for me
to invent it in the first place.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.817
- Interesting.
- Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.

00:26.568 --> 00:27.819
Sounds like a breakthrough.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.489
Should I call science
and tell them to hold the cover?

00:30.656 --> 00:32.991
It's time travel, Leonard.
I will have done that.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.912
I guess congratulations are in order.

00:37.079 --> 00:41.041
No, congratulations
will have been in order.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.210
You know,
I'm not going to enjoy this party.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.337
Leonard:
I know, I'm familiar with you.

00:45.796 --> 00:48.340
Sheldon: The last party,
professor finkleday cornered me...

00:48.507 --> 00:50.842
And talked about spelunking
for 45 minutes.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.052
Yes, I was there.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.054
You know what's interesting
aboutcaves?

00:54.221 --> 00:56.557
- What?
- Nothing.

00:57.432 --> 01:01.812
We'll avoid finkleday, meet the new head,
congratulate him, shake his hand and go.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.940
Sheldon: How's this?
"Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.985
How fortunate for you
the university has chosen to hire you...

01:08.151 --> 01:11.238
Despite the fact you've done
no original research in 25 years...

01:11.405 --> 01:13.323
And instead have written books...

01:13.490 --> 01:16.410
That reduce the great concepts
of science to anecdotes...

01:16.577 --> 01:17.786
Each one dumbed down...

01:17.953 --> 01:21.707
To accommodate the duration
of an average bowel movement."

01:22.457 --> 01:24.167
[Speaks in Hawaiian]

01:27.170 --> 01:29.923
- "Mahalo" is a nice touch.
- Hmm.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.509
Only eight consonants
in the Hawaiian language.

01:32.676 --> 01:35.012
Leonard:
Interesting, you should lead with that.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.850
Oh, god, look at this buffet.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.852
I love america.

01:42.019 --> 01:46.231
- You don't have buffets in India?
- Of course, but it's all Indian food.

01:46.565 --> 01:49.401
You can't find a bagel in Mumbai
to save your life.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.361
Smear me.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.866
- Well, here's an interesting turn of events.
- What?

01:58.577 --> 01:59.870
Howard brought a date?

02:00.037 --> 02:04.916
A more plausible explanation is that his
work in robotics has made an amazing leap.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.795
Hey, what up, science bitches?

02:10.213 --> 02:12.883
May I introduce my special lady friend,
summer.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.801
Howard, I told you, touching's extra.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.595
Right. Sorry.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.098
Here comes our new boss. Be polite.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.516
Man: Hi, fellas.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.560
- Eric gablehauser.
- Howard Wolowitz.

02:23.727 --> 02:26.438
Howard, nice to meet you. And you are?

02:27.439 --> 02:29.775
An actual real scientist.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.613
How was that?

02:35.864 --> 02:38.575
I can't believe he fired me.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.119
You did call him
a glorified science teacher...

02:41.286 --> 02:45.874
Whose last successful experiment
was lighting his own farts.

02:46.333 --> 02:50.712
In my defense, I prefaced that by saying
"with all due respect."

03:16.988 --> 03:18.115
Morning.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.658
Morning.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.868
You're making eggs for breakfast?

03:22.035 --> 03:25.038
This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment.

03:25.372 --> 03:28.583
Oh. Because it looks a lot like breakfast.

03:28.750 --> 03:32.629
I finally have time to test my hypothesis
about the separation of water molecules...

03:32.796 --> 03:36.383
From the egg proteins
and its impact vis-a-vis taste.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.803
Sounds yummy.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.055
I look fonnard to your work with bacon.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.979
You know, I'm sure if you just apologize
to gablehauser he'd give your job back.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.897
I don't want my job back.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.985
I've spent three and a half years
staring at grease boards full of equations.

03:55.152 --> 03:57.571
Before that,
I spent four years working on my thesis.

03:57.738 --> 04:01.908
Before that, I was in college,
and before that I was in the fifth grade.

04:02.492 --> 04:06.496
This is my first day off in decades
and I'm going to savor it.

04:06.663 --> 04:10.542
Okay. I'll let you get back
to fixing your eggs.

04:10.709 --> 04:13.920
I'm not just fixing my eggs,
I'm fixing everyone's eggs.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.965
And we all thank you.

04:18.633 --> 04:19.926
[Door closes]

04:37.277 --> 04:38.361
[Sighs]

04:47.537 --> 04:50.665
Use new eggs.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.375
[Knock on door]

04:53.376 --> 04:56.213
Hi, I'm running out to the market.
Do you guys need anything?

04:56.588 --> 04:59.090
Oh. This would be
one of those circumstances...

04:59.257 --> 05:02.803
People unfamiliar with the law
of large numbers would call a coincidence.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.721
- I'm sorry?
- I need eggs.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.932
- Four dozen should suffice.
- Fourdozen?

05:07.098 --> 05:12.521
Evenly distributed amongst brown, white,
free-range, large, extra-large and jumbo.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.482
- Okay, one more time?
- Never mind, you won't get it right.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.860
I'd better come with you.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.404
Oh, yay.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.202
How come
you didn't go in to work today?

05:27.369 --> 05:31.706
I'm taking a sabbatical because
I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.917
So you got canned, huh?

05:34.084 --> 05:37.170
Theoretical physicists do not get canned.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.089
But, yeah.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.258
Maybe it's for the best.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.511
You know, I always say, "when one door
closes, another one opens."

05:45.053 --> 05:46.721
No, it doesn't.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.349
Not unless the doors
are connected by relays.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.935
- Or there are motion sensors involved.
- No, I meant...

05:52.102 --> 05:56.523
Or if the first door closing creates a change
of air pressure that acts upon the second.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.733
Never mind.

05:59.985 --> 06:03.071
Slow down. Slow down.
Please, slow down.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.281
We're fine.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.491
You're not leaving
enough space between cars.

06:06.658 --> 06:07.701
Oh, sure I am.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.536
No, no, let me do the math for you.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.122
This car weighs, let's say, 4000 pounds.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.207
Now, add 140 for me, 120 for you...

06:14.374 --> 06:17.419
- One-twenty?
- Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you?

06:17.586 --> 06:20.422
Is your body mass
somehow tied into your self-worth?

06:21.006 --> 06:22.757
Well, yeah.

06:22.924 --> 06:23.967
Interesting.

06:24.134 --> 06:27.512
Anyway, that gives us a total weight of,
let's say, 4400 pounds.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.806
Let's say 4390.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.349
Fine.

06:31.516 --> 06:34.936
We're traveling fonnard at...
Good lord... 51 miles an hour.

06:35.312 --> 06:38.481
Let's assume that your brakes are new
and the calipers are aligned.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.317
By the time we come to a stop...

06:40.483 --> 06:43.069
We'll be occupying the same space
as that buick.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.990
An impossibility that nature will quickly
resolve into death, mutilation and...

06:47.157 --> 06:50.911
Oh, look,
they built a new putt-putt course.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.706
Sheldon: This is great.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.709
Look at me.
I'm in the real world of ordinary people...

06:57.876 --> 07:01.630
Just living their ordinary,
colorless, work-a-day lives.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.008
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.511
And thank you, ordinary person.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.140
Hey, you wanna hear an interesting thing
about tomatoes?

07:12.307 --> 07:13.475
No. No, not really.

07:13.642 --> 07:16.519
Listen, didn't you say
you needed some eggs?

07:16.686 --> 07:20.023
Yes, but anyone who knows anything
about bacterial growth...

07:20.190 --> 07:23.151
Knows to pick up their
refrigerated foods on the way out.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.112
Oh, okay, maybe you should start
heading on out, then.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.366
No, this is fun.

07:29.532 --> 07:32.369
The thing about tomatoes,
and I think you'll enjoy this...

07:32.535 --> 07:35.789
Is they're shelved with the vegetables,
but they're technically a fruit.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.207
- Hmm. Interesting.
- Isn't it?

07:37.374 --> 07:40.043
No, I mean what you find enjoyable.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.507
Oh, boy.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.052
What now?

07:49.219 --> 07:51.763
Well, there's some value
to taking a multivitamin...

07:51.930 --> 07:54.140
But the human body
can only absorb so much.

07:54.307 --> 07:59.187
What you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.816
Well, maybe that's what I was going for.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.818
Well, then you'll want some manganese.

08:11.408 --> 08:12.993
Well, that was fun.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.620
Tomorrow we can go
to one of those warehouse stores.

08:15.787 --> 08:16.871
I don't know, Sheldon.

08:17.038 --> 08:21.376
It's gonna take me a while to recover
from all the fun I had today.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.213
Are you sure? There are a lot
of advantages to buying in bulk.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.799
For example, I noticed
you purchase your tampons...

08:27.966 --> 08:29.426
One month's supply at a time.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.972
- What?
- Well, think about it.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.557
It doesn't spoil...

08:35.724 --> 08:39.269
And you're going to be needing them
for at least the next 30 years.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.856
You want me to buy
30 years' worth of tampons?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.107
Well, 30, 35...

08:44.274 --> 08:47.068
- When did your mother go into menopause?
- Okay.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.571
I'm not talking about this with you.

08:49.738 --> 08:50.822
Oh, penny.

08:50.989 --> 08:54.909
This is a natural human process and
we're talking about significant savings.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.788
Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle
in a 28-day cycle...

08:58.955 --> 09:00.749
Are you fairly regular?

09:05.628 --> 09:09.382
Okay, no warehouse store, but
we're still on for putt-putt golf, right?

09:13.845 --> 09:14.971
[Door opens]

09:15.263 --> 09:18.058
Hey, I just ran into penny.
She seemed upset about something.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.727
I think it's her time of the month.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.565
I marked the calendar
for future reference.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.945
What's with the fish?

09:31.112 --> 09:33.615
It's an experiment.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.410
- What happened to your egg research?
- Oh, that was a dead end.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.663
Scrambled eggs are as good
as they're ever going to be.

09:44.751 --> 09:48.630
I read an article about scientists
who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish...

09:48.797 --> 09:54.302
Into other animals, and I thought,
"hey, fish nightlights."

09:56.346 --> 09:58.014
Fish nightlights.

09:58.181 --> 10:01.267
It's a billion-dollar idea. Shhh!

10:02.102 --> 10:03.144
Mum's the word.

10:04.854 --> 10:09.067
Are you sure you don't wanna just apologize
to gablehauser and get your job back?

10:09.234 --> 10:11.861
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I have too much to do.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.155
Like luminous fish.

10:14.322 --> 10:17.200
- Shhh!
- I'm sorry, I didn't...

10:18.576 --> 10:19.786
That's just the beginning.

10:20.203 --> 10:24.207
I also have an idea for a bulk,
mail-order feminine hygiene company.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.793
Oh, glow-in-the-dark tampons.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.881
Leonard, we're gonna be rich.

10:35.593 --> 10:39.097
- Thanks for coming on such short notice.
- You did the right thing calling.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.474
I didn't know what to do.
He's lost all focus.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.477
Every day, he's got a new obsession.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.236
This is a particularly disturbing one.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.365
Mommy?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.910
Hi, baby.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.580
[Mouthing] You called my mother?

11:10.670 --> 11:14.090
Oh, you got yourself a loom. How nice.

11:14.591 --> 11:18.094
- Thank you.
- Honey, why did you get a loom?

11:18.928 --> 11:23.683
I was working with luminous fish
and I thought, "hey...

11:24.184 --> 11:26.269
Loom."

11:27.770 --> 11:29.939
Mom, what are you doing here?

11:30.106 --> 11:31.524
Leonard called me.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.818
I know, but why?

11:33.985 --> 11:36.446
Because one of the great minds
of the 21st century...

11:36.613 --> 11:39.824
Is raising glow-in-the-dark fish
and weaving serapes.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.785
This is not a serape. This is a poncho.

11:42.952 --> 11:46.122
A serape is open at the sides,
a poncho is closed. This is a poncho.

11:46.289 --> 11:50.418
And neither is a reason
to call someone's mother.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.254
Really?
When was the last time you left the house?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.506
I went to the market with penny.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.425
Yeah, that was three weeks ago.

11:57.592 --> 11:58.635
Well, then, buckle up.

11:58.801 --> 12:02.889
In the next four to eight days,
she's going to get very crabby.

12:04.641 --> 12:07.268
Sweetheart,
your little friend is concerned about you.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.728
Yes, well, I'm not a child.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.981
I'm a grown man
capable of living my life as I see fit.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.318
And I certainly don't need someone
telling on me to my mother.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.029
Wait, where are you going?

12:18.196 --> 12:21.241
To my room and no one's allowed in.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.700
[Door slams]

12:22.867 --> 12:25.328
- He gets his temper from his daddy.
- Ah.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.872
- He's got my eyes.
- I see.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.584
All that science stuff,
that comes from Jesus.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.422
Sheldon, your mom made dinner.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.632
Sheldon: I'm not hungry.

12:37.799 --> 12:40.718
Oh. Leonard, don't trouble yourself.
He's stubborn.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.971
He may stay in there till the rapture.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.808
Are we so sure that's a bad thing?

12:46.975 --> 12:48.434
I love the boy to death...

12:48.601 --> 12:52.689
But he has been difficult
since he fell out of me at the kmart.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.067
Excuse me for being so bold...

12:56.234 --> 13:00.071
But I now see where Sheldon gets
his smoldering good looks.

13:00.238 --> 13:04.284
Oh. Honey, that ain't gonna work,
but you keep trying.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.869
I made chicken.

13:07.453 --> 13:12.041
I hope that isn't one of the animals
that you people think is magic.

13:17.422 --> 13:20.049
You know, we have an Indian gentleman
at our church.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.468
A Dr. Patel. It's a beautiful story.

13:22.635 --> 13:27.015
The lord spoke to him and moved him
to give us all 20 percent off on lasek.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.100
You know, those that needed it.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.561
That is a lovely story.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.479
Are we gonna do anything
about Sheldon?

13:33.646 --> 13:36.190
Oh, we will.
You have to take your time with Sheldon.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.526
His father, god rest his soul, used to say:

13:38.693 --> 13:41.904
"Mary, you have to take your time
with Sheldon."

13:42.739 --> 13:45.575
- Sounds like a wise man.
- Oh, not so wise.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.828
He once tried to fight a bobcat
for some licorice.

13:49.704 --> 13:55.251
So everybody grab a plate
and a pretty placemat that Shelly wove.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.754
Has Shelly ever freaked out
like this before?

13:57.920 --> 13:58.963
Oh, all the time.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.341
I remember one summer
when he was 13...

14:01.507 --> 14:04.635
He built a small nuclear reactor
in the shed...

14:04.802 --> 14:07.930
And told everybody he was gonna provide
electricity for the town.

14:08.097 --> 14:12.518
Well, the only problem was, he had no,
what you call, fissionable materials.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.189
Anyway, when he went on the Internet
to get some...

14:16.356 --> 14:20.818
A man from the government came by
and sat him down real gentle...

14:20.985 --> 14:24.781
And told him it's against the law
to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.326
- Well, what happened?
- Well, poor boy had a fit.

14:28.493 --> 14:31.662
Locked himself in his room
and built a Sonic death ray.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.957
- A death ray?
- Well, that's what he called it.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.293
Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.
Heh.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.797
It pissed our dog off to no end.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.134
You know, you two make a cute couple.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.469
[Both laugh]

14:46.636 --> 14:49.430
I... no, no.
No, we're not a couple. We're singles.

14:49.597 --> 14:54.644
Two singles. Like those individually
wrapped slices of cheese that...

14:58.564 --> 15:00.316
- Did I pluck a nerve there?
- Oh, yeah.

15:00.483 --> 15:03.111
Okay.
All right, everybody, it's time to eat.

15:04.529 --> 15:09.325
Oh, lord, we thank you for this meal
and for all your bounty.

15:09.492 --> 15:13.996
And we pray that you help Sheldon
get back on his rocker.

15:14.163 --> 15:18.418
Now, after a moment of silent meditation,
I'm gonna end with "in Jesus' name"...

15:18.584 --> 15:21.337
But you two
don't feel any obligation to join in.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.426
Unless, of course,
the holy spirit moves you.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.020
Oh, my god,
this is the best cobbler I've ever had.

15:38.187 --> 15:41.858
It was always Sheldon's favorite.
You know what the secret ingredient is?

15:48.823 --> 15:52.201
- Hey, look who's com...
- Shh. You'll spook him.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.873
He's like a baby deer.
You gotta let him come to you.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.591
This is ridiculous.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.384
Damn it, Sheldon, snap out of it.

16:08.926 --> 16:12.722
You're a physicist. You belong at the
university doing research, not in your room.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.519
[Door slams]

16:20.313 --> 16:21.814
You don't hunt, do you?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.653
[Knock on door]

16:28.321 --> 16:31.532
Good morning, snickerdoodle.

16:31.699 --> 16:32.909
- Morning.
- Oh.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.620
Well, that looks awful fancy.
What is that?

16:37.079 --> 16:42.335
It's my idea of what DNA would look like
in a silicon-based life form.

16:42.877 --> 16:47.173
But intelligently designed
by a creator, right?

16:49.133 --> 16:50.259
What do you want, mom?

16:50.676 --> 16:54.639
You know how your daddy used to say
that you can only fish for so long...

16:54.805 --> 16:57.683
Before you gotta throw
a stick of dynamite in the water?

16:57.850 --> 17:00.978
- Yeah?
- Well, I'm done fishing.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.607
- You put those on.
- What for?

17:04.774 --> 17:06.651
Because you're gonna go
to your office...

17:06.817 --> 17:09.362
Apologize to your boss
and get your job back.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.947
- No.
- I'm sorry.

17:11.113 --> 17:15.243
Did I start that sentence with the words
"if it please your highness"?

17:16.953 --> 17:19.664
I'm not going to.
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.207
Now, you listen here.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.876
I have been telling you since you were 4.

17:24.043 --> 17:28.005
It's okay to be smarter than everybody,
but you can't go around pointing it out.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.967
- Why not?
- Because people don't like it.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.096
Remember all the ass-kickings
from the neighbor kids?

17:38.140 --> 17:39.850
Now, let's get cracking.

17:40.017 --> 17:43.980
Shower, shirt, shoes and let's shove off.

17:45.481 --> 17:50.152
Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings
if that stupid death ray had worked.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.158
Problem solved.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.869
Really? That's impressive.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.831
Leonard, the lord never gives us
more than we can handle.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.417
Thankfully, he blessed me
with two other children...

18:04.584 --> 18:06.002
Who are dumb as soup.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.884
Excuse me, Dr. Gablehauser,
are you busy?

18:14.051 --> 18:18.055
- Well, actually...
- Sheldon, he's just doodling. Get in here.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.185
- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Dr. Cooper.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.023
Let's go, baby, we're losing daylight.

18:31.360 --> 18:35.531
As you know, several weeks ago
in our first encounter...

18:35.698 --> 18:37.908
We may have gotten off
on the wrong foot...

18:38.075 --> 18:39.619
When I called you an idiot.

18:40.578 --> 18:43.456
And I just wanted to say
that I was wrong...

18:43.623 --> 18:46.417
To point it out.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.962
I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.549
- Dr. Eric gablehauser.
- Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mom.

18:53.716 --> 18:57.011
Now, that's impossible. You must've
had him when you were a teenager.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.513
Oh, aren't you sweet. His father's dead.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.268
- Recently?
- Long enough.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.021
Please.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.398
Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?

19:13.986 --> 19:15.946
Okay.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.619
Hey, how did it go?

19:22.328 --> 19:23.579
I got my job back.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.915
Really? What happened?

19:26.082 --> 19:28.584
I'm not quite sure.

19:28.751 --> 19:33.339
It involves a part of the human experience
that has always eluded me.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.133
Well, that narrows it down.

19:39.887 --> 19:43.766
I'm very proud of you, honey.
You showed a lot of courage today.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.227
Thanks, mom.

19:51.941 --> 19:56.070
Is Dr. Gablehauser
going to be my new daddy?

19:58.197 --> 20:02.118
We'll see. Sleep tight.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.448
[English - us - sdh]
