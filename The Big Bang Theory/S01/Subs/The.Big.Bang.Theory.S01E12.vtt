00:06.882 --> 00:09.968
Here's the problem with teleportation.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.640
Lay it on me.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.600
Assuming a device could be invented...

00:16.767 --> 00:20.437
Which would identify the state of matter
of an individual in one location...

00:20.604 --> 00:23.440
And transmit that to a distant location
for reassembly...

00:23.607 --> 00:25.859
You wouldn't have
transported the individual...

00:26.026 --> 00:31.156
You would have destroyed him in one
location and re-created him in another.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.368
How about that.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.787
I would never use a transporter.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.623
The original Sheldon
would have to be disintegrated...

00:39.790 --> 00:42.543
In order to create a new Sheldon.

00:43.001 --> 00:47.089
Would the new Sheldon be in any way
an improvement on the old Sheldon?

00:48.006 --> 00:50.300
No, he would be exactly the same.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.344
That is a problem.

00:52.511 --> 00:53.762
So you see it too?

00:54.721 --> 00:56.848
Dr. Hofstadter, Dr. Cooper.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.225
Both: Dr. Gablehauser.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.769
Gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim.

01:00.936 --> 01:03.772
Dennis is a highly sought-after
doctoral candidate.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.066
We're hoping to have him
do graduate work here.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.486
- Graduate work, very impressive.
- And he's only 15 years old.

01:09.653 --> 01:13.532
Not bad.
I myself started graduate school at 14.

01:13.699 --> 01:17.202
Well, I lost a year while my family
was tunneling out of North Korea.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.374
Advantage, Kim.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.002
I thought maybe you
could show Dennis around.

01:25.168 --> 01:28.505
Let him see why we're the best
physics research facility in the country.

01:28.672 --> 01:29.715
I know you're not.

01:29.881 --> 01:33.218
You don't have an open science grid
computer or a free electron laser.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.971
The string theory research
being done is a dead end.

01:36.138 --> 01:39.850
Excuse me, that is my research,
and it is by no means a dead end.

01:40.017 --> 01:43.061
Well, obviously, you don't see it yet,
but trust me, you will.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.441
Dennis, we've discussed this.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.985
We're in the process
of updating our equipment.

01:50.152 --> 01:52.321
We welcome your input
on our research goals.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.032
We agree to look the other way
if you use 20 percent...

01:55.198 --> 01:58.577
Of the money you attract to smuggle
your grandfather out of Pyongyang.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.372
We want him here, boys.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.041
- Make it happen.
- Yes, sir.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.043
You can count on us. We're on it.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.503
What the hell do you mean, "dead end"?

02:08.920 --> 02:11.882
I mean, the whole landscape
of false vacuums in string theory...

02:12.049 --> 02:14.384
Could be as large
as 10 to the 500th power.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.552
In addition...

02:15.719 --> 02:17.095
Ooh, look, chocolate milk.

02:20.098 --> 02:23.018
I sense a disturbance in the force.

02:23.185 --> 02:26.480
[Imitating Yoda]
A bad feeling I have about this. Mm.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.590
So how long have you been in america?

02:53.757 --> 02:55.217
- A year and a half.
- No kidding.

02:55.384 --> 02:58.595
- You speak English really well.
- So do you.

02:59.012 --> 03:03.433
Except for your tendency
to end sentences with prepositions.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.977
What are you talking about?

03:09.398 --> 03:10.691
He's not wrong.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.985
All right, and this is my office.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.571
- Is this part of the tour?
- Nope. Goodbye.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.700
Sheldon,
we've hardly shown him anything.

03:19.866 --> 03:23.495
All right, this is my desk.
These are my books.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.456
This is my door.
Please close it behind you, goodbye.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.961
You're doing work
in quantum loop corrections.

03:31.128 --> 03:35.632
- Keen observation, goodbye.
- You see where you went wrong, don't you?

03:36.675 --> 03:37.968
- Leonard.
- Ha.

03:38.135 --> 03:40.971
- Yeah?
- Get him out.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.850
Come, I'll show you the rec center.
They've got nautilus equipment.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.810
Do I look like I lift weights?

03:48.019 --> 03:50.397
Not heavy ones.

03:50.564 --> 03:54.443
It's startling you haven't considered a
lorentz invariant or field theory approach.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.987
You think I haven't considered it?

03:57.154 --> 04:00.407
- You really think I haven't considered it?
- Have you considered it?

04:02.117 --> 04:04.202
- Get him out, Leonard.
- Come on, Dennis.

04:04.369 --> 04:07.164
I'll show you the radiation lab.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.624
Wow. You won the Stevenson award?

04:10.000 --> 04:13.879
Yes. In fact,
I am the youngest person ever to win it.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.381
Really? How old?

04:16.548 --> 04:17.883
Fourteen and a half.

04:18.049 --> 04:20.177
Mm. You were the youngest
ever to win it.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.475
It's like looking
into an obnoxious mirror, isn't it?

04:30.771 --> 04:34.441
Mm. This is really delicious, isn't it?

04:37.527 --> 04:40.822
Still can't talk to me
unless you're drunk, huh?

04:41.782 --> 04:45.952
Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.

04:46.912 --> 04:49.581
Hey, I'm damaged too.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.125
How about a hug for Howie?

04:52.292 --> 04:55.504
Sure. Raj, hug Howard.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.465
[Sheldon sighs]

04:59.716 --> 05:01.218
Something you'd like to share?

05:02.260 --> 05:04.638
A tale of woe perhaps?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.473
Fifteen years old.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.477
Dennis Kim is 15 years old
and he's already correcting my work.

05:10.644 --> 05:14.523
Today, I went from being
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to...

05:14.689 --> 05:16.107
You know, that other guy.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.400
Antonio salieri?

05:18.235 --> 05:20.904
Oh, god,
now even you're smarter than me.

05:22.113 --> 05:26.493
You know, you don't have so many friends
that you can afford to start insulting them.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.496
Just eat, Sheldon. You'll feel better.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.914
Why waste food?

05:31.081 --> 05:33.458
When a cow goes dry,
they don't keep feeding it...

05:33.625 --> 05:36.962
They just take her out
and shoot her between the eyes.

05:37.379 --> 05:41.174
I'm confused.
Did Sheldon stop giving milk?

05:41.925 --> 05:43.635
You can't let this kid get to you.

05:43.802 --> 05:47.264
You knew that someday, someone would
come along who's younger and smarter.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.100
Yes, but I assumed
I would've been dead hundreds of years.

05:50.267 --> 05:53.812
And that there'd be an asterisk by his name
because he'd be a cyborg.

05:55.105 --> 05:58.483
So you got a little competition.
I really don't see what the big deal is.

05:58.650 --> 06:02.779
Of course you don't.
You've never excelled at anything.

06:03.780 --> 06:07.492
I don't understand, exactly how did
he get any friends in the first place?

06:12.330 --> 06:14.124
What are you gonna do, just give up?

06:14.624 --> 06:19.379
Yes, it's what a rational person does when
his entire life's work is invalidated...

06:19.546 --> 06:22.340
By a postpubescent Asian wunderkind.

06:22.966 --> 06:27.470
He ceases his fruitless efforts, he
donates his body to scientific research...

06:27.637 --> 06:30.181
And he waits to die.

06:31.349 --> 06:36.229
I'm confused again. Is he waiting, or do
we get to shoot him between the eyes?

06:38.857 --> 06:40.650
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.193
I've decided you're right.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.529
- My career is not over.
- Great.

06:44.696 --> 06:47.741
But since Dennis Kim
has rendered my research pointless...

06:47.908 --> 06:50.368
I just have to find
something else to focus on.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.497
So I've decided
I'm going to collaborate with you.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.212
So, what exactly is it you do?

07:02.255 --> 07:06.301
I know you chatter on about it all the
time, but I've never really paid attention.

07:07.010 --> 07:10.221
Right now, I'm designing an experiment
to study the soft component...

07:10.388 --> 07:13.141
Of cosmic radiation at sea level,
but I don't need help.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.352
Oh, sure you do.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.480
Now see, what's this here in the schematic,
a laser array?

07:18.647 --> 07:20.357
- Yes.
- Now, hmm...

07:23.693 --> 07:26.738
What happens if you use argon lasers
instead of helium-neon?

07:27.155 --> 07:29.240
- It would blow up.
- Are you sure?

07:29.741 --> 07:32.243
- Pretty sure.
- "Pretty sure" is not very scientific.

07:32.410 --> 07:36.206
Is this how you normally work?
Just hunches and guesses and stuff?

07:37.082 --> 07:38.208
Okay.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.419
I understand that you're going
through a bit of a career crisis.

07:41.586 --> 07:45.423
You're searching for some other area
where you can feel valuable and productive.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.134
But I need to tell you something,
and listen carefully.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.596
- All right.
- Go away.

07:53.932 --> 07:58.728
If you're concerned about sharing credit
with me, your name can go first... I'm going.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.943
It's a small brown paper bag, ma.

08:05.110 --> 08:08.071
I'm looking at it right now.

08:08.321 --> 08:12.909
Why would I make that up?
There's no ding dong in it.

08:14.786 --> 08:18.957
How are two ding dongs tomorrow
gonna help me today?

08:20.417 --> 08:23.503
So this is engineering, huh?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.797
I'll talk to you later.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.717
Engineering,
where the noble semiskilled laborers...

08:28.883 --> 08:31.761
Execute the vision
of those who think and dream.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.015
Hello, oompa loompas of science.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.394
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

08:39.811 --> 08:41.813
I just came by to say hello.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.649
For three years,
you've never come by to say hello.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.318
Well, up until now,
I've had better things to do.

08:48.403 --> 08:50.405
So, what are we making today?

08:50.572 --> 08:54.784
A small payload support structure for
a European science experimental package...

08:54.951 --> 08:58.496
- That's going up on the next space shuttle.
- Really? How does it work?

08:58.663 --> 09:00.790
It will be attached to the payload bay...

09:00.957 --> 09:04.544
And the sensor
apparatus will rest on it.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.132
So it's a shelf.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.303
No, you don't understand.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.765
During acceleration, it needs
to stay perfectly level and provide...

09:16.931 --> 09:18.349
Yeah, okay, it's a shelf.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.643
I notice you're using titanium.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.146
Did you give any consideration
to carbon nanotubes?

09:23.313 --> 09:26.274
They're lighter, cheaper
and have twice the tensile strength.

09:26.441 --> 09:32.030
Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office
that says I have a master's in engineering.

09:32.197 --> 09:36.034
And you also have a note from your mother
that says, "I love you, bubula."

09:37.869 --> 09:41.706
But neither of those is a cogent argument
for titanium over nanotubes.

09:42.457 --> 09:43.708
- Sheldon.
- Yes?

09:43.875 --> 09:46.044
Go away.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.213
Did Leonard tell you to say that?

09:48.797 --> 09:50.548
No, I thought of it all by myself.

09:52.175 --> 09:55.595
Huh? Can't be a coincidence.

09:55.762 --> 09:59.224
There must be some causal link
I'm missing.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.604
Go away.

10:11.778 --> 10:15.073
Sheldon:
Curiouser and curiouser.

10:18.868 --> 10:22.580
- Is he here?
- If he were, I wouldn't be.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.041
You know what he did?
He watched me work...

10:25.208 --> 10:29.712
And then started to design a simple
piece of software that could replace me.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.132
Is that even possible?

10:32.298 --> 10:34.175
As it turns out, yes.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.471
- Something's gotta be done about him.
- Like what?

10:38.638 --> 10:41.891
He'll never cope with the fact
that some 15-year-old is smarter...

10:42.058 --> 10:43.768
And more accomplished than he is.

10:44.519 --> 10:48.565
What if something were to happen to him
so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?

10:50.066 --> 10:52.569
Then our problem would be solved.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.947
Hang on, are we talking about
murdering Dennis Kim?

10:57.240 --> 10:59.117
I'm not saying no.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.453
We don't have to go that far.
There are other means.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.456
We can't send him back to North Korea.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.875
He knows how to get out.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.714
The only thing we need to do
is make this Kim kid lose his focus.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.758
It won't happen. He is not interested
in anything but physics.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.635
- What about biology?
- What?

11:17.802 --> 11:20.805
You know, biology.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.892
The one thing that can completely derail
a world-class mind.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.102
- Howard, he's 15.
- Yeah, so?

11:26.269 --> 11:28.062
When I was 15, I met Denise palmeri...

11:28.229 --> 11:32.317
And my grade point average
fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.776
She was sleeping with you?

11:34.235 --> 11:38.865
No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking
about what it would be like if she did.

11:40.158 --> 11:41.618
Oh, good, you're all here.

11:41.784 --> 11:46.080
I've decided that if the three of you drop
whatever you're working on and join me...

11:46.247 --> 11:50.793
We could lick cold fusion
in less than a decade, 12 years tops.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.005
Go away?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.260
Could it be me?

12:03.473 --> 12:04.515
Hey, guys, what's up?

12:04.682 --> 12:08.144
We need a hot 15-year-old Asian girl
with a thing for smart guys.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.688
- What?
- Howard, that's racist.

12:10.855 --> 12:14.525
Any 15-year-old girl will do the trick.

12:19.822 --> 12:23.326
It's possible
she may have misunderstood us.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.665
[Knocking on door]

12:28.998 --> 12:32.168
- Dr. Cooper. Oh, are we interrupting?
- No, no, please come in.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.837
I think you'll appreciate this.
This is very exciting.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.173
- What are you working on?
- Something remarkable.

12:37.340 --> 12:41.678
Since my prospects for the nobel prize
in physics have disappeared... thank you.

12:41.844 --> 12:45.265
I've decided to refocus my efforts
and use my people skills...

12:45.431 --> 12:46.933
To win the nobel peace prize.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.560
Look, I'm going
to solve the middle east crisis...

12:49.727 --> 12:54.565
By building an exact replica of Jerusalem
in the middle of the Mexican desert.

12:56.401 --> 13:00.822
You know, it's like the baseball movie.
"Build it and they will come."

13:01.572 --> 13:02.615
Who will come?

13:02.782 --> 13:04.659
The Jewish people.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.077
What if they don't come?

13:06.244 --> 13:08.079
We'll make it nice, put out a spread.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.457
Okay, well, speaking of spreads...

13:11.624 --> 13:14.544
We're having a welcoming party
this afternoon for Mr. Kim...

13:14.711 --> 13:18.589
- Who's agreed to join us at the university.
- Of course he has.

13:18.756 --> 13:22.802
The oracle told us little Neo was the one.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.638
You can see the matrix, can't you?

13:25.805 --> 13:30.560
Okay, well, obviously, you're very busy
with your, ah, um...

13:30.727 --> 13:31.769
Come, Dennis.

13:33.730 --> 13:37.525
You'll have to excuse Dr. Cooper.
He's been under a lot of, um...

13:37.692 --> 13:39.861
He's nuts.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.072
[Sheldon humming "cielito lindo"]

13:43.239 --> 13:45.450
[Singing in Hebrew]

13:45.867 --> 13:49.579
They'll come, they'll settle
and I'll win the prize

13:51.289 --> 13:54.000
I don't understand your objections,
professor goldfarb.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.795
Why wouldn't the sonora desert
make a perfectly good promised land?

13:58.588 --> 14:00.089
Go away.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.052
We could call it nuevo Jerusalem.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.387
Please go away.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.640
Said pharaoh to Moses.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.894
Why are all these young women here?

14:13.061 --> 14:14.896
It's take your daughter to work day.

14:15.438 --> 14:16.981
Really? I was not aware of that.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.442
Oh, yes.
There was a very official e-mail...

14:19.609 --> 14:22.236
That was sent to everyone
whose files indicated...

14:22.403 --> 14:25.239
They had daughters
between the ages of 14 and 16.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.826
- Smooth.
- Thank you.

14:30.161 --> 14:33.122
There's the man of the hour.

14:33.706 --> 14:38.127
So we have a socially awkward genius in
a room of attractive age-appropriate women.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.046
All he has to do is hook up with one.

14:49.013 --> 14:52.350
Anyone else see the flaw in this plan?

14:52.850 --> 14:54.268
We need a social catalyst.

14:54.435 --> 14:58.314
Like what?
We can't get 15-year-old girls drunk.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.441
- Or can we?
- No, we can't.

15:01.484 --> 15:04.487
I don't think you mean we can't.
I think you mean we shouldn't.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.323
Hey, Howard, you're a Jew.

15:07.490 --> 15:10.701
If there was another wailing wall
exactly like the one in Jerusalem...

15:10.868 --> 15:13.579
But close to taco stands
and cheap prescription drugs...

15:13.746 --> 15:15.415
Would you still wail at it?

15:17.542 --> 15:19.836
Okay, it's definitely me.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.507
We cannot leave this to chance.
Let's pick a girl...

15:24.674 --> 15:26.884
And figure out
how to get her with Dennis.

15:27.844 --> 15:28.886
How about that one?

15:30.263 --> 15:33.808
Uh-uh. I know the type. Cheerleader,
student council, goes out with jocks.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.144
Won't look at anybody
in the gifted program.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.021
If she does agree to go out,
it turns out to be a setup.

15:39.188 --> 15:43.067
You're in your mom's car with your pants
off while the whole football team laughs.

15:46.612 --> 15:50.074
- Are you crying?
- No, I have allergies.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.410
Okay. Uh...

15:52.577 --> 15:54.620
Oh, hey, how about her?

15:55.329 --> 15:58.040
Sure, if he wants to spend years
doing her homework...

15:58.207 --> 16:01.419
While she drinks herself into a stupor
with nonfat white Russians.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.005
And you're holding her head
while she's puking...

16:04.172 --> 16:06.382
And wishes more guys were like you.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.885
She gets into Cornell,
because you wrote her essay.

16:09.051 --> 16:13.264
And you drive up to visit her one weekend
and she acts like she doesn't know you.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.602
Okay, so not her either.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.646
How about her?

16:20.813 --> 16:24.692
Interesting, kind of pretty, a little
chubby, so probably low self-esteem.

16:24.859 --> 16:25.943
I think that's our girl.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.737
One of us should go talk to her.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.697
I can't talk to her, you do it.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.824
I can't just go up and talk to her.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.159
Howard, you talk to her.

16:34.035 --> 16:37.705
I don't know, she'll never go for the kid
once she gets a peek at this.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.459
In India, this would be simpler.

16:41.626 --> 16:44.837
Five minutes with her dad, 20 goats
and a laptop, and we'd be done.

16:45.463 --> 16:46.714
Well, we're not in India.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.633
Why don't we do it your way, then?

16:48.799 --> 16:54.180
We'll arrange for her to move in across the
hall so he can pathetically moon over her.

16:56.057 --> 16:58.434
- Okay, that was uncalled for.
- You started it, dude.

16:58.601 --> 16:59.810
[Glass clinking]

16:59.977 --> 17:02.146
Could I have everyone's attention,
please?

17:02.897 --> 17:06.192
What a wonderful occasion this is.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.737
And how fortunate that it should
fall on take your daughter to work day.

17:11.155 --> 17:15.243
We're here to welcome Mr. Dennis Kim
to our little family.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.662
Welcome, Dennis Kim.

17:18.621 --> 17:22.458
Mr. Kim was not only the valedictorian
at Stanford university...

17:22.625 --> 17:27.964
He is also the youngest recipient
of the prestigious Stevenson award.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.508
Youngest till the cyborgs rise up.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.302
And now, without any further ado...

17:33.469 --> 17:39.100
Let me introduce the man of the hour,
Mr. Dennis Kim.

17:40.184 --> 17:43.145
Dennis? Dennis.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.481
What?

17:46.232 --> 17:48.943
Would you like to tell us
about your upcoming research?

17:49.110 --> 17:52.321
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm going to the mall with Emma.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.954
The kid got a girl.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.081
Unbelievable.

18:02.248 --> 18:05.751
Did anyone see how he did it?

18:06.502 --> 18:07.920
Don't worry, I've got this.

18:08.087 --> 18:12.049
Ladies and gentlemen,
honored daughters...

18:12.216 --> 18:15.386
While Mr. Kim,
by virtue of his youth and naiveté...

18:15.553 --> 18:18.848
Has fallen prey to the inexplicable need
for human contact...

18:19.015 --> 18:22.852
Let me step in and assure you
that my research will go on uninterrupted.

18:23.019 --> 18:28.149
And that social relationships
will continue to baffle and repulse me.

18:28.774 --> 18:29.900
Thank you.

18:30.693 --> 18:31.902
[Clapping]

18:32.778 --> 18:34.905
- He's back.
- Yeah, mission accomplished.

18:35.072 --> 18:38.326
Forget the mission. How did that
little yutz get a girl on his own?

18:39.035 --> 18:41.245
I guess times have changed
since we were young.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.539
Smart is the new sexy.

18:44.332 --> 18:47.293
Then why do we go home alone
every night? We're still smart.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.378
Maybe we're too smart.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.339
So smart, it's off-putting.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.176
Yeah, let's go with that.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.139
Unbelievable.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.892
Components I built
are on the space station...

19:03.059 --> 19:05.811
And I get a ticket
for launching a rocket in the park.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.899
I don't know if the ticket was so much for
the launch as for telling the policewoman:

19:10.066 --> 19:13.361
"You have to frisk me.
I have another rocket in my pants."

19:13.903 --> 19:15.529
Hey, look at that.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.325
It's Dennis Kim.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.911
Wow, I almost didn't recognize him.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.080
I kind of feel bad
about what we did to him.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.420
Yeah, we really ruined his life.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.257
Screw him, he was weak.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.872
