00:02.127 --> 00:06.131
If a photon is directed through a plane with
two slits in it and either is observed...

00:06.298 --> 00:08.842
It will not go through both.
If unobserved, it will.

00:09.009 --> 00:12.262
If it's observed after it left the plane,
before it hits its target...

00:12.429 --> 00:15.265
- It will not have gone through both slits.
- Agreed.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.558
What's your point?

00:16.725 --> 00:19.686
There's no point, I just think
it's a good idea for a t-shirt.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.861
- Excuse me.
- Hang on.

00:31.198 --> 00:34.284
One across is aegean,
eight down is nabokov.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.954
Twenty-six across is mcm.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.163
Fourteen down is...

00:38.330 --> 00:40.165
Move your finger.

00:40.332 --> 00:43.168
Phylum, which makes 14 across
Port-au-Prince.

00:44.628 --> 00:48.632
See, papa doc's capital idea,
that's Port-au-Prince.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.178
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

00:55.514 --> 01:00.185
Um, is this the high-IQ sperm bank?

01:01.103 --> 01:04.022
If you have to ask,
maybe you shouldn't be here.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.192
I think this is the place.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.361
- Fill these out.
- Thank you.

01:09.528 --> 01:11.697
- We'll be right back.
- Oh, take your time.

01:11.863 --> 01:14.533
I'll just finish my crossword puzzle.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.369
Oh, wait.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.715
Leonard, I don't think I can do this.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.509
What, are you kidding? You're a semipro.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.470
No. We are committing genetic fraud.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.849
There's no guarantee our sperm's
going to generate high-IQ offspring.

01:40.183 --> 01:44.521
I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix
who hostesses at fuddruckers.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.815
Sheldon, this was your idea.

01:46.982 --> 01:50.193
A little extra money to get
fractional t1 bandwidth in the apartment?

01:50.360 --> 01:53.697
I know.
And I do yearn for faster downloads.

01:54.239 --> 01:57.200
There's some poor woman
who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.370
What if she winds up with a toddler
who doesn't know if he should use...

02:00.537 --> 02:04.041
A differential to solve for the area
under a curve?

02:04.625 --> 02:07.794
- I'm sure she'll still love him.
- I wouldn't.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.006
Well, what do you wanna do?

02:11.173 --> 02:13.592
- I want to leave.
- Okay.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.969
- What's the protocol for leaving?
- I don't know.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.264
I've never reneged
on a proffer of sperm before.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.642
Let's try just walking out.

02:22.517 --> 02:23.727
Okay.

02:33.820 --> 02:34.863
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.448
Nice meeting you.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.412
- Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
- No.

02:43.246 --> 02:46.375
You wanna hear an interesting thing
about stairs?

02:46.541 --> 02:47.918
Not really.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.088
If the height of a step is off
by as little as two millimeters...

02:51.254 --> 02:54.424
- Most people will trip.
- I don't care.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.094
Two millime...? That doesn't seem right.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.805
It's true. I did a series of
experiments when I was 12.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.723
My father broke his clavicle.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.768
Is that why they sent you
to boarding school?

03:04.935 --> 03:07.646
No. That was the result
of my work with lasers.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.584
[Lily Allen's "smile" playing
over speakers]

03:11.608 --> 03:13.610
I go ahead and smile

03:13.777 --> 03:14.861
new neighbor?

03:15.028 --> 03:16.279
Sheldon: Evidently.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.616
Significant improvement
over the old neighbor.

03:19.950 --> 03:23.578
Two-hundred pound transvestite
with a skin condition? Yes, she is.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.665
Oh, hi.

03:26.832 --> 03:27.874
-Hi.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.584
-Hi.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.212
Hi?

03:32.379 --> 03:35.048
We don't mean to interrupt.
We live across the hall.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.633
Oh, that's nice.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.137
No. We don't live together. I mean...

03:40.303 --> 03:45.475
We live together, but in separate,
heterosexual bedrooms.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.145
Okay, well, guess I'm your new neighbor.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.439
- Penny.
- Leonard. Sheldon.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.232
-Hi.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.112
Well...

03:57.487 --> 03:58.989
Oh, welcome to the building.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.491
Oh, thank you.
Maybe we can have coffee sometime.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.701
- Oh, great.
- Great.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.578
- Great.
- Great.

04:06.371 --> 04:07.748
Well, bye.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.875
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.254
Should we have invited her for lunch?

04:14.421 --> 04:17.466
No. We're gonna start season two
of Battlestar Galactica.

04:18.133 --> 04:20.260
We already watched
the season two DVDs.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.053
Not with commentary.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.849
I think we should be good neighbors.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.851
Invite her over, make her feel welcome.

04:28.477 --> 04:31.688
We never invited louie/louise over.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.149
Well, and that was wrong of us.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.650
We need to widen our circle.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.862
I have a very wide circle.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.115
I have 212 friends on MySpace.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.494
Yes, and you've never met one of them.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.454
That's the beauty of it.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.708
I'm gonna invite her over.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.586
We'll have a nice meal and chat.

04:54.753 --> 04:58.131
Chat? We don't chat,
at least not off-line.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.884
Well, it's not difficult.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.677
You just listen to what she says...

05:02.844 --> 05:06.473
And then you say something appropriate
in response.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.145
- Hi. Again.
- Hi.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.606
-Hi.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.316
Anyway...

05:16.483 --> 05:19.569
We brought home Indian food...

05:20.445 --> 05:22.531
And I know that
moving can be stressful...

05:22.697 --> 05:24.908
And I find
that when I'm undergoing stress...

05:25.075 --> 05:28.370
That good food
and company can have a comforting effect.

05:29.496 --> 05:33.375
Also, curry's a natural laxative and
I don't have to tell you that, you know...

05:33.542 --> 05:37.921
A clean colon is just one less thing
to worry about.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.925
I'm no expert,
but in the context of a lunch invitation...

05:42.092 --> 05:44.761
You might wanna skip the reference
to bowel movements.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.097
Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.434
Oh, that's so nice. I'd love to.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.105
So, what do you guys do for fun
around here?

05:55.730 --> 05:57.732
Well, today we tried masturbating
for money.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.637
- Okay, well, make yourself at home.
- Okay.

06:27.804 --> 06:31.266
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.102
[Mouths] You're very welcome.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.397
This looks like some serious stuff.
Leonard, did you do this?

06:37.564 --> 06:39.983
Actually, that's my work.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.112
Yeah, well, it's just some
quantum mechanics...

06:44.279 --> 06:48.116
With a little string theory doodling
around the edges. That part's just a joke.

06:48.283 --> 06:51.494
It's a spoof of the born-Oppenheimer
approximation.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.916
So you're, like, one of those
beautiful mind genius guys.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.754
This is really impressive.

07:00.921 --> 07:04.174
I have a board, if you like boards.
This is my board.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.301
Holy smokes.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.763
If by "holy smokes," you mean
a derivative restatement of the stuff...

07:09.930 --> 07:13.308
You can find scribbled on the wall
of any men's room at mit, sure.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.310
- What?
- Oh, come on.

07:15.477 --> 07:19.105
Who hasn't seen this differential below
"here I sit brokenhearted"?

07:19.272 --> 07:23.318
At least I didn't have to invent 26
dimensions just to make the math come out.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.237
- I didn't invent them. They're there.
- In what universe?

07:26.404 --> 07:28.198
In all of them, that is the point.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.034
Do you guys mind if I start?

07:31.201 --> 07:32.869
- Penny.
- Yeah?

07:33.036 --> 07:35.163
That's where I sit.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.832
So sit next to me.

07:39.250 --> 07:43.296
- No, I sit there.
- What's the difference?

07:43.463 --> 07:46.049
- What's the difference?
- Here we go.

07:46.216 --> 07:49.427
In winter, that seat is close enough
to the radiator to remain warm...

07:49.594 --> 07:51.805
Yet not so close
as to cause perspiration.

07:51.972 --> 07:56.184
In the summer, it's in a cross breeze
created by opening windows there and there.

07:56.351 --> 08:00.438
It faces the television at an angle that is
neither direct, discouraging conversation...

08:00.605 --> 08:03.066
Nor so far wide
as to create a parallax distortion.

08:03.233 --> 08:07.320
I could go on,
but I think I've made my point.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.949
Do you want me to move?

08:11.116 --> 08:12.951
- Well...
- Just sit somewhere else.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.830
Fine.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.683
Sheldon, sit.

08:41.104 --> 08:44.399
Well, this is nice.
We don't have a lot of company over.

08:44.566 --> 08:47.110
That's not true.
Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.278
Yes, I know.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.905
Tuesday night we played klingon boggle
until 1 in the morning.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.592
- Yeah, I remember.
- I resent you saying we don't have company.

08:53.742 --> 08:56.494
- That has a negative social implication.
- I said I'm sorry.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.498
Klingon boggle?

09:00.665 --> 09:05.253
Yeah. It's like regular boggle,
but in klingon.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.592
That's probably enough about us.
So tell us about you.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.053
Me? Okay.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.806
I'm a sagittarius, which probably tells you
way more than you need to know.

09:16.973 --> 09:20.435
Yes, it tells us that you participate
in the mass cultural delusion...

09:20.602 --> 09:23.646
That the sun's position relative
to arbitrary constellations...

09:23.813 --> 09:27.108
At the time of your birth
somehow affects your personality.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.071
Participate in the what?

09:31.237 --> 09:33.073
I think what Sheldon's trying to say...

09:33.239 --> 09:35.992
Is that sagittarius wouldn't have been
our first guess.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.828
Oh, yeah, a lot of people
think I'm a water sign.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.372
Okay, let's see, what else?

09:41.539 --> 09:42.582
Oh, I'm a vegetarian.

09:42.749 --> 09:46.795
No, except for fish,
and the occasional steak. I love steak.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.839
Well, that's interesting.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.591
Leonard can't process corn.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.014
So do you have some sort of a job?

09:58.181 --> 09:59.224
Penny: Oh, yeah.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.392
I'm a waitress
at the cheesecake factory.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.353
I love cheesecake.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.898
- You're lactose intolerant.
- I don't eat it, I think it's a good idea.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.318
Anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.905
It's about this sensitive girl who comes
to la. From Lincoln, Nebraska...

10:14.072 --> 10:18.284
To be an actress and winds up
a waitress at the cheesecake factory.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.578
So it's based on your life.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.747
No, I'm from Omaha.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.336
If that was a movie, I would go see it.

10:28.503 --> 10:29.712
I know, right?

10:29.879 --> 10:31.589
Okay, let's see, what else?

10:33.049 --> 10:34.759
I guess that's about it.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.554
That's the story of penny.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.722
Well, it sounds wonderful.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.267
It was.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.937
Until I fell in love with a jerk.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.441
What is happening?

10:50.608 --> 10:52.610
[Mouths] I don't know.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.029
Oh, god, you know,
four years I lived with him.

10:55.196 --> 10:58.366
Four years.
That's like as long as high school.

10:58.533 --> 11:01.035
It took you four years
to get through high school?

11:02.954 --> 11:06.749
I just... I can't believe I trusted him.

11:10.753 --> 11:13.256
Should I say something?
I feel I should say something.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.091
You? No, you'll only make it worse.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.427
You wanna know the most pathetic part?

11:17.594 --> 11:21.139
Even though I hate his lying,
cheating guts...

11:21.306 --> 11:23.766
I still love him.

11:23.933 --> 11:24.976
Is that crazy?

11:28.229 --> 11:31.524
No, it's not crazy. It's a...

11:31.691 --> 11:33.401
It's a paradox.

11:33.568 --> 11:36.946
Paradoxes are part of nature.
I mean, think about light.

11:37.113 --> 11:41.701
If you look at huygens, light is a wave, as
confirmed by the double-slit experiments.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.204
But then, along comes Albert Einstein...

11:44.370 --> 11:47.332
And discovers that light
behaves like particles too.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.503
Well, I didn't make it worse.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.465
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm such a mess.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.343
And on top of everything else,
I'm all gross from moving...

11:58.509 --> 12:00.261
And my stupid shower doesn't work.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.597
Our shower works.

12:03.181 --> 12:05.433
Really? Would it be totally weird
if I used it?

12:05.600 --> 12:06.643
-Yes.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.022
It's right down the hall.

12:11.189 --> 12:12.398
Okay, thanks.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.150
You guys are really sweet.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.493
Well, this is an interesting development.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.247
Leonard: How so?

12:27.413 --> 12:28.748
Sheldon:
It has been some time...

12:28.915 --> 12:31.793
Since we've had a woman
take her clothes off in our apartment.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.962
That's not true.
Remember at Thanksgiving...

12:34.128 --> 12:37.173
My grandmother with Alzheimer's
had that episode?

12:38.383 --> 12:42.178
Point taken. It has been some time since
we've had a woman take her clothes off...

12:42.345 --> 12:45.014
After which
we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.

12:45.932 --> 12:49.435
The worst part
was watching her carve that Turkey.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.648
So, what exactly
are you trying to accomplish here?

12:53.815 --> 12:54.941
Excuse me?

12:55.108 --> 12:57.694
That woman in there
is not going to have sex with you.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.862
Well, I'm not trying to have sex with her.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.740
Oh, good.
Then you won't be disappointed.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.243
What makes you think
she wouldn't have sex with me?

13:05.410 --> 13:07.370
I'm a male and she's a female.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.999
Yes, but not of the same species.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.251
I'm not gonna engage
in hypotheticals here.

13:13.418 --> 13:17.130
- I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
- Oh, of course.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.383
That's not to say that
if a carnal relationship were to develop...

13:20.550 --> 13:23.052
That I wouldn't participate.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.805
However briefly.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.309
Do you think this possibility
will be hindered...

13:29.475 --> 13:33.354
When she discovers your Luke Skywalker
"no more tears" shampoo?

13:34.063 --> 13:36.566
It's Darth Vader shampoo.

13:36.733 --> 13:37.775
[Knocking on door]

13:37.942 --> 13:40.320
Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.741
- Wait till you see this.
- It's fantastic. Unbelievable.

13:47.243 --> 13:51.456
It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from mit
in 1974.

13:51.622 --> 13:52.832

- —why?

14:01.174 --> 14:04.177
- It's just not a good time.
- Leonard has a lady over.

14:04.719 --> 14:07.597
[In normal voice] Yeah, right.
Your grandmother back in town?

14:10.600 --> 14:13.102
And she's not a lady,
she's just a new neighbor.

14:13.269 --> 14:16.022
Hang on, there really is a lady here?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.648
- —Uh-huh.
- And you want us out...

14:17.815 --> 14:19.859
Because you're anticipating coitus?

14:20.443 --> 14:23.237
- I'm not anticipating coitus.
- So she's available for coitus?

14:23.404 --> 14:25.865
Can we please just stop saying "coitus"?

14:26.032 --> 14:28.659
Technically,
that would be coitus interruptus.

14:29.452 --> 14:32.497
Hey, is there a trick
to getting it to switch from tub to shower?

14:32.663 --> 14:34.457
Oh, hi, sorry.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.545
Enchanté, mademoiselle.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.342
Howard Wolowitz,
Caltech department of applied physics.

You may be familiar
with some of my work.

Jupiter's largest moon...

14:52.809 --> 14:55.728
Penny. I work at
the cheesecake factory.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.939
- I'll show you the trick with the shower.
- Okay.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.690
[Speaks in French]

14:59.857 --> 15:01.317
I'm sorry?

15:01.484 --> 15:03.152
It's French for "good shower."

15:03.319 --> 15:06.072
It's a sentiment I can express
in six languages.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.450
Save it for your blog, Howard.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.453
[Speaks in foreign language]

Leonard: All right, there it goes.
It sticks, I'm sorry.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.920
- Okay, thanks.
- You're welcome.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.131
Oh, you're just gonna step right...? Okay.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.551
- Penny: Hey, Leonard?
- The hair products are Sheldon's.

15:26.717 --> 15:27.885
Penny: Okay.

15:28.052 --> 15:31.973
- Um, can I ask you a favor?
- A favor?

15:32.140 --> 15:35.351
Sure, you could ask me a favor.
I would do you a favor for you.

15:36.144 --> 15:40.231
- It's okay if you say no.
- Oh, I'll probably say yes.

15:40.523 --> 15:44.569
It's just not the kind of thing
you ask a guy you just met.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.996
I really think we should examine
the chain of causality here.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.372
- Must we?
- Event a:

15:56.539 --> 15:58.624
A beautiful woman
stands naked in our shower.

15:58.791 --> 16:02.128
Event b: We drive halfway across town
to retrieve a television set...

16:02.295 --> 16:04.505
From the aforementioned woman's
ex-boyfriend.

16:04.672 --> 16:08.259
Query: On what plane of existence
is there even a semi-rational link...

16:08.426 --> 16:10.470
Between these events?

16:11.179 --> 16:13.514
She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.142
Well, that may be the proximal cause
of our journey...

16:16.309 --> 16:18.728
But we both know it exists
in contradistinction...

16:18.895 --> 16:20.855
To the higher-level distal cause.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.858
- Which is?
- You think with your penis.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.528
That's a biological impossibility,
and you didn't have to come.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.907
Oh, yes. I could have stayed behind
to watch Wolowitz hit on penny...

16:31.073 --> 16:33.409
In Russian, arabic and Farsi.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.453
And why can't she get her own TV?

16:35.620 --> 16:37.580
Come on, you know how it is
with breakups.

16:37.747 --> 16:40.041
No, I don't, and neither do you.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.251
But I... I broke up with Joyce Kim.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.922
You did not break up with Joyce Kim.
She defected to North Korea.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.633
To mend her broken heart.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.763
This situation is much less complicated.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.599
There's some dispute
between penny and her ex-boyfriend...

16:56.766 --> 16:58.434
As to who gets custody of the TV.

16:58.601 --> 17:02.355
- She just wanted to avoid a scene with him.
- So we get to have a scene with him?

17:02.522 --> 17:05.024
No, Sheldon,
there's not going to be a scene.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.859
There's two of us and one of him.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.071
Leonard, the two of us
can't even carry a TV.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.784
So you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon
at the university?

17:20.456 --> 17:22.917
I'm sorry, do you speak English?

17:23.084 --> 17:26.128
Oh, he speaks English.
He just can't speak to women.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.297
Really? Why?

17:28.464 --> 17:30.216
He's kind of a nerd.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.602
-I'll do the talking. Man: Yeah?

- Hi. I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
- Hello.

17:44.522 --> 17:45.982
What did I just...?

17:47.817 --> 17:50.653
- We're here to pick up penny's TV.
- Get lost.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.196
Okay, thanks for your time.

17:52.363 --> 17:55.866
- We're not gonna give up just like that.
- Leonard, the TV's in the building.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.036
We've been denied access to the building,
ergo we are done.

17:59.203 --> 18:03.082
Excuse me. If I were to give up at the first
hitch, I never would have identified...

18:24.186 --> 18:26.856
It's just a privilege
to watch your mind at work.

Come on,
we have a combined IQ of 360.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.696

how to get into a stupid building.

- Just grab the door.

Leonard: This is it.

18:45.708 --> 18:46.876
I'll do the talking.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.754
Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.

18:56.886 --> 19:00.097
- Yeah?
- I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.058
From the intercom.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.853
How the hell did you get in the building?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.397
We're scientists.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.568

19:24.538 --> 19:26.207
- Leonard.
- What?

19:26.374 --> 19:29.585
- My mom bought me those pants.
- I'm sorry.

19:30.211 --> 19:32.254
You're gonna have to call her.

19:34.757 --> 19:37.677
Sheldon, I am so sorry
I dragged you through this.

19:37.843 --> 19:42.098
It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing
and it won't be my last.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.933
And you were right about my motives.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.852
I was hoping to establish
a relationship with penny...

19:47.019 --> 19:50.272
That might have someday led to sex.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.359
Sheldon:
Well, you got me out of my pants.

19:54.777 --> 19:58.280
Anyway, I've learned my lesson.
She's out of my league, I'm done with her.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.615
I've got my work.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.743
One day I'll win the nobel prize
and then I'll die alone.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.955
Don't think like that.
You're not going to die alone.

20:06.122 --> 20:09.125
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're a good friend.

20:10.251 --> 20:13.129
Sheldon: And you're certainly
not gonna win a nobel prize.

to kick back after a quest.

Yeah, I've had him since level 10.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.933
His name is buttons.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.561
Anyway, if you had
your own game character...

20:28.728 --> 20:31.647
We could hang out,
maybe go on a quest.

20:31.814 --> 20:35.109
- That sounds interesting.
- So you'll think about it?

20:35.276 --> 20:37.987
Oh, I don't think
I'll be able to stop thinking about it.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.699
Smooth.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.537
- We're home.
- Oh, my god. What happened?

20:46.704 --> 20:52.334
Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and
I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.669
I'm so sorry.

20:53.836 --> 20:57.298
I really thought if you guys went
instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.049
No, it was a valid hypothesis.

20:59.216 --> 21:02.470
That was a valid hypo...?
What is happening to you?

21:03.012 --> 21:06.098

for going and trying.

get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay?

- Really? Great.
- Thank you.

- Is Thai food okay with you, penny?
- Sure.

21:41.884 --> 21:43.886
We can't have Thai,
we had Indian for lunch.

- So?
- They're both curry-based cuisines.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.350
- So?
- It would be gastronomically redundant.
