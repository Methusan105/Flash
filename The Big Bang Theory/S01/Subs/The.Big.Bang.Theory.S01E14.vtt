00:02.753 --> 00:06.298
Well, this sandwich
is an unmitigated disaster.

00:06.465 --> 00:08.133
I asked for Turkey and roast beef...

00:08.300 --> 00:10.969
- With lettuce and Swiss on whole wheat.
- What'd they give you?

00:11.136 --> 00:14.973
Turkey and roast beef
with Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.

00:20.395 --> 00:23.941
It's the right ingredients
but in the wrong order.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.860
In a proper sandwich,
the cheese is adjacent to the bread...

00:27.027 --> 00:30.322
To create a moisture barrier
against the lettuce.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.117
They might as well have dragged this thing
through a car wash.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.996
- I don't believe it.
- I know. It's basic culinary science.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.124
Some guy is auctioning off
a miniature time-machine prop...

00:41.291 --> 00:43.710
From the original film
and no one is bidding.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.630
A time machine
from the movie the time machine?

00:47.089 --> 00:49.967
No, a time machine
from Sophie '3 choice.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.970
Boy, Sophie could have used
a time machine in that movie.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.347
Did you see it? It's rough.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.073
Howard: Oh, that's cool.
Leonard: Uh-huh.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.644
- It's only $800?
- Yeah. And that's my bid.

01:00.811 --> 01:03.564
- You bid $800?
- It was a spur-ofâ€”the-moment thing.

01:03.730 --> 01:07.359
I figured it would go for thousands,
and I just wanted to be a part of it.

01:07.526 --> 01:10.654
- There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.
- Do you have $800?

01:10.821 --> 01:14.032
- Not to blow on a miniature time machine.
- Don't worry.

01:14.199 --> 01:17.578
People wait until the last second,
then they get it. It's called sniping.

01:17.744 --> 01:21.373
- Fifteen seconds.
- Come on, snipers.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.711
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Where are your snipers?

01:26.378 --> 01:27.504
- Five.
- Snipe.

01:27.671 --> 01:28.672
-Foun -snipe.

01:28.839 --> 01:30.882
- Three, two.
- Snipe, snipe.

01:32.676 --> 01:38.140
Oh. Congratulations, you are the proud
owner of a miniature time machine.

01:38.307 --> 01:39.933
-You lucky duck. Leonard: Heh.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.560
I wonder why no one else bid.

01:41.727 --> 01:44.187
This is a classic piece
of Sci-Fi movie memorabilia.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.440
I know. But I still can't afford it.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.151
Why don't we share it?
We'll each put in 200 bucks...

01:49.318 --> 01:52.988
- And take turns having it in our house.
- A time-share time machine.

01:54.323 --> 01:57.409
- I'm in. Sheldon?
- Wha...? Need you ask?

01:57.576 --> 01:59.870
But I still don't understand
why no one else bid.

02:09.171 --> 02:11.923
I understand why no one else bid.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.579
Did the listing actually say "miniature"?

02:44.748 --> 02:46.583
I just assumed.

02:47.167 --> 02:51.588
Well, who sells a full-sized time machine
for $800?

02:51.755 --> 02:54.424
In a venn diagram,
that would be an individual located...

02:54.591 --> 02:57.427
Within the intersection of
"no longer want time machine"...

02:57.594 --> 03:00.263
And "need $800."

03:00.847 --> 03:02.599
It's actually a tremendous bargain.

03:02.766 --> 03:07.020
Even with shipping,
it works out to less than $4 a pound.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.731
Cocktail shrimp are 12.50.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.486
How are we gonna get it upstairs?

03:15.112 --> 03:17.823
If we take the dish off,
it might fit in the elevator.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.492
Yes, but the elevator's been broken
for two years.

03:20.659 --> 03:24.371
I've been meaning to ask you, do you think
we should make a call about that?

03:25.956 --> 03:28.792
Not necessary.
I have a master's in engineering.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.837
I remotely repair satellites
on a regular basis.

03:32.003 --> 03:35.465
I troubleshoot space-shuttle payloads.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.884
When the Mars rover
started pulling to the left...

03:38.051 --> 03:43.765
I performed a front-end alignment
from 62 million miles away.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.985
No, that baby's broken.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.822
Leonard: Come on, guys, push.

03:58.989 --> 04:03.201
Howard: If I push any harder,
I'm gonna give birth to my colon.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.120
Rajesh:
I can't feel my fingers. Hurry up.

04:05.287 --> 04:08.623
It's the same amount of work,
no matter how fast you go. Basic physics.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.000
- Rajesh: Sheldon.
- Yeah?

04:10.167 --> 04:14.504
Rajesh: If my fingers ever work again,
I've got a job for the middle one.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.715
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hi, penny.

04:16.882 --> 04:17.924
[Rajesh and Howard scream]

04:20.469 --> 04:22.345
Take a break, guys.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.516
- What are you doing?
- Just moving something upstairs.

04:26.850 --> 04:31.188
- What is it?
- Just, you know, a time machine.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.732
Okay, neat.
But I really gotta get to work.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.860
- Just give us a few minutes.
- I'm running really late.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.403
Then I have a simple solution.

04:38.570 --> 04:41.573
Go up to the roof, hop over
to the next building... there's a gap.

04:41.740 --> 04:45.535
Don't look down if you're subject
to vertigo... and use their stainnell.

04:45.827 --> 04:49.998
- You're joking, right?
- Oh, I neverjoke when it comes to vertigo.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.002
Damn. Okay, I'll just take the roof.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.379
If you wait for us
to set up the time machine...

04:56.546 --> 04:58.715
I can drop you off at work yesterday.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.969
Time-travel joke. It's not... never mind.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.724
For what it's worth,
I thought it was humorous.

05:07.891 --> 05:08.975
[Chortles]

05:11.561 --> 05:12.896
Let's just do this.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.607
- You guys ready to push?
- Rajesh: In a minute.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.401
Howard stepped outside to throw up.

05:23.323 --> 05:27.744
I don't know what you were worried about.
I think it really works in the room.

05:28.495 --> 05:32.123
Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing
I have ever owned.

05:32.290 --> 05:35.252
The exact time machine
that carried actor rod Taylor...

05:35.418 --> 05:38.255
From victorian england
into the post-apocalyptic future...

05:38.421 --> 05:40.674
Where society had splintered
into two factions:

05:40.841 --> 05:42.217
The subterranean morlocks...

05:42.384 --> 05:46.429
Who survived by feasting on the flesh
of the gentle surface-dwelling eloi.

05:48.265 --> 05:51.601
Talk about your chick magnets.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.689
Oh, yeah. The guy who lives next to me
is always like:

05:55.856 --> 05:59.317
"I have a jacuzzi on my balcony.
I have a jacuzzi on my balcony."

05:59.484 --> 06:03.446
But wait until I tell him
I've got a time machine on my balcony.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.909
Stuff that in your speedos, jacuzzi Bob.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.287
Gentlemen, we said we'd take turns...

06:10.453 --> 06:13.999
But I think you'll agree
that practicality dictates it remain here.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.459
You can't keep it.
What if I meet a girl and say:

06:16.626 --> 06:19.337
"You wanna see my time machine?
It's at my friend's house."

06:19.504 --> 06:21.631
How lame is that?

06:21.798 --> 06:23.398
- He's got a point.
- Sheldon: All right.

06:23.508 --> 06:27.137
We're going to need some ground rules.
"No shoes in the time machine."

06:27.304 --> 06:29.806
"No eating in the time machine."
I propose that we add:

06:29.973 --> 06:33.727
"Pants must be worn at all times
in the time machine."

06:34.102 --> 06:35.812
Seconded.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.648
I was gonna put down a towel.

06:41.818 --> 06:45.739
I still want it on my balcony.
I say we move it on a bimonthly basis.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.867
- That sounds fair.
- Hold on. Bimonthly is an ambiguous term.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.661
- Every other month or twice a month?
- Twice a month.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.830
- Then no.
- Okay, every other month.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.751
Sheldon, you can't be selfish.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.253
We all paid for it,
so it belongs to all of us.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.381
Now get out of the way
so I can sit in my time machine.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.013
[All gasping]

07:11.973 --> 07:17.103
Okay. I am setting the dials
for march 10th, 1876.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.857
Good choice. Alexander Graham bell
invents the telephone and calls for Watson.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.527
- Wait a minute. I wanna see that too.
- So when it's your turn, you can.

07:24.694 --> 07:28.198
If we all go back to the same time,
bell's lab's going to get very crowded.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.367
He'll know something's up.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.702
Since the time machine
doesn't move in space...

07:32.869 --> 07:36.039
- You'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.
- Even if you make it to Boston...

07:36.206 --> 07:39.709
What are you gonna do? Knock and say
to Mrs. Bell, "fan of your husband.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.712
Can I come in and watch him
invent the telephone?"

07:42.879 --> 07:45.715
Mrs. Bell was deaf.
She's not even gonna hear you knock.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.219
I have a solution.
First, go into the future...

07:49.386 --> 07:52.305
- And obtain a cloaking device.
- Ooh. How far into the future?

07:52.472 --> 07:55.892
If I remember, kirk will steal
a cloaking device from the romulans...

07:58.353 --> 08:02.565
Which would be January 10th, 2328,
by pre-federation reckoning.

08:03.566 --> 08:08.405
Okay, I am setting the dials
for January 10th, 2328.

08:08.571 --> 08:11.908
Here we go into the future.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.930
That was fun.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.265
[Laughing]

08:35.432 --> 08:36.850
My turn.

08:37.475 --> 08:41.312
Okay, first of all, what you call a gap
was nearly three feet wide.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.440
- I slipped and skinned my knee.
- Are you okay?

08:43.606 --> 08:44.649
[Buzzing]

08:44.816 --> 08:47.444
The door to the stairwell
of the other building was locked.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.321
I had to go down the fire escape,
which ends on the third floor...

08:50.488 --> 08:53.408
Forcing me to crawl through the window
of a lovely Armenian family...

08:53.575 --> 08:55.994
Who insisted I stay for lunch.

08:56.661 --> 08:57.954
That doesn't sound too bad.

08:58.121 --> 09:02.333
It was eight courses of lamb.
And they tried to fix me up with their son.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.128
- Sorry.
- Not done.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.964
By the time I got to work,
they'd given my shift away.

09:08.131 --> 09:11.468
Yeah, that's right. I've lost an
entire day's pay thanks to this.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.303
- This...
- Time machine.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.600
The lights flash and the dish spins.
Wanna try?

09:20.810 --> 09:24.230
I don't wanna try it.
My god, you are grown men.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.108
How can you waste your lives
with these stupid toys...

09:27.275 --> 09:30.195
And costumes and comic books,
and now that?

09:30.361 --> 09:33.740
- That...
- Again, time machine.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.577
Oh, please, it's not a time machine.
If anything, it looks like...

09:37.744 --> 09:40.663
Something Elton John would drive
through the everglades.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.338
It only moves in time.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.841
It would be worse than useless
in a swamp.

09:56.679 --> 10:01.101
Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.273
My turn.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.292
Leonard, it's 2 in the morning.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.171
- So?
- So it's my turn.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.219
Why'd you set it
for the day before yesterday?

10:36.386 --> 10:39.931
Because I wanna go back and keep myself
from getting a time machine.

10:40.098 --> 10:43.434
You can't. If you were to prevent yourself
from buying it in the past...

10:43.601 --> 10:46.688
You would not have it available
to stop yourself from buying it.

10:46.855 --> 10:51.067
Ergo, you would still have it. This is
a classic rookie time-travel mistake.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.157
Can I go back and prevent you
from explaining that to me?

10:57.657 --> 10:58.700
Same paradox.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.744
If you were to travel back in time
and knock me unconscious...

11:01.911 --> 11:04.231
You wouldn't have the conversation
that irritated you...

11:04.372 --> 11:07.000
Motivating you to go back
and knock me unconscious.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.670
What if I knocked you unconscious
right now?

11:12.088 --> 11:14.257
It won't change the past.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.178
But it'd make the present so much nicer.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.639
Are you upset about something?

11:21.806 --> 11:23.766
What was your first clue?

11:24.434 --> 11:27.312
Well, it was a number of things.
First, the late hour.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.355
Then your demeanor
seems very low-energy.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.357
- Plus your irritability...
- Yes, I'm upset.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.528
I don't usually pick up on those things.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.322
Good for me.

11:39.949 --> 11:40.950
Yeah, good for you.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.203
Oh, wait.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.415
Did you wanna talk about
what's bothering you?

11:48.666 --> 11:51.461
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Wow, I'm on fire tonight.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.551
Well, here's the thing.

11:58.718 --> 12:02.805
Girls like penny never end up with guys
who own time machines.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.390
I disagree.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.851
Your inability
to successfully woo penny...

12:07.018 --> 12:10.230
Long predates your acquisition
of the time machine.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.984
That failure clearly stands on its own.

12:16.027 --> 12:19.113
- Thanks for pointing it out.
- In addition, your premise is flawed.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.158
In the original film,
rod Taylor got yvette mimieux...

12:22.325 --> 12:23.743
With that time machine.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.621
In back to the future,
Marty mcfly got to hook up...

12:26.788 --> 12:29.582
With his extremely attractive
young mother.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.712
- Those are movies.
- Of course they're movies.

12:34.879 --> 12:39.384
Are you expecting an example
involving a real-life time machine?

12:41.219 --> 12:43.179
That's absurd.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.015
Leonard: Come on, guys, push.

12:46.182 --> 12:50.687
Howard: If I push any harder,
I'm gonna give birth to my colon.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.147
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hi, penny.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.691
[Rajesh and Howard scream]

12:56.776 --> 12:58.653
Take a break, guys.

12:59.362 --> 13:00.363
What are you doing?

13:00.530 --> 13:04.200
Oh, you know,
just moving a time machine.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.328
Yeah, okay, neat.
But I really gotta get to work.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.247
No problem.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.754
Hang on.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.632
But what about your time machine?

13:19.799 --> 13:22.885
Some things are more important
than toys.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.562
I'm scared.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.897
Don't worry, baby, I've got you.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.400
Oh, Leonard.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.546
It's still my turn.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.762
What are you doing?

14:06.512 --> 14:07.992
I'm packing up all my collectibles...

14:08.139 --> 14:10.600
And taking them down
to the comic-book store to sell.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.935
Is that really necessary?

14:13.102 --> 14:16.189
If you need money,
you can always sell blood.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.317
And semen.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.194
It's not about money.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.446
We brought food.

14:23.613 --> 14:26.657
Lox and bagels,
the breakfast of time travelers.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.494
Terrific. Anyone wanna buy
my share of the time machine?

14:29.660 --> 14:31.621
- â€”Why?
- Because I don't want it anymore.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.207
- â€”Why?
- Just personal reasons.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.418
My spidey sense tells me
this has something to do with penny.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.129
Look, do you wanna buy me out or not?

14:40.296 --> 14:44.133
I'll give you $100, which will make me
half-owner, and we'll put it on my balcony.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.136
Screw his balcony.
I'll give you 120 and put it in my garage.

14:47.303 --> 14:50.765
- I paid $200 for my share.
- Everybody knows a time machine loses...

14:50.932 --> 14:54.018
Half its value the minute
you drive it off the lot.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.105
I'll go for 200.
That time machine stays right where it is.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.858
Three hundred. And I'll throw in my
original 1979 mattel millennium falcon...

15:01.025 --> 15:02.902
With real light-speed sound effects.

15:03.069 --> 15:07.782
No. No more toys or action figures
or props or replicas...

15:07.949 --> 15:11.327
Or costumes or robots
or Darth Vader voice changers.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.413
I'm getting rid of all of it.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.623
You can't do that.
Look what you've created.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.209
It's like nerdvana.

15:20.878 --> 15:24.090
More importantly,
you have a Darth Vader voice changer?

15:25.716 --> 15:28.553
- Not for long.
- I call dibs on the golden age flash.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.722
I need that to complete
my justice society of america collection.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.182
- I called dibs.
- You can't.

15:33.349 --> 15:36.227
I can and I did.
Look up "dibs" in Wikipedia.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.938
Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.859
It's not a bidding war. I'm selling it all
to Larry down at the comic-book store.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.987
- Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?
- Will you forget dibs?

15:46.154 --> 15:48.531
He offered me a fair price
for the whole collection.

15:48.698 --> 15:52.994
- What's the number? I'll match it.
- I'll match it, plus 1000 rupees.

15:53.161 --> 15:56.831
- What's the exchange rate?
- None of your business. Take it or leave it.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.542
Mom, my bar mitzvah bonds,
how much do I got?

15:59.709 --> 16:03.671
Thanks. I can go $2600
and two trees in Israel.

16:05.423 --> 16:09.260
Forget it. Guys, if I sell to one of you,
the other two are gonna be mad at me.

16:09.427 --> 16:12.388
Who cares? As long as you pick me.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.640
Okay, Leonard, put down the box.
Let's talk.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.976
Sorry, raj, my mind is made up.

16:17.143 --> 16:20.396
No. I can't let you do this.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.691
Sheldon, get out of my way.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.696
None shall pass.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.242
Okay.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.952
I did not wanna do this...

16:35.119 --> 16:38.206
But I have here the rare,
mint-condition, production-era...

16:38.372 --> 16:41.918
Star Trek: The next generation
geordi la forge without his visor...

16:42.084 --> 16:43.461
In the original packaging.

16:44.045 --> 16:46.464
If you do not get out of my way...

16:46.631 --> 16:48.466
I will open it.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.302
Okay, man, be cool.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.679
We're all friends here.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.557
What the hell's going on?

16:56.724 --> 16:59.352
- You hypocrite.
- What?

16:59.519 --> 17:02.021
Little miss grown-ups-
don't-play-with-toys.

17:02.188 --> 17:05.733
If I went into that apartment right now,
would I not find beanie babies?

17:05.900 --> 17:08.778
Are you not an accumulator
of care bears and my little ponies?

17:08.945 --> 17:11.864
And who is that Japanese feline
I see frolicking on your shorts?

17:12.031 --> 17:14.575
Hello, hello kitty.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.623
Okay, okay, look,
if this is about yesterday, Leonard...

17:20.790 --> 17:23.543
I am really sorry about what I said.
I was just upset.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.462
- No, I needed to hear it.
- You didn't. You are a great guy.

17:26.629 --> 17:29.799
And it is the things you love
that make you who you are.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.386
I guess that makes me large breasts.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.809
Still, I think it's time for me
to get rid of this stuff...

17:39.976 --> 17:42.812
And, you know, move on with my life.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.149
Oh. Wow.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.068
Good for you.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.032
Hey, do you wanna,
I don't know, later...?

17:55.199 --> 17:56.701
Excuse me.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.369
- Hey, penny.
- Hi, Mike.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.413
- You ready to go?
- I just have to change.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.332
- I'll give you a hand.
- Oh, stop it.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.167
Bye, guys.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.335
[Door closes]

18:09.714 --> 18:11.799
My turn on the time machine.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.159
It worked.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.412
It really worked.

18:41.996 --> 18:45.583
They said I was mad, but it worked.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.550
Oh, no, not morlocks.

18:54.717 --> 18:57.345
Not flesh-eating morlocks.

18:57.511 --> 19:01.057
Help!

19:03.392 --> 19:04.560
[Screams]

19:07.730 --> 19:09.899
Sheldon, are you okay?

19:10.608 --> 19:12.818
We have to get rid of the time machine.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.404
It is a little big for the living room,
isn't it?

19:16.405 --> 19:18.741
Yeah, that's the problem. It's too big.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.952
I'm glad you agree.
I hired some guys to help us move it.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.080
Come on in, fellas.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.126
Oh, no, morlocks.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.087
Eat him, eat him.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.713
[Screaming]

19:32.880 --> 19:33.923
[Gasping]

19:36.217 --> 19:40.638
Leonard!
