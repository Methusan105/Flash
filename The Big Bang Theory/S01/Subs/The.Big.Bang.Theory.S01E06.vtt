WEBVTT

00:09.134 --> 00:11.053
Okay, if no one else will say it, I will.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.722
We really suck at paintball.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.808
Howard:
That was absolutely humiliating.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.978
Leonard: Oh, come on. Some battles
you win, some battles you lose.

00:20.145 --> 00:25.526
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose
to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah party.

00:26.235 --> 00:31.406
I think we have to acknowledge, those were
some fairly savage preadolescent Jews.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.869
No, we were annihilated
by our own incompetence...

00:36.036 --> 00:39.122
And the inability of some people
to follow the chain of command.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.624
Sheldon, let it go.

00:40.791 --> 00:45.045
No, I wanna talk about the fact
that Wolowitz shot me in the back.

00:45.629 --> 00:49.841
I shot you for a good reason.
You were leading us into disaster.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.427
I was giving clear, concise orders.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.012
You hid behind a tree yelling:

00:54.179 --> 00:57.015
"Get the kid in the yarmulke!
Get the kid in the yarmulke!"

00:57.182 --> 00:58.642
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, penny.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.519
- Hello.
- Morning, ma'am.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.564
So how was paintball?
Did you have fun?

01:03.730 --> 01:07.651
Sure, if you consider being fragged
by your own troops fun.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.655
You clear a space on your calendar.
There will be an inquiry.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.407
Okay. Um...

01:13.574 --> 01:16.410
I'm having a party on Saturday,
so if you're around, come by.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.831
A boy-girl party?

01:22.165 --> 01:24.251
There will be boys
and there will be girls...

01:24.418 --> 01:26.003
And it is a party, so...

01:26.169 --> 01:29.131
Just a bunch of my friends,
have some beer, do a little dancing.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.676
- I don't know, penny...
- Thing is, we're not...

01:32.843 --> 01:34.553
- We're really more of a...
- No.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.140
But thanks.
Thanks for thinking of us.

01:38.307 --> 01:39.933
Are you sure? It's Halloween.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.476
A Halloween party?

01:41.643 --> 01:43.061
As in costumes?

01:43.228 --> 01:44.605
Well, yeah.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.865
Is there a theme?

01:55.032 --> 01:56.575
Um, yeah, Halloween.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.245
Yes, but are the costumes random
or genre-specific?

02:00.912 --> 02:03.540
As usual, I'm not following.

02:03.707 --> 02:06.877
He's asking if we can come as anyone
from science fiction...

02:07.044 --> 02:08.128
- Fantasy...
- Sure.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.588
- Comic books?
- Fine.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.214
- Anime?
- Of course.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.800
TV, film, d&d, manga.
Greek, Roman, norse gods...

02:13.967 --> 02:15.052
Anything you want.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.096
Okay? Any costume you want.

02:22.351 --> 02:25.145
Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.546
[Knocking]

02:51.713 --> 02:53.507
Leonard: I'll get it.

03:03.809 --> 03:04.893
Psshoo.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.731
Oh, no.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.150
Sheldon: Oh, no.

03:13.443 --> 03:16.822
Make way for the fastest man alive.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.323
Oh, no.

03:18.490 --> 03:21.284
See, this is why I wanted
to have a costume meeting.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.787
We all have other costumes.
We can change.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.873
Or we could walk right
behind each other all night.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.751
It'll look like one person
going really fast.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.260
No, no, no.

03:38.427 --> 03:42.431
It's a boy-girl party,
this flash runs solo.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.600
Okay, how about this?
Nobody gets to be the flash.

03:45.767 --> 03:46.810
We all change. Agreed?

03:48.270 --> 03:50.188
All: Agreed.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.733
I call Frodo!

03:52.899 --> 03:54.151
All: Damn.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.617
Hey.

04:04.619 --> 04:08.540
Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck
in the door on the bus.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.834
- You went with Thor?
- What?

04:11.001 --> 04:13.879
Just because I'm Indian,
I can't be a norse god?

04:14.045 --> 04:17.007
No, no, no, raj has to be an Indian god.

04:17.174 --> 04:18.467
That's racism.

04:18.633 --> 04:22.220
I mean, look at Wolowitz. He's not English,
but he's dressed like Peter Pan.

04:23.889 --> 04:27.559
Sheldon is neither sound nor light,
but he's obviously the doppler effect.

04:32.230 --> 04:35.734
- I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin hood.
- Really?

04:36.193 --> 04:39.488
Because I saw Peter Pan and you're
dressed exactly like Cathy rigby.

04:41.031 --> 04:44.868
She was a little bigger than you,
but it's basically the same look, man.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.872
Sheldon, there's something
I wanna talk to you about before we go.

04:49.039 --> 04:53.084
I don't care if anybody gets it,
I'm going as the doppler effect.

04:53.543 --> 04:58.006
- No, it's not that...
- If I have to, I can demonstrate: Vroom.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.220
Terrific. Um...

05:03.804 --> 05:06.264
This party is my first chance for penny...

05:06.431 --> 05:09.518
To see me in the context
of her social group...

05:09.684 --> 05:12.354
And I need you not
to embarrass me tonight.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.524
What exactly do you mean
by embarrass you?

05:16.399 --> 05:21.696
For example, tonight, no one needs to know
that my middle name is leakey.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.865
But there's nothing embarrassing
about that.

05:24.032 --> 05:27.244
Your father worked with Louis leakey,
a great anthropologist.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.955
It had nothing to do
with your bed-wetting.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.417
All I'm saying is that this party
is the perfect opportunity...

05:34.584 --> 05:37.629
For penny to see me
as a member of her peer group...

05:37.796 --> 05:41.049
A potential close friend
and perhaps more.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.262
I don't wanna look like a dork.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.440
Just a heads up, fellas,
if anyone gets lucky...

05:57.607 --> 06:00.151
I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.446
Oh, hey, guys.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.156
Hey, sorry we're late.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.158
Late? It's 7:05.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.369
And you said the party starts at 7.

06:09.536 --> 06:15.250
Yeah, I mean, when you start a party at 7,
no one shows up at, you know, 7.

06:18.587 --> 06:19.963
Yes, yes, it is.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.465
Okay, well, um, come on in.

06:30.515 --> 06:33.101
What, are all the girls in the bathroom?

06:33.435 --> 06:35.812
Probably, but in their own homes.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.983
So, what time
does the costume parade start?

06:40.734 --> 06:41.985
The parade?

06:42.152 --> 06:44.988
Yeah, so the judges can give out
the prizes for best costume.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.907
Most frightening, most authentic...

06:47.073 --> 06:50.744
Most accurate visualization
of a scientific principle.

06:52.537 --> 06:53.997
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry...

06:54.164 --> 06:58.335
But there aren't gonna be any parades
or judges or prizes.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.047
This party is just going to suck.

07:02.213 --> 07:05.008
No, come on, it's gonna be fun.
And you all look great.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.053
I mean, look at you, Thor,
and, oh, Peter Pan.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.305
That's so cute.

07:10.472 --> 07:13.600
- Actually, penny, he's Robin...
- I'm Peter Pan.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.854
And I've got a handful of pixie dust
with your name on it.

07:19.397 --> 07:20.565
No, you don't.

07:23.234 --> 07:26.988
- Hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be?
- Oh, he's the doppler effect.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.866
Yes, it's the apparent change
in the frequency of a wave...

07:30.033 --> 07:33.745
Caused by relative motion between
the source of the wave and the observer.

07:35.538 --> 07:39.292
Oh, sure, I see it now.
The doppler effect.

07:39.459 --> 07:43.004
All right, I gotta shower. You guys,
um, make yourselves comfortable.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.048
Okay.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.843
See? People get it.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.061
[Music playing]

07:58.228 --> 08:00.063
[Chattering]

08:01.398 --> 08:05.777
Mm. By Odin's beard,
this is good chex mix.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.320
No, thanks. Peanuts.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.532
I can't afford to swell up in these tights.

08:10.699 --> 08:11.908
I'm confused.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.953
If there's no costume parade,
what are we doing here?

08:15.578 --> 08:18.707
We're socializing, meeting new people.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.209
Telepathically?

08:21.793 --> 08:24.713
- Oh, hey. When did you get here?
- Woman: Hi.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.258
Penny is wearing the worst
catwoman costume I've ever seen.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.260
And that includes Halle Berry's.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.263
She's not catwoman.
She's just a generic cat.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.306
And that's the kind
of sloppy costuming...

08:35.473 --> 08:38.727
Which results
from a lack of rules and competition.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.273
Hey, guys, check out the sexy nurse.

08:43.440 --> 08:48.611
I believe it's time for me
to turn my head and cough.

08:49.612 --> 08:52.991
- What is your move?
- I'm going to use the mirror technique.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.994
She brushes her hair back, I brush mine.
She shrugs, I shrug.

08:56.161 --> 08:59.664
Subconsciously, she's thinking,
"we're in sync. We belong together."

08:59.831 --> 09:02.000
Where do you get this stuff?

09:02.167 --> 09:05.003
You know, psychology journals,
Internet research.

09:05.170 --> 09:09.132
And there's this great show on vh1
about how to pick up girls.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.636
Oh, if only I had his confidence.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.097
I have such difficulty
speaking to women...

09:16.264 --> 09:20.477
Or around women,
or at times even effeminate men.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.772
If that's a working stethoscope...

09:23.938 --> 09:26.483
Maybe you'd like to hear
my heart skip a beat.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.610
No, thanks.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.946
No, seriously, you can.
I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.300
[Under the influence of giants'
"got nothing" plays on stereo]

09:34.324 --> 09:35.700
So take my money

09:35.867 --> 09:38.787
take my money

09:38.953 --> 09:41.664
I wanna get to know penny's friends.
I just...

09:41.831 --> 09:44.334
I don't know
how to talk to these people.

09:44.501 --> 09:48.463
- Well, I actually might be able to help.
- How so?

09:48.630 --> 09:51.132
Like Jane goodall observing the apes...

09:51.299 --> 09:55.011
I initially saw their interactions
as confusing and unstructured.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.221
But patterns emerge.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.808
They have their own language,
if you will.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.143
Go on.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.647
Well, it seems that the newcomer
approaches the existing group...

10:05.814 --> 10:08.358
With the greeting,
"how wasted am I?"

10:08.525 --> 10:12.320
Which is met
with an approving chorus of "dude."

10:13.029 --> 10:14.197
Then what happens?

10:14.364 --> 10:16.032
That's as far as I've gotten.

10:17.492 --> 10:18.827
This is ridiculous.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.995
- I'm jumping in.
- Good luck.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.539
No, you're coming with me.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.707
Oh, I hardly think so.

10:24.874 --> 10:25.917
Come on.

10:26.543 --> 10:30.713
- Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?
- Yes, but I need a wingman.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.675
All right, but if we're going
to use flight metaphors...

10:33.842 --> 10:38.513
I'm much more suited to being the guy
from the faa analyzing wreckage.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.933
Oh, hi.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.520
So, what are you supposed to be?

10:47.397 --> 10:49.482
I'll give you a hint.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.234
Vroom.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.611
A choo-choo train?

10:54.028 --> 10:55.905
Close.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.866
Vroom.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.118
A brain-damaged choo-choo train?

11:02.412 --> 11:05.415
How wasted am I?

11:05.582 --> 11:07.208
Dancing all by myself

11:07.375 --> 11:10.587
cannot control the beat
when you make me weak

11:13.423 --> 11:14.465
vroom.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.694
[Under the influence of giants'
"mama's room" plays on stereo]

11:16.718 --> 11:17.719
I still don't get it.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.637
I'm the doppler effect.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.223
Okay, if that is some sort
of learning disability...

11:22.390 --> 11:24.559
I think it's very insensitive.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.396
Why don't you just tell people
you're a zebra?

11:29.230 --> 11:32.317
Why don't you just tell people
you're one of the seven dwarves?

11:32.483 --> 11:33.610
Because I'm Frodo.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.696
Yes, well, I'm the doppler effect.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.657
- Oh, no.
- What?

11:40.074 --> 11:41.826
That's penny's ex-boyfriend.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.703
What do you suppose he's doing here?

11:43.870 --> 11:47.081
Besides disrupting the local gravity field.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.877
If he were any bigger,
he'd have moons orbiting him.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.049
So I guess we'll be leaving now.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.967
Why should we leave?

11:58.134 --> 12:01.763
For all we know, he crashed the party
and penny doesn't even want him here.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.850
You have a backup hypothesis?

12:06.017 --> 12:07.936
Maybe they just wanna be friends.

12:08.478 --> 12:12.440
Or maybe she wants to be friends
and he wants something more.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.359
Then he and I are on equal ground.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.820
Yes, but you're much closer to it
than he is.

12:19.072 --> 12:23.284
Look, if this was 15,000 years ago,
by virtue of his size and strength...

12:23.451 --> 12:26.162
Kurt would be entitled
to his choice of female partners.

12:26.329 --> 12:29.332
And male partners, animal partners,
large primordial eggplants...

12:29.499 --> 12:32.001
Pretty much
whatever tickled his fancy.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.255
Yes, but our society
has undergone a paradigm shift.

12:35.421 --> 12:39.676
In the information age, Sheldon,
you and I are the Alpha males.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.345
- And we shouldn't have to back down.
- True.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.682
Why don't you text him that
and see if he backs down?

12:49.018 --> 12:52.105
I'm going to assert
my dominance face to face.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.356
Face to face?

12:53.523 --> 12:57.193
Are you gonna wait for him to sit down
or you gonna stand on the coffee table?

12:58.695 --> 13:00.446
Hello, penny. Hello, Kurt.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.407
Oh, hey, guys.

13:04.367 --> 13:08.204
This party is a scathing indictment
of the American education system.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.290
What? You're a zebra, right?

13:11.374 --> 13:13.876
Yet another child left behind.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.713
And what are you supposed to be,
an elf?

13:16.879 --> 13:18.089
No, I'm a hobbit.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.549
What's the difference?

13:19.716 --> 13:22.719
A hobbit is a mortal, halfling inhabitant
of middle-earth...

13:22.885 --> 13:26.014
Whereas an elf
is an immortal, tall warrior.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.058
So why the hell
would you wanna be a hobbit?

13:29.434 --> 13:33.521
Because he's neither tall nor immortal,
and none of us could be the flash.

13:34.689 --> 13:38.776
Well, whatever. Why don't you go hop off
on a quest? I'm talking to penny here.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.903
I think we're all talking to penny here.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.447
I'm not. No offense.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.199
Okay, maybe you didn't hear me.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.410
- Go away.
- All right, Kurt, be nice.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.163
Oh, I am being nice.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.123
Right, little buddy?

13:52.290 --> 13:54.417
- Kun.
- Okay.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.421
I understand your impulse
to try to physically intimidate me.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.049
You can't compete with me
on an intellectual level...

14:01.215 --> 14:04.010
And so you're driven
to animalistic puffery.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.429
You calling me a puffy animal?

14:06.596 --> 14:07.722
Oh, of course not.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.224
No, he's not. You're not, right, Leonard?

14:10.892 --> 14:13.353
No, I said animalistic.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.021
Of course, we're all animals...

14:15.188 --> 14:18.566
But some of us have climbed
a little higher on the evolutionary tree.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.902
If he understands that, you're in trouble.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.945
So what? I'm unevolved?

14:23.112 --> 14:24.364
You're in trouble.

14:25.239 --> 14:28.618
You know, you use a lot of big words
for such a little dwarf.

14:28.785 --> 14:29.827
Okay, Kurt, please.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.287
Look, penny, it's okay.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.705
I can handle this.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.626
I am not a dwarf, I'm a hobbit.

14:36.793 --> 14:37.835
A hobbit.

14:38.002 --> 14:41.255
Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus
preventing the conversion...

14:41.422 --> 14:43.257
From short-term to long-term memory?

14:43.424 --> 14:45.819
[Under the influence of giants'
"meaningless love" plays on stereo]

14:45.843 --> 14:47.887
Okay, now you're starting
to make me mad.

14:49.138 --> 14:52.892
A homo habilis discovering
his opposable thumbs says, "what?"

14:59.774 --> 15:01.192
I think I've made my point.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.362
Yeah? How about I make a point
out of your pointy little head?

15:04.529 --> 15:08.491
Let me remind you, while my moral support
is absolute, in a physical confrontation...

15:08.658 --> 15:10.326
I will be less than useless.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.453
There's not going to be a confrontation.

15:12.620 --> 15:16.541
In fact, I doubt
if he can even spell confrontation.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.379
C-o-n...

15:21.754 --> 15:23.548
Frontation.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.051
- Kurt, put him down this instant.
- He started it.

15:27.218 --> 15:30.096
I don't care, I'm finishing it.
Put him down.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.848
Fine.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.935
You're one lucky little leprechaun.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.023
I got your back.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.067
Leonard, are you okay?

15:43.234 --> 15:45.069
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.447
I can't afford you

15:47.697 --> 15:51.451
it's a good party. Thanks for having...
It's just getting a little late, so...

15:51.826 --> 15:55.121
Oh. Okay. All right.
Well, thank you for coming.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.249
I had nothing to do with

15:58.416 --> 15:59.625
happy Halloween.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.714
If it's any consolation...

16:04.881 --> 16:08.509
I thought that homo habilis line
really put him in his place.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.021
- What's that?
- Tea.

16:20.730 --> 16:21.898
When people are upset...

16:22.064 --> 16:25.318
The cultural convention
is to bring them hot beverages.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.367
There, there.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.330
You wanna talk about it?

16:40.333 --> 16:42.627
"There, there" was really all I had.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.089
- Good night, Sheldon.
- Good night, Leonard.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.220
[Knocking on door]

16:53.429 --> 16:55.389
- Hey, Leonard?
- Hi, penny.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.808
Hey, I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.102
I'm fine.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.564
I am so sorry about what happened.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.358
It's not your fault.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.944
Yes, it is.
That's why I broke up with him.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.696
He always does stuff like that.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.950
So why was he at your party?

17:15.326 --> 17:18.621
Well, I ran into him last week...

17:18.788 --> 17:22.250
And he was just all apologetic
about how he's changed.

17:22.416 --> 17:25.503
He was just going on and on,
and I believed him.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.839
And I'm an idiot,
because I always believe guys like that.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.051
And I can't go back to my party
because he's there.

17:32.218 --> 17:36.222
And I know you don't wanna hear this. I'm
upset and really drunk and I just wanna...

17:37.348 --> 17:39.016
[Sobbing]

17:45.398 --> 17:47.275
There, there.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.321
God, what is wrong with me?

17:52.488 --> 17:53.906
Nothing, you're perfect.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.449
Ecch. I'm not perfect.

17:55.616 --> 17:56.909
Yes, you are.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.914
You really think so, don't you?

18:16.012 --> 18:18.347
- Penny?
- Yeah?

18:19.390 --> 18:22.143
How much have you had
to drink tonight?

18:24.103 --> 18:27.273
Just... a lot.

18:28.190 --> 18:32.069
Are you sure that your being drunk
and your being angry with Kurt...

18:32.236 --> 18:34.905
Doesn't have something to do
with what's going on here?

18:36.490 --> 18:38.200
It might.

18:39.702 --> 18:40.786
[Sighs]

18:40.953 --> 18:42.580
Boy, you're really smart.

18:42.747 --> 18:45.541
Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.

18:50.004 --> 18:51.922
Leonard, you are so great.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.091
Why can't all guys be like you?

18:55.051 --> 18:59.472
Because if all guys were like me,
the human race couldn't survive.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.685
I should probably go.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.103
Probably.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.323
Thank you.

19:27.458 --> 19:30.002
That's right, you saw what you saw.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.674
That's how we roll in the shire.

19:41.889 --> 19:42.932
[Knocking]

19:43.099 --> 19:44.600
Sheldon: Coming.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.107
Hey, have you seen Koothrappali?

19:51.816 --> 19:53.401
He's not here.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.320
Maybe the avengers summoned him.

19:57.279 --> 20:00.116
He's not the marvel comics Thor,
he's the original norse god.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.451
Thank you for the clarification.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.621
- I'm supposed to give him a ride home.
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.790
He has his hammer.

20:15.297 --> 20:19.427
I have to say, you are an amazing man.

20:19.593 --> 20:22.972
You're gentle and passionate.

20:23.139 --> 20:27.977
And, my god,
you are such a good listener.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.635
