00:29.071 --> 00:30.989
- Checkmate.
- Aaarggh!

00:31.490 --> 00:32.574
Again?

00:32.741 --> 00:35.744
Obviously, you're not well suited
for three-dimensional chess.

00:35.911 --> 00:39.248
Perhaps three-dimensional candy land
would be more your speed.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.083
Just reset the board.

00:41.250 --> 00:45.295
It must be humbling to suck
on so many different levels.

00:49.675 --> 00:51.134
[Knocking on door]

00:51.301 --> 00:52.344
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.805
- Get my mail?
- Yeah, right here.

00:54.972 --> 00:58.433
- How was Nebraska?
- Well, better than north Dakota.

01:04.022 --> 01:07.150
I guess that joke's only funny
in Nebraska.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.778
From the data at hand,
you can't draw that conclusion.

01:09.945 --> 01:13.574
All you can say with absolute certainty
is that that joke is not funny here.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.373
Boy, it's good to be back.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.710
- How's your family?
- Oh, it was the worst trip.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.837
- Everyone got sick over the weekend.
- Sick?

01:27.004 --> 01:28.672
Here we go.

01:31.008 --> 01:33.927
- What kind of sick?
- Oh, the flu, I guess.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.179
I don't need you to guess,
I need you to know.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.807
Now, when did the symptoms
first appear?

01:38.974 --> 01:40.225
Maybe Friday.

01:40.392 --> 01:42.519
Friday. Was that morning or afternoon?

01:43.353 --> 01:45.063
- I don't...
- Think, woman.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.190
Who blew their nose and when?

01:47.774 --> 01:50.027
Sheldon, relax.
She doesn't have any symptoms.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.737
I'm sure she's not contagious.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.864
Oh, please.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.367
If influenza was only contagious
after symptoms appear...

01:57.534 --> 01:59.411
It would've died out years ago.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.872
Somewhere between tool using
and cave painting...

02:02.039 --> 02:05.626
Homo habilis would've figured out
to kill the guy with the runny nose.

02:06.209 --> 02:09.212
Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon.
He's a bit of a germaphobe.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.589
That's okay. I understand.

02:10.756 --> 02:13.759
Thanks for your consideration.
Now please leave.

02:14.593 --> 02:18.138
You'd better go
before he starts spraying you with lysol.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.223
Okay, well,
thank you for getting my mail.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.726
No, problem. Welcome home.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.561
[Can spraying]

02:29.399 --> 02:31.026
Sheldon: What?

03:02.766 --> 03:04.518
What the hell are you doing?

03:04.685 --> 03:08.563
I'm making petri dishes
to grow throat cultures.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.273
With lime jell-o?

03:10.440 --> 03:14.861
I need a growth medium, and someone
polished off the apricot yogurt.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.490
Here. Swab my throat.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.244
- I don't think so.
- Leonard.

03:22.411 --> 03:26.581
If I'm going to get ahead of this, I need
to find out what's growing in my throat.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.502
Sheldon, you are not sick.

03:30.669 --> 03:33.964
This is, but you are not.

03:34.423 --> 03:35.882
We have no idea what pathogen...

03:36.049 --> 03:38.635
Typhoid penny
has introduced into our environment.

03:38.802 --> 03:43.807
And having never been to Nebraska, I'm
certain I have no corn-husking antibodies.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.146
Sheldon, don't you think
you're overreacting?

03:49.312 --> 03:53.066
When I'm lying comatose in a hospital
relying on inferior minds to cure me...

03:53.233 --> 03:55.402
These cultures
and my accompanying notes...

03:55.569 --> 03:57.821
Will give them a fighting chance.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.702
I'm going back to bed.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.830
- Wait, put this in the bathroom.
- What for?

04:06.997 --> 04:09.166
I need to measure
my fluid intake and output...

04:09.332 --> 04:11.585
To make sure
my kidneys aren't shutting down.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.590
I mix pancake batter in this.

04:17.090 --> 04:20.302
No, that measuring cup
has always been for urine.

04:21.511 --> 04:24.222
You had time to make a label
for everything in this apartment...

04:24.389 --> 04:25.849
Including the label-maker...

04:26.016 --> 04:29.644
But you didn't have 10 seconds
to make one that said, "urine cup"?

04:31.188 --> 04:33.398
It's right here on the bottom.

04:40.405 --> 04:44.034
I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company
a letter of apology.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.246

05:29.538 --> 05:34.751
Leonard, my comforter fell down
and my sinuses hurt when I bend over.

Leonard?

05:53.645 --> 05:56.064
- Leonard: Hey.
- Leonard, where are you?

05:56.231 --> 05:58.191
I'm at work.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.569
At 6:30 in the morning?

06:03.113 --> 06:04.197
On Sunday?

06:06.992 --> 06:09.077
- â€”Why?
- They asked me to come in.

06:09.452 --> 06:13.623
- Well, I didn't hear the phone ring.
- They texted me.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.836
Well, as I predicted, I am sick.

06:18.003 --> 06:21.548
My fever has been tracking up
exponentially since 2 am...

06:21.715 --> 06:24.718
And I am producing sputum
at an alarming rate.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.095
[Sheldon coughing]

06:27.262 --> 06:30.140
- No kidding.
- Nope. Not only that...

06:30.307 --> 06:34.144
It has shifted from clear
to milky green.

06:34.311 --> 06:37.564
All right, well, get some rest
and drink plenty of fluids.

06:37.731 --> 06:42.569
What else would I drink?
Gases? Solids? Ionized plasma?

06:43.153 --> 06:44.487
Drink whatever you want.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.948
- I want soup.
- Then make soup.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.826
- We don't have soup.
- I'm at work, Sheldon.

- Yes.

- In the lab?
- Yes.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.882
They're training dogs
to operate the centrifuge...

07:04.049 --> 07:09.471
For when they need dogs to operate
the centrifuge for blind scientists.

- Well, who's calling at this ungodly hour?
- I don't know.

07:28.573 --> 07:32.702
Well, ask them why they're calling
at this ungodly hour.

when I'm talking to you?

- How could you've gotten it from me?

that if there were a way for me...

To have had soup at home,
I would have thought of it?

10:07.732 --> 10:09.109
You can have soup delivered.

- No, visiting professor.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.920
- Sorry.
- Okay.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.839
[Glasses breaking]

14:42.048 --> 14:43.257
Found them.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.842
[Music playing over speakers]

14:45.009 --> 14:47.970
- Oh, great.
- I'm sorry. Don't you have a spare?

14:48.137 --> 14:50.765
- Yeah, at home.
- If you leave now, you can be back...

14:50.932 --> 14:54.102
Before the gorillas whip
the crap out of charlton heston.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.311
Unless Sheldon's there.

14:55.478 --> 15:00.191
You'll be trapped forever
in his whiny, hyper-neurotic snot web.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.575
Hi, penny?

15:09.742 --> 15:13.162
I was just wondering,
is Sheldon still at the restaurant?

15:14.664 --> 15:17.250
Okay, that was very nice of you.
Okay, I gotta go.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.711
Got kind of a full-blown
chernobyl thing here. Gotta go, bye.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.423
He's home. I'm screwed.

15:26.175 --> 15:29.762
Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.473
How about Lasik?

15:33.599 --> 15:36.602
- You want me to get eye surgery?
- Would you rather go back...

15:36.769 --> 15:40.898
And deal with Sheldon or have a stranger
carve out your corneas with a laser beam?

15:43.276 --> 15:45.403
- Well?
- I'm thinking.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.991
Okay, nice and cozy.

15:50.408 --> 15:53.453
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Wait.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.498
Will you please rub this on my chest?

15:58.332 --> 16:00.501
Oh, Sheldon. Can't you do that yourself?

16:00.668 --> 16:04.005
Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.

16:04.672 --> 16:08.009
- But, Sheldon...
- Please, please, please.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.931
I can't believe I'm doing this.

16:19.854 --> 16:23.441
No, no. Counterclockwise,
or my chest hair mats.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.278
Sorry.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.447
[Sheldon sighs]

16:32.241 --> 16:34.952
Can you sing "soft kitty"?

16:36.579 --> 16:37.622
What?

16:37.788 --> 16:40.291
My mom used to sing it to me
when I was sick.

16:40.458 --> 16:43.503
- I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it.
- I'll teach you.

16:45.087 --> 16:48.633
[Singing] Soft kitty, warm kitty

16:48.799 --> 16:52.261
little ball of fur

16:53.596 --> 16:56.933
happy kitty, sleepy kitty

16:57.099 --> 17:00.102
purr, purr, purr

17:02.897 --> 17:04.524
now you.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.487
[Sighs]

17:09.946 --> 17:14.408
[Singing] Soft kitty, warm kitty

17:15.743 --> 17:18.704
little ball of fur

17:19.288 --> 17:20.998
keep rubbing.

17:22.792 --> 17:25.628
Little ball of fur

17:39.934 --> 17:41.894
What do you see? What do you see?
I can't...

17:42.061 --> 17:45.314
- Living room appears to be empty.
- Okay, he must be in his bedroom.

17:45.481 --> 17:50.903
My spare glasses are in my bedroom,
on my dresser, next to my bat signal.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.197
I'm not going in there.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.408
- Raj?
- No way, Jose.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.453
- But I can't do it. I can't see anything.
- It's all right.

17:59.620 --> 18:02.248
Wireless mini-cam
and Bluetooth headset.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.875
We'll be your eyes.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.878
- Fine.
- One more thing.

18:08.254 --> 18:12.592
This is a sub-Sonic impact sensor.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.969
If Sheldon gets out of bed
and starts to walk...

18:15.136 --> 18:17.763
This will register it
and send a signal to the laptop.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.726
At that point, based on the geography of
the apartment and the speed of Sheldon...

18:21.892 --> 18:25.438
You'll have seven seconds to get out,
glasses or no glasses.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.315
Won't my footsteps set it off?

18:27.481 --> 18:29.859
No. You'll be on your hands and knees.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.778
Now, you'll need to get the sensor
close to Sheldon's room.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.573
How do I carry it
if I'm on my hands and knees?

18:40.953 --> 18:42.413
Howard: Stay low.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.373
Bear left.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.584
- Now keep true.
- What?

18:46.751 --> 18:49.920
- It means go straight.
- Then just say, "go straight."

18:50.421 --> 18:54.258
You don't say, "go straight," when you're
giving bearings. You say, "keep true."

18:54.967 --> 18:56.636
All right.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.807
I just hit my head.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.352
Because you didn't keep true.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.357
Okay, turn right.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.984
The picture's breaking up.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.819
Angle your head to the right.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.947
Now, a little more.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.616
Little more.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.661
That's it. Now just keep true.

19:24.497 --> 19:28.292
All right, you're close enough
to Sheldon's room. Deploy the sensor.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.295
Now turn it on.

19:31.462 --> 19:34.006
- It wasn't on?
- No.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.133
Then why did I have to crawl?

19:37.551 --> 19:39.512
Oh, I guess you didn't.

19:42.723 --> 19:43.849
Okay, it's on.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.770
Good. From this point fonnard,
you will have to crawl.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.065
I know.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.026
[Beeping]

19:54.193 --> 19:55.903
Hang on,
the sensor's picking up something.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.780
Turn your head back.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.871
You rat bastard.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.583
Howard:
Told you the sensor would work.

20:12.086 --> 20:14.130
You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.632
Come on, I had to.
You see what he's like.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.468
Sheldon:
Penny? Penny, I'm hungry.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.804
It's okay, sweetie. Good news.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.723
- Leonard's home.
- No.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.475
- Here you go, good luck, bye.
- Oh, wait, wait.

20:26.642 --> 20:31.397
- Sheldon: Leonard? I'm hungry.
- Wait. Penny, take me with you.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.486
Sheldon: Leonard?

20:40.990 --> 20:42.867
I want grilled cheese.

21:01.343 --> 21:05.181
Do you think penny will come here
and take care of us?

21:06.098 --> 21:09.518
I don't think penny's
ever coming here again.

21:12.146 --> 21:15.024
I'm very congested.

21:18.027 --> 21:22.823
Can you go to the kitchen and get me
the Turkey baster labeled, "mucus"?

21:25.826 --> 21:28.954
If I stand, I'll vomit.

21:29.497 --> 21:32.500
Under the sink. Yellow tuppennare bowl.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.071
