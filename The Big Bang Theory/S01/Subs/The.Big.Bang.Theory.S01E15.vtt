WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:06.256
On the other hand, some physicists are
concerned that if this supercollider works...

00:06.423 --> 00:10.344
It'll create a black hole and swallow up
the earth, ending life as we know it.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.554
What a bunch of crybabies.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.973
No guts, no glory, man.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.934
Hey, check it out.

00:17.100 --> 00:20.103
The school of pharmacology
is looking for volunteers.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.773
"We are testing a new medication
for social anxiety...

00:22.940 --> 00:27.694
Panic attacks, agoraphobia
and obsessive-compulsive disorder."

00:28.570 --> 00:30.822
Why would they be looking
for test subjects here?

00:32.157 --> 00:33.450
I don't know, raj.

00:33.617 --> 00:36.954
Maybe the comic-book store
doesn't have a bulletin board.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.292
- What's going on?
- Shh! Hot girl in Sheldon's office.

00:43.585 --> 00:44.670
Sheldon's office?

00:46.755 --> 00:48.840
Is she lost?

00:49.299 --> 00:52.636
I don't think so.
I followed her here from the parking lot.

00:54.638 --> 00:58.433
- Maybe she's his lawyer.
- Well, she's free to examine my briefs.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.143
- Howard...
- I know, I'm disgusting.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.395
I should be punished.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.439
By her. Oh, look, I did it again.

01:04.606 --> 01:08.485
- Missy: Well, that should do it.
- Thank you for coming by.

01:15.617 --> 01:19.037
Oh, hey, buddy.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.457
Buddy?

01:22.624 --> 01:25.002
Sorry I'm late.
I'm working on a project...

01:25.168 --> 01:28.338
That may take me up
on the next space shuttle.

01:28.505 --> 01:31.383
Well, how can you be late?
I wasn't expecting you at all.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.677
Nobody ever expects me.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.847
Sometimes you just look,
and bam, Howard Wolowitz.

01:38.849 --> 01:42.394
- Sheldon, are you gonna introduce us?
- Oh, all right. This is missy.

01:42.561 --> 01:46.231
Missy, this is Leonard and rajesh,
and you've already met Howard.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.734
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too, as well also.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.739
So how do you two know each other?

01:54.281 --> 01:58.702
Oh, he once spent nine months
with my legs wrapped around his head.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.248
Excuse me?

02:03.415 --> 02:04.666
She's my twin sister.

02:04.833 --> 02:08.170
She thinks she's funny, but frankly,
I've never been able to see it.

02:08.337 --> 02:11.131
That's because you have
no measurable sense of humor, Shelly.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.800
How exactly would one measure
a sense of humor?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.094
A humormometer?

02:18.889 --> 02:22.267
Well, I think you're delightfully droll.
Or as the French say:

02:22.434 --> 02:24.144
[Speaks in French]

02:24.311 --> 02:28.774
Okay, so let me see if I got this.
Leonard, Howard and...

02:28.940 --> 02:31.234
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

02:57.844 --> 02:59.680
Rajesh.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.665
So, missy, what brings you
all the way from Texas?

03:26.832 --> 03:29.626
Was it perhaps destiny?
I think it was destiny.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.878
My friend's getting married at Disneyland.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.340
Destiny, thy name is anaheim.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.178
And I had to drop off some papers
for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.

03:40.345 --> 03:43.849
The papers could've been mailed. Mom
sent you here to spy on me, didn't she?

03:44.015 --> 03:46.309
I guess that's why
they call you a genius.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.146
They call me a genius
because I'm a genius.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.649
Tell mom
that I currently weigh 165 pounds...

03:52.816 --> 03:55.986
And that I'm having
regular bowel movements.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.863
Enjoy the wedding. Goodbye.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.990
- Whoa, whoa.
- Whoa, whoa.

04:00.824 --> 04:04.077
If the wedding's not till tomorrow,
why don't you stay with us tonight?

04:04.244 --> 04:07.205
Oh, I don't think so.
Shelly doesn't like company.

04:07.372 --> 04:11.168
Even as a little boy, he'd send his
imaginary friends home at the end of the day.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.755
They were not friends.
They were imaginary colleagues.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.049
Look, you're here,
and we have plenty of room.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.970
- No, we don't.
- Come on, Shelly, she's family.

04:22.137 --> 04:25.557
So what?
I don't issue invitations to your mother.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.894
It would be nice not to have to drive
to anaheim in rush hour.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.104
And don't ever call me Shelly.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.523
So it's settled. You'll stay with us.

04:33.690 --> 04:37.152
I'll walk you to your car.
You're in structure 3, level c, right?

04:40.906 --> 04:43.241
What just happened?

04:44.743 --> 04:46.369
So anyway, we're 8 years old...

04:46.536 --> 04:50.916
And Sheldon converts my easy-bake oven
to some kind of high-powered furnace.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.919
That's just classic.

04:54.336 --> 04:57.130
I needed a place to fire
ceramic semiconductor substrates...

04:57.297 --> 04:59.341
For homemade integrated circuits.

04:59.508 --> 05:03.220
He was trying to build some sort of
armed robot to keep me out of his room.

05:03.386 --> 05:07.057
Made necessary by her insistence
on going into my room.

05:07.224 --> 05:10.519
Anyway, I make those little muffins
they give you. There's a big flash.

05:10.685 --> 05:13.355
Next thing you know,
my eyebrows are gone.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.025
Not your eyebrows?

05:17.192 --> 05:19.528
Yep, I had to go through
the entire second grade...

05:19.694 --> 05:22.280
With crooked eyebrows
my mom drew on.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.449
Is that what that was? I just assumed...

05:24.616 --> 05:27.118
That the second-grade curriculum
had rendered you quizzical.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.204
[Knocking on door]

05:30.413 --> 05:34.751
Hey, Leonard, you left your undennear
in the drier downstairs.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.800
Those are not mine.

05:43.218 --> 05:46.763
Really? They have
your little name label in them.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.100
Oh, yeah, no, I use those...

05:50.267 --> 05:54.604
Just to Polish up
my spearfishing equipment.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.440
I spearfish.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.822
When I'm not crossbow hunting,
I spearfish.

06:06.491 --> 06:09.953
Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister.
Missy, this is our neighbor penny.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.163
- Hi.
- Wow, you don't look that much alike.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.875
Can I get a hallelujah?

06:15.584 --> 06:17.586
Fraternal twins
come from two separate eggs.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.963
They are no more alike
than any other siblings.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.007
Hallelujah.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.758
Hey, guess what.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.177
I've been accepted as a test subject
for a drug...

06:26.344 --> 06:28.513
To overcome pathological shyness.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.808
- Oh, good for you, raj.
- Yes, I'm very hopeful.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.602
Hello, missy.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.697
They mentioned
there may be side effects.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.326
So, missy...

06:49.492 --> 06:53.914
Have you ever met a man
from the exotic subcontinent of India?

06:54.497 --> 06:58.877
- Well, there's Dr. Patel at our church.
- Yes, patel. Good man.

06:59.044 --> 07:02.130
Do you like motorcycles?
Because I ride a hog.

07:02.797 --> 07:06.176
A hog? You have a two-cylinder scooter
with a basket in the front.

07:07.969 --> 07:11.306
You still have to wear a helmet.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.809
- Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?
- The sex book.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.937
The Indian sex book.

07:17.103 --> 07:20.815
In other words, if you wonder, wonder
who wrote the book of love...

07:20.982 --> 07:22.734
It was us.

07:24.069 --> 07:27.697
- So Sheldon's sister is pretty cute, huh?
- I wasn't staring.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.327
I didn't say you were.
I just said she was cute.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.954
Oh. Eh...

07:34.120 --> 07:38.416
Maybe. If you like women who are tall.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.211
And perfect.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.507
Sheldon,
why are you ignoring your sister?

07:45.674 --> 07:49.678
I'm not ignoring my sister.
I'm ignoring all of you.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.346
I brought snacks.

07:51.513 --> 07:55.016
Oh, my. Gherkins and...

07:55.517 --> 07:57.686
Onion dip. It's onion dip.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.732
We don't entertain much.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.278
Missy. Do you enjoy pajamas?

08:07.445 --> 08:10.657
- I guess.
- Yeah, we Indians invented them.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.034
You're welcome.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.997
Yeah, well,
my people invented circumcision.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.003
You're welcome.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.257
Missy, I'm gonna go get my nails done.
Do you wanna come?

08:27.424 --> 08:29.718
God, yes. Thanks.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.720
You're welcome.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.888
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, missy.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.223
Bye, missy, see you.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.601
- Goodbye, Leonard.
- Yeah, no, bye, penny.

08:40.145 --> 08:43.106
- You two have to back off.
- Why should I back off? You back off.

08:43.273 --> 08:46.443
Excuse me, this is my apartment,
and she's my roommate's sister.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.070
- So what? You've got penny.
- How do I have penny?

08:49.237 --> 08:51.281
In what universe do I have penny?

08:52.490 --> 08:54.951
- So I can have penny?
- Hell, no.

08:56.119 --> 08:59.080
Excuse me, can I interject something?

08:59.914 --> 09:03.168
I'm ordering pizza online.
Is everyone okay with pepperoni?

09:05.253 --> 09:08.506
- Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?
- I guess.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.342
Don't worry,
I was going to order you cheese-less.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.844
-Thank you. Sheldon: It's okay.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.972
Lactose intolerance
is nothing to be embarrassed about.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.810
[In Indian accent] I'm a fancy
Indian man. We invented pajamas.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.314
Hey, look at me, I don't have a foreskin.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.114
Sheldon.

09:35.033 --> 09:38.328
Are you aware that your sister
is an incredibly attractive woman?

09:41.122 --> 09:45.502
She has the symmetry and low body fat
that western culture deems desirable.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.962
It's noteworthy that at other points
in history...

09:48.129 --> 09:53.051
Heavier women were the standard for
beauty because girth suggested affluence.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.553
- That's fascinating...
- I didn't say fascinating.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.180
I said it was noteworthy.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.725
All right. Noted.

10:00.892 --> 10:04.521
But my point
is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz...

10:04.687 --> 10:08.566
They're hitting on your sister.
Ugh. It's...

10:09.484 --> 10:13.988
Oh. Okay. You know, I don't want
to criticize your rhetorical style...

10:14.155 --> 10:16.533
But we'd be further along
in this conversation...

10:16.699 --> 10:18.701
If you'd begun with that thought.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.453
That's great, but...

10:20.620 --> 10:23.706
We took quite a detour
from what I understand to be your thesis.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.458
Whatever.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.295
- You have to do something about it.
- —why?

10:29.462 --> 10:31.214
Because she's your sister.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.134
I don't understand.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.719
Yes, we shared a uterus
for nine months.

10:36.886 --> 10:40.098
But since then, we've pretty much gone
our own separate ways.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.268
Okay, consider this.

10:43.434 --> 10:47.021
With your father gone,
it is your responsibility...

10:47.188 --> 10:50.483
To make sure
that missy chooses a suitable mate.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.571
I hadn't considered that.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.867
So there is the possibility,
however remote...

10:59.033 --> 11:02.412
That resting in her loins
is the potential for another individual...

11:02.579 --> 11:05.373
As remarkable as myself.

11:05.540 --> 11:10.545
Exactly. And you owe it to yourself
and to posterity...

11:10.712 --> 11:14.591
To protect the genetic integrity
of your sister's future offspring.

11:16.593 --> 11:20.263
You're right. If someone wants
to get at missy's fallopian tubes...

11:20.430 --> 11:22.765
They'll have to go through me.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.230
[Laughing]

11:32.233 --> 11:36.237
I am Shiva, the destroyer.
I will have the woman.

11:37.113 --> 11:41.075
I'm warning you.
I was judo champion at math camp.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.494
All right.
That's enough juvenile squabbling.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.747
You stop it. You stop it, I say.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.125
I'm gonna settle this right now.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.753
Neither of you are good enough
for my sister.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.504
Who are you to decide that?

11:53.671 --> 11:56.382
He's the man of his family.
You have to respect his wishes.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.135
- You're out too, by the way.
- Say what?

11:59.302 --> 12:01.638
Nothing personal.
I'd prefer my niece or nephew...

12:01.804 --> 12:05.433
Didn't become flatulent
every time they ate an eskimo pie.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.567
- What are you so happy about?
- I'm not happy.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.737
It's the medication. I can't stop smiling.

12:24.911 --> 12:28.164
Now that Leonard's made me aware
of how high the genetic stakes are...

12:28.331 --> 12:31.668
We have to face the fact that
none of you are suitable for my sister.

12:31.834 --> 12:35.421
Wait a minute,
Leonard made you aware of that?

12:36.339 --> 12:38.800
We all make mistakes. Let's move on.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.970
Excuse me, but I think you're missing
a big opportunity here.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.305
- How so?
- Everybody knows genetic diversity...

12:44.472 --> 12:46.307
Produces the strongest offspring.

12:46.474 --> 12:50.061
Why not put a little mocha
in the family latte?

12:52.647 --> 12:54.232
In principle, you have a point.

12:54.399 --> 12:58.361
But as a practical matter, need I remind
you it takes experimental pharmaceuticals...

12:58.528 --> 13:02.115
To simply enable you
to speak to the opposite sex?

13:02.323 --> 13:06.035
I think you're focusing
entirely too much on the drugs.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.542
Is it because I'm Jewish?

13:12.709 --> 13:16.212
Because I'd kill my rabbi with a pork chop
to be with your sister.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.512
This has nothing to do with religion.

13:24.679 --> 13:27.140
This has to do with the fact
that you're a tiny man...

13:27.307 --> 13:29.350
Who still lives with his mother.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.563
- Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.
- Am I?

13:34.022 --> 13:37.817
Here. Eat this cheese without farting,
and you can sleep with my sister.

13:39.444 --> 13:40.987
Missy: Oh, really?

13:45.033 --> 13:46.576
Oops.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.580
Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute?
Alone.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.083
Why does everyone
suddenly wanna talk to me alone?

13:54.250 --> 13:57.253
Usually nobody wants
to be alone with me.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.470
We all make mistakes. Let's move on.

14:07.138 --> 14:08.556
Okay.

14:08.723 --> 14:12.310
I'm not even gonna ask
why you're pimping me out for cheese...

14:13.144 --> 14:16.397
But since when do you care at all
about who I sleep with?

14:16.564 --> 14:18.733
Truthfully,
I've never given it any thought...

14:18.900 --> 14:22.445
But it has been pointed out to me
that you carry DNA of great potential.

14:22.612 --> 14:25.365
- What on earth are you talking about?
- Let me explain.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.951
You see,
I'm a superior genetic mutation...

14:29.118 --> 14:31.954
An improvement
on the existing mediocre stock.

14:33.748 --> 14:36.417
And what do you mean,
"mediocre stock"?

14:36.584 --> 14:37.668
That would be you.

14:39.253 --> 14:42.507
But residing within you
is the potential for another me.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.885
Perhaps even taller, smarter
and less prone to freckling.

14:46.052 --> 14:49.555
A Sheldon 2.0, if you will.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.892
- Sheldon 2.0?
- Exactly.

14:53.059 --> 14:56.813
Now, I am not saying that I should be
the sole decider of who you mate with.

14:56.979 --> 15:00.525
If you're not attracted, then the
likelihood of conception will be reduced.

15:00.691 --> 15:03.152
- You have got to be kidding me.
- Not at all.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.614
Frequent coitus dramatically increases
the odds of fertilization.

15:07.782 --> 15:10.701
Okay, Shelly, sit down.

15:13.204 --> 15:16.833
Now, I've lived my whole life dealing
with the fact that my twin brother is...

15:16.999 --> 15:20.962
As mom puts it,
one of god's special little people.

15:21.838 --> 15:24.173
I always thought
I was more like a cuckoo bird.

15:24.340 --> 15:28.386
A superior creature whose egg is placed
in the nest of ordinary birds.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.638
The newly hatched cuckoo
eats all the food...

15:30.805 --> 15:33.850
Leaving the ordinary siblings
to starve to death.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.228
Luckily for you,
that's where the metaphor ended.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.065
I thought it ended at cuckoo.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.735
Now, you listen to me.

15:44.902 --> 15:48.156
If you wanna start acting like a brother
who cares about me, terrific.

15:48.531 --> 15:49.991
Bring it on.

15:50.158 --> 15:53.077
But you try one time to tell me
who I should be sleeping with...

15:53.244 --> 15:58.040
And you and I are gonna go round the way
we did when we were little. Remember?

16:01.544 --> 16:03.838
- I have an alternate proposal.
- Go on.

16:04.505 --> 16:07.550
You donate eggs.
We will place them in cryogenic storage.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.636
I will find an appropriate sperm donor
for your eggs...

16:10.803 --> 16:13.306
Have them fertilized
and implanted in you.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.765
That way, everybody wins.

16:24.233 --> 16:28.070
Correction.
Missy can date whoever she wants.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.366
- Look, we have to settle this.
- I agree.

16:32.533 --> 16:36.162
Sheldon's sister is hiding at penny's
because we've all been hitting on her.

16:36.329 --> 16:40.625
She's not hiding. She needed to call her
grandmother, who's apparently very sick.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.544
Oh, and then I believe
she has to wash her hair.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.797
Oh, you poor deluded bastard.

16:46.964 --> 16:49.175
- Don't start with me, dude.
- You wanna go again?

16:49.342 --> 16:51.302
- Sit down.
- Okay.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.847
If we're gonna fight over missy,
let's do it the right way.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.516
The honorable way.

16:56.724 --> 16:57.934
Howard: Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.852
Leonard: Take that.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.729

17:04.065 --> 17:05.942

17:17.954 --> 17:20.331
Yeah! Natural selection at work.

17:20.498 --> 17:22.792
I weep for humanity.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.295
Excuse me
while I go tell missy the good news.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.303
- Hey.
- Hi, penny, how's it going?

17:34.470 --> 17:37.181
That guy Mike that you were dating,
is that still going on?

17:37.348 --> 17:39.016
- Pretty much, why?
- Just catching up.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.561
By the way,
may I speak to missy, please?

17:42.812 --> 17:44.897
Of course.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.149
Hi, Leonard, what's up?

17:47.316 --> 17:51.404
Well, since you're leaving, I was wondering
if you'd like to go to dinner with me.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.656
That's so sweet. But no, thanks.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.495
- Do you have other plans or...?
- No.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.542
All right.

18:05.918 --> 18:10.006
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Thanks, I'll see you.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.515
Um, here's something
we didn't anticipate.

18:25.021 --> 18:29.734
- What do you want, Howard?
- I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.194
I've come to call on missy.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.114
Missy.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.910
- Hi, Howard.
- The amazing Howard.

18:40.703 --> 18:43.372
- Do you like magic?
- Not really, no.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.667
Then you are in for a treat.

is your medication wearing off?

Well, hi, cutie pie.
I was hoping you'd show up.

who made a noise like that.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.306
Any news you want me
to pass along to mom?

20:24.473 --> 20:27.810
Well, she might be interested to know
that I've refocused my research...

20:27.977 --> 20:31.021
From bosonic string theory
to heterotic string theory.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.316
Yeah, I'll just tell her you said, "hey."

20:36.152 --> 20:38.612
Okay. Well, it was pleasant seeing you.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.702
Come on, Shelly.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.085
I want you to know
I'm very proud of you.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.503
- Really?
- Yep.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.674
I'm always bragging to my friends
about my brother, the rocket scientist.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.844
You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?

21:03.012 --> 21:06.098
- Well, yeah.
- I'm a theoretical physicist.
