00:02.753 --> 00:04.421
Okay.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.257
The x tens are online.

00:07.424 --> 00:13.388
Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal
from this laptop through our local isp...

00:13.555 --> 00:17.017
Racing down fiber-optic cable
at the speed of light to San Francisco...

00:17.184 --> 00:20.521
Bouncing off a satellite in
geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.815
Data packets will be handed off
to submerged transatlantic cables...

00:23.982 --> 00:25.901
Terminating in halifax, Nova Scotia...

00:26.068 --> 00:29.738
And transferred across the continent
via microwave relays back to our isp...

00:29.905 --> 00:32.115
And the external receiver attached
to this...

00:33.116 --> 00:34.535
Lamp.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.164
Look at me, look at me,
I've got goose bumps.

00:39.331 --> 00:42.251
- Are we ready on the stereo?
- Go for stereo.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.211
[Mouse clicks]

00:44.378 --> 00:47.381
[2001: A space odyssey's "main title"
plays over speakers]

00:50.342 --> 00:52.344
[Leonard humming]

00:53.762 --> 00:55.764
[All humming]

00:57.307 --> 00:59.309
[All imitating drums]

01:03.814 --> 01:06.483
- Hey, guys.
- Leonard & Sheldon: Hello.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.110
It's a little loud.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.487
No problem. Turning it down.

01:10.654 --> 01:13.824
San Francisco, Lisbon, halifax:

01:13.991 --> 01:15.409
Voila.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.618
Okay, thanks.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.288
Hang on, hang on.
Do you not realize what we just did?

01:19.538 --> 01:21.873
Yeah, you turned your stereo down
with your laptop.

01:22.040 --> 01:26.962
No, we turned our stereo down by sending
a signal around the world via the Internet.

01:27.170 --> 01:30.299
Oh. Get one of those
universal remotes at radioshack.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.050
They're really cheap.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.927
No. You don't get it.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.638
Howard, enable public access.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.307
Public access enabled.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.563
- Boy, that's terrific, but I'll see you.
- No, hang on.

01:46.732 --> 01:47.774
[All gasp]

01:51.862 --> 01:54.156
Someone in sichuan province, China...

01:54.323 --> 01:58.076
Is using his computer
to turn our lights on and off.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.579
Huh. Well, that's handy.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.707
Um, here's a question. Why?

02:05.292 --> 02:06.960
All: Because we can.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.088
Oh! They found the remote-control cars.

02:13.342 --> 02:16.762
- But wait, wait, what's on top of them?
- Wireless webcams. Wave hello.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.223
The monster truck
is out of Austin, Texas...

02:20.390 --> 02:24.269
And the blue viper is being operated
from suburban Tel Aviv.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.607
You may wanna put on slacks.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.067
What?

02:31.943 --> 02:36.114
Ew! Stop it. No. Leave me alone.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.367
[Door slams]

02:38.575 --> 02:41.745
- Who's running the red corvette?
- That would be me.

03:06.395 --> 03:09.690
You know, in the future,
when we're disembodied brains in jars...

03:09.856 --> 03:13.402
We're going to look back on this
as eight hours well wasted.

03:14.444 --> 03:18.907
I don't wanna be in a jar.
I want my brain in an Android body.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.618
Eight feet tall and ripped.

03:22.494 --> 03:26.873
I'm with you. I just have to make sure if
I'm a synthetic human, I'd still be Jewish.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.585
I promised my mother.

03:32.379 --> 03:36.758
I suppose you could have
your Android penis circumcised.

03:37.801 --> 03:41.138
That's something your rabbi would have
to discuss with the manufacturer.

03:41.596 --> 03:44.975
Not to mention
you'd have to power down on Saturdays.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.478
Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?

03:48.645 --> 03:50.480
Well, there's always the possibility...

03:50.647 --> 03:53.483
That a trash can spontaneously
formed around the letter...

03:54.109 --> 03:57.529
But ockham's razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.990
It's from the institute
for experimental physics.

04:00.157 --> 04:03.326
They want us to present our
paper on the properties of supersolids...

04:03.493 --> 04:06.163
At the topical conference
on bose-Einstein condensates.

04:06.329 --> 04:09.332
I know. I read it before I threw it out.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.294
Okay, if I may drill down
to the bedrock of my question...

04:12.461 --> 04:13.754
Why did you throw it out?

04:13.920 --> 04:17.799
Because I have no interest in standing in
the Rose room of the Pasadena marriott...

04:17.966 --> 04:20.218
In front of a group
ofjudgmental strangers...

04:20.385 --> 04:24.473
Who wouldn't recognize genius if it were
standing in front of them giving a speech.

04:24.639 --> 04:27.100
Which, if I were there, it would be.

04:27.809 --> 04:28.852
I don't know, Sheldon.

04:29.019 --> 04:32.814
Those topical conference on bose-Einstein
condensates parties are legendary.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.316
Forget the parties.

04:34.483 --> 04:37.444
Forget the parties? What a nerd.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.864
Any other honors I've gotten
that I don't know about?

04:41.031 --> 04:43.992
Did ups drop off a nobel prize
with my name on it?

04:44.159 --> 04:47.662
Leonard, don't take this the wrong way,
but the day you win a nobel prize...

04:47.829 --> 04:52.459
Is the day I begin my research on the drag
coefficient of tassels on flying carpets.

04:53.126 --> 04:57.047
Ha, ha, ha. The only thing missing from
that insult was your mama.

04:57.964 --> 05:01.301
I got one. Hey, Leonard, your mama's
research methodology is so flawed...

05:01.468 --> 05:03.220
Shut up, Howard.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.972
- Sheldon, we have to do this.
- No, we don't.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.350
We have to take in nourishment,
expel waste...

05:08.517 --> 05:11.144
And inhale enough oxygen
to keep our cells from dying.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.313
Everything else is optional.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.565
Okay, let me put it this way: I'm doing it.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.818
You can't. I'm the lead author.

05:17.984 --> 05:21.780
Come on, the only reason you're the lead
author is because we went alphabetically.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.865
I let you think we went alphabetically...

05:24.032 --> 05:26.827
To spare you dealing
with the fact that it was my idea.

05:26.993 --> 05:30.497
Not to put too fine a point on it,
but I was throwing you a bone.

05:30.914 --> 05:32.249
You're welcome.

05:32.415 --> 05:35.836
Excuse me, I designed the experiment
that proved the hypothesis.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.420
It doesn't need proving.

05:37.587 --> 05:41.341
So the entire scientific community
is just supposed to just take your word?

05:41.508 --> 05:44.261
They're not supposed to,
but they should.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.637
I don't care what you say.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.265
I'm going to the conference,
presenting our findings.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.599
And I forbid it.

05:51.142 --> 05:52.352
You forbid it?

05:52.519 --> 05:55.397
If I'm not taking credit for our work,
then nobody is.

05:55.564 --> 06:00.151
- So you admit that it's our work?
- No, once again, I'm throwing you a bone.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.946
And once again, you are welcome.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.448
[Scoffs]

06:05.907 --> 06:08.243
Oh, no, he didn't.

06:11.162 --> 06:14.291
So how's it going with Sheldon?
Are you guys still not talking?

06:14.457 --> 06:17.460
Not only is he still not talking to me,
but he does this thing...

06:17.627 --> 06:20.630
Where he stares at you
and tries to get your brain to explode.

06:21.882 --> 06:25.427
You know,
like in the classic Sci-Fi movie scanners?

06:25.594 --> 06:26.928
Like: Bzz-phew!

06:28.680 --> 06:29.723
Never mind.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.058
How about this one?

06:32.225 --> 06:35.228
It says, "I know my physics,
but I'm still a fun guy."

06:36.646 --> 06:39.524
Oh, I didn't know
they still made corduroy suits.

06:39.691 --> 06:42.277
They don't. That's why I saved this one.

06:42.736 --> 06:46.072
Okay, well,
let's just see what else you have.

06:46.239 --> 06:51.286
Okay, here.
Take this and this and this...

06:51.453 --> 06:53.914
- And these.
- Is this stuff you want me to try on?

06:54.080 --> 06:56.791
No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.

06:56.958 --> 07:00.962
Seriously, don't even give it to charity.
You won't be helping anyone.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.214
What's this?

07:03.381 --> 07:05.842
That's the bottle city of Kandor.

07:08.678 --> 07:12.641
You see, Kandor was the capital city
of the planet Krypton.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.477
It was miniaturized by brainiac
before Krypton exploded...

07:15.644 --> 07:17.437
And then rescued by Superman.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.066
Oh, nice.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.361
It's a lot cooler
when girls aren't looking at it.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.782
Here, why don't you put these on
while I find a shirt and sport coat?

07:28.949 --> 07:31.618
- Great, be right back.
- Where are you going? Put them on.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.621
- Here?
- Oh, are you shy?

07:34.788 --> 07:37.040
- No, I'm not shy.
- Don't worry, I won't look.

07:37.207 --> 07:40.543
I know you won't. Why would you look?
There's nothing to see. Not noth...

07:40.710 --> 07:43.505
- Sweetie, put the pants on.
- I'm gonna put them on.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.926
So, you know, isn't there some way
you and Sheldon could compromise...

07:48.093 --> 07:49.511
On this presentation thing?

07:49.678 --> 07:52.389
No, no. Scientists do not compromise.

07:52.555 --> 07:56.393
Our minds are trained to synthesize facts
and come to inarguable conclusions.

07:56.893 --> 08:00.772
Not to mention,
Sheldon is bat-crap crazy.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.401
What is this?

08:04.567 --> 08:06.695
Oh, careful.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.739
That's my original series
Battlestar Galactica flight suit.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.076
Oh, why didn't you wear it
on Halloween?

08:13.243 --> 08:16.329
Because it's not a costume.
It's a flight suit.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.834
Okay, all right. Moving on.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.169
Oh, wow, a Paisley shirt.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.171
Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.

08:26.381 --> 08:30.343
If you mean it should end up
in the same place, then I agree.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.179
Is this your only tie?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.140
Ah, technically, yes.

08:35.306 --> 08:39.936
But if you'll notice, it's reversible.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.897
So it works as two.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.692
Oh, sweetie,
I don't even think it works as one.

08:47.610 --> 08:51.072
- Is this all your clothes?
- Yup, everything since the eighth grade.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.241
The eighth grade?

08:53.408 --> 08:55.201
My last growth spurt.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.622
Okay, well,
guess we're back to the corduroy suit.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.958
- Great.
- Yup.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.545
I said no. Put it down.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.091
[Keys jingling]

09:11.134 --> 09:13.219
Hey, Sheldon.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.472
Hello, penny.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.308
Get anything good?

09:19.809 --> 09:22.896
Just the latest copy
of applied particle physics quarterly.

09:23.313 --> 09:27.400
Oh, you know, that is so weird
that yours came and mine didn't.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.448
It was a joke.

09:38.244 --> 09:42.290
Yup. Tip your waitresses.
I'm here all week.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.543
To save you from further awkwardness...

09:45.710 --> 09:49.506
Know that I'm comfortable with the
two of us climbing the stairs in silence.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.966
Oh, yeah, okay, me too. Zip it, lock it.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.763
Put it in your pocket.

10:00.683 --> 10:03.561
- So you and Leonard...
- Oh, dear god.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.647
Little misunderstanding, huh?

10:05.814 --> 10:07.232
A little misunderstand...?

10:07.398 --> 10:11.319
Galileo and the pope
had a little misunderstanding.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.282
Anyway, I was talking
to Leonard this morning...

10:16.449 --> 10:18.701
And I think he feels
really bad about it.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.203
Sheldon: Huh.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.539
Well, how do you feel?

10:23.039 --> 10:25.333
I don't understand the question.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.754
Well, I'm just asking if it's difficult
to be fighting with your best friend.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.715
Oh, I hadn't thought about it like that.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.927
I wonder if I've been experiencing
physiological manifestations...

10:36.094 --> 10:39.430
Of some sort
of unconscious emotional turmoil.

10:39.848 --> 10:40.890
Penny: Wait, what?

10:41.057 --> 10:43.560
I couldn't poop this morning.

10:47.438 --> 10:50.483
You should just talk to him.
I'm sure you guys can work this out.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.736
- It's certainly preferable to my plan.
- Which was?

10:53.903 --> 10:56.072
A powerful laxative.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.409
Okay, so you absolutely
should talk to him.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.369
I know Leonard values you as a friend.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.413
He told me without your little idea...

11:03.580 --> 11:07.041
There was no way he could've come up
with this whole experiment thing.

11:10.253 --> 11:11.921
Excuse me. Little idea?

11:12.088 --> 11:15.133
Yeah, he tried to explain it to me.
I didn't really understand it...

11:15.300 --> 11:18.261
Of course you didn't.
He said "little idea"?

11:18.428 --> 11:21.472
Oh. Well, no.
I mean, not in those words...

11:21.639 --> 11:23.516
In what words, then, exactly?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.185
The exact words aren't really...

11:25.351 --> 11:27.729
- It's more the spirit in which...
- What did he say?

11:27.896 --> 11:29.189
You had a lucky hunch.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.359
I've been thinking.
Instead of arguing about this, why...?

11:33.526 --> 11:36.070
Don't you ever speak to me again.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.324
What...?

11:40.950 --> 11:43.077
Oh, he:

11:54.505 --> 11:56.883
Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.

11:57.050 --> 12:01.221
- Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch."
- Sheldon, I didn't mean it like that.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.014
- Why did you say it?
- I don't know...

12:03.181 --> 12:05.975
- Were you trying to impress penny?
- No, no, not at all.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.644
A little bit.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.979
How did that work out for you?

12:10.146 --> 12:11.397
Leonard, ready to go?

12:11.564 --> 12:14.859
Libido, one. Truth, zero.

12:16.611 --> 12:17.904
I'm gonna ask one more time.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.782
We did the work together,
let's present the paper together.

12:20.949 --> 12:25.870
And I'm telling you for the last time, it's
pandering, it's undignified, and bite me.

12:27.747 --> 12:28.998
Let's go.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.084
- Bye, Sheldon.
- Goodbye, penny.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.928
[Grunts]

12:42.095 --> 12:44.305
One of these days: Phew!

12:47.308 --> 12:48.351
There you go.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.395
You're right, this side does look better.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.856
No, no, I didn't say better,
I said less stained.

12:55.149 --> 12:58.236
I just checked the house.
There's probably 20, 25 people in there.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.862
- You're kidding.
- Is that all?

13:00.029 --> 13:04.033
All? In particle physics, 25 is Woodstock.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.620
Oh. Well, then, good.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.956
I wasn't expecting such a crowd.
I'm nervous.

13:10.123 --> 13:14.460
- It's okay. Open with a joke, you'll be fine.
- Okay, joke. Okay.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.046
How about this? Um, okay.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.383
There's this farmer,
and he has these chickens...

13:20.550 --> 13:22.051
But they won't lay any eggs.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.887
So he calls a physicist to help.

13:25.054 --> 13:30.101
The physicist then does some calculations
and he says:

13:30.268 --> 13:35.898
"I have a solution, but it only works
for spherical chickens in a vacuum."

13:36.065 --> 13:38.109
[All laughing]

13:38.693 --> 13:39.736
Right?

13:43.906 --> 13:46.409
Oh, sorry, I just... I've heard it before.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.369
- Let's roll.
- Okay.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.205
- Hey, nice suit.
- It's a classic, right?

13:51.748 --> 13:55.001
I really should've brought my own car.

13:56.753 --> 14:01.132
So in conclusion, the data show that at
temperatures approaching absolute zero...

14:01.299 --> 14:04.761
The moment of inertia changes
and the solid becomes a supersolid...

14:04.927 --> 14:09.766
Which clearly appears to be a previously
unknown state of matter.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.809
[Audience applauding]

14:11.976 --> 14:13.561
Thank you.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.942
- Are there any questions?
- Man: Yeah.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.653
What the hell was that?

14:24.781 --> 14:25.990
Any other questions?

14:26.532 --> 14:30.703
Dr. Sheldon Cooper here. I am the
lead author of this particular paper.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.415
Thank you.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.127
And you, sir, you have completely
skipped over the part...

14:38.294 --> 14:40.213
Where I was walking through
the park...

14:40.380 --> 14:42.632
And I saw these children
on a merry-go-round...

14:42.799 --> 14:45.510
Which started me thinking
about the moment of inertia...

14:45.676 --> 14:48.763
In gasses like helium at temperatures
approaching absolute zero.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.599
I didn't skip it.
It's just an anecdote. It's not science.

14:51.766 --> 14:54.769
Oh, I see. It was the apple falling
on Newton's head.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.187
Was that just an anecdote?

14:56.354 --> 14:58.564
- You are not Isaac Newton.
- No, no, that's true.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.484
Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.236
You cannot be that arrogant.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.030
You continue to underestimate me,
my good man.

15:06.197 --> 15:10.159
If you weren't happy with my presentation,
then maybe you should've given it with me.

15:10.326 --> 15:14.539
As I've explained repeatedly, unlike you,
I don't need validation from lesser minds.

15:14.705 --> 15:17.041
- No offense.
- Really? So why did you come?

15:17.208 --> 15:19.919
- Because I knew you'd screw this up.
- I didn't screw it up.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.256
Oh, please. I admit,
that spherical-chicken joke was hilarious.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.675
- Thank you.
- It was straight downhill from there.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.802
I've had enough of your condescension.

15:27.969 --> 15:30.680
Maybe I didn't go to college
when I was 11, like you.

15:30.847 --> 15:34.183
Maybe I got my doctorate at 24
instead of 16.

15:34.350 --> 15:38.354
But you are not the only person who
is smarter than everyone else in this room.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.857
No offense.

15:41.065 --> 15:45.027
And I am clearly not the only person
who is tormented by insecurity...

15:45.194 --> 15:47.447
And has an ego
in need of constant validation.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.533
- So you admit you're an egotist.
- Yes.

15:51.409 --> 15:54.620
My name is Dr. Leonard hofstadter.
I could never please my parents...

15:54.787 --> 15:57.039
So I need to get my self-esteem
from strangers.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.291
But he's worse!

15:58.458 --> 16:00.001
Okay, that is it.

16:00.168 --> 16:01.878
Stop it.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.257
You cannot blow up my head
with your mind.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.384
Then I'll settle for an aneurism.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.303
- Stop it.
- You hit me.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.721
You saw that. He hit me.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.223
- You tried to blow up my head.
- So it was working.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.476
It wasn't... it was not...
You are a nutcase.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.979
We'll see. Heads up, you people
in the front row. This is a splash zone.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.898
Stop it. Stop it.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.900
Quit it.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.361
[Both grunting]

16:28.946 --> 16:31.574
Is this usually
how these physics things go?

16:31.741 --> 16:34.076
More often than you'd think.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.247
Hit you with a vulcan nerve pinch.

16:38.414 --> 16:39.874
- No pinches. No...!
- No!

16:40.041 --> 16:41.459
[Lock clicking]

16:49.592 --> 16:52.303
You could have offered me a ride home.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.765
You're lucky I didn't run you over.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.184
I don't understand
what you're unhappy about.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.854
You begged me to come, I came.
There's just no pleasing you.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.649
You're right. I'm the problem,
the one that needs help.

17:04.815 --> 17:07.777
Well, that's not much of an apology,
but I'll take it.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.112
Excuse me.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.199
Is there anything you'd like
to apologize for?

17:15.701 --> 17:18.621
I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head.

17:19.956 --> 17:21.791
It was uncalled for.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.459
You won't believe this.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.879
Somebody got the whole thing
on their cell phone and put it on YouTube.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.798
What?

17:29.715 --> 17:32.927
- Now, who would do that?
- That would be me.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.471
Check it out. It's a featured video.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.306
You hit me. You saw that. He hit me.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.725
- You tried to blow up my head.
- 80 it was working.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.436
- It was not... you are a nutcase.
- We'll see about that.

17:42.603 --> 17:46.107
You people in the front row, heads up.
This is a splash zone.

17:46.732 --> 17:50.403
Stop it. Quit it. Quit it.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.655
[Both grunting]

17:52.822 --> 17:56.117
- Hit you with a vulcan nerve pinch.
- No pinches. No...!

17:56.742 --> 17:59.161
You should clip your fingernails.
Those hurt.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.330
Oh, jeez.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.958
Does this suit really look that bad?

18:04.125 --> 18:06.002
Forget your suit.
Look at my arms waving.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.713
I'm like a flamingo on ritalin.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.175
Howard, would you like
to explain to me...

18:13.384 --> 18:17.179
Why your Facebook page has a picture
of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned:

18:17.346 --> 18:19.015
"Me and my girlfriend"?

18:20.349 --> 18:23.561
Uh-oh, here comes the talk.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.655
- He hit me.
- You tried to blow up my head.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.450
- So it was working.
- It was not... you are a nutcase.
