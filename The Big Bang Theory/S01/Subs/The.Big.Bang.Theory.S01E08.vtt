00:10.761 --> 00:13.764
Damn you, walletnook.Com.

00:14.765 --> 00:15.766
Problem?

00:15.933 --> 00:18.227
The online description
was completely misleading.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.854
They said eight slots plus removable ID.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.941
To any rational person,
that would mean room for nine cards.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.944
But they don't tell you,
the removable ID takes up one slot.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.029
It's a nightmare.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.198
Okay, now, do you really need...

00:31.365 --> 00:34.952
The honorary justice league
of america membership card?

00:35.452 --> 00:38.622
It's been in every wallet
I've owned since I was 5.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.290
Why?

00:40.457 --> 00:43.627
It says, "keep this on your person
at all times."

00:43.794 --> 00:44.836
[Knock on door]

00:45.003 --> 00:46.922
It's right here, under Batman's signature.

00:48.507 --> 00:52.135
And this is Leonard
and Sheldon's apartment.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.888
[Chuckles]
Guess whose parents just got broadband.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.976
Leonard, may I present, live from new
Delhi, Dr. and Mrs. V. M. Koothrappali?

01:00.352 --> 01:02.813
Tilt up the camera.
I'm looking at his crotch.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.314
Sorry, papa.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.733
- Oh, that's much better. Hi.
- Hi.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.529
- And over here is Sheldon.
- Sheldon: Hi.

01:10.696 --> 01:11.822
He lives with Leonard.

01:11.989 --> 01:15.075
Oh, that's nice. Like haroon and tanvir.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.827
No, not like haroon and tanvir.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.554
Mrs. Koothrappali:
Such sweet young men.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.540
They just adopted
the cutest little punjabi baby.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.751
Yeah. No, we're not
like haroon and tanvir.

01:25.210 --> 01:28.005
- So are you boys academics like our son?
- Yes.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.924
Your parents are comfortable
with limited earning potential?

01:31.091 --> 01:32.593
- Oh, yes.
- Not at all.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.344
Papa, please don't start.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.638
What? It's just a question.
He's so sensitive.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.266
That's my life, my friends.
Good to see you. Say bye.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.475
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.227
Dr. Koothrappali: Wait, wait.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.522
Before you go, we have good news.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.692
Put the computer down
and gather your friends.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.699
- What is it, papa?
- I don't see your friends.

01:58.035 --> 02:02.539
Is it just me or does web-chatting with
your clothes on seem a little pointless?

02:02.706 --> 02:05.792
Rajesh, do you remember lalita gupta?

02:05.959 --> 02:09.713
The little fat girl that used to kick me
in the samosas and call me untouchable?

02:09.880 --> 02:12.966
Yes. Well, now she's
a dental student at usc...

02:13.133 --> 02:15.302
So we gave her
your contact information.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.095
Why did you do that?

02:17.262 --> 02:19.890
You're 26 years old, rajesh.
We want grandchildren.

02:20.057 --> 02:23.894
- But, papa, I'm not supposed...
- Lalita's parents approved the match.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.980
If you decide on a spring wedding,
we can avoid monsoon season.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.815
A spring wedding?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.859
It's up to you. We don't want to meddle.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.278
If you don't want to meddle,
why are you meddling?

02:33.445 --> 02:35.530
Your parents
don't consider this meddling.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.949
While arranged marriages
are no longer the norm...

02:38.116 --> 02:41.870
Indian parents continue to have an
involvement in their children's love lives.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.748
Why are you telling me
about my own culture?

02:45.540 --> 02:46.833
You seemed confused.

02:48.627 --> 02:52.631
- Sorry, but with all due respect, I don't...
- I'm sorry, darling. We have to go.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.508
Doogie howser is on.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.761
Grandma, it's doogie time.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.680
- Bye-b ye.
- Bye-b ye.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.393
I don't believe it.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.438
Doogie howser's been off the air
for like 20 years.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.943
Actually, I read that it's one of
the most popular programs in India.

03:13.110 --> 03:17.322
Might speak to a cultural aspiration to have
one's children enter the medical profession.

03:17.698 --> 03:18.818
Leonard: I bet you're right.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.118
- I bet they love scrubs.
- What's not to love?

03:21.284 --> 03:22.786
Excuse me, hello?

03:23.036 --> 03:26.498
My parents are trying to marry me off
to a stranger. What am I going to do?

03:26.957 --> 03:29.668
- I suggest you go through with it.
- What?

03:29.835 --> 03:34.256
Romantic love as the basis for marriage
has only existed since the 19th century.

03:34.423 --> 03:38.301
Up until then, arranged marriages were
the norm and it served society quite well.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.387
It's the premise of Fiddler on the roof.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.432
I'm not a big fan of musicals,
but I love that show.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.934
Me too. Of course,
it speaks to me culturally.

03:46.101 --> 03:50.480
Understandable, but there's a universality
to that story which transcends ethnicity.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.066
Let's not forget
it's got some really catchy tunes.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.776
-Oh, yeah. —absolutely.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.570
- I know what I'm gonna do.
- What?

03:56.737 --> 03:58.155
Find new friends.

04:00.615 --> 04:03.243
[Door opens, closes]

04:04.244 --> 04:07.581
- So who wants to rent Fiddler?
- No need. We have the special edition.

04:10.125 --> 04:13.170
Well, maybe we are like
haroon and tanvir.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.446
This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.240
Yeah, I need to cancel my membership
to the planetarium.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.409
[Laughing noiselessly]

04:44.993 --> 04:46.536
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too...

04:46.703 --> 04:49.706
But there's just no room
for you in my wallet.

04:51.541 --> 04:55.212
No, I understand, but it was between
you and the museum of natural history...

04:55.378 --> 04:57.756
And frankly, you don't have dinosaurs.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.885
Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-bye.

05:02.886 --> 05:06.473

and I'd really like you to stop.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.064
I thought you were finding new friends.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.066
I've got some feelers out.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.568
In the meantime, listen to this.

[On recording]
Hi, rajesh, this is lalita gupta.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.324
Your mother gave my mother
your phone number to give to me.

05:24.491 --> 05:28.912
So I'm calling you and call me back.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.458
Can you believe how pushy she is?

05:35.710 --> 05:37.128
So don't call her.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.589
If I don't call her,
I won't hear the end of it.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.884
- So call her.
- How can I call her? I can't talk to women.

05:43.552 --> 05:44.761
I'm done. Anybody else?

05:44.928 --> 05:45.929
[Grunts]

05:46.096 --> 05:47.138
-Give me the phone. —why?

05:47.305 --> 05:49.516
Just give it to me. Sh.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.727
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry, you'll thank me.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.438
[Imitating rajesh]
Hello, lalita? Raj Koothrappali.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.399
[Laughing]

05:58.400 --> 06:01.486
Yes, it is good to talk to you too.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.407
So, what are you wearing?

06:08.326 --> 06:09.870
Oh, not important.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.747
So anyhow,
when would you like to meet?

06:13.790 --> 06:16.293
Friday works for me.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.421
I'll call you with a time and place.

06:19.588 --> 06:23.049
In the meantime, keep it real, babe.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.599
[Normal voice]
You may now thank me.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.311
For what, making me sound
like a Simpsons character?

06:35.312 --> 06:38.064
- Next time, make your own date.
- Didn't wanna make this one.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.693
Look on the bright side, she might
turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.487
Great, we get married,
I won't be able to talk to her...

06:44.654 --> 06:47.657
And we'll spend the rest of our lives
in total silence.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.409
It worked for my parents.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.119
[Knock on door]

- Hi, guys.
- Oh, hey.

I need Guinea pigs.

06:53.872 --> 06:58.335
Okay, there's a lab animal supply
company in reseda you could try.

06:58.501 --> 07:02.297
But if your research is going to have
human applications, I suggest white mice.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.508
Their brain chemistry
is far closer to ours.

07:06.718 --> 07:10.180
I swear to god, Sheldon, one day,
I'm gonna get the hang of talking to you.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.850
His mom's been saying that for years.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.521
- What's up?
- Well, I convinced the restaurant...

07:18.688 --> 07:21.900
To give me a bartending shift
so I need to practice mixing drinks.

07:22.067 --> 07:26.196
Oh, well, great. The key to acquiring
proficiency in any task is repetition.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.989
With certain obvious exceptions.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.868
Suicide, for example.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.497
So, Leonard, how about it?

07:36.748 --> 07:40.502
Penny, we'd love to help you, but raj
is going through some stuff right now.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.213
And besides, he doesn't drink, so...

07:43.380 --> 07:44.839
[Whispering indistinctly]

07:45.006 --> 07:46.383
Really?

07:48.677 --> 07:53.556
Raj is going through some stuff right now
and he'd like to take up drinking.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.520
Okay, here you go, Leonard.
One Tequila sunrise.

07:58.687 --> 07:59.771
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

07:59.938 --> 08:03.692
This drink is an example of how liquids
with different specific gravities...

08:03.858 --> 08:06.236
Interact in a cylindrical container.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.781
Thank you.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.741
Okay, raj, what'll it be?

08:12.909 --> 08:14.536
[Whispering indistinctly]

08:14.703 --> 08:15.870
Whatever you recommend.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.374
How about a grasshopper?
I make a mean grasshopper.

Okay? Good, coming up.

08:20.875 --> 08:24.879
- Sheldon, what are you gonna have?
- I'll have a diet coke.

08:25.714 --> 08:29.259
Okay, can you please order a cocktail?
I need to practice mixing drinks.

08:29.426 --> 08:32.929
Fine. I'll have a virgin Cuba libre.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.100
That's rum and coke without the rum.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.567
And would you make it diet?

08:50.613 --> 08:51.906
There's a can in the fridge.

08:52.657 --> 08:56.494
A Cuba libre traditionally comes
in a tall glass with a lime wedge.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.788
Then swim to Cuba.

Bartenders are supposed
to have people skills.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.996
Is there another penny here?

09:40.955 --> 09:43.666
I had such plans. I had dreams.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.212
I was going to be the indira Gandhi
of particle astrophysics.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.589
But with a penis, of course.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.550
It's amazing.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.177
Ever since I was a little boy...

09:54.344 --> 09:57.222
My father wanted me
to be a gynecologist like him.

09:57.388 --> 10:01.351
How can I be a gynecologist?
I can barely look a woman in the eye.

10:04.854 --> 10:08.191
You know what? I'm not going
to let my parents control my future.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.818
It's time for a showdown.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.112
Somebody give me a computer
with a webcam.

10:12.278 --> 10:16.366
Okay. Sweetie, I think
that's the grasshopper talking.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.034

down the aisle with lalita gupta.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.623
Okay, calm down.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.000

Raj, honey...

10:37.554 --> 10:41.015
You say you can't talk to women
but you've been talking to me.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.351
And now we'll never know.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.729
You're right. I...

10:46.896 --> 10:48.356
I am talking to you.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.901
Hello, penny. How are you?

10:52.360 --> 10:53.611
I'm fine.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.072
Okay, now, I need to
make sure I have a lalita...

just promise me you won't overdo it.

Freedom?

11:13.256 --> 11:18.761
This warm glow inside of me that promises
everything's going to be all hunky dunky?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.471
Yeah, that.

11:20.638 --> 11:23.892
Why don't you bring her to my restaurant
so I can keep an eye on you?

11:24.058 --> 11:25.685
Okay.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.939
What's the plan? Let's say he meets her,
he likes her, they get married.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.942
What's he gonna do,
stay drunk for the rest of his life?

11:51.002 --> 11:52.629
Well, you are.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.923
Little lalita.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.633
That's kind of fun to say.

- Oh, it's okay.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.310
You have lost so much weight.

12:08.353 --> 12:11.981
That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat.

12:21.366 --> 12:22.575
Well, I've been trying.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.037
- So you're a dental student?
- Hmm.

12:26.829 --> 12:31.334
Mm! Are you aware that dentists
have an extremely high suicide rate?

12:32.168 --> 12:35.672
Not as high as air traffic controllers,
but there are far more dentists...

12:35.838 --> 12:39.509
Than air traffic controllers,
so in pure numbers, you're still winning.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.594
Yay, me.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.555
Do you have a drink
that'll make him less obnoxious?

12:45.348 --> 12:47.684
Drinks do not work that way.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.186
I'd say he's doing fine. Look at her.

12:50.353 --> 12:54.107
The last girl my mom set me up with
had a mustache and a vestigial tail.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.069
- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened?

12:58.361 --> 13:00.822
Nothing. I just really didn't wanna come.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.535
Virgin diet Cuba libre, please.

13:05.994 --> 13:09.664
- Okay.
- In a tall glass with a lime wedge.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.875
Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.212
So how's Koothrappali...?

13:16.379 --> 13:17.672
Oh, my lord.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.675
- What?
- That's Princess panchali.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.719
I'm pretty sure her name's lalita.

13:22.885 --> 13:27.056
No, no. Princess panchali
from the monkey and the Princess.

13:27.223 --> 13:31.936
Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online
but they wanted my credit card.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.439
It's a children's story.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.566
Oh, no, it isn't.

13:39.402 --> 13:42.488
When I was a little boy and got sick,
which was most of the time...

13:42.655 --> 13:44.032
My mother would read it.

13:44.198 --> 13:47.243
It's about an Indian Princess
who befriends a monkey...

13:47.410 --> 13:50.413
Who was mocked by the other monkeys
because he was different.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.750
For some reason,
I related to it quite strongly.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.918
I know the reason.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.047
We all know the reason.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.591
Sheldon, what are you getting at?

14:01.758 --> 14:05.595
That woman looks exactly like the pictures
of Princess panchali in the book.

14:05.970 --> 14:09.766
How often does one see a beloved
fictional character come to life?

14:09.932 --> 14:12.435
Every year at comic-con.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.187
Every day at Disneyland.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.898
You can hire snow white
to come to your house.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.692
Of course, they prefer
it if you have a kid.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.570
Hey, guys. This is lalita gupta.

14:22.737 --> 14:26.032
Lalita, this is Leonard and Sheldon
and Howard and penny.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.160
Isn't it great? She isn't fat anymore.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.079
Forgive me, your highness...

14:31.245 --> 14:33.956
For I am but a monkey
and it is in my nature to climb.

14:34.123 --> 14:37.627
I did not mean to gaze upon you
as you comb your hair.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.213
I'm sorry?

14:40.380 --> 14:43.508
You are the living embodiment
of the beautiful Princess panchali.

14:44.050 --> 14:47.136
Oh, no kidding. Who is that?

14:47.303 --> 14:49.889
A beloved character
from an Indian folktale.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.852
Us Indian
or "come to our casino" Indian?

14:56.813 --> 14:58.481
- You Indian.
- Oh.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.900
The resemblance is remarkable.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.487
I can practically smell the lotus blossoms
woven into your ebony hair.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.489
Well, thanks.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.991
I imagine you smell very nice too.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.995
I shower twice a day
and wash my hands as often as I can.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.331
Really? So do I.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.501
But you're a dentist, he's nuts.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.754
Don't be insulting, rajesh.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.716
So, Sheldon, tell me more about
this Princess you say I look like.

15:25.883 --> 15:29.929
It was said that the gods
fashioned her eyes out of the stars...

15:30.096 --> 15:34.100
And that roses were ashamed to bloom
in the presence of her Ruby lips.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.018
Oh, my.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.187
- Back off, Sheldon.
- What?

15:38.354 --> 15:42.692
If you do not stop hitting on my lady,
you will feel the full extent of my wrath.

15:43.526 --> 15:44.694
I'm not hitting on her.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.404
And I am not your lady.

15:46.571 --> 15:49.031
And you have no wrath.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.702
You are my lady. Our parents said so.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.371
We are, for all purposes,
100 percent hooked up.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.165
Let's get something straight.

15:57.331 --> 16:00.334
The only reason I came tonight
was to get my parents off my case.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.254
I don't need to be getting
this old-world crap from you.

16:03.421 --> 16:07.717
That's the kind of spirit with which
Princess panchali led the monkeys to freedom.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.136
- Screw panchali.
- You can't talk to me like that.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.846
But you're not Princess panchali.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.390
Luckily for you.
She could have you beheaded.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.393
- Sheldon, are you hungry?
- I could eat.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.437
Let's go.

16:22.899 --> 16:23.983
What just happened?

16:24.150 --> 16:25.902
Beats the hell out of me.

16:26.068 --> 16:29.697
I'll tell you what happened. I just
learned how to pick up Indian chicks.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.803
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we
supposed to say to lalita's parents?

16:34.827 --> 16:37.580
I play golf with her father.
I won't be able to look at him.

16:37.747 --> 16:40.750
Maybe you should keep
your eye on the ball, papa.

16:40.917 --> 16:45.087
Oh, now you're a funnyman?
This is not funny, Mr. Funnyman.

16:45.254 --> 16:49.467
Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, in all fairness,
it wasn't entirely raj's fault.

16:49.634 --> 16:52.136
- This is a family matter, Sheldon.
- No, I'm Leonard.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.264
Oh. Sorry. You all look alike to us.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.289
But he's right, papa. Listen to him.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.727
[Door opens]

16:59.894 --> 17:02.021
You, you are the one
who ruined everything.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.773
Who is it? We can't see.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.358
Turn us. Turn us.

17:08.486 --> 17:11.447
Go ahead, tell my parents why
they won't have any grandchildren.

17:11.822 --> 17:14.951
How would I know?
Do you have a low sperm count?

17:16.494 --> 17:18.621
This has nothing to do
with my sperm count.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.457
You are wearing the boxers
that we sent you, aren't you?

17:21.624 --> 17:22.667
Yes, mommy.

17:22.833 --> 17:26.462
You know what happens to the samosas
when you wear the tighty whit/es.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.632
Can we please stop talking
about my testicles?

17:30.216 --> 17:32.969
- Sheldon, tell them what you did.
- What did I do?

17:33.344 --> 17:35.012
You left with his date.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.847
Friends don't do that to each other.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.060
All right, noted.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.856
- Sorry.
- "Sorry"? That's all you can say is "sorry"?

17:46.023 --> 17:48.234
Take it, raj.
It's more than I've ever gotten.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.443
And may I point out...

17:49.610 --> 17:52.738
She wouldn't have asked me to go
if you weren't drunk and boring.

17:52.947 --> 17:56.117
- Drunk?
- And boring. Her words.

17:56.284 --> 17:59.036
[Knew it, he moves to america
and becomes an alcoholic.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.830
I'm not an alcoholic.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.665
Then why were you drunk?

18:02.832 --> 18:04.709
It was just this one time, papa, I swear.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.962
Are you in denial? Do we have
to come over and do an intervention?

18:08.129 --> 18:10.548
Don't embarrass him
in front of his friends.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.508
All right. Carry us outside.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.885
We want to talk to you in private.

18:15.386 --> 18:17.054
- But, papa, please...
- Now, rajesh.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.935
I have to go.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.427
- Dr. Koothrappali: Now, listen to me...
- At least wait till I get into the hall.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.485
[Door closes]

18:31.861 --> 18:32.945
Okay, well, good night.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.367
What happened with you and lalita?

18:38.534 --> 18:42.121
We ate, she lectured me on the link
between gum disease and heart attacks...

18:42.288 --> 18:45.207
Nothing I didn't already know,
and I came home.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.960
So you're not gonna see her again?

18:48.127 --> 18:49.754
Why would I see her again?

18:49.920 --> 18:52.381
I already have a dentist.

18:57.219 --> 19:01.098
I wonder who's gonna tell his parents
that they're not having grandchildren.

19:04.727 --> 19:05.978
[Singing and playing "to life"]

19:06.145 --> 19:08.230
To life, to life, I'Chaim

19:08.397 --> 19:10.691
I'Chaim, I'Chaim, to life

19:11.233 --> 19:13.277

19:13.444 --> 19:15.112

19:15.279 --> 19:20.159

19:22.286 --> 19:24.580
I don't believe it.
What's gotten into him?

19:24.747 --> 19:29.752
Oh, maybe a couple of virgin Cuba libres
that turned out to be kind of slutty.

19:30.920 --> 19:31.921
[Chuckles] You didn't.

19:32.088 --> 19:34.340
Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine.

19:34.757 --> 19:37.802
To life
