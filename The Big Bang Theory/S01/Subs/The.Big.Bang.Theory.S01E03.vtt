And would you agree
the primary way we would evaluate...

06:27.929 --> 06:31.808

be based on the biochemical reaction...

06:31.975 --> 06:35.395
- During the good-night kiss?
- Heart rate, pheromones, et cetera, yes.

- Yes.

- You proposed the experiment.

your findings first.

There is an inherent ambiguity
in the word "dinner."

Technically,
it refers to the largest meal of the day.

- Or dinner, you know.

Sometimes he finds that filling,
other times he doesn't.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.701
It's no fault of quizno's.
They have a varied menu.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.912
Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.708
-Did we say a time? —six—thirty.

13:11.874 --> 13:12.917
Still good?

13:13.084 --> 13:14.711
- It's fine.
- It's not carved in stone.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.170
No. Six-thirty is great.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.423
I'll get my chisel. Heh-heh.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.134
Why?

13:23.094 --> 13:27.223
To carve the...
Okay, I'll see you at 6:30.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.694
How do I look?

13:44.115 --> 13:45.950
Could you be more specific?

13:47.660 --> 13:50.079
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?

13:50.913 --> 13:55.335
No. The dark Crescent-shaped patterns
under your arms conceal it nicely.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.380
- What time is your date?
- —six—thirty.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.924
Perfect, that gives you
two hours and 15 minutes...

14:02.091 --> 14:05.303
For that dense molecular cloud
of aramis to dissipate.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.640
- Is it too much?
- Not if you're a rugby team.

14:11.309 --> 14:14.270
By the way, you didn'tjoin us
because you stuffed yourself...

14:14.437 --> 14:16.647
With a chicken-carbonara sub
at quizno's.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.232
Why would I join you?

14:19.233 --> 14:20.735
No reason.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.573
Oh, you know what?
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.117
Oh, no, well, now,
there's always the possibility...

14:28.284 --> 14:30.495
That alcohol and poorjudgment
on her part...

14:30.661 --> 14:33.039
Might lead to a nice romantic evening.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.835
You're right. Alcohol, poorjudgment.
It could go well.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.506
Of course, there's the other possibility
that this day kicks off...

14:41.672 --> 14:44.759
An unpleasant six months of you
passing awkwardly in the hall...

14:44.926 --> 14:47.804
Until one of you breaks down
and moves to another zip code.

14:48.221 --> 14:51.265
You could have stopped at,
"it could go well."

14:51.849 --> 14:53.893
If I could have, I would have.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.896
I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy.
There's no reason...

14:57.063 --> 14:59.857
We couldn't go to the restaurant
and have a lovely dinner.

15:00.024 --> 15:04.654
Maybe take a walk aftennards,
talk about things we have in common.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.657
"You love pottery? I love pottery."

15:08.074 --> 15:10.701
You know, there's a pause.
We both know what's happening.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.829
We kiss. It's a little tentative at first.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.998
But I realize, she's kissing me back,
she's biting my lower lip.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.334
She wants me.
This thing is going the distance.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.503
We're gonna have sex.
Oh, god. Oh, my god.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.842
Is the sex starting now?

15:26.509 --> 15:27.885
I'm having a panic attack.

15:28.052 --> 15:31.389
Oh, okay. Well, then, calm down.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.433
If I could,
I wouldn't be having an attack.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.018
- That's why they call it a panic attack.
- All right.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.728
Would you just sit down?

15:37.895 --> 15:40.481
- Yeah, sit down. Now close your eyes.
- —why?

15:40.648 --> 15:41.858
- Just do it.
- Okay.

15:42.024 --> 15:45.027
Now, try to increase
your Alpha-wave activity.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.947
- What?
- It's a biofeedback technique.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.241
It's relaxation
through brainwave manipulation.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.577
I read it
in the journal of American neuroscience.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.455
It was sparsely sourced,
but I think the science is valid.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.207
I probably have it here somewhere.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.501
Who am I kidding?
I can't go through with this.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.378
- You need to call her and cancel.
- Me?

16:02.545 --> 16:04.088
- Yes.
- What should I tell her?

16:04.255 --> 16:06.674
- I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.
- Okay.

16:06.841 --> 16:09.385
Not the kind that would make her
wanna take care of me.

16:09.552 --> 16:13.764
But nothing so critical that she'll feel
uncomfortable if I wanna try this again.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.434
Got it. So I'm assuming nothing venereal.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.691
I'll just tell her that you had
a routine colonoscopy...

16:23.858 --> 16:25.693
And haven't quite bounced back.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.237
- Give me the phone.
- I thought you wanted to cancel.

16:28.404 --> 16:31.240
I can't. If I don't show up,
she'll still be expecting you.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.784
Why would she be expecting me?

16:34.785 --> 16:38.831
Stop asking me all these questions.
I need to take another shower.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.754
- Are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
- Oh, yeah.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.841
Turns out that raj and Howard
had to work...

16:49.008 --> 16:54.472
And Sheldon had a colonoscopy,
and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.725
Ooh, my uncle just had
a colonoscopy.

16:57.892 --> 17:01.979
You're kidding. Well, then,
that's something we have in common.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.232
How?

17:04.398 --> 17:10.905
We both have people in our lives
who wanna nip intestinal polyps in the bud.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.871
So, what's new in the world of physics?

17:19.956 --> 17:21.541
Nothing.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.960
Really? Nothing?

17:24.126 --> 17:29.632
Well, with the exception of string theory,
not much has happened since the 1930s...

17:29.799 --> 17:31.509
And you can't prove string theory.

17:31.676 --> 17:37.139
At best you can say, "hey, look, my idea
has an internal logical consistency."

17:38.266 --> 17:41.936
Ah. Well, I'm sure things will pick up.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.025
What's new at the cheesecake factory?

17:48.192 --> 17:50.653
Oh, uh, not much.

17:50.820 --> 17:55.199
Oh, we do have a chocolate key lime
that's moving pretty well.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.918
Uh, what about
your, uh, hallway friend?

18:06.085 --> 18:10.506
Doug? Oh, yeah. I don't know. I mean,
you know, he's nice and funny, but...

18:10.673 --> 18:12.925
- Can I get you started with some drinks?
- —no. Bzzz.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.345
- You were saying, "but..."?
- I'd like a drink.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.765
Just say the "but" thing about Doug,
and then I'll get her back.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.185
Okay, well, it...
I don't know. It's just me.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.521
I'm still getting over this break-up
with Kurt.

18:25.688 --> 18:28.524
And this thing with Doug
would just be rebound sex.

18:29.066 --> 18:33.279
Ugh. Don't get me started
on rebound sex.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.114
It's just... it's my pattern.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.491
I break up, then I find some cute guy...

18:37.658 --> 18:41.370
And then it's just
36 meaningless hours of...

18:41.537 --> 18:42.788
Well, you know.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.250
I'm not sure that I do. Um...

18:47.585 --> 18:52.423
Is that one 36-hour experience
or is that 36 hours spread out over...

18:52.590 --> 18:56.052
Say, one glorious summer?

18:56.218 --> 18:57.720
No. It's usually over a weekend.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.640
And trust me,
you do not feel good after it.

19:01.015 --> 19:03.225
Well, chafing, right?

19:04.393 --> 19:05.478
Emotionally.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.564
Of course, yeah. Emotional chafing.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.782
Hey, do you wanna see something cool?

19:19.200 --> 19:23.412
I can make this olive go into this glass
without touching it.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.290
- How?
- Physics.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.798
Wow, centrifugal force.

19:33.964 --> 19:37.259
Actually, it's centripetal force,
which is an inward force...

19:37.426 --> 19:40.763
Generated by the glass
acting on the olive. Ooh.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.848
Excuse me.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.143
Now, if you were biting on the olive...

19:46.310 --> 19:49.855
You'd be in a non-inertial
reference frame and would...

19:51.273 --> 19:54.443
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.654
Did you spill ketchup?

19:56.821 --> 19:59.156
- No.
- I'm not okay.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.161
You don't wanna go
to the emergency room?

20:04.328 --> 20:05.371
No, no. I'm okay.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.956
It stopped bleeding.

20:07.123 --> 20:10.084
Anyway, you did throw up.
Isn't that a sign of a concussion?

20:10.251 --> 20:13.504
Yes, but I get carsick too, so...

20:13.671 --> 20:14.714
Okay.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.590
Sorry about your car, by the way.

20:16.757 --> 20:20.386
Oh, no, it's fine.
You got most of it out the window.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.888
The poor guy on the bike.

20:25.641 --> 20:26.642
I had a nice time.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.769
Yeah, me too.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.147
Well, um, good night.

20:31.856 --> 20:33.190
Good night.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.818
- Leonard.
- Yeah?

20:36.569 --> 20:38.821
Was this supposed to be a date?

20:39.655 --> 20:41.323
This?

20:44.618 --> 20:46.162
No, of course not.

20:46.328 --> 20:49.582
This was just you and me hanging out
with guys who didn't show up...

20:49.749 --> 20:52.877
Because of work and a colonoscopy.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.671
Okay. I was just checking.

20:56.881 --> 21:01.302
When I take a girl on a date...
And I do, heh.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.638
She knows she's been dated.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.350
Capital d. Heh.

21:08.768 --> 21:13.314
Bold face, underlined, like, dated.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.109
I think I might have a concussion.
I'm gonna go lay down.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.694
Good night.

21:22.323 --> 21:25.659
- So how was your date?
- Awesome. Heh.

21:29.872 --> 21:32.875
Score one for liquor and poorjudgment.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.571
[English - us - sdh]
