00:02.336 --> 00:03.771
Leonard: Nice move.
Rajesh: I've got it.

00:03.795 --> 00:05.899
Howard: Take him down.
Leonard: He's got you, Sheldon.

00:05.923 --> 00:08.123
Howard: Come on.
Leonard: He's completely schooling you.

00:08.258 --> 00:11.345
Hey, guys, some of the other waitresses
wanted me to ask you something.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.056
- It's tressling.
- It combines the physical strength...

00:14.223 --> 00:18.602
Of arm wrestling with the mental agility
of Tetris into the ultimate sport.

00:18.769 --> 00:22.564
That's terrific, but what they wanted me
to ask you is to cut it the hell out.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.483
All right, come on, guys. Come on.

00:24.650 --> 00:28.570
Wait staff [singing]:
Happy birthday to you

00:28.862 --> 00:30.781
we might as well stop, it's a stalemate.

00:30.948 --> 00:34.910
You're beating me in Tetris, but you've got
the upper body strength of a keebler elf.

00:35.077 --> 00:37.371
Keebler elf?
I got a keebler elf right here.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.040
[Rajesh groaning]

00:42.417 --> 00:44.294
Okay, it's a stalemate.

00:45.796 --> 00:49.550
Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday
for your free birthday cheesecake?

00:49.716 --> 00:52.094
He can't eat cheesecake.
He's lactose intolerant.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.720
Okay, he can have carrot cake.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.765
- What about the cream-cheese frosting?
- He can scrape it off.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.936
Forget about the cake.
How did you know my birthday's Saturday?

01:01.103 --> 01:02.563
I did your horoscope, remember?

01:02.729 --> 01:06.233
I was gonna do everybody's until Sheldon
went on one of his psychotic rants.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.902
For the record, that psychotic rant...

01:09.069 --> 01:11.947
Was a concise summation
of the research of Bertram forer...

01:12.114 --> 01:14.491
Who, in 1948, proved conclusively...

01:14.658 --> 01:16.493
Through meticulous experiments...

01:16.660 --> 01:18.996
That astrology
is pseudoscientific hokum.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.998
Blah, blah, blah. Typical Taurus.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.085
- So we gonna see you Saturday?
- I don't think so.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.170
- Why not?
- I don't celebrate my birthday.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.505
Shut up. Yeah, you do.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.841
It's no big deal.
It's the way I was raised.

01:31.008 --> 01:33.468
My parents focused
on celebrating achievements...

01:33.635 --> 01:37.389
And being expelled from a birth canal
was not considered one of them.

01:37.889 --> 01:41.059
- That's so silly.
- It's actually based on very sound theories.

01:41.226 --> 01:44.146
- His mother published a paper on it.
- Well, what was it called?

01:44.313 --> 01:46.690
"I hate my son
and that's why he can't have cake"?

01:47.816 --> 01:49.443
Sheldon:
It was obviously effective.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.820
Leonard grew up to be
an experimental physicist.

01:51.987 --> 01:55.699
Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas,
he'd be a little better at it.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.368
Thank you.

01:58.535 --> 02:02.372
Well, I love birthdays. Waking up
to mom's special French-toast breakfast...

02:02.539 --> 02:06.335
Wearing the birthday king crown,
playing laser tag with all my friends.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.545
Yeah, see? That's what kids should have.

02:08.712 --> 02:11.089
Actually, that was last year.

02:14.009 --> 02:17.387
So you've really never had
a birthday party?

02:17.554 --> 02:19.056
No, but it was okay.

02:19.222 --> 02:23.477
When I was little, I'd think my parents
would change their mind and surprise me.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.146
This one birthday,
I came home from my cello lesson...

02:26.313 --> 02:28.273
And I saw strange cars
parked out front.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.442
When I got to the door,
I hear whispering...

02:30.609 --> 02:34.029
And I could smell German chocolate cake,
which is my favorite.

02:34.946 --> 02:38.742
- And?
- It turns out my grandfather had died.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.662
Oh, my god, that's terrible.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.039
Well, it was kind of like a birthday party.

02:44.790 --> 02:48.377
I got to see all my cousins,
and there was cake, so...

02:49.169 --> 02:52.214
- That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
- You think?

02:52.381 --> 02:54.424
Go ahead,
tell her about your senior prom.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.620
Howard:
Make sure they remember, no peanuts.

03:23.787 --> 03:27.916
Howard, every Thai restaurant in town
knows you can't eat peanuts.

03:28.417 --> 03:31.878
When they see me coming,
they go, "ah, no-peanut boy."

03:42.848 --> 03:46.393
- Hello, penny, Leonard just left.
- I know, I wanna talk to you.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.228
What would we talk about?

03:48.478 --> 03:50.981
We have no overlapping
areas of interest I'm aware of.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.401
- As you know, I don't care for chitchat.
- Can you just let me in?

03:54.568 --> 03:57.779
Well, all right, but I don't see this
as a promising endeavor.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.073
Okay, here's the deal.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.160
We'll throw Leonard a kickass
surprise party for his birthday.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.327
I hardly think so.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.747
Leonard made it clear
he doesn't want a party.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.207
Did someone say party?

04:10.459 --> 04:13.628
He just doesn't know he wants one,
because he's never had one.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.005
I suppose that's possible.

04:15.172 --> 04:18.842
But for the record, I've never had a
threesome and yet I still know I want one.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.220
Here's the difference.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.182
The possibility exists
Leonard could have a birthday party...

04:25.348 --> 04:27.476
Before hell freezes over.

04:29.186 --> 04:32.022
Fine. If I do have a threesome,
you can't be part of it.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.525
I'm just kidding. Yes, you can.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.653
Can you bring a friend?

04:40.363 --> 04:42.741
I think a birthday
party is a terrible idea.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.660
I envy Leonard for growing up
without that anguish.

04:45.827 --> 04:46.870
Anguish?

04:47.037 --> 04:50.123
Year after year,
I had to endure wearing conical hats...

04:50.290 --> 04:53.627
While being forced into the crowded,
sweaty hell of bouncy castles.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.420
Not to mention being blindfolded...

04:55.587 --> 04:57.881
And spun toward
a grotesque tailless donkey...

04:58.048 --> 05:01.092
As the other children mocked
my disorientation.

05:01.885 --> 05:06.181
Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars
that no non-professional can heal...

05:06.348 --> 05:09.226
But nevertheless, we're gonna
throw Leonard a birthday party.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.436
I'm extremely uncomfortable
with dancing...

05:11.603 --> 05:14.856
Loud music and most other forms
of alcohol-induced frivolity.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.026
- Nevertheless...
- In addition...

05:18.193 --> 05:20.654
You either help me
throw Leonard a birthday party...

05:20.821 --> 05:22.489
Or I will go into your bedroom...

05:22.656 --> 05:25.200
And unbag all
your mint-condition comic books.

05:25.367 --> 05:29.996
- And on one of them... you won't know which.
- -I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.

05:31.748 --> 05:35.877
You can't do that. If you make a Mark
in a mint comic book, it's no longer mint.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.255
Do you understand
the concept of blackmail?

05:38.421 --> 05:40.257
Well, of course, I... oh.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.887
Yeah, I have an idea. Let's throw Leonard
a kickass birthday party.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.367
That's not the secret knock.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.037
This is the secret knock:

06:14.457 --> 06:15.959
What difference does it make?

06:16.126 --> 06:19.129
The point of a secret knock
is to establish a nonverbal signal...

06:19.296 --> 06:22.007
To verify the identity
of one's coconspirators.

06:22.173 --> 06:25.510
- Penny: Is that raj and Howard?
- Possibly, but unverified.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.220
Would you just let us in?

06:27.387 --> 06:30.473
Luckily for you,
this is not a nuclear reactor.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.309
So, what'd you get the birthday boy?

06:32.475 --> 06:35.437
Raj got him an awesome
limited-edition dark knight sculpture...

06:35.604 --> 06:37.480
Based on Alex Ross'
definitive Batman.

06:37.647 --> 06:41.568
And I got him this amazing autographed
copy of the feynman lectures on physics.

06:41.735 --> 06:45.113
Nice. I got him a sweater.

06:45.739 --> 06:49.451
Okay, well, he might like that.
I've seen him get chilly.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.622
- Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
- That's because I didn't bring one.

06:53.788 --> 06:54.915
- Why not?
- Don't ask.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.126
The entire institution of gift-giving
makes no sense.

06:58.293 --> 07:01.463
- Too late.
- Let's say I go out and I spend $50 on you.

07:01.630 --> 07:04.758
It's a laborious activity
because I have to imagine what you need...

07:04.925 --> 07:06.509
Where you know what you need.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.804
I could simplify things,
just give you the $50 directly...

07:09.971 --> 07:12.807
And then you could give me $50
on my birthday and so on...

07:12.974 --> 07:17.103
Until one of us dies,
leaving the other one old and $50 richer.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.399
And I ask you, is it worth it?

07:21.983 --> 07:23.860
Told you not to ask.

07:24.027 --> 07:27.697
Well, Sheldon, you're his friend.
Friends give each other presents.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.325
I accept your premise,
I reject your conclusion.

07:32.369 --> 07:36.039
Try telling him
it's a non-optional social convention.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.833
- What?
- Just do it.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.877
[Penny groans]

07:41.044 --> 07:44.297
It's a non-optional social convention.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.384
Ah, fair enough.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.555
He came with a manual.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.393
Question, how am I going to get Leonard
a present before the party?

07:56.559 --> 07:59.396
I don't drive and the things available
in walking distance...

07:59.562 --> 08:01.398
Are a Thai restaurant
and a gas station.

08:01.564 --> 08:05.735
I could wrap up an order of mee krob
and a couple of lottery scratchers.

08:05.902 --> 08:09.406
Okay, let's do this.
I will drive Sheldon to get a present.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.409
- Howard, get rid of Leonard for two hours.
- No problem.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.912
And then, raj, you bring the stuff
across the hall and start setting up.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.332
- What if guests show up?
- Entertain them.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.460
What if they're women?

08:23.378 --> 08:26.006
Stare at them
and make them feel uncomfortable.

[Gunshots on TV]

08:33.638 --> 08:35.056
[Knocking on door]

08:35.890 --> 08:38.601
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.146
- How's it going?
- Fine.

08:41.855 --> 08:47.444
So listen, the nuart is showing the
revised, definitive cut of blade runner.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.862
-Seen it.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.740
You've seen
the 25th anniversary final cut.

08:51.906 --> 08:55.201
This one has eight seconds
of previously-unseen footage.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.038
They say it completely changes
the tone of the film.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.206
Pass.

09:00.373 --> 09:04.919
Come on. Afterwards, there's a q&a
with Harrison Ford's body double.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.464
Look, I am in the "halo" battle
of my life here.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.216
There's this kid in Copenhagen,
he has no immune system.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.470
So all he does is sit in his bubble
and play "halo" 24/7.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.889
Can't you play him some other time?

09:16.056 --> 09:18.725
Not if you believe his doctors.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.355
Oh, my god, do you smell gas?

09:25.315 --> 09:27.317
- No.
- Yeah, no.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.740
Penny:
You know, they have DVDs over there.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.410
Yes, but they have DVD burners
over here.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.497
Leonard needs a DVD burner.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.083
Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be
something someone needs.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.501
It should be something fun.

09:44.667 --> 09:49.380
- Something they wouldn't buy for themself.
- You mean, like a sweater?

09:51.341 --> 09:55.595
Well, it's a fun sweater.
It's got a bold geometric print.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.932
- Is it the geometry that makes it fun?
- Okay.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.893
The point is, one of the ways
we show we care about people...

10:02.060 --> 10:05.688
Is by putting thought and imagination
into the gifts we give them.

10:05.855 --> 10:09.901
- Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.
- Exactly.

10:10.068 --> 10:14.030
Something he wouldn't buy for himself,
something fun, something like... ah!

10:14.197 --> 10:17.158
An 802.11n wireless router.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.288

- This granola bar has peanuts in it.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.489
- Oh, my god. Why did you eat it?
- I don't know, it was just there.

10:56.656 --> 11:00.368
Well, if I had a gun there,
would you have shot yourself?

11:00.535 --> 11:01.703
Don't yell at me.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.247
- I've gotta go to the emergency room.
- Now?

11:04.414 --> 11:07.500
No, after my tongue has swollen
to the size of a brisket.

what was it supposed to be?

11:23.558 --> 11:26.311
Fine, it's out of the washer.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.938
I'll call you when it's in the dryer.

- Um, that one.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.374
- Because of the additional ethernet ports?
- Sure.

I'm going to do it right.

I refuse to let him experience
the same childhood trauma I did.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.809
I know I'm gonna regret this,
but what trauma?

12:08.144 --> 12:11.731
On my 12th birthday,
I really wanted a titanium centrifuge...

12:11.898 --> 12:14.734
So, you know,
I could separate radioactive isotopes.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.027
Of course, yeah.

12:16.194 --> 12:20.198
Instead of a titanium centrifuge,
my parents bought me...

12:20.365 --> 12:21.824
Wow, this is hard.

12:22.825 --> 12:26.621
They got me a motorized dirt bike.

All right, let's go.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.767
Excuse me,
do you know anything about this stuff?

12:47.934 --> 12:50.144
I know everything about this stuff.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.939
Okay, I have my own
wholesale flower business.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.108
I wanna hook up my computer
in the front...

12:55.275 --> 12:57.277
With the one
in my refrigerated warehouse.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.862
Buy this one, it's the one we're getting.
Happy quy-

13:00.029 --> 13:01.239
no, she doesn't want that.

13:01.406 --> 13:05.618
She needs a point-to-point peer network
with a range extender.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.329
- Thank you.
- Which hard drive do I want?

13:08.496 --> 13:12.792
- Firewire or USB?
- It depends on what bus you have available.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.549
I drive a Chevy cavalier.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.010
Oh, dear lord.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.679
- We have to go.
- Not now, this poor man needs me.

13:24.846 --> 13:26.889
You, hold on, I'll be right with you.

13:27.056 --> 13:31.227
What computer do you have,
and please don't say a white one.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.901
- Excuse me.
- Fill this out and have a seat.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.362
We're throwing
my friend a surprise party...

13:41.529 --> 13:43.865
And I'm supposed to keep him out
for two hours.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.159
Uh-huh. Fill this out and have a seat.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.120
The way I could get him
to leave was tell him I ate a peanut.

13:49.287 --> 13:50.997
I'm allergic to peanuts.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.417
Well, in that case,
fill this out and have a seat.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.712
All I need from you
is to give me a band-aid.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.380
I can pretend I had epinephrine.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.550
Tell my friend you need to keep me
under observation for an hour.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.010
- Is that all you need?
- Yes.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.762
Get out of my er.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.431
- No, you don't understand.
- I understand.

14:08.598 --> 14:12.352
But unfortunately, this hospital
is not equipped to treat stupid.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.272
Okay, I get it.
I know how the world works.

14:16.439 --> 14:22.278
How about if I were to introduce you
to the man who freed your people?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.534
Unless my people were freed
by Benjamin Franklin...

14:28.701 --> 14:31.454
And his five twin brothers,
you are wasting your time.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.626
Hey. Sorry, I couldn't find a parking spot.
How are you doing?

14:36.793 --> 14:38.127
Bad, very bad.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.463
Really? You don't look
like you're swelling up.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.299
We should pick up Benadryl
at the drugstore and go home.

14:43.466 --> 14:44.926
- We can't go home.
- Why not?

14:45.843 --> 14:47.470
Because... phbbtt!

14:47.637 --> 14:49.305
Because... phbbtt!

14:49.931 --> 14:51.641
Brisket. Brisket.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.490
- Water, need water.
- I'll be right back.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.604
[Clearing throat]

15:00.483 --> 15:03.152
- Penny, listen, I've got a problem.
- Yeah, well, so do I.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.114
- You gotta stall Leonard longer.
- I don't think I can.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.741
You have to.
We all have to be there to yell "surprise."

15:08.908 --> 15:11.994
You have to understand something.
We're in a hospital right now.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.246
Why? Is Leonard okay?

15:13.413 --> 15:16.958
Leonard's fine. I'm fine,
thanks for asking, by the way.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.336
Okay, I don't need your attitude.
Just hold him there a little longer.

15:20.503 --> 15:24.340
I've done my best, but he wants to go home
and I don't know how to stop him.

15:24.507 --> 15:25.508
Okay, how about this?

15:25.675 --> 15:27.885
Keep him longer,
when you get to the party...

15:28.052 --> 15:30.638
I'll point out which of my friends
are easy.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.191
Don't toy with me, woman.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.528
I got a former fat girl
with no self-esteem.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.947
A girl who punishes her father
by sleeping around.

15:48.114 --> 15:51.868
An alcoholic who's two Tequila shots
away from letting you wear her like a hat.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.455
Thy will be done.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.217
I'm doing this for you, little buddy.

16:14.056 --> 16:17.101
Okay, we don't have that in stock...

16:17.852 --> 16:20.563
But I can special-order it for you.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.315
Him.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.151
Excuse me, sir, you don't work here.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.446
Yes, well, apparently,
neither does anyone else.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.991
-Sheldon, we have to go. —why?

16:32.158 --> 16:34.118
We're late for Leonard's birthday party...

16:34.285 --> 16:36.829
And for another,
I told him to call security.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.041
Good luck.

16:41.751 --> 16:44.086
By the way, a 6-year-old
could hack your computer.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.296
Keep walking.

16:45.463 --> 16:48.466
Yeah, 1234 is not a secure password.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.387
My friend
is having allergic reaction to peanuts.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.932
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.434
Look, sir, we are very busy here
and I just don't...

16:58.601 --> 17:00.520
Holy crap.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.981
Please help me.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.025
Code four. I need a gurney.

17:07.235 --> 17:10.238
- Right away, right away.
- Thank you.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.285
Say what you will
about healthcare in this country...

17:16.452 --> 17:20.122
But when they're afraid of lawsuits,
they sure test everything.

17:20.456 --> 17:24.210
Howard: I really don't think
the colonoscopy was necessary.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.463
Before you got all swollen up...

17:27.630 --> 17:30.466
I thought you're trying to keep me out
of the apartment...

17:30.633 --> 17:32.718
So you could throw me
a surprise party.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.554
Oh, right, it's your birthday.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.931
I had no idea it was your birthday.
I forgot.

17:37.098 --> 17:40.726
What a lousy way to spend a birthday.
Well, it's all over now.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.731
There is a party, isn't there?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.609
Maybe.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.111
Howard.

17:51.153 --> 17:54.323
- Are you mad?
- How could I be mad?

17:54.490 --> 17:58.077
You actually risked your life
because you care about me.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.914
Yeah, that's why I did it.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.295
All right, here we go.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.923
My first birthday party.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.945
[Singing cyndi lauper's
"true colors"]

18:13.092 --> 18:14.468
I see your true colors

18:14.927 --> 18:18.556
and that's why I love you

18:20.099 --> 18:23.603
dude, everybody left an hour ago.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.940
Surprise.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.239
[On phone] Okay, Leonard...

18:35.406 --> 18:36.866
Here I am at your birthday party.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.620
I don't know where you are, dude,
but it's really kickass.

18:40.786 --> 18:44.832
Everyone is very, very drunk and...
Ooh, mmm.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.545
Oh, and look,
there's a girl taking her shirt off.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.423
That's my friend Carol.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.551
Remind me,
I gotta introduce her to Howard.

18:55.718 --> 19:00.264
Rajesh: Oh, sweet krishna,
shake that rupee maker.

19:01.390 --> 19:06.270
- I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.
- It's okay.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.940
Well, happy birthday anyways.

19:17.073 --> 19:20.660
Hey, penny, when's your birthday?

19:46.936 --> 19:48.938
[English - us - sdh]
