WEBVTT

00:02.628 --> 00:05.005
Ooh, more details
about the new Star Trek film.

00:05.172 --> 00:09.343
There's going to be a scene
depicting Spock's birth.

00:09.510 --> 00:13.096
I'd be more interested in a scene
depicting Spock's conception.

00:13.764 --> 00:19.269
Oh, please. For vulcans, mating,
or, if you will, pon farr...

00:19.436 --> 00:22.689
- It's an extremely private matter.
- I'd like to know the details.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.984
His mother was human. His father
was vulcan. They couldn't conceive.

00:26.151 --> 00:29.196
Maybe they had to go to a clinic.
Can you imagine Spock's dad...

00:29.363 --> 00:33.075
With a copy of
pointy ears and shapely rears?

00:34.201 --> 00:37.412
How come on Star Trek
everybody's private parts are the same?

00:37.579 --> 00:42.209
No alien lady ever told captain kirk,
"hey, get your thing out of my nose."

00:42.417 --> 00:43.460
[Knocks on door]

00:44.378 --> 00:45.420
Hi. Can you help me?

00:45.587 --> 00:47.881
I was writing an e-mail
and the a key got stuck.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.717
Now it's just going, "aaaah."

00:51.051 --> 00:53.220
- What'd you spill on it?
- Nothing.

00:54.263 --> 00:55.556
Diet coke.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.809
And yogurt.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.227
And a little nail Polish.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.020
I'll take a look at it.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.982
Gentlemen, switching
to local nerd news...

01:05.148 --> 01:08.068
Fishman, chen, chaudury and mcnair
aren't fielding a team...

01:08.235 --> 01:10.112
In the physics bowl this year.

01:10.279 --> 01:13.156
- You're kidding. Why not?
- They formed a barbershop quartet...

01:13.323 --> 01:16.493
And got a gig playing
knott's Berry farm.

01:17.160 --> 01:21.832
Wow. So in your world,
you're like the cool guys.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.751
Recognize.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.046
This is our year. With those guys out...

01:28.213 --> 01:30.924
The entire physics bowl
will kneel before Zod.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.844
- Zod?
- Kryptonian villain. Long story.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.345
Good story.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.934
- Count me out.
- What? Why?

01:41.101 --> 01:44.313
You want me to use my intelligence
in a tawdry competition?

01:44.855 --> 01:48.066
Would you ask Picasso
to play pictionary?

01:48.317 --> 01:51.361
Would you ask Noah Webster
to play boggle?

01:51.737 --> 01:54.781
Would you ask Jacques cousteau
to play go fish?

01:55.991 --> 01:58.744
Come on, you need a four-person team.
We're four people.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.913
By that reasoning we should also
play bridge, hold up a huppah...

02:02.080 --> 02:05.042
And enter the olympic bobsled
competition.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.210
Tickets to that, please.

02:08.295 --> 02:12.132
Sheldon, what? Do I need to quote
Spock's dying words to you?

02:12.299 --> 02:13.383
No, don't

02:14.259 --> 02:16.011
"the needs of the many..."

02:16.178 --> 02:18.221
"Outweigh the needs of the few..."

02:18.388 --> 02:20.223
"Or the one."

02:20.390 --> 02:22.476
Damn it, I'll do it.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.796
Okay, first order
of physics bowl business.

02:51.588 --> 02:55.008
We need a truly kick-ass team name.
Suggestions?

02:55.175 --> 02:58.553
How about the perpetual motion squad?

02:58.845 --> 03:02.849
It's beyond the laws of physics,
plus a little heads up for the ladies.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.019
- The ladies?
- Perpetual motion squad...

03:06.186 --> 03:08.522
We can go all night.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.565
- I like it.
- I don't.

03:10.732 --> 03:13.276
Teams are traditionally named after
fierce creatures...

03:13.443 --> 03:15.570
Thus intimidating one's opponent.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.239
We could be the bengal tigers.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.366
Poor choice. Gram for gram...

03:19.533 --> 03:23.620
No animal exceeds the relative
fighting strength of the army ant.

03:24.287 --> 03:28.458
Maybe so, but you can't incinerate
a bengal tiger with a magnifying glass.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.171
Let's put it to a vote.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.173
- All those in favor...
- Point of order.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.551
I move that any vote on team names
be unanimous.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.846
No man should be forced to emblazon
his chest with a bengal tiger...

03:41.012 --> 03:44.182
When common sense dictates
it should be an army ant.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.686
Will the gentleman from the great
state of denial yield for a question?

03:48.311 --> 03:50.689
- I will yield.
- After we go through the exercise...

03:50.856 --> 03:53.984
Of an annoying series of votes,
which the gentleman will lose...

03:54.151 --> 03:56.570
Does he intend to quit
if he does not get his way?

03:56.737 --> 04:00.115
- He does.
- We are the army ants. All those in favor?

04:01.950 --> 04:05.495
Good afternoon and welcome
to today's physics bowl practice round.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.706
I'm penny,
and I'll be your host because...

04:07.873 --> 04:10.792
I didn't have anything else
to do on a Saturday afternoon...

04:10.959 --> 04:13.545
And isn't that just a little sad?

04:15.130 --> 04:16.810
- Gentlemen, are you ready?
- Leonard: Yes.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.967
- Howard: Fire away.
- It's none of my business...

04:19.134 --> 04:22.345
But is a guy who can't speak
in front of women gonna hold you back?

04:22.512 --> 04:25.223
Oh, he'll be okay once the women
are mixed into the crowd.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.935
He only has a problem
when they're one-on-one and smell nice.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.438
Oh, thanks, raj. It's vanilla oil.

04:31.772 --> 04:35.025
I was actually the one who noticed.
Okay, let's just start.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.652
Okay, the first question
is on the topic of optics.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.071
"What is the shortest light pulse
ever produced?"

04:40.238 --> 04:41.281
[Buzzer sounds]

04:41.448 --> 04:44.826
- Dr. Cooper.
- Of course, the answer is 130 attoseconds.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.037
- That is correct.
- I knew that too.

04:47.913 --> 04:50.582
Good for you, sweetie.
Okay, next question.

04:50.749 --> 04:54.461
"What is the quantum-mechanical effect
used to encode data on hard-disk drives?"

04:54.628 --> 04:55.670
[Buzzer sounds]

04:55.837 --> 04:59.090
- Howard?
- The answer is giant magnetoresistance.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.343
- Right.
- Hey, I buzzed in.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.054
And I answered. It's called teamwork.

05:05.722 --> 05:09.309
Don't you think I should answer
engineering questions? I am an engineer.

05:09.768 --> 05:14.314
By that logic, I should answer anthropology
questions because I'm a mammal.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.109
Just ask another one.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.402
Okay.

05:19.569 --> 05:23.907
"What artificial satellite has seen glimpses
of Einstein's predicted 'frame dragging'?"

05:24.074 --> 05:25.116
[Buzzer sounds]

05:25.283 --> 05:27.410
And, of course, it's gravity probe b.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.330
Sheldon, you have to let
somebody else answer.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.791
- —Why?
- Because it's polite.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.753
What do manners have to do with it?
This is war.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.840
Were the romans polite
when they salted carthage...

05:40.006 --> 05:42.467
To make sure
nothing would ever grow again?

05:43.093 --> 05:46.304
Leonard, you said
I only had to ask questions.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.267
The objective is to give correct answers.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.394
If I know them,
why shouldn't I give them?

05:52.602 --> 05:55.313
Some of us might have
the correct answers too.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.233
- Please. You don't even have a Ph.D.
- all right, that's it.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.694
- Howard, sit down.
- Okay.

06:02.070 --> 06:05.156
- We should take a little break.
- Good idea. I need my wrist brace.

06:05.323 --> 06:08.618
All this button pushing is aggravating
my old Nintendo injury.

06:08.785 --> 06:09.828
[Whispers indistinctly]

06:09.995 --> 06:11.037
I agree.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.247
What did he say?

06:12.664 --> 06:17.377
He compared Sheldon to a disposable
feminine cleansing product...

06:17.544 --> 06:20.171
One might use on a summer's Eve.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.968
Yeah, and the bag it came in.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.016
Leonard, excellent.
I wanna show you something.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.059
Can it wait? I need to talk to you.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.354
Just look. I've designed
the perfect uniforms for our team.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.107
The colors are based
on Star Trek: The original series.

06:39.274 --> 06:43.528
The three of you will wear support red
and I will wear command gold.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.947
Why do they say aa"'?

06:46.531 --> 06:47.657
Army ants.

06:48.992 --> 06:52.829
Isn't that confusing? Aa might mean
something else to certain people.

06:53.788 --> 06:57.584
Why would a physics bowl team
be called anodized aluminum?

06:57.918 --> 06:58.960
No, I meant...

07:00.295 --> 07:01.922
Never mind.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.798
Hey, check it out.

07:03.965 --> 07:07.093
I got you a Batman cookie jar.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.347
Oh, neat. What's the occasion?

07:10.513 --> 07:13.642
Well, you're a friend
and you like Batman and cookies...

07:13.808 --> 07:15.310
And you're off the team.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.023
Sheldon: What?

07:20.190 --> 07:22.525
Howard, raj and I
just had a team meeting.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.861
- You didn't.
- We did. I just came from there.

07:25.028 --> 07:28.531
I don't know where you just came from.
It couldn't have been a team meeting.

07:28.698 --> 07:32.619
I'm on the team and I wasn't there.
Ergo, the team did not meet.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.914
Okay, let me try it this way.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.833
I was at a coffee klatch
with a couple of friends...

07:39.000 --> 07:42.712
And one thing led to another
and, it turns out, you're off the team.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.841
- —Why?
- Because you're taking all the fun out of it.

07:47.008 --> 07:50.971
I'm sorry, is the winner of the physics
bowl the team that has the most fun?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.764
Okay. Let me try it this way.

07:52.931 --> 07:56.643
You're annoying and no one wants
to play with you anymore.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.063
I see.

08:00.230 --> 08:06.403
Well, at this point I should inform you
that I intend to form my own team...

08:06.569 --> 08:09.948
And destroy the molecular bonds
that bind your very matter together...

08:10.115 --> 08:14.244
And reduce the resulting
particulate chaos to tears.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.706
Thanks for the heads up.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.125
You're welcome.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.585
- One more thing.
- Yes?

08:22.752 --> 08:24.796
It's on, bitch.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.808
- So who did he get to be on his team?
- He won't say.

08:36.975 --> 08:40.812
He just smiles
and eats macaroons out of his bat-jar.

08:41.646 --> 08:45.442
He's using psychological warfare.
We must reply in kind.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.278
I say we wait until he looks at us,
then laugh like:

08:48.445 --> 08:50.780
"Yes, you are a smart
and strong competitor.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.615
But we are also smart and strong...

08:52.782 --> 08:56.202
And we have a reasonable chance
of defeating you."

08:57.662 --> 08:59.622
How exactly would that laugh go?

09:01.374 --> 09:04.294
Hee-hee-hee!

09:04.753 --> 09:05.795
That sounds more like:

09:05.962 --> 09:11.468
"We are a tall, thin woman who wants
to make a coat out of your dalmatians."

09:12.594 --> 09:16.181
Guys, let's remember that Sheldon
is still our friend and my roommate.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.060
So nothing. Let's destroy him.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.854
Sheldon: Gentlemen.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.356
Rajesh: Hee-hee-hee!

09:30.403 --> 09:32.989
Okay, we're gonna need a strong fourth
for our team.

09:33.156 --> 09:36.951
You know who is apparently very smart
is the girl who played TV's blossom.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.872
She got a Ph.D. in neuroscience
or something.

09:41.039 --> 09:45.168
Raj, we're not getting TV's blossom
to join our physics bowl team.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.255
How about the girl from
the wonder years?

09:50.882 --> 09:54.636
Gentlemen, I believe I've found
the solution to all our problems.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.723
We can't ask Leslie winkle.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.517
Why? Because you slept together...

10:00.683 --> 10:04.479
And when she was done with you, she
discarded you like last night's chutney?

10:10.443 --> 10:14.405
- You gotta take one for the team.
- Yeah. Sack up, dude.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.408
Fine.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.995
Here I go, taking one for the team...

10:21.162 --> 10:23.206
In the sack.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.752
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hi, guys.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.255
Ahem. So, Leslie,
I have a question for you...

10:30.421 --> 10:34.509
And it might be a little awkward,
you know, given that I...

10:34.676 --> 10:36.886
Hit that thing.

10:39.556 --> 10:43.226
There's no reason to feel uncomfortable
because we've seen each other's faces...

10:43.393 --> 10:46.938
And naked bodies contorted
in the sweet agony of coitus.

10:48.481 --> 10:52.277
There's not? Gee, because it sure sounds
like there should be.

10:53.069 --> 10:56.906
Any aspects of our sexual relationship,
regarding your preferences...

10:57.073 --> 11:00.493
Your idiosyncrasies, your performance,
are protected by the inherent...

11:00.660 --> 11:03.746
- Confidentiality of the bedroom.
- That's all very comforting...

11:03.913 --> 11:05.790
But I'd like to get on my question now.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.544
- Proceed.
- We are entering the physics bowl...

11:09.711 --> 11:11.796
- And we need a fourth.
- No, thanks.

11:11.963 --> 11:15.133
I'm really busy with my like-sign dilepton
supersymmetry search.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.219
Dilepton shmylepton, we need you.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.138
Sorry.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.640
Well, we tried.

11:22.807 --> 11:27.145
We'll just have to face Sheldon
mano y mano y mano a mano.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.606
Wait, you're going up against
Sheldon Cooper?

11:29.772 --> 11:32.275
- Yes.
- That arrogant, misogynistic...

11:32.442 --> 11:36.279
Doorknob that told me I should abandon
my work with high-energy particles...

11:36.446 --> 11:39.699
For laundry and childbearing?

11:41.951 --> 11:43.620
She's in.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.665
Penny: So how do you feel?

11:47.832 --> 11:50.835
Nice and loose? Come to play?
Got your game face on?

11:52.337 --> 11:54.047
-Are you ready? All: Oh.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.008
Yeah. You don't have to stay
for the whole thing.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.886
Oh, no, no, I want to.
Sounds really interesting.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.095
Okay.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.311
- Gentlemen.
- Sheldon.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.648
- Sheldon.
- Hee-hee-hee.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.859
Sheldon.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.321
I'm just gonna sit down.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.660
So is that your team?

12:23.993 --> 12:25.411
Actually, I don't need a team.

12:25.578 --> 12:29.540
I could easily defeat you single-handedly,
but the rules require four.

12:29.707 --> 12:34.003
So may I introduce the third-floorjanitor,
the lady from the lunch room and...

12:34.170 --> 12:38.091
- My Spanish is not good.
- -Either her son or her butcher.

12:38.716 --> 12:39.968
And what about your team?

12:40.134 --> 12:43.179
What rat have you recruited
to the s. S. Sinking ship?

12:43.346 --> 12:45.390
Leslie: Hello, Sheldon.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.771
Yeah, Leslie winkle.
The answer to the question:

12:51.938 --> 12:54.691
"Who made Sheldon Cooper cry
like a little girl?"

12:55.566 --> 12:59.779
Yes, well, I'm polymerized tree sap,
and you're an inorganic adhesive.

12:59.946 --> 13:03.741
So whatever verbal projectile you launch
in my direction is reflected off of me...

13:03.908 --> 13:07.161
Returns on its original trajectory,
and adheres to you.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.123
Oh, ouch.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.251
Okay, if everyone could please
take your seats?

13:21.217 --> 13:23.136
Here's your t-shirt.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.809
It's a couple days early.

13:31.686 --> 13:34.397
It stands for perpetual motion squad.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.566
Oh, right, of course.
What was I thinking?

13:38.401 --> 13:43.656
Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome to this year's physics bowl.

13:44.949 --> 13:48.453
Today's preliminary match
features two great teams:

13:48.911 --> 13:53.791
Aa versus pms.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.960
All night long, y'all.

14:00.423 --> 14:03.551
Okay, well, iet'sjump right in.
First question.

14:03.718 --> 14:09.057
For 10 points. "What is the isospin
singlet partner of the pi-zero meson?"

14:09.223 --> 14:10.308
[Buzzer sounds]

14:10.475 --> 14:12.310
- Pms?
- The eta meson.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.770
Correct.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.231
- Formal protest.
- On what grounds?

14:17.398 --> 14:20.526
The velcro on my wrist brace
caught on my shirt.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.654
Denied. All right, for 10 points.

14:23.821 --> 14:27.700
"What is the lightest element on earth
with no stable isotope?"

14:27.867 --> 14:28.993
[Buzzer sounds]

14:29.160 --> 14:31.245
- Aa?
- And, of course, the answer is technetium.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.122
Terrific.

14:33.498 --> 14:37.085
Next question. "What is the force
between two uncharged plates...

14:37.251 --> 14:39.087
Due to quantum vacuum fluctuation?"

14:39.253 --> 14:40.296
[Buzzer sounds]

14:40.463 --> 14:42.006
- Pms?
- And Sheldon can suck on...

14:42.173 --> 14:44.258
The casimir effect.
Gablehauser: Correct.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.558
"How does a quantum computer
factor large numbers?"

14:52.725 --> 14:53.768
[Buzzer sounds]

14:53.935 --> 14:55.520
- Pms?
- Shor's algorithm.

14:55.686 --> 14:56.729
Gablehauser: Correct.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.070
Four-point-one-eight-five-five times 10
to the seventh ergs per calorie.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.155
Prévost's theory of exchanges.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.658
Lambda equals one over pi-r-squared n.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.701
Seven hundred and sixty degrees celsius.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.955
The approximate temperature
of the young lady in the front row.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.958
Mr. Wolowitz,
this is your second warning.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.002
A sigma particle.

15:20.169 --> 15:23.589
Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet
has a mass greater than the earth.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.383
Gablehauser: Correct.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.933
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hold in my hand the final question.

15:34.976 --> 15:41.357
The score now stands,
aa, 1150, pms, 1175.

15:41.524 --> 15:44.861
So for 100 points and the match...

15:45.027 --> 15:49.532
Please turn your attention
to the formula on the screens.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.409
Solve the equation.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.996
Holy crap.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.623
What the hell is that?

15:57.790 --> 16:01.461
It looks like something they found
on the ship at roswell.

16:01.627 --> 16:05.298
- Come on, think. Leslie?
- It's not gonna work if you rush me.

16:05.465 --> 16:09.260
- You have to let me get there.
- You are never gonna let that go, are you?

16:09.427 --> 16:10.678
Ten seconds.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.141
[Buzzer sounds]

16:17.727 --> 16:19.854
Sorry, I panicked.

16:20.730 --> 16:21.939
Then guess.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.402
Eight.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.533
Point four.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.911
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

16:35.077 --> 16:39.081
Aa, if you can answer correctly,
the match is yours.

16:42.251 --> 16:45.505
He doesn't have it. He's got squat.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.766
Aa, I need your answer.

16:57.725 --> 16:58.768
[Buzzer sounds]

16:58.935 --> 17:01.103
The answer is minus eight pi Alpha.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.189
Hang on a second.
That's not our answer.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.316
- What are you doing?
- Answering question.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.693
Winning physics bowl.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.113
How do you know anything
about physics?

17:11.280 --> 17:15.701
Here, I am janitor.
In former Soviet union, I am physicist.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.995
Leningrad politechnika.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.331
Go, polar bears.

17:23.251 --> 17:24.794
That's a delightful little story.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.213
Our arrangement was
you sit and not say anything.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.924
- I answer the questions.
- You didn't answer question.

17:30.091 --> 17:33.344
Hey, look. Now, maybe you have democracy
now in your beloved Russia...

17:33.511 --> 17:36.389
But on this physics bowl team,
I rule with an iron fist.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.518
Aa, I need your official answer.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.770
- It's not what he said.
- Then what is it?

17:42.937 --> 17:45.106
- I want a different question.
- You can't.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.482
- Formal protest.
- Denied.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.109
Informal protest.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.486
Denied.

17:50.653 --> 17:53.739
- I need your official answer.
- No, I decline to provide one.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.201
That's too bad because the answer
your teammate gave was correct.

17:58.661 --> 18:01.122
That's your opinion.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.876
- All right, the winner of the match is...
- Hang on.

18:06.294 --> 18:10.840
Sheldon, is proving you are single-handedly
smarter than everyone else so important...

18:11.007 --> 18:14.510
That you would rather lose by yourself
than win as part of a team?

18:16.012 --> 18:17.972
I didn't understand the question.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.892
- Go ahead.
- The winner is pms.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.600
Sorry, somebody's sitting there.

19:03.100 --> 19:07.229
- Who?
- My physics bowl trophy.

19:09.023 --> 19:12.276
That trophy is meaningless.
I forfeited, therefore you did not win.

19:12.443 --> 19:14.528
- I know someone who would disagree.
- Who?

19:14.695 --> 19:17.031
My physics bowl trophy.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.409
"Leonard is so smart.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.245
- Sheldon who?"
- All right, that is just very immature.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.580
You're right. I'm sorry.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.041
M not!"

19:28.167 --> 19:30.836
- Okay, new contest.
- Leonard: What are you doing?

19:31.003 --> 19:35.174
I am settling, once and for all,
who is the smartest around here.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.967
- Okay? Are you ready?
- —absolutely.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.594
-Bring it on. Penny: Okay.

19:39.261 --> 19:43.432
"Marsha, jan and Cindy were
the three daughters in what TV family?"

19:47.895 --> 19:48.938
The Brady bunch.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.732
Okay.

19:51.899 --> 19:55.736
"Sammy hagar replaced David Lee roth
as the lead singer in what group?"

20:00.574 --> 20:02.451
The Brady bunch?

20:04.537 --> 20:05.579
Van halen.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.750
All right. "Madonna was married
to this ridgemont high alum."

20:12.044 --> 20:14.296
Oh, my god. Sean penn.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.841
How do you know these things?

20:17.258 --> 20:20.636
I go outside and I talk to people.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.140
Okay, here.
"What actor holds the record...

20:24.306 --> 20:27.143
For being named people magazine's
sexiest man alive?"

20:27.476 --> 20:30.020
- William shatner.
- Wait.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.691
I don't think it's shatner.

20:33.858 --> 20:36.152
Then it's gotta be Patrick Stewart.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.782
- No.
- Formal protest.

20:43.325 --> 20:46.495
All right. "Singer who sang
'oops!...I did it again'?"

20:51.417 --> 20:52.877
Okay.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.547
"Tweety bird thought he saw a what?"

21:00.593 --> 21:02.511
Romulan.

21:06.056 --> 21:09.643
Yes. He thought he saw a romulan.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.189
[Penny sighs]

21:39.507 --> 21:41.509
[English - us - sdh]
