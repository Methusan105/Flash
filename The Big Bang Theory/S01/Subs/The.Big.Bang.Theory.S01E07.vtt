00:02.586 --> 00:05.088
Watch this, it's really cool. Ahem.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.341
Call Leonard hofstadter.

00:07.508 --> 00:11.428
Woman [on machine]:
Did you say, "call Helen box/eitner"?

00:13.347 --> 00:17.309
No. Call Leonard hofstadter.

00:17.476 --> 00:21.188
Did you say, "call temple Beth seder"?

00:22.439 --> 00:24.775
- No.
- Here, let me try.

00:25.442 --> 00:29.530
Call m'kflono m'kflooniloo. Ha-ha. Ha.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.324
Calling rajesh Koothrappali.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.995
[Phone ringing]

00:38.330 --> 00:41.124
Oh. It's very impressive.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.502
And a little racist.

00:44.628 --> 00:47.089
If we're through playing
mock the flawed technology...

00:47.256 --> 00:48.799
Can we get on with "halo" night?

00:48.966 --> 00:51.051
We were supposed to start at 8.
It's now 8:06.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.636
So we'll start now.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.888
We have to decide
if those lost six minutes...

00:55.055 --> 00:57.975
Will come out of game time,
bathroom time or the pizza break.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.935
We could split it two, two and two.

01:00.102 --> 01:03.182
If we're having anchovies on the pizza,
we can't take it out of bathroom time.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.356
[Knocking on door]

01:04.523 --> 01:06.400
What fresh hell is this?

01:07.192 --> 01:09.361
- Hey, penny. Come on in.
- Hey, guys.

01:09.528 --> 01:13.991
See a penny, pick her up,
and all the day, you'll have good luck.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.412
No, you won't. Uh...

01:18.579 --> 01:21.415
- Can I hide out here for a while?
- Sure. What's going on?

01:21.582 --> 01:24.459
Well, there's this girl I know
from back in Nebraska, Christy.

01:24.626 --> 01:27.170
She called me up,
she's like, "hey, how's California?"

01:27.337 --> 01:29.673
And I'm like, "awesome,"
because it's not Nebraska.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.718
The next thing I know,
she's invited herself to stay with me.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.596
- Eight oh eight.
- Shh.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.974
She got here today
and she's just been in my apartment...

01:39.141 --> 01:43.228
Yakking about every guy she slept with
in Omaha, which is every guy in Omaha...

01:43.395 --> 01:45.939
And washing
the sluttiest collection of undennear...

01:46.106 --> 01:48.025
You have ever seen
in my bathroom sink.

01:48.191 --> 01:51.445
Is she doing it one thong at a time
or does she throw it all in?

01:51.612 --> 01:54.364
Like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?

01:55.907 --> 01:58.452
- He really needs to dial it down.
- I know.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.914
So if you don't like this Christy,
why are you letting her stay?

02:03.081 --> 02:05.959
She was engaged to my cousin
while sleeping with my brother...

02:06.126 --> 02:07.419
So she's kind of family.

02:08.879 --> 02:11.214
Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.258
Who needs "halo"
when we can be regaled...

02:13.425 --> 02:16.470
With the delightfully folksy tale
of the whore of Omaha?

02:17.512 --> 02:19.473
Oh... I don't think she's a whore.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.266
No, yeah, she's definitely a whore.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.852
I mean, she has absolutely no standards.

02:24.019 --> 02:26.271
This one time, she was at...

02:26.438 --> 02:27.606
Where's Howard?

02:27.773 --> 02:29.024
Howard: Bonjour, mademoiselle.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.984
I understand you're new in town.

02:32.527 --> 02:33.820
Oh, good grief.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.389
[Slow country music playing]

03:03.725 --> 03:08.605
Ugh. I cannot believe Christy let Howard
into my apartment.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.274
And I cannot believe people pay
for horoscopes...

03:11.441 --> 03:15.779
But on a more serious note, it's
8:13 and we're still not playing "halo."

03:15.946 --> 03:18.824
Okay, fine. We'll just play one-on-one
until he gets back.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.742
One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one.

03:20.909 --> 03:24.705
We play teams, not one-on-one.
One-on-one.

03:25.163 --> 03:29.334
Well, the only way we can play teams
at this point is if we cut raj in half.

03:29.626 --> 03:33.588
Sure, cut the foreigner in half.
There's a billion more where he came from.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.007
Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.719
- Great idea.
- Uh, no.

03:39.761 --> 03:43.807
The wheel was a great idea.
Relativity was a great idea.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.893
This is a notion,
and a rather sucky one at that.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.813
- —Why?
- Why? Oh...

03:49.980 --> 03:53.400
- Penny, penny, penny.
- What, what, what?

03:53.567 --> 03:56.737
This is a complex battle simulation
with a steep learning curve.

There are myriad weapons,
vehicles and strategies to master...

Not to mention an intricate back-story

Oh, cool!
Whose head did I just blow off?

04:06.788 --> 04:07.831
Mine.

04:08.999 --> 04:12.169
Okay, I got this. Lock and load, boys.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.796
It's the only way we can play teams.

04:14.963 --> 04:18.283

her lack of experience, not to mention...

Ha-ha! There goes your head again.

04:22.179 --> 04:25.766
Okay, it's not good sportsmanship
to shoot somebody who's just re-spawned.

You need to give them a chance to...
Now, come on.

04:34.816 --> 04:35.901

04:36.067 --> 04:38.195
Yeah, and so is Sheldon.

[Laughing]

04:40.030 --> 04:42.824
Okay, that's it.
I don't know how, but she is cheating.

No one can be that attractive
and this skilled at a video game.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.955
Wait, Sheldon, come back.
You forgot something.

you just wait until you need tech support.

Gosh. He's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?

05:05.722 --> 05:09.226
Well, to be fair,
he's also a rather unpleasant winner.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.228
Well, it's been fun.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.188
Penny, we make such a good team.

05:13.355 --> 05:16.149
Maybe we could enter
a couple of "halo" tournaments sometime.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.110
Or we could just have a life.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.781
I guess for you, that's an option.
Ha-ha. Ha.

- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

As usual, nice talking to you, raj.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.872
What do you suppose she meant by that?

05:31.873 --> 05:33.500
She's an enigma, raj.

It's called carpal tunnel syndrome,
and quite frankly, you deserve it.

What's wrong?

05:51.560 --> 05:57.357
Well, um, Howard and Christy
are kind of hooking up in my bedroom.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.902
- Are you sure?
- Look, I grew up on a farm, okay?

06:01.069 --> 06:04.990
From what I heard, they're either having
sex or Howard's caught in a milking machine.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.494
Do you mind if I stay here tonight?

06:09.661 --> 06:12.873
No. Yeah, take the couch, or my bed.
I just got new pillows.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.389
It's up to you. Crazy person's choice.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.892
Well, first, we don't have house guests.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.103
Frankly, if I could afford the rent,
I'd ask you to leave.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.523
Your friendship means a lot
to me as well. What else?

06:39.107 --> 06:41.359
Well, our earthquake supplies.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.945
- We have a two-man, two-day kit.
- So?

06:44.112 --> 06:47.365
So if there's an earthquake
and the three of us are trapped here...

06:47.532 --> 06:50.535
We could be out of food
by tomorrow afternoon.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.413
Are you suggesting
that if we let penny stay...

06:53.580 --> 06:55.707
We might succumb to cannibalism?

06:55.874 --> 06:58.752
No one ever thinks it'll happen
until it does.

07:00.045 --> 07:04.883
Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh
off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.

07:05.342 --> 07:10.180
- Ha. What?
- He's engaging in reductio ad absurdum.

07:11.014 --> 07:14.601
It's the fallacy of extending someone's
argument to ridiculous proportions...

07:14.768 --> 07:17.854
And then criticizing the result.
And I don't appreciate it.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.107
I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.

07:21.399 --> 07:25.737
Okay, since I'm obviously being ignored
here, let's go over the morning schedule.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.448
I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.076
Plan your ablutions
and bodily functions accordingly.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.871
How am I supposed to
plan my bodily functions?

07:35.038 --> 07:37.290
I suggest no liquids after 11 pm.

07:38.249 --> 07:40.961
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Leonard.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.089
Heh, wrong.

07:46.925 --> 07:47.968
I'm listening.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.095
Your head goes on the other end.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.263
- —Why?
- It's culturally universal.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.224
A bed, even a temporary bed...

07:54.391 --> 07:57.143
Is always orientated with the headboard
away from the door.

07:57.310 --> 08:02.065
It serves the ancient imperative
of protecting oneself against marauders.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.903
- I'll risk it.
- Ooh.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.446
Anything else I should know?

08:08.613 --> 08:12.575
Yes. If you use my toothbrush,
I'll jump out that window.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.913
Please don't come to my funeral.
Have a good night.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.584
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

08:21.751 --> 08:26.131
Fyi, his toothbrush is the red one
in the plexiglas case under the uv light.

08:26.297 --> 08:29.718
- Ha. Got it.
- Well, sleep tight.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.434
Funny expression, sleep tight. Ha-ha. Ha.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.021
It refers to
the early construction of beds...

08:41.187 --> 08:44.983
Which featured a mattress suspended on
interlocking ropes, which occasionally...

08:45.734 --> 08:47.694
Sleep tight.

10:02.477 --> 10:03.770
What are you doing?

10:07.273 --> 10:10.860
Every Saturday since we've lived in
this apartment I have awakened at 6:15...

10:11.027 --> 10:13.696
Poured a bowl of cereal,
added a quarter cup of milk...

10:13.863 --> 10:18.576
Sat on this end of this couch, turned on
BBC america, and watched doctor who.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.453
Penny's still sleeping.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.541
Every Saturday
since we've lived in this apartment...

10:24.707 --> 10:26.668
I have awakened at 6:15,
poured myself...

10:26.835 --> 10:28.962
I know.
Look, you have a TV in your room.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.797
Why don't you have breakfast in bed?

10:31.214 --> 10:35.009
Because I am neither an invalid
nor a woman celebrating mother's day.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.179
What time is it?

10:40.306 --> 10:42.267
I slept all day?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.727
No, it's 6:30 in the morning.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.897
What the hell is your problem?

10:49.065 --> 10:51.568
Okay, this cereal
has lost all its molecular integrity.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.571
I now have a bowl
of shredded wheat paste.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.241
Hola, nerd-migos.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.787
Why do you people hate sleep?

11:03.746 --> 11:05.540
Are you wearing my robe?

11:07.041 --> 11:09.169
Oh, yeah. Sorry, I'll have it cleaned.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.671
That's okay, keep it.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.883
- Where's Christy?
- In the shower.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.385
By the way,
where did you get that loofah mitt?

11:17.552 --> 11:20.138
Yours reaches places
that mine just won't.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.519
You used my loofah?

11:26.686 --> 11:29.105
More precisely, we used your loofah.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.900
I exfoliated her brains out.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.987
You can keep that too.

11:36.446 --> 11:40.658
Ah. Well, then, we'll probably need to talk
about your stuffed-bear collection.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.245
- Christy: Howard?
- In here, milady.

11:45.455 --> 11:49.083

[Imitating train]

11:53.671 --> 11:56.591

I'll never read again.

Hi. Christy.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.970
- Hey, Leonard.
- I'm Sheldon.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.348
Right. You're Howard's entourage.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.769
So, Christy, what are your plans?

12:07.936 --> 12:11.356
Well, Howard said he'd take me shopping
in Beverly Hills.

12:11.522 --> 12:15.235
Yeah, no, I meant plans to find
some place to live other than with me.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.363
Not that I don't love having you,
but it's a little crowded.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.615
Penny, you're always welcome
to stay with us.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.826
Oh, terrific.
Now we're running a cute little b & b.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.454
Let me offer a little thinking here.

12:26.621 --> 12:29.749
- Why doesn't Christy stay with me?
- You live with your mother.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.585
I do not. My mother lives with me.

12:33.586 --> 12:37.298
It's settled. Christy will stay with
Howard, penny can go back to her apartment.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.884
And I'll watch the last 24 minutes
of doctor who...

12:40.051 --> 12:43.137
Although at this point,
it's more like doctor why bother?

12:44.264 --> 12:47.850
- Sheldon, you just can't dictate...
- No more talking. Everybody go.

12:48.851 --> 12:52.438
So, what do you say?
Wanna repair to casa Wolowitz?

12:52.605 --> 12:55.149
What is that, like a Mexican deli?

12:55.316 --> 12:57.527
I'm sorry,
I should have mentioned this earlier.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.404
My last name is Wolowitz.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.156
Oh. That's so cool.

I imagine there aren't
very many kosher cornhuskers.

- But you're still taking me shopping?
- Anything you want.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.798
Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.

13:21.384 --> 13:24.929
When they perfect human cloning,
I'm gonna order 12 of those.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.766
Howard, can't you see she's using you?

13:28.933 --> 13:32.228
Who cares? Last night,
she pulled off her blouse and I wept.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.063
Look, Howard, I know her, okay?

13:34.230 --> 13:37.650
She'll have sex with anyone
as long as they keep buying her things.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.070
Yay.

13:43.614 --> 13:48.161
If you'll excuse me,
I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.838
I'm sorry,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.924
We can't order Chinese food
without Wolowitz?

14:02.091 --> 14:03.384
Let me walk you through it.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.262
Our standard order is,
the steamed dumpling appetizer...

14:06.429 --> 14:08.556
General tso's chicken,
beef with broccoli...

14:08.723 --> 14:11.100
Shrimp with lobster sauce,
and vegetable io mein.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.186
Do you see the problem?

14:14.645 --> 14:16.606
I see a problem.

14:16.773 --> 14:20.401
Our entire order is predicated
on four dumplings and four entrées...

14:20.568 --> 14:23.071
Divided amongst four people.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.075
So we'll just order three entrees.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.826
Fine. What do you wanna eliminate?

14:28.993 --> 14:31.913
- And who gets the extra dumpling?
- We could cut it into thirds.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.539
Then it's no longer a dumpling.

14:33.706 --> 14:37.502
Once you cut it open, it is, at best,
a very small open-faced sandwich.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.253
Hi, fellas.

14:39.420 --> 14:44.050
Oh. Where's your annoying little friend
who thinks he speaks mandarin?

14:44.217 --> 14:46.636
He's putting his needs
ahead of the collective good.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.180
Where he comes from,
that's punishable by death.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.558
I come from Sacramento.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.898
Can we get an order of dumplings,
but with three instead of four?

14:59.065 --> 15:00.608
No substitutions.

15:00.775 --> 15:03.152
This isn't a substitution.
It's a reduction.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.738
Okay. No reductions.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.991
Fine. Bring us three orders of dumplings.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.619
- That's 12, we'll each have four.
- That works.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.288
If we fill up on dumplings,
we need to eliminate an entrée.

15:14.455 --> 15:15.665
No eliminations.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.502
If we have extra,
we'll just take the leftovers home.

15:19.669 --> 15:23.297
And divide it how? I'm telling you,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.924
Wolowitz is with his girlfriend.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.677
If you'd let me invite penny,
you would've had your fourth.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.554
Have you seen penny eat Chinese food?

15:29.720 --> 15:32.014
She uses a fork
and she double-dips her egg rolls.

15:32.515 --> 15:35.893
- We don't order egg rolls.
- Exactly. But we'd have to if she was here.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.520
Can we please make a decision?

15:37.687 --> 15:42.108
Not only are there children starving in
India, there's an Indian starving right here.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.695
There's an idea.
Why don't we go out for Indian food?

15:45.862 --> 15:47.613
Oh, ew.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.532
You're nice boys.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.994
Tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna bring you the four dumplings.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.871
When I'm walking over to the table...

15:55.037 --> 15:57.915
Maybe I get bumped,
one of the dumplings fall to the floor.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.125
No one has to know.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.086
I'll know.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.423
[Speaking in Chinese]

16:08.050 --> 16:10.553
- How about soup?
- Yeah, we can always divide soup.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.221
What about the won tons?

16:18.519 --> 16:20.229
Oh. Hey, guys, what's up?

16:20.396 --> 16:22.398
It's "halo" night.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.650
Yeah? Okay.

16:28.362 --> 16:31.365
With Wolowitz spending all of his time
with your friend Christy...

16:31.532 --> 16:35.536
She's not my friend. Friends do not
get their friends' care bears all sweaty.

16:36.537 --> 16:40.333
Right, anyway, uh,
with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere...

16:40.500 --> 16:42.919
We had something
we wanted to ask you.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.004
- Sheldon?
- Yes. Ahem.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.801
Penny,
we would very much appreciate it...

16:50.968 --> 16:53.596
If you would be the fourth member
of our "halo" team.

16:54.555 --> 16:58.434
I don't think I need to tell you
what an honor this is.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.021
Oh. That's so sweet.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.232
But I'm going out dancing
with a girlfriend.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.692
You can't go out, it's "halo" night.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.237
Well, for penny, it's dancing night.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.364
- You go dancing every Wednesday?
- No.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.823
Then it's not dancing night.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.327
Why don't I play with you tomorrow?

17:16.494 --> 17:19.956
Tonight is "halo" night.
It's like talking to a wall.

17:20.915 --> 17:24.502
All right, now, Sheldon,
you and I are about to have a problem.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.422
Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.342
Yes, but you didn't portray her
as completely irrational.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.803
All right, fellas, I gotta go.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.055
But good luck.

17:38.766 --> 17:42.436
Maybe we should've asked if we could go
dancing with her and her girlfriend.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.814
Okay, assuming we could dance,
which we can't...

17:44.981 --> 17:46.857
There are three of us and two of them.

17:47.024 --> 17:51.320
- So?
- It's the Chinese restaurant all over again.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.490
I assure you that cutting
a dumpling in thirds is child's play...

17:54.657 --> 17:58.911
Compared with three men each attempting
to dance with 67 percent of a woman.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.541
For god's sakes, Sheldon,
you are driving me crazy.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.043
Your anger is not with me,
but with mathematics.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.962
I'm pretty sure my anger is with you.

18:08.129 --> 18:10.840
What is happening to us?
We're falling apart.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.011

- The only man who can restore...

Howard: We can't get to the phone
right now because we 're having sex.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.400
Christy: You're not gonna put that
on your message, are you?

18:29.567 --> 18:31.327
Howard:
I'm just kidding. I '/I re-record it.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.528
[Beeps]

18:35.197 --> 18:36.532
Sheldon, think this through.

18:36.699 --> 18:39.702
You're going to ask Howard
to choose between sex and "halo."

18:39.869 --> 18:43.539
No, I'm going to ask him
to choose between sex and "halo 3."

18:44.040 --> 18:46.125
As far as I know,
sex has not been upgraded...

18:46.292 --> 18:49.462
To include hi-def graphics
and enhanced weapon systems.

18:49.629 --> 18:53.257
You're right, all sex has is nudity,
orgasms and human contact.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.384
My point.

18:55.885 --> 18:59.597
Christy: I'm just saying you can take the
damn plastic off the couch once in a while.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.891
Mrs. Wolowitz: Why, so you
and Howard can hump on it?

19:03.768 --> 19:06.062
Howard: Ladies, ladies,
I'm sure there's a middle ground.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.481

Christy: Shut up, Howard!

I'm gonna take my scooter out for a spin.

You drove your son out of the house.

And don't you take that tone with me,
you gold digger.

Christy: What'd you call me?
Mrs. Wolowitz: You heard me.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.751
You're barking up the wrong tree...

19:28.918 --> 19:32.004
Because as long as you're around,
Howard is out of the will.

I got better offers. I'm out of here.
