WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:06.965
No, see, the liquid-metal terminators
were created in the future by skynet...

00:07.132 --> 00:09.218
And skynet was developed
by miles Dyson...

00:09.384 --> 00:13.347
But that future no longer exists
due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.099
Okay, then riddle me this.

00:16.266 --> 00:17.935
Assuming all the good terminators...

00:18.101 --> 00:20.729
Were originally evil terminators
created by skynet...

00:20.896 --> 00:23.941
Then reprogrammed by the future
John Connor, why would skynet...

00:24.107 --> 00:26.026
An artificial computer intelligence...

00:26.193 --> 00:30.405
Bother to create
a petite, hot, 17-year-old killer robot?

00:32.282 --> 00:34.368
Skynet is kinky? I don't know.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.914
Artificial intelligences
do not have teen fetishes.

00:39.081 --> 00:42.125
- All right, wait. They use it to lure...
- Eh! Too late, I win.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.337
[Penny singing "out tonight"]

00:45.504 --> 00:48.966
Let's go out tonight

00:51.635 --> 00:56.932
I have to go out tonight

00:57.808 --> 00:59.768
what the hell is that?

01:00.644 --> 01:03.855
I don't know. But if cats could sing...

01:04.022 --> 01:05.732
They'd hate it too.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.393
Penny [singing]: You wanna prowl

01:12.489 --> 01:15.409
be my night owl? Well, take my...

01:15.576 --> 01:16.702
Hey, guys.

01:16.868 --> 01:19.079
- Hi, where are you going?
- What?

01:19.246 --> 01:22.666
We just had to mail some letters.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.003
And throw away some chicken.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.272
You'll never guess what just happened.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.898
- I give up.
- I don't guess.

01:47.065 --> 01:50.694
As a scientist, I reach conclusions
based on observation and experimentation.

01:51.653 --> 01:55.157
Although it occurs to me, you may
have been employing a rhetorical device...

01:55.324 --> 01:57.200
Rendering my response moot.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.413
- What was that?
- Believe it or not, personal growth.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.623
What happened?

02:02.789 --> 02:06.918
Remember when I auditioned for rent but I
didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?

02:07.085 --> 02:09.087
I have a conclusion
based on an observation.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.297
No, you don't.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.757
No, he doesn't.

02:12.215 --> 02:15.844
The girl picked to play Mimi, she dropped
out and they asked me to replace her.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.805
- Oh! Congratulations, what a lucky break.
- It's not a big deal.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.725
Just one night,
but they invite casting people and agents.

02:21.892 --> 02:22.934
So you never know.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.562
- I think I know.
- No, you don't.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.191
- He doesn't.
- It's this Friday at 8, you guys wanna come?

02:29.358 --> 02:30.525
-No.

02:32.194 --> 02:37.074
Because Friday,
we are attending a symposium...

02:37.240 --> 02:38.825
On molecular positronium.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.120
- I think that's a week from Tuesday at 6.
- No, it's this Friday.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.415
- At 8.
- Oh, too bad.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.876
- I gotta get to rehearsal. See you guys.
- See you.

02:48.126 --> 02:53.256
Penny [singing]:
Let's go out tonight

02:53.799 --> 02:55.926
- you just lied to penny.
- Yes, I did.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.427
And you did it so casually.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.555
No rapid breathing,
no increase in perspiration.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.933
- So?
- So lack of a physiological response...

03:03.100 --> 03:06.937
While lying
is characteristic of a violent sociopath.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.398
Sheldon, are you worried
about your safety?

03:09.564 --> 03:13.694
No. I imagine if you were going to kill me,
you'd have done it a long time ago.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.279
That's very true.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.077
Leonard?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.495
Leonard?

04:05.662 --> 04:07.706
-Leonard? Leonard: What?

04:09.583 --> 04:11.418
I need to speak to you.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.920
- It's 2:00 in the morning.
- It's important.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.673
| highly doubt that.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.842
Go away.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.806
Are you still out there?

04:28.810 --> 04:30.437
What?

04:31.313 --> 04:33.815
You're right, it can wait until morning.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.028
- Leonard: What, what, what?
- Never mind.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.739
I clearly woke you up
in the middle of a rem cycle.

04:40.906 --> 04:44.326
- You're in no state of mind to talk.
- Sheldon, what is it?

04:45.869 --> 04:48.997
I'm uncomfortable
having been included in your lie to penny.

04:49.581 --> 04:52.793
- What was I supposed to say?
- You could have told her the truth.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.586
That would have hurt her feelings.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.672
Is that a relevant factor?

04:59.216 --> 05:01.259
Then I suppose
you could have agreed to go.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.929
And what would I have said aftennards?

05:04.095 --> 05:06.181
I would suggest something
to the effect of:

05:06.348 --> 05:09.726
"Singing is neither an appropriate vocation
nor avocation for you...

05:09.893 --> 05:13.104
And if you disagree, I recommend
a cat scan to look for a tumor...

05:13.271 --> 05:16.817
Pressing on the cognitive
processing centers of your brain."

05:18.109 --> 05:19.236
I couldn't say that.

05:19.402 --> 05:23.698
I would have to say, "you were terrific
and I can't wait to hear you sing again."

05:24.324 --> 05:26.034
Why?

05:26.201 --> 05:27.994
It's the social protocol.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.204
It's what you do...

05:29.371 --> 05:32.749
When you have a friend who's proud
of something they really suck at.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.210
I was not aware of that.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.963
- Well, now you are.
- Oh, all right.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.631
- Leonard?
- Yes?

05:39.798 --> 05:43.677
When we played chess earlier, you were
terrific, and I can't wait to play you again.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.387
Good night.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.683
[Knocking on door]

05:49.850 --> 05:51.434
Sheldon: Leonard? Leonard?

05:51.601 --> 05:53.979
Leonard? Leonard?

05:54.145 --> 05:57.357
This would be so much easier
if I were a violent sociopath.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.943
Leonard? Leonard?

06:01.152 --> 06:03.488
- What?
- I was analyzing our lie...

06:03.655 --> 06:06.741
And I believe we're in danger
of penny seeing through the ruse.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.119
- How?
- Simple.

06:09.286 --> 06:14.457
If she were to log on to www.
Socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other...

06:14.624 --> 06:18.169
Click on upcoming events, scroll to
seminars, download the pdf schedule...

06:18.336 --> 06:21.131
And look for the seminar
on molecular positronium, then...

06:21.298 --> 06:25.010
Bippity boppity boo,
our pants are metaphorically on fire.

06:29.681 --> 06:33.059
Well, sir, my trousers
will not be igniting today.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.771
Penny?

06:36.938 --> 06:38.148
Penny?

06:38.315 --> 06:39.941
Penny?

06:40.483 --> 06:41.651
Good morning.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.529
- Do you have any idea what time it is?
- Of course I do.

06:44.696 --> 06:48.491
My watch is linked to the atomic clock
in Boulder, Colorado.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.119
It's accurate to one-tenth of a second.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.496
As I'm saying this
it occurs to me once again...

06:53.663 --> 06:56.207
Your question may
have been rhetorical.

06:56.666 --> 06:57.834
What do you want?

06:58.001 --> 07:00.295
Remember how Leonard told you
we couldn't come...

07:00.462 --> 07:03.965
Because we were attending a symposium
on molecular positronium?

07:05.634 --> 07:08.345
I remember symposium.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.473
Yes, well, he lied.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.725
Wait, what?

07:13.892 --> 07:17.187
He lied, and I'm feeling
very uncomfortable about it.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.397
Well, imagine how I'm feeling.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.150
Hungry?

07:23.652 --> 07:25.445
Tired?

07:25.612 --> 07:28.323
I'm sorry, this really
isn't my strong suit.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.367
You told her I lied?

07:30.533 --> 07:32.369
Why would you tell her I lied?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.871
To help you.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.374
I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.876
She was going to see
through your lie eventually...

07:40.043 --> 07:42.504
So I told her that you were lying
to protect me.

07:42.671 --> 07:43.755
[Leonard groans]

07:43.922 --> 07:46.508
Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.385
Hunger?

07:49.219 --> 07:50.220
Indigestion?

07:50.387 --> 07:52.514
I'm sorry,
I'm really not very good at this.

07:52.931 --> 07:55.642
Anyway, penny now believes
that on Friday night...

07:55.809 --> 08:00.480
We're going to participate
in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.649
Your cousin Leopold.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.360
Whom most people call Leo,
but he also answers to Lee.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.945
Remember that, it's important.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.489
- What's important?
- Details, Leonard.

08:09.656 --> 08:13.827
The success or failure of our
deceitful enterprise turns on details.

08:13.994 --> 08:17.539
- Do you have a cousin Leopold?
- No, I made him up.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.709
I think you'd call him Lee.

08:21.751 --> 08:25.547
I don't get it. I already told her a lie,
why replace it with a different lie?

08:25.714 --> 08:28.508
Well, first of all,
your lie was laughably transparent...

08:28.675 --> 08:31.094
Where mine is exquisitely convoluted.

08:32.303 --> 08:36.808
While you were sleeping,
I was weaving an UN-unravelable web.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.394
- UN-unravelable?
- Yes.

08:39.561 --> 08:42.480
If she googles Leopold Houston,
she'll find a Facebook page...

08:42.647 --> 08:45.233
An online blog
depicting his descent into drug use...

08:45.400 --> 08:49.112
And a desperate
yet hopeful listing on eharmony.Com.

08:49.946 --> 08:53.783
Okay, why would I go
to a drug intervention for your cousin?

08:53.950 --> 08:57.162
Ah! Because it's in long beach
and I don't drive.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.789
We're going to long beach?

08:59.956 --> 09:02.792
Of course not, there's no cousin Leo,
there's no intervention.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.587
- Focus, Leonard.
- Oh, come on.

09:06.463 --> 09:09.758
We just leave the house on Friday night
and return in the wee hours...

09:09.924 --> 09:13.678
Emotionally wrung out from the work
of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.346
So he goes back into rehab?

09:15.513 --> 09:20.769
Yes, but he can relapse if penny
ever invites us to hear her sing again.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.273
Yeah, for a noble purpose.

09:25.440 --> 09:29.194
To spare me the social embarrassment
of having a drug-addled first cousin.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.113
- Which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?
- I don't know.

09:33.656 --> 09:37.452
- How am I supposed to remember all this?
- That's the best part, you don't have to.

09:37.619 --> 09:41.623
I told penny that you would be embarrassed
if you knew she found out you had lied...

09:41.790 --> 09:45.668
So she's agreed to operate
as if the original lie is still in force.

09:48.338 --> 09:53.301
So she's expecting me to lie
about going to a symposium in Pasadena...

09:53.468 --> 09:58.473
When in actuality, we're pretending to
go to a drug intervention in long beach.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.475
UN-unravelable.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.316
Oh, hey, penny. Wow, look at you,
all ready for your showcase.

10:08.483 --> 10:09.984
-You look great. Penny: Thanks.

10:10.151 --> 10:14.322
I just wanted to come by and wish you
guys luck with your symposium.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.366
Leonard: Oh.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.993
- Well, thank you.
- You know, I gotta tell you.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.372
A lot of friends would let their friend
go alone, but that's not you.

10:22.539 --> 10:26.251
You are the kind of guy
who stands by a friend when...

10:26.417 --> 10:29.337
When he has a symposium to go to.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.717
I don't know what to say.

10:35.426 --> 10:38.805
- It's okay, Leonard.
- Oh, okay, all right, good.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.141
-Oh, boy, group hug. —uh-uh.

10:41.307 --> 10:45.270
- Uh-uh?
- Okay. So, what's up?

10:45.436 --> 10:49.566
Well, penny is on her way to perform in
a one-night showcase production of rent...

10:49.732 --> 10:53.027
Which we are unable to attend,
because we're going to a symposium...

10:53.194 --> 10:57.574
On molecular positronium
given by Dr. Emil farmanfarmian.

10:57.740 --> 11:02.245
Wait a minute, farmanfarmian is speaking
and you're bogarting the symposium?

11:02.453 --> 11:05.915
- Howard, I'm sorry, we would've...
- No, no, you're quark-blocking us.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.420
I don't know what to say.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.090
- Howard...
- It's your millennium falcon...

11:14.257 --> 11:17.093
You and Chewbacca do
whatever you wanna do.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.931
Me and Princess Leia here will find
some other way to spend the evening.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.766
Howard, wait.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.978
Sheldon, I think we should tell them.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.480
Okay, sure.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.232
I don't see a problem with that.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.569
There's no symposium.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.821
Leonard lied to me.
Isn't that right, Leonard?

11:36.988 --> 11:38.489
Well...

11:39.199 --> 11:42.660
- I don't know what to say.
- It's okay, I do.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.455
Look, Leonard is helping Sheldon
through a family crisis.

11:45.622 --> 11:50.293
He made up the whole story about
the symposium with Dr. Farmanfarmian...

11:50.460 --> 11:51.502
- Good for you.
- Ha! Yeah.

11:53.213 --> 11:57.091
He didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed.
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.177
Every family in america has a relative...

11:59.344 --> 12:02.472
Holed up in a garage somewhere
huffing paint thinner.

12:03.181 --> 12:06.100
No, I'm lost too.
I think she skipped a step.

12:06.893 --> 12:11.314
Now, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped
rehab and he's in a motel 8 in long beach.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.733
The whole family's going out
for an intervention.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.611
Leonard is driving Sheldon down
to help him through this...

12:16.778 --> 12:20.615
- Because he's such a good man.
- Oh, another hug? Thank you.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.577
- All right, you guys. Good luck.
- Thanks, penny.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.496
- Break a leg.
- Yeah, break a leg.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.457
So road trip to long beach.

12:29.624 --> 12:32.001
- We're not going to long beach.
- Why not?

12:32.168 --> 12:35.213
Because Sheldon doesn't have
a drug-addicted cousin Leopold.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.173
Oh, too bad.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.176
I've always wanted to go to long beach.

12:40.343 --> 12:43.137
It's a very nice community.
The queen Mary is docked there.

12:43.304 --> 12:46.683
Once the largest liner in the world,
it's now a hotel and restaurant...

12:46.849 --> 12:49.852
Where they host a surprisingly gripping
murder-mystery dinner.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.813
- Sounds fun.
- I'm game.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.190
- Shotgun.
- No, no, no.

12:54.899 --> 12:58.319
Leonard gets nauseous unless
he sits in front, and even then it's iffy.

13:00.029 --> 13:03.533
Wait, are we really going to long beach?

13:09.163 --> 13:10.206
[Knocking on door]

13:10.373 --> 13:13.251
Sheldon:
Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?

13:13.418 --> 13:15.086
Let it go, Sheldon.

13:15.253 --> 13:18.548
The murderer was the first mate
whether it makes sense to you or not.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.718
No, that's the least of our worries.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.720
I've been doing research on addiction...

13:23.886 --> 13:26.055
Both the biochemical
and behavioral aspects...

13:26.222 --> 13:29.434
And I think there's a problem
with the current version of our lie.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.562
What are you talking about?
It's fine, she bought it, it's over.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.693
Sadly, it's not.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.737
Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.448
But beyond that,
I have realized the Leo I described...

13:43.614 --> 13:47.368
- Would not have agreed to go to rehab.
- Why not?

13:47.535 --> 13:48.953
Because Leo's a middle child.

13:49.746 --> 13:53.041
There's no Leo. How can you say that?

13:56.252 --> 13:58.755
You didn't read the bio, did you?

13:58.921 --> 14:02.008
He's not just a middle child,
he is the quintessential middle child.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.886
From a broken home, to boot.
Psychologically speaking...

14:05.053 --> 14:08.473
The attention he gets by rebelling,
even to the point of destruction...

14:08.639 --> 14:11.601
Is more emotionally valuable
than help he would get at rehab.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.644
- I've got a solution.
- Great. What is it?

14:13.811 --> 14:16.105
Get out.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.441
Fine.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.990
I've hesitated to point this out...

14:26.157 --> 14:28.618
But I must remind you
we are in our predicament...

14:28.785 --> 14:31.079
Because of your initial
and inadequate deceit.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.289
I'm just trying to clean up
after your mess.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.545
Sheldon:
We'll talk in the morning.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.684
Morning.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.645
Who are you?

14:56.437 --> 14:58.022
I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.608
Oh, god.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.655
Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.532
Au contraire.

15:07.698 --> 15:08.991
I'm 26 years old...

15:09.158 --> 15:14.497
I'm originally from "denton, Texas,"
but I was a Navy brat.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.667
I was brought up on a variety
of military bases around the world.

15:17.834 --> 15:21.254
As a result, I've often felt like
an outsider, never really fitting in...

15:21.421 --> 15:23.881
Probably the reason
for my substance-abuse problem.

15:24.048 --> 15:27.009
Excuse me, we just went over this.

15:27.176 --> 15:31.639
As the middle child, your addiction
is rooted in your unmet need for attention.

15:31.806 --> 15:34.559
Oh, Sheldon, are we really gonna go
with pop psychology?

15:34.725 --> 15:37.562
For your information,
this is all based on solid research.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.314
Just stick with the character profile
I wrote for you.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.066
- Sheldon?
- I'm sorry.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.818
Leonard, this is Toby loobenfeld.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.696
He's a research assistant
in the particle-physics lab...

15:46.863 --> 15:50.032
But he also minored in theater at mit.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.034
It was more of a double major, actually.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.453
Theater and physics.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.539
You can guess which one
my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.

15:56.706 --> 15:57.874
Yeah, I got it.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.001
Sheldon, why?

16:00.168 --> 16:02.712
You see, while Leo would not
have gone into rehab...

16:02.879 --> 16:06.883
It is completely plausible that we would
have talked him into leaving the motel...

16:07.049 --> 16:09.218
- And coming home with us.
- Oh...

16:09.510 --> 16:11.554
Sheldon, how about this
as my motivation?

16:11.721 --> 16:12.889
When I was 14 years old...

16:13.055 --> 16:17.101
I was abused in the Philippines
by a clubfooted Navy chaplain.

16:18.686 --> 16:22.064
No, we're going with middle child
and a genetic predisposition...

16:22.231 --> 16:24.734
To inadequate serotonin production.

16:24.901 --> 16:27.695
Swell, well, how do I play
genetic predisposition?

16:28.863 --> 16:31.032
Subtextually, of course.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.409
[Knocking on door]

16:34.076 --> 16:36.245
Just have fun with it.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.628
- Morning, penny.
- Hi. How did the intervention go?

16:43.794 --> 16:46.714
Unfortunately, we weren't able
to convince him to go to rehab.

16:46.881 --> 16:50.092
Well, based on what you told me,
I'm not surprised.

16:52.553 --> 16:55.097
But we did convince him
to leave the motel.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.265
Come say hello.

16:58.017 --> 17:02.396
Leo, this is penny,
our friend and neighbor.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.775
Hi, Leo, how are you feeling?

17:11.072 --> 17:12.615
Let me ask you something, penny.

17:13.032 --> 17:17.286
Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel
covered in your own vomit...

17:17.453 --> 17:20.248
Next to a transsexual prostitute?

17:23.167 --> 17:27.296
- No.
- Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.

17:29.799 --> 17:30.841
Well, that's Leo.

17:31.008 --> 17:35.304
Hey, why don't you tell me
about your showcase last night?

17:35.471 --> 17:36.639
Oh, it was okay, I guess.

17:36.806 --> 17:39.350
Wasn't a big turnout,
but they both seemed to like it.

17:40.017 --> 17:44.313
- There were only two people there?
- By the end, yeah.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.316
Damn you, chaplain horrigan.

17:49.277 --> 17:50.695
I'm sorry?

17:50.861 --> 17:52.822
The Philippines.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.828
The subic bay naval station.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.998
A young boy on the cusp of manhood.

18:02.707 --> 18:07.545
His only companions,
mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitoes.

18:07.712 --> 18:11.048
Desperate and alone,
he reached out to a man...

18:11.215 --> 18:15.344
Who promised to introduce him
to a merciful, loving god...

18:15.511 --> 18:19.682
But who instead introduced him
to a gin-pickled tongue...

18:19.849 --> 18:23.686
Shoved down his adolescent throat.

18:26.355 --> 18:32.194
But to drink, shoot
and snort his pain away?

18:32.361 --> 18:34.822
Don't forget genetic predisposition
towards addiction.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.032
Never been proven.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.576
- There have been studies.
- Not double-blind studies.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.203
How could there be?
Who would be the control group?

18:41.370 --> 18:43.456
As you can see,
detoxing can get pretty ugly.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.708
- Let's give them some privacy.
- Yeah.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.668
Do you wanna come over,
have coffee?

18:47.835 --> 18:50.880
- Sounds good.
- I have a video of me singing last night.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.882
Do you wanna see it?

18:53.090 --> 18:55.676
- Gee, why wouldn't I?
- This is even better...

18:55.843 --> 18:59.013
Than you coming to the showcase,
now I get to watch you watch me.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.310
Funny how things work out.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.063
But he loved the companionship
and the wisdom...

19:07.229 --> 19:09.732
That his own father failed to provide.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.610
Your parents made the right decision.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.160
I cannot work like this.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.249
[Man speaking indistinctly
on TV]

19:30.670 --> 19:36.258
This is amazing, just sitting on a couch
watching TV with a woman.

19:36.425 --> 19:41.889
Not being drunk or high
or wondering if you're a dude down there.

19:43.683 --> 19:47.228
Leo, you are a very sweet,
really funny guy.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.522
You're gonna do okay.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.024
One day at a time, penny.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.863
One day at a time.

20:02.368 --> 20:05.037
How long is he going to stay here?

20:05.204 --> 20:08.958
He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard,
where is he going to go?

20:09.166 --> 20:11.877
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
