00:02.503 --> 00:05.672
All right,
I'm moving my infantry division...

00:05.839 --> 00:08.759
Augmented by a battalion of orcs
from lord of the rings.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.594
We flank the Tennessee volunteers...

00:10.761 --> 00:13.931
And the north once again
wins the battle of gettysburg.

00:14.097 --> 00:17.184
Not so fast. Remember, the south
still has two infantry divisions.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.645
Plus Superman and Godzilla.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.688
No, no, no. Orcs are magic.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.357
Superman is vulnerable to magic.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.567
Not to mention,
you already lost Godzilla...

00:25.734 --> 00:28.028
To the Illinois cavalry and hulk.

00:28.445 --> 00:32.407
Why don't you just have Robert e. Lee
charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?

00:32.574 --> 00:34.159
- You guys ready to order?
- Hang on.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.580
The hindu gods
against the entire union army?

00:38.747 --> 00:40.457
And orcs.

00:42.292 --> 00:45.796
Excuse me. Ganesh is the remover
of obstacles and Shiva's the destroyer.

00:45.963 --> 00:48.549
When the smoke clears,
Lincoln will be speaking hindi...

00:48.715 --> 00:50.300
And drinking mintjuleps.

00:50.842 --> 00:54.263
My boss says you have to either
order or leave and never come back.

00:54.930 --> 00:57.808
What do you recommend for someone
with a man-sized appetite...

00:57.975 --> 01:00.435
From a morning of
weight-training and cardio-funk?

01:00.602 --> 01:01.687
A shower.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.065
I'll take the heart-smart platter.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.317
All right, thank you. And Sheldon?

01:07.484 --> 01:09.736
We don't eat here.
I don't know what's good.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.447
- Well, it's all good.
- Statistically unlikely.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.325
Just get a hamburger.
You like hamburgers.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.494
I like the hamburgers
where we usually eat.

01:17.661 --> 01:20.706
You can't make the assumption
that I'll like the hamburgers here.

01:20.872 --> 01:23.500
I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.544
Which one,
the classic, the ranch house...

01:25.711 --> 01:27.921
The barbeque burger
or the Kobe burger?

01:28.088 --> 01:30.007
Can't we just go to big boy?

01:30.173 --> 01:34.803
- They only have one burger, the big boy.
- The barbeque burger's like the big boy.

01:34.970 --> 01:37.347
In a world that already
includes a big boy...

01:37.514 --> 01:39.850
Why would I settle for something
like a big boy?

01:40.017 --> 01:42.144
Because you are not at big boy.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.856
- Fine. I'll have the barbeque burger.
- Make it two.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.317
Waitresses don't yell at you at big boy.

01:49.526 --> 01:50.902
Hey, Leonard. Hi, guys.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.237
- Hey.
- Hey, Leslie.

01:52.404 --> 01:56.116
- I didn't know you ate here.
- We don't. This is a disturbing aberration.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.494
Leslie, this is penny, she lives across
the hall from Sheldon and me.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.414
And walks in quiet beauty
like the night.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.083
Howard, I've asked you not to do that.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.629
Leslie and I do research together
at the university.

02:08.837 --> 02:11.006
Oh, wow. A girl scientist.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.467
Yep. Come for the breasts,
stay for the brains.

02:14.384 --> 02:15.636
So I'm glad I ran into you.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.513
The physics department string quartet
needs a new cellist.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.057
What happened to Elliott wong?

02:20.223 --> 02:23.101
Switched over to high-energy
radiation research, had a mishap.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.188
And now the other guys
are uncomfortable sitting next to him.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.565
- So are you in?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

02:28.732 --> 02:32.110
- We rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.
- Why at my place?

02:32.277 --> 02:35.614
Yeah, department of energy said
our regular space is kind of a hot zone.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.408
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you too.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.786
Leonard, I didn't know
you played the cello.

02:40.952 --> 02:43.121
Yeah, my parents felt
that naming me Leonard...

02:43.288 --> 02:45.582
And putting me
in advanced-placement classes...

02:45.749 --> 02:47.668
Wasn't getting me beaten up enough.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.587
If you're into music, I happen
to be a human beatbox...

02:50.754 --> 02:52.339
-Really?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.508
[Beatboxing]

02:59.179 --> 03:01.264
I'm actually not that into music.

03:02.265 --> 03:05.143
Your friend's really cute.
Anything going on with you two?

03:05.686 --> 03:06.812
Leshe?

03:06.978 --> 03:09.272
No, no. What, are you kidding?

03:09.439 --> 03:12.442
He asked her out once.
It was an embarrassing failure.

03:12.776 --> 03:13.819
Thank you, Sheldon.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.154
I'm sorry.
Was that supposed to be a secret?

03:17.364 --> 03:20.117
That's too bad.
You guys would make a cute couple.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.578
- Oh, dear.
- What's the matter?

03:23.745 --> 03:24.913
She didn't take my order.

03:25.080 --> 03:28.291
How could she take your order
when you're too neurotic to talk to her?

03:29.084 --> 03:32.462
Nevertheless,
this will be reflected in her tip.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.968
Leonard: What did penny mean,
"you'd make a cute couple"?

03:38.135 --> 03:39.803
I assume she meant
the two of you...

03:39.970 --> 03:43.515
Would constitute a couple
that others might consider cute.

03:45.142 --> 03:49.855
An alternate and less likely interpretation
is that you could manufacture one.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.734
As in, "look, Leonard and Leslie
made Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.694
Aren't they adorable?"

03:55.861 --> 03:58.447
If penny didn't know
that Leslie had turned me down...

03:58.613 --> 04:02.826
Then that would mean that she, penny,
thought I should ask her, Leslie, out...

04:02.993 --> 04:05.829
Indicating that penny had no interest
in me asking her out.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.331
But because she did know
I had asked Leslie out...

04:08.498 --> 04:10.584
And that she, Leslie,
had turned me down...

04:10.751 --> 04:14.171
Then she, penny,
could be offering consolation.

04:15.547 --> 04:18.341
"That's too bad,
you would have made a cute couple."

04:18.508 --> 04:22.929
But while thinking,
"good, Leonard remains available."

04:24.055 --> 04:26.433
You're a lucky man, Leonard.

04:27.684 --> 04:28.727
How so?

04:28.894 --> 04:31.146
You're talking to one of
the three men in the west...

04:31.313 --> 04:33.732
Capable of following
that train of thought.

04:34.858 --> 04:35.984
Well, what do you think?

04:36.151 --> 04:39.154
I said I could follow it,
I didn't say I cared.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.430
[Playing classical music]

05:09.726 --> 05:12.312
I admire your fingering.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.439
Thank you.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.401
Maybe sometime you can
try that on my instrument.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.042
- Leslie: Good night, guys. Good job.
- Thanks.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.580
See you next week.

05:30.914 --> 05:33.583
- That was fun. Thanks for including me.
- You're welcome.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.962
If you're up for it, we could practice
that middle section again.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.047
Sure. Why not?

05:39.214 --> 05:41.216
[Starts playing]

05:44.928 --> 05:48.306
Just so we're clear, you understand
me hanging back to practice with you...

05:48.473 --> 05:51.059
Is a pretext for letting you know
that I'm sexually available.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.228
[Clattering]

05:58.483 --> 05:59.776
Really?

05:59.943 --> 06:01.319
Yeah, I'm good to go.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.989
I thought you weren't interested in me.

06:04.155 --> 06:08.618
That was before I saw you handling that
beautiful piece of wood between your legs.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.038
You mean my cello.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.666
No, I mean the obvious,
crude double entendre.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.877
I'm seducing you.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.005
No kidding.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.675
What can I say?
I'm a passionate and impulsive woman.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.594
So how about it?

06:28.722 --> 06:32.183
- Is it the waitress?
- Penny? What about her?

06:32.350 --> 06:34.644
I saw your pupils dilate
when you looked at her...

06:34.811 --> 06:38.189
Which, unless you're a heroin addict,
points to sexual attraction.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.693
I did have a poppy-seed bagel
for breakfast...

06:41.860 --> 06:44.654
Which could give
a positive urine test for opiates...

06:44.821 --> 06:46.656
But certainly not dilate my pupils...

06:46.823 --> 06:49.743
So I guess there was no point
in bringing it up.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.663
- You and the waitress, then.
- No, no.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.499
There's nothing going on
between penny and me.

06:56.708 --> 06:59.127
So you're open to a sexual relationship?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.297
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.049
- Good.
- Yeah, it is.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.884
It is good.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.179
Did you wanna start now?

07:09.346 --> 07:12.474
- Why don't we finish this section first?
- Oh, okay.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.768
A little musical foreplay. Terrific.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.721
Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What's going on?

07:52.138 --> 07:54.474
I need your opinion
on a matter of semiotics.

07:55.016 --> 07:58.228
- I'm sorry?
- Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols.

07:58.395 --> 08:01.523
It's a branch of philosophy
related to linguistics.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.528
Okay, sweetie, I know you think
you're explaining yourself...

08:06.695 --> 08:09.114

08:18.415 --> 08:21.459
- Well, what?
- What does it mean?

08:21.793 --> 08:23.628
Come on, you went to college.

08:23.795 --> 08:26.089
Yes, but I was 11.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.678
A tie on the doorknob usually means
someone doesn't wanna be disturbed...

08:31.845 --> 08:36.182
Because they're, you know,
getting busy.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.269
So you're saying
Leonard has a girl in there?

08:39.436 --> 08:44.232
Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack
and gotten really into Bryan Adams.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.318
Leslie [flatly]:
Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.

08:50.822 --> 08:53.450
We really shouldn't be standing here.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.370
This is very awkward.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.874
Oh, come on. You know,
Leonard's had girls over before, right?

09:01.041 --> 09:05.295
Oh, yes. But there's usually planning,
courtship, advance notice.

09:05.837 --> 09:10.675
You know, last time, I was able to book a
cruise to the arctic to see a solar eclipse.

09:11.593 --> 09:15.096
Wait, wait. You had to leave the state
because your roommate was having sex?

09:15.263 --> 09:18.308
I didn't have to.
The dates just happened to coincide.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.188

Well, there's Leonard.

Why do you ask?

13:51.289 --> 13:55.126
Well, a little bird told me that
you and Leslie hooked up last night.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.797
-Sheldon! Sheldon: I'm coming.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.550
So is it serious? Do you like her?

14:05.219 --> 14:09.682
That's really two different questions.
I'm not...

14:09.849 --> 14:11.601
Sheldon, we have to go.

14:11.768 --> 14:16.105
Boy, you're wound awfully tight
for a man who just had sexual intercourse.

14:17.523 --> 14:21.569
All right, well, I'll talk to you later.
But I am so happy for you, Leonard.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.447
Thank you.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.783
[Door closes]

14:26.991 --> 14:29.952
What did she mean, she's happy for me?

14:30.119 --> 14:33.748
Is she happy because I'm seeing someone
or because she thinks I'm happy?

14:33.915 --> 14:36.959
Because anyone who cared for someone
would want them to be happy...

14:37.126 --> 14:40.797
Even if the reason for their happiness
made the first person unhappy.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.341
You know, because the second person,
though happy...

14:43.508 --> 14:46.886
Is now romantically unavailable
to the first person.

14:47.053 --> 14:51.557
Do you realize I may have to share
a nobel prize with your Booty call?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.270
You know what?

14:56.437 --> 14:58.022
I'm being ridiculous.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.566
But who cares what penny thinks?

15:00.733 --> 15:03.903
Leslie is a terrific girl.
She's attractive. We like each other.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.655
She's extremely intelligent.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.699
Sheldon: She's not that intelligent.
Leonard: She fixed your equation.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.186
Sheldon: She got lucky.
Leonard: You don't believe in luck.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.830
I don't have to believe in it
for her to be lucky.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.333
Regardless, I have a chance
at a real relationship with Leslie.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.670
I'm not gonna pass that up for
some hypothetical future happiness...

15:20.837 --> 15:23.840
With a woman who may
or may not want me to be happy...

15:24.006 --> 15:27.427
With the woman
who is currently making me happy.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.416
Sheldon: Leonard. Leonard: Yeah?

15:29.512 --> 15:31.722
Sheldon: I still don't care.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.190
Hey, Leslie.

15:41.357 --> 15:44.819
Careful, Leonard. Liquid nitrogen,
320 degrees below zero.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.997
Why are you smashing
a flash-frozen banana?

15:56.164 --> 15:59.208
Because I got a bowl of cheerios
and I couldn't find a knife.

16:01.210 --> 16:05.423
So anyway, hello.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.218
What are you doing?

16:09.385 --> 16:11.637
Just extending the intimacy.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.140
Hey, do you wanna slip over
to the radiation lab...

16:14.307 --> 16:17.143
And share a decontamination shower?

16:19.979 --> 16:24.275
Okay, what exactly do you think's
going on between us?

16:25.067 --> 16:29.405
I'm not sure, but I think I'm about
to discover how the banana felt.

16:33.117 --> 16:37.538
Neither of us are neuroscientists, but we
both understand the biochemistry of sex.

16:37.705 --> 16:41.125
Dopamine in our brains is released
across synapses, causing pleasure.

16:41.292 --> 16:44.086
Stick electrodes in a rat's brain,
give him an orgasm button.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.964
He'll push that thing
until he starves to death.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.008
Well, who wouldn't? Heh.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.052
The difference between us and the rat...

16:51.219 --> 16:53.763
Is you can't stick an electrode
in our hypothalamus.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.431
That's where you come in.

16:57.433 --> 17:00.436
Yeah, well,
I'm just glad to be a part of it. Heh.

17:01.604 --> 17:02.813
So, what happens now?

17:02.980 --> 17:06.734
Well, I don't know about your sex drive,
but I'm probably good till new year's.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.572
Okay.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.408
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

17:17.245 --> 17:20.373
- You wanna make plans for new year's?
- Please, you're smothering me.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.416
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:23.251 --> 17:26.003
Hey, look. It's Dr. Stud.

17:27.255 --> 17:28.297
Doctor what?

17:28.464 --> 17:31.133
The blogosphere is abuzzing
with news of you and Leslie...

17:31.300 --> 17:34.428
Making the bang, bang music.

17:34.971 --> 17:38.808
- Well, how did it get on the Internet?
- I put it there.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.018
Well, how did you know about it?

17:41.185 --> 17:42.853
A little bird told us.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.816
Apparently, you are a magnificent beast.

17:49.277 --> 17:51.821
Well, that part's true.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.703
I think I may have
misjudged this restaurant.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.997
- No kidding.
- I don't wanna go out on a limb...

18:01.163 --> 18:04.375
But I think we may be looking
at my new Tuesday hamburger.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.838
Your old Tuesday hamburger
will be so brokenhearted.

18:09.672 --> 18:10.715
Way ahead of you.

18:10.881 --> 18:15.428
I was thinking of moving big boy to
Thursdays and just dropping souplantation.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.850
The name always confused me, anyway.
Souplantation.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.852
You can't grow soup.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.774
- So how's everything?
- Terrific.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.945
You'll be happy to know I plan to come
every Tuesday for the foreseeable future.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.032
Really? Oh, yay. Heh.

18:36.824 --> 18:39.702
Who do I speak to about
permanently reserving this table?

18:40.453 --> 18:43.205
I don't know, a psychiatrist?

18:44.582 --> 18:46.042
Penny: So, hey.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.587
- How are things with you and Leslie?
- Oh.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.465
To be honest,
I don't think it's going to work out.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.510
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, hey, don't worry.

18:56.677 --> 19:00.139
I'm sure there's someone out there
who's just right for you.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.645
Well, what did she mean by that?

19:06.020 --> 19:10.232
Was that just a generic platitude
or was that a subtle bid for attention?

19:12.234 --> 19:15.655
You know why this hamburger
surpasses the big boy?

19:15.988 --> 19:18.991
This is a single-Decker,
whereas the big boy is a double-Decker.

19:19.158 --> 19:23.245
This has a much more satisfying
meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.582
- Are you even listening to me?
- Of course I'm listening.

19:26.749 --> 19:30.419
Blah, blah, hopeless penny delusion,
blah, blah, blah.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.048
Okay, then.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.761
You know, you can grow
the ingredients for soup.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.627
