00:02.679 --> 00:06.775
My new book, The Hidden Reality,
takes on a grand question:

00:06.950 --> 00:09.942
Is our universe the only universe?

00:10.286 --> 00:13.346
You see, there's a growing belief
among scientists like me...

00:13.523 --> 00:16.822
...that ours may only be one
among many universes...

00:16.993 --> 00:18.984
...populating a gigantic cosmos.

00:19.529 --> 00:21.861
In The Hidden Reality,
I explore possibility...

00:22.031 --> 00:25.057
...without presuming any knowledge
of mathematics or physics...

00:25.235 --> 00:26.725
...on the part of the reader.

00:26.936 --> 00:29.131
Hysterical.

00:29.939 --> 00:31.702
I'm glad you talked me into this.

00:31.875 --> 00:35.709
We work so hard, sometimes it's nice
to goof off and do something silly.

00:35.879 --> 00:36.971
Agreed.

00:37.147 --> 00:40.480
Wait till you hear how he dumbs down
Werner Heisenberg for the crowd.

00:40.650 --> 00:43.517
You may actually believe
you're in a comedy club.

00:43.686 --> 00:46.553
You can think about Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle...

00:46.723 --> 00:50.420
...much like the special order menu
that you find in Chinese restaurants...

00:50.593 --> 00:54.029
...where you have dishes in column A
and other dishes in column B...

00:54.197 --> 00:58.361
...and if you order the dish in column A,
you can't order the dish in column B.

00:58.535 --> 01:01.003
That's sort of like
the uncertainly principle.

01:01.838 --> 01:03.703
Ba-rum-bum.

01:06.176 --> 01:09.168
Say, I heard an interesting tidbit
about Howard and Bernadette.

01:09.579 --> 01:11.376
Really, Amy? Gossip?

01:11.548 --> 01:13.038
I'm disappointed in you.

01:13.216 --> 01:17.277
Now, now. Evolutionary biologist
Robin Dunbar has identified gossip...

01:17.487 --> 01:19.785
...as an aid to social bonding
in large groups.

01:20.223 --> 01:23.624
Forgive my language, but poppycock.

01:23.793 --> 01:26.626
What if he's right?
And by not participating in gossip...

01:26.796 --> 01:30.254
...society breaks down into feral bands
of tattooed motorcycle riders...

01:30.433 --> 01:33.129
...fighting to the death
over a few cans of tuna fish?

01:33.303 --> 01:36.363
Fine. In the parlance
of the urban music scene:

01:36.539 --> 01:39.007
"What's the 411"?

01:39.943 --> 01:42.605
Bernadette is thinking
about breaking up with Howard.

01:43.112 --> 01:45.945
I believe our nation's
tuna cans are safe.

01:46.115 --> 01:48.709
Excuse me. Ahem. Dr. Greene, question?

01:49.419 --> 01:50.579
Yes?

01:50.753 --> 01:54.086
You've dedicated your life's work
to educating the general populace...

01:54.257 --> 01:56.589
...about complex scientific ideas.

01:56.759 --> 01:57.817
Yes, in part.

01:58.027 --> 02:01.326
Have you ever considered
trying to do something useful?

02:03.766 --> 02:06.326
Perhaps reading to the elderly?

02:07.036 --> 02:08.094
Excuse me?

02:08.271 --> 02:11.399
Yeah, but not your books.
Something they might enjoy.

02:13.243 --> 02:15.143
I kid, of course. Big fan.

02:48.978 --> 02:51.845
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

02:52.548 --> 02:55.813
My father taught me archery
as a child.

03:00.256 --> 03:04.488
It's odd how the activity
brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.

03:05.995 --> 03:08.589
- Perfect.
- I know.

03:09.098 --> 03:11.623
What an elf I would have made.

03:14.203 --> 03:16.797
- Ooh. What do you think you're doing?
- Shooting a target?

03:16.973 --> 03:18.998
- With what?
- An arrow.

03:19.175 --> 03:22.667
Really? I didn't see you draw one
from your quiver.

03:23.346 --> 03:24.973
I'm not gonna do that, Sheldon.

03:25.148 --> 03:27.946
Leonard, the people at Nintendo
can only go so far...

03:28.117 --> 03:31.814
...in helping us re-create
an actual athletic experience.

03:31.988 --> 03:33.319
We have to do our part too.

03:40.997 --> 03:45.491
That was uncalled for,
but I'll play along. Ow.

03:49.605 --> 03:52.506
I had an unusual experience
with Amy last night.

03:52.675 --> 03:55.542
Really? How could you tell?

03:57.380 --> 04:00.213
She was attempting
to engage me in gossip.

04:00.650 --> 04:02.049
- You don't say.
- Yes.

04:02.218 --> 04:06.712
I think prolonged exposure to Penny has
turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.

04:07.357 --> 04:08.585
So, what's the gossip?

04:08.758 --> 04:10.726
Oh, please, I was just pointing it out.

04:10.893 --> 04:13.157
I have no desire
to engage in the activity.

04:13.329 --> 04:14.387
Fine, don't tell me.

04:16.265 --> 04:18.233
All right, get this.

04:19.502 --> 04:22.562
Bernadette is thinking about
breaking up with Howard.

04:22.739 --> 04:26.072
Oh, that's too bad.
I wonder what happened.

04:26.242 --> 04:28.039
Hard to say. I can only speculate...

04:28.211 --> 04:31.442
...based on data I collected
watching my parents' marriage implode.

04:32.081 --> 04:35.016
In that case, the woman dives
into religion...

04:35.184 --> 04:37.778
...while the man dives
into a bottle-blond bartender...

04:37.954 --> 04:41.082
...who tries to buy my love
with action figures.

04:42.158 --> 04:44.353
Ooh. Out of arrows.

[MAKES POPPING SOUND]

04:55.271 --> 04:58.035
Boy, you sure get your money's worth
out of these games.

05:01.044 --> 05:03.706
- Priya, can I come in?
PRIYA: Sure.

05:05.548 --> 05:07.277
Oh, God.

05:07.483 --> 05:09.212
- What?
- It's okay. You didn't know.

05:09.385 --> 05:11.182
I'll take care of it.

05:12.388 --> 05:13.912
What did I do?

05:14.090 --> 05:16.888
Sheldon doesn't allow flossing
that close to the mirror.

05:17.060 --> 05:18.118
You're kidding.

05:18.294 --> 05:19.818
It's a splatter thing.

05:19.996 --> 05:23.432
There's a piece of tape on the floor
you're supposed to stand behind.

05:23.599 --> 05:25.396
- That's madness.
- I know.

05:25.568 --> 05:27.627
Do it.
There's a big inspection coming up...

05:27.804 --> 05:30.466
...and I don't wanna lose
my TV privileges.

05:31.274 --> 05:34.402
You really need to let me take a look
at that roommate agreement.

05:35.111 --> 05:37.807
I don't know.
I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer.

05:37.980 --> 05:40.710
It's just easier
to stand behind the tape.

05:41.017 --> 05:44.418
Oh, by the way, a fellow at work said
I could use his Dodger tickets.

05:44.587 --> 05:49.354
- Does that sound like fun?
- Yeah. Dodgers are baseball, right?

05:49.525 --> 05:51.356
You'll need to explain the game
to me.

05:51.994 --> 05:53.086
It's complicated.

05:53.262 --> 05:55.196
But as I remember it,
the essentials are:

05:55.364 --> 05:58.299
Get chosen last, get hit by the ball,
cry, go home.

05:59.001 --> 06:02.129
Well, regardless, I've got four tickets.

06:02.305 --> 06:04.466
I was thinking
we bring Bernadette and Howard.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.837
She's really interesting,
and I bet I can get used to him.

06:08.177 --> 06:11.044
Well, it might not be a great idea
to invite those two.

06:11.247 --> 06:12.646
Why not?

06:12.815 --> 06:16.046
Don't tell anybody I told you,
she might be breaking up with him.

06:16.252 --> 06:17.879
Oh, too bad.

06:18.054 --> 06:20.648
I do know one person
for whom that's good news.

06:20.823 --> 06:22.484
- Really? Who?
- My brother.

06:22.658 --> 06:25.149
He's got a big crush on Bernadette.

06:27.330 --> 06:28.888
What?

06:29.065 --> 06:30.327
You're kidding.

06:30.500 --> 06:35.233
No. I found poems he wrote about her.
Very disturbing.

06:35.404 --> 06:38.805
Oh, Bernadette
Please play my clarinet

06:41.410 --> 06:44.345
- Wow, that's hard to believe.
- Yes.

06:44.514 --> 06:47.005
And for years,
everyone in my family was convinced...

06:47.183 --> 06:50.675
...he was the clarinet enthusiast.

06:51.821 --> 06:56.019
- Hm. What's that piece of tape?
- That one doesn't apply to you. You sit.

06:58.928 --> 07:00.589
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

07:00.796 --> 07:04.596
- Hear about Howard and Bernadette?
- I heard. How did you hear about it?

07:05.101 --> 07:07.592
I heard about it from Sheldon.
He got it from Amy.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.601
PENNY: Oh, damn it. I told Amy that
in the strictest confidence.

07:10.806 --> 07:13.570
Boy, some people
are such blabbermouths.

07:14.043 --> 07:16.841
Well, whatever.
I'm sure Bernadette can do better.

07:17.013 --> 07:20.073
Do you think a sexually ambivalent
Indian astrophysicist...

07:20.249 --> 07:22.046
...with mutism and alcohol issues...

07:22.218 --> 07:25.881
...is better than a hundred-pound
Jewish guy who lives with his mom?

07:26.956 --> 07:28.924
You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?

07:29.091 --> 07:32.527
I didn't say Raj. Who said Raj?

07:33.429 --> 07:35.954
Okay, give. How do you know?
Did he tell you?

07:36.132 --> 07:38.430
- No.
- Well, then who?

07:38.601 --> 07:40.262
I can't say.

07:40.436 --> 07:43.894
Priya told you. What a little gossip.

07:44.073 --> 07:46.234
Not an attractive quality
in a woman, Leonard.

07:46.409 --> 07:49.207
Not judging, just my opinion.

07:50.279 --> 07:54.215
The point is, if this got out, it would
destroy Howard and Raj's friendship.

07:54.383 --> 07:58.911
You don't have to worry. Unlike Amy
and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.

07:59.956 --> 08:01.821
You told Amy in the first place.

08:01.991 --> 08:03.549
In confidence.

08:09.498 --> 08:11.966
Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.
How are you?

08:12.134 --> 08:14.125
We're very rich in a very poor country.

08:14.303 --> 08:16.737
So all in all, can't complain.

08:18.074 --> 08:21.510
So, Priya, how are you enjoying
staying with your brother?

08:21.677 --> 08:24.737
It's fine. But if I'm going to stay
in Los Angeles much longer...

08:24.914 --> 08:27.348
...I think I should get my own place.
MRS. KOOTHRAPPALl: Why?

08:27.516 --> 08:29.746
Is Rajesh not making you
feel comfortable?

08:29.919 --> 08:33.184
Rajesh, why aren't you
making your sister comfortable?

08:33.389 --> 08:34.981
I am making her comfortable.

08:35.157 --> 08:37.216
Besides, she's not sleeping here
half the time anyw...

08:40.129 --> 08:42.654
What? Where are you sleeping, Priya?

08:42.832 --> 08:44.629
It's a figure of speech, Daddy.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.598
It means I work late.

08:48.304 --> 08:51.603
Tell me you're not dating an American.
I knew this would happen.

08:51.774 --> 08:55.175
Rajesh, are you letting your sister
date that little Howard boy?

08:56.712 --> 08:58.873
Now, hold on.
If she is dating an American...

...that's not a bad way to go.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.049
- For now.
- What?

09:09.225 --> 09:10.351
I'll tell you later.

09:10.526 --> 09:12.460
Is something going on
with Bernadette?

09:12.628 --> 09:15.222
- Who's Bernadette?
- Doesn't sound Jewish.

09:15.431 --> 09:19.333
You can't tell by that.

DR. KOOTHRAPPALl:
Okay, we're getting off the subject.

09:22.505 --> 09:25.565
I want you to try harder
to make your sister feel welcome.

09:39.155 --> 09:42.522
- You should have kept your mouth shut.
- Fair enough.

09:42.692 --> 09:44.990
Now, what's up with clarinet...

09:50.232 --> 09:52.530

about Dr. Greene's efforts...

09:52.702 --> 09:55.170
...to make science palatable
for the masses.

That's all.
I've just been thinking about it.

10:01.977 --> 10:05.003
Now I'm thinking
about fractal equations.

10:06.415 --> 10:10.351
Now I'm thinking about the origin
of the phrase "train of thought."

10:10.986 --> 10:13.477
Now I'm thinking about trains.

11:55.357 --> 11:57.222
- No.
- Fascinating work.

to smoke cigarettes.

12:01.464 --> 12:02.829

12:02.998 --> 12:07.367
Yes. He looks much cooler
than the non-smoking monkeys.

12:07.837 --> 12:09.202
It's not much of a contest.

12:09.371 --> 12:12.204
The other monkeys just sit around
and masturbate.

to stop listening to you and start talking.

indicated an impending breakup.

I know. The group consensus is
that his proposal will be met...

...with a humiliating,
soul-crushing rejection.

12:43.239 --> 12:45.730
Although, oddly, no one tweeted.

- Are you familiar with meme theory?
- I'm familiar with everything, but go on.

12:57.019 --> 13:00.250
Meme theory suggests that items
of gossip are like living things...

13:00.422 --> 13:03.050
...that seek to reproduce
using humans as their host.

13:03.425 --> 13:06.292
I'm no stranger
to memetic epidemiology.

13:06.462 --> 13:08.089
At Johnson Elementary School...

13:08.264 --> 13:12.894
...the phrase "Shelly Cooper's
a smelly pooper" spread like wildfire.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.031
I should think so.

13:16.205 --> 13:18.139
That's gold.

13:21.210 --> 13:24.475
Your meme hypothesis
does intrigue me.

13:24.647 --> 13:26.740
How might we examine this
more closely?

13:27.483 --> 13:30.611
Do you have any ethical qualms
regarding human experimentation?

13:30.986 --> 13:35.582
It's one of the few forms of interaction
with people that I don't find repellent.

13:36.091 --> 13:39.083
We need to fabricate
a tantalizing piece of gossip.

13:39.495 --> 13:42.760
And a second non-tantalizing piece
to use as a control.

13:42.932 --> 13:45.127
Track its progress
through our social group...

13:45.301 --> 13:47.565
...interpret results
through academic prisms...

13:47.736 --> 13:51.866
...of memetic theory, algebraic gossip
and epidemiology.

13:52.408 --> 13:56.936
Look at you, getting me to engage
in the social sciences.

13:58.681 --> 14:01.980
You're a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.

14:07.990 --> 14:09.252
Oh, hey, Amy. What's up?

14:09.425 --> 14:11.188
Sheldon and I engaged in intercourse.

14:11.393 --> 14:15.523
In other news, I'm thinking of starting an
herb garden. Mum's the word. Gotta go.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.666
Oh, hey, Raj,
what are you doing here?

14:23.105 --> 14:27.508
I just felt like drinking alone
because I'm deep and dark.

14:28.344 --> 14:31.177
Uh-huh. So Howard's not here?

14:31.347 --> 14:33.679
No. One of those times
when it's just you and me.

14:33.849 --> 14:37.046
Like when we went to the movies
and waited outside the bathroom...

14:37.219 --> 14:40.017
...while Howard threw up
Red Vines and cherry Coke.

14:41.790 --> 14:43.883
- Do you remember that?
- Yeah.

14:44.059 --> 14:46.926
Me too. Good times.

14:47.997 --> 14:49.862
Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers.

14:50.032 --> 14:53.229
- Oh, thanks.
- This was nice.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.066
What are you doing?
Howard's your best friend.

14:59.241 --> 15:01.801
That is his girlfriend.
Be ashamed of yourself.

15:01.977 --> 15:06.243
I was when I came in, but it's amazing
what liquor does to guilt.

15:06.548 --> 15:10.507
What you might not know is Bernadette
is planning on breaking up with Howard.

15:10.686 --> 15:13.018
- I know. How do you know?
- My sister told me.

15:13.188 --> 15:15.656
Oh, that gossipy bitch.

15:17.526 --> 15:18.993
- No offense.
- None taken.

15:19.161 --> 15:21.356
You should hear
how she talks about you.

15:23.365 --> 15:26.095
Just because Howard and Bernadette
are having problems...

15:26.268 --> 15:28.532
...does not mean
you should be sniffing around.

15:28.704 --> 15:31.502
What can I do?
I can't stop thinking about her.

15:31.674 --> 15:34.108
All right, try thinking about this.

15:34.276 --> 15:35.903
Sheldon and Amy had sex.

15:36.745 --> 15:39.839
Shut your ass.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.748
Yeah, it's true. Amy told me.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.683
How did that even happen?

15:46.855 --> 15:50.382
Did they know that's what they
were doing when they were doing it?

15:50.693 --> 15:52.786
I guess they just figured it out
at some point.

15:52.961 --> 15:57.864
Wow. I can't believe old smelly pooper
finally got laid.

16:01.537 --> 16:02.902
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:03.072 --> 16:05.097
Hope you're hungry.

16:05.274 --> 16:08.766
Interesting. A friendly sentiment
in this country...

16:08.944 --> 16:12.038
...cruel taunt in the Sudan.

16:13.549 --> 16:15.710
It's a lesson in context.

16:16.118 --> 16:17.779
Will Amy be joining us for dinner?

16:17.953 --> 16:19.284
Yes, I believe so.

16:19.455 --> 16:20.786
Good, good.

16:20.956 --> 16:23.789
Everything okay between you two?

16:29.465 --> 16:31.296
Yes.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.932
Why do you ask?

16:35.170 --> 16:38.139
No reason. I was just talking to Raj...

16:38.307 --> 16:43.142
...and he mentioned
what a lovely glow she has these days.

16:43.812 --> 16:46.474
Did he mean
as if she'd been out in the sun...

16:46.648 --> 16:50.948
...tending an herb garden
without wearing a hat or sunblock?

16:52.454 --> 16:54.319
No.

16:54.490 --> 16:56.981
That's not what he meant.

16:58.360 --> 17:00.487
Well, we may never know.

17:00.662 --> 17:05.429
As my mother would say,
the Asians are an inscrutable folk.

17:08.003 --> 17:10.198
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

17:10.372 --> 17:13.933
Yeah, you do. You dog, you.

17:19.848 --> 17:21.543
Did you get that?

17:21.717 --> 17:26.017
Every word. Our false gossip meme
appears to have reached node lambda.

17:26.188 --> 17:28.053
This is moving faster
than we thought.

17:28.223 --> 17:30.817
Agreed. Rate of gossip transmission
is proportional...

17:30.993 --> 17:33.484
...to the number of nodes squared.

17:33.729 --> 17:36.789
I must say, Amy, pretending
to have intercourse with you...

17:36.965 --> 17:40.128
...is giving me a great deal
of satisfaction.

17:41.303 --> 17:43.703
Slow down, Sheldon.
I'm not quite there yet.

17:47.042 --> 17:49.567
- Pass the soy sauce.
HOWARD: Sure.

17:49.745 --> 17:52.646
Bernadette just asked
about my sexual encounter with you.

17:52.815 --> 17:55.750
The meme
has reached full penetration.

17:58.253 --> 17:59.743
Pun intended?

18:00.756 --> 18:02.917
No. Happy accident.

18:04.927 --> 18:06.554
This is remarkable.

18:06.728 --> 18:08.593
Took less than 24 hours.

18:08.764 --> 18:12.131
I should let you know that she asked
for details about our dalliance.

18:12.668 --> 18:13.760
Interesting.

18:13.936 --> 18:19.169
So it went beyond the mere fact
of coitus to a blow-by-blow, as it were.

18:21.043 --> 18:22.738
Pun intended?

18:22.911 --> 18:25.141
I'm sorry. What pun?

18:27.249 --> 18:29.183
Not important.

18:29.451 --> 18:32.511
I described your lovemaking
as aloof, but effective.

18:34.189 --> 18:36.384
I wish you hadn't done that.

18:36.558 --> 18:40.858
That's going to make me
a chick magnet, and I'm so busy as it is.

18:42.297 --> 18:46.131
Hey, everybody, I got something
I wanna ask Bernadette...

18:46.301 --> 18:50.067
...and I can't think of a better time
than when I'm with all my friends.

18:50.239 --> 18:53.470
Oh, hold on, Howard.
There's lots of better times.

18:54.943 --> 18:56.274
Please, the man is talking.

18:56.445 --> 19:00.313
Let him get it out,
and let the chips fall where they may.

19:01.984 --> 19:03.246
Thank you.

19:04.620 --> 19:07.612
Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...

19:07.789 --> 19:09.689
Oh, God. What's happening?

19:10.826 --> 19:14.922
I know things haven't been perfect
with us, and we've had our problems...

19:15.097 --> 19:17.258
...but I just have to tell you...

19:17.432 --> 19:19.764
...from the moment l...
- Howard, stop right here.

19:19.935 --> 19:21.596
This is it.

19:23.605 --> 19:25.402
Yes.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.732
Yes, what?

19:28.243 --> 19:29.801
Yes, I will marry you.

19:29.978 --> 19:31.240
- You will?
- You will?

19:31.413 --> 19:32.471
I will.

19:34.349 --> 19:36.613
- I will.
- Oh, I love you so much.

19:36.785 --> 19:37.911
Oh, I love you too.

19:38.086 --> 19:39.519
Congratulations.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.120
Oh, it's so exciting.

[SOBBING]

19:45.928 --> 19:47.623
I wonder what changed her mind.

19:48.263 --> 19:52.825
Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess
renewed her faith in love.

19:54.136 --> 19:56.730
As good an explanation as any.

19:57.806 --> 19:59.433
That's great.

20:04.379 --> 20:06.347
Oh, hey, Amy.
Bernadette just texted me.

20:06.515 --> 20:07.914
Howard proposed?

20:08.083 --> 20:10.916
Yes. Just stopped by
to let you know I'm getting orthotics.

20:11.086 --> 20:14.681
Also, I'm carrying Sheldon's baby.
Mum's the word.

20:20.062 --> 20:22.496
You're pregnant?!

20:24.433 --> 20:28.096
Wow, is there anything on there
about orthotics?
