No, seriously, I think I've finally figured out
my problem with women.

The capybara is the largest member
of the rodent family.

00:10.847 --> 00:13.008
What does that have to do
with me and women?

00:13.216 --> 00:15.047
Nothing, it was a desperate attempt...

00:15.218 --> 00:18.210
...to introduce
an alternate topic of conversation.

00:18.388 --> 00:20.618
My problem
is I don't project confidence.

00:20.790 --> 00:24.282
So I decided that the next time I meet
a woman I think is attractive...

00:24.460 --> 00:26.792
...rather than holding back
and being cautious...

00:26.963 --> 00:28.897

the mantle of self-assurance.

- Congratulations, Howard.
HOWARD: Thanks.

01:14.777 --> 01:16.938
Listen,
I have to get a security clearance...

01:17.146 --> 01:19.671
...so you guys might be hearing
from the FBI.

01:19.849 --> 01:22.443

I don't want to speak to the FBI.

- Why not?
- I'm brown and I talk funny.

They're just doing
a background check on me.

It doesn't matter, they'll find a reason to
give me a one-way ticket to Gandhiville.

01:33.663 --> 01:36.029
By the way, when I say that,
it's not offensive.

01:36.799 --> 01:38.027

03:50.066 --> 03:51.090
Of course not.

03:51.267 --> 03:52.598
I'm here on an H1 B visa...

Of course, most of my relationships

12:53.509 --> 12:56.945
H is for honesty,
of which he has much.

12:57.112 --> 12:59.603
O is for outstanding, which he is such.

12:59.782 --> 13:02.307
W is for witty, he's quick with a joke.

13:02.484 --> 13:04.452
A is for artistic, his ability..."

13:04.653 --> 13:07.451
I'm sorry, Dr. Cooper,
this matter is already closed.

13:07.656 --> 13:10.523
But I still have "ard Joel Wolowitz"
left to go.

13:11.026 --> 13:12.653
It's closed.

13:14.463 --> 13:17.125
I don't understand why you people
are picking on my friend Howard...

13:17.332 --> 13:19.823
...when there are much more serious
security threats to pursue.

13:20.002 --> 13:21.970
For instance,
when I first met Leonard...

13:22.137 --> 13:25.868
...he was on the verge of giving away
rocket secrets to a North Korean spy...

13:26.041 --> 13:28.737
...and not one agent
ever investigated that.

13:29.178 --> 13:31.669
This is Leonard Hofstadter?

13:32.514 --> 13:35.972
No, it's a different Leonard.
He's Chinese, red hair, six fingers.

13:36.151 --> 13:37.175
Goodbye.

13:41.023 --> 13:43.583
Raj, have you seen Howard?

13:43.826 --> 13:45.691
I think he's eating lunch.

13:45.894 --> 13:48.362
Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet
Neil DeGrasse Tyson...

13:48.530 --> 13:50.293
...from the Hayden Planetarium
in New York.

13:50.466 --> 13:52.900
I'm quite familiar with Dr. Tyson.

13:53.068 --> 13:56.663
He's responsible for the demotion
of Pluto from planetary status.

13:56.839 --> 13:58.170
I liked Pluto...

13:59.475 --> 14:03.536
...ergo, I do not like you.
- But I actually didn't demote Pluto.

14:03.712 --> 14:06.374
That was a vote of
the International Astronomical Union.

14:06.548 --> 14:11.212
If ifs and buts were candy and nuts,
we'd all have a merry Christmas.

14:12.054 --> 14:13.385
Think about that, Dr. Tyson.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.555
That the guy you
were telling me about?

14:17.726 --> 14:19.057
Oh, yeah.

14:21.263 --> 14:26.394
Howard, the person at fault for you
not getting a security clearance is me.

14:27.202 --> 14:29.932
- You?
- Yes, but before you get upset...

14:30.105 --> 14:33.233
...I want you to know I went to the FBI
and retracted my statement.

14:33.775 --> 14:35.800
And they were okay with that?

14:36.011 --> 14:37.808
No. If anything, I made it worse.

14:38.814 --> 14:41.806
In any case,
I have been riddled with guilt...

14:42.017 --> 14:44.281
...which is causing
Gorn-infested REM sleep.

14:44.453 --> 14:50.119
- So I'm here now to say I'm sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

14:50.292 --> 14:52.590
You've set my career back
at least two years...

14:52.761 --> 14:55.628
...and you think you can make it right
with "I'm sorry"?

14:55.797 --> 14:57.389
Yes.

14:57.599 --> 14:59.089
I followed the social protocol.

14:59.268 --> 15:01.736
I attempted to right the wrong
and when I failed...

15:01.904 --> 15:05.806
...I delivered a heartfelt apology.
Now, you say "apology accepted"...

15:05.974 --> 15:09.273
...and I will offer you
a one-time-only high five.

15:10.846 --> 15:12.746
Your apology is not accepted.

15:13.415 --> 15:15.849
You're tricking me. It really is, isn't it?

15:16.051 --> 15:18.451
Leave me alone, Sheldon.

15:20.556 --> 15:22.421
Dr. Cooper,
I just wanted you to know...

15:22.591 --> 15:25.856
...I’m sorry for the role I played
in the Pluto matter.

15:26.061 --> 15:27.756
Oh, shut up.

15:32.334 --> 15:33.995
- Sheldon?
- Hello.

[PENNY CHUCKLES]

15:35.370 --> 15:36.962
What are you doing here?

15:37.139 --> 15:38.163
I have troubles, Penny.

15:38.340 --> 15:39.364
[SIGHS]

15:39.541 --> 15:42.840
I've come to pour them out to
the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.

15:43.612 --> 15:46.843
You know, they have a really nice bar
over at the Olive Garden.

15:47.382 --> 15:51.284
I don't like the Olive Garden.
They treat me like family.

15:53.822 --> 15:56.518
- Okay, Sheldon, what can I get you?
- Alcohol.

15:57.359 --> 16:01.125
- Could you be a little more specific?
- Ethyl alcohol.

16:01.296 --> 16:02.627
Forty milliliters.

16:03.098 --> 16:05.123
I'm sorry, honey,
I don't know milliliters.

16:05.300 --> 16:08.360
Ah. Blame President James Jimmy Carter.

16:08.537 --> 16:11.995
He started America on a path
to the metric system but then just gave up.

16:12.174 --> 16:13.198
[SCOFFS]

16:13.375 --> 16:15.673
He wonders
why he was a one-term president.

16:16.511 --> 16:19.105
- Would you say that's 40 milliliters?
- More or less.

16:19.314 --> 16:20.338
Great.

16:22.551 --> 16:23.609
Now where were we?

16:23.819 --> 16:26.583
I believe you were about to ask me
to choose a cocktail.

16:26.755 --> 16:29.986
Fortunately,
thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics...

16:30.158 --> 16:32.251
...there's an app for that.

16:43.338 --> 16:44.396
Ooh.

- I'll have a Rosewater Rickey.
- A what?

16:48.243 --> 16:50.768

brandied cherries, gin...

16:51.013 --> 16:54.039
...rosewater, Angostura bitters
and over-proofed rum.

16:54.216 --> 16:56.548
Now first,
dust the cherries with sugar...

16:56.718 --> 16:59.414
...then spray them
with a mixture of rum and bitters.

16:59.588 --> 17:03.456
- Then ignite the rum..."
- Here you go, one Rosewater Rickey.

17:03.692 --> 17:06.058
That's not how it looks in the picture.

17:06.228 --> 17:08.526
Oh, yeah,
every bartender makes it differently.

17:08.697 --> 17:12.189
- Why don't you give it a try?
- All right.

17:13.702 --> 17:16.034
To the metric system.

17:26.481 --> 17:28.915
I can't taste the cherries.

17:30.752 --> 17:32.947
All right, Sheldon,
what's on your mind?

17:33.755 --> 17:36.781
I wronged Howard
and he won't accept my apology.

17:36.992 --> 17:38.050
Oh, right, that.

17:38.226 --> 17:40.194
Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.

17:40.762 --> 17:43.128
Penny,
you face failure on a daily basis.

17:45.467 --> 17:48.402
- How do you cope?
- I drink.

17:50.305 --> 17:52.000
To drinking.

17:55.110 --> 17:56.600
Nope.

18:00.115 --> 18:03.516
If only there were some way to
force Howard to accept my apology...

18:03.719 --> 18:06.347
...so I could escape
this miasma of guilt.

18:06.588 --> 18:09.921
Sometimes just stuff happens
and there's nothing you can do about it.

18:10.092 --> 18:13.255
For example, Lisa Peterson hasn't talked
to me since 11th grade.

18:13.428 --> 18:15.293
No matter how much you apologize...

18:15.464 --> 18:18.297
...you can't go back
and undry-hump someone's boyfriend.

18:19.434 --> 18:20.594

Hard to believe I'm actually having
this conversation with you.

18:43.525 --> 18:45.550
Right there with you.

18:46.361 --> 18:51.663
Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru
by reprogramming the simulator.

- That's it.
- What?

18:53.702 --> 18:55.363

Sheldon, you can't reprogram people.

No, you can't reprogram people.

19:15.824 --> 19:17.758
- Hello, all.
LEONARD: Hello.

19:17.926 --> 19:22.090
Howard, you're feeling better
about me today, aren't you?

19:22.330 --> 19:25.663
- Not really.
- Yes, you are.

to modify your thought patterns.

- What's in the bag?
- It's for Howard.

19:40.081 --> 19:42.914
No, Sheldon,
you can't fix this with gifts.

19:43.118 --> 19:46.383
Nevertheless, I've hurt you
and whether you forgive me or not...

19:46.588 --> 19:48.556
...I want you to have this.

19:50.625 --> 19:52.718
You're giving me a couch cushion?

19:52.894 --> 19:55.089
No. The cushion is merely symbolic.

19:55.263 --> 19:57.959
I'm giving you my spot on the couch.

20:00.569 --> 20:02.036
But you love that spot.

20:02.237 --> 20:04.467
No, I love my mother.

My feelings for my spot
are much greater.
