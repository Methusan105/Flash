Ma, Ma, calm down. Listen to me.
I know it says click with the mouse...

00:07.844 --> 00:11.143
...but on a laptop,
the trackpad is the mouse.

00:11.314 --> 00:16.411
Now, put your finger on it.
No, doesn't matter which finger.

[SCOFFS]

00:17.787 --> 00:19.220
Good choice.

00:19.389 --> 00:22.187
Yeah, now move it down
to your e-mail icon.

00:22.359 --> 00:24.884
Yeah, the little envelope.

00:25.061 --> 00:28.553
What do you mean what does it
look like? It looks like an envelope!

00:28.732 --> 00:31.701
Fine, you don't like the computer,
don't use it.

00:31.868 --> 00:35.531
Sure, we can exchange it
for a salad spinner. Goodbye.

[SIGHS]

00:38.508 --> 00:41.944
That's a Hanukkah present
you're regretting, huh?

00:42.112 --> 00:46.208
Yeah, I won't say that all senior citizens
who can't master technology...

00:46.383 --> 00:50.217
...should be publicly flogged, but if
we made an example of one or two...

00:50.387 --> 00:52.878
...it might give the others
incentive to try harder.

00:54.824 --> 00:57.622
I had a great idea.
You know how we're always having...

00:57.827 --> 00:59.954
...to stop
and solve differential equations...

01:00.130 --> 01:03.691
...like when you do Fourier analysis
or using the Schrodinger equation?

01:03.867 --> 01:05.698
Howard doesn't. He's only an engineer.

01:07.470 --> 01:11.702
I think we could write a little app that
would use handwriting recognition...

01:11.875 --> 01:14.366
...then run it through
a symbolic evaluation engine.

01:14.544 --> 01:17.945
You just use your smartphone,
take a picture of the equation, and bam!

01:18.114 --> 01:22.710
You know what's a great app?
The one that makes fart noises.

01:27.223 --> 01:31.922
You know, Leonard,
that's actually a valid idea. Very good.

01:32.762 --> 01:35.424
Can you say that
and not make it sound like I'm a cat...

01:35.599 --> 01:38.124
...who learned how to use the toilet?

01:38.768 --> 01:41.931
No. The two achievements
are equally surprising...

01:42.105 --> 01:43.436
...and equally admirable.

01:43.607 --> 01:46.974
Though if pressed,
I'd have to give a slight edge to the cat.

01:47.143 --> 01:50.806
I'll save you the pain and nervousness
of waiting for the answer.

01:50.981 --> 01:54.439
I agree to be part of your project.
Congratulations.

01:54.918 --> 01:56.510
Ha, ha. Yay for me.

01:57.921 --> 01:59.946
What about you?
I can't promise anything...

02:00.123 --> 02:02.614
...but people do make money
off stuff like this.

02:02.792 --> 02:04.316
A few extra bucks would be nice.

02:04.494 --> 02:07.327
- Could move out of my mother's house.
- Where would you go?

02:07.497 --> 02:11.763
I always dreamed about building
a little place of my own over the garage.

02:12.469 --> 02:14.835
You know, if I made more money,
I could take time off...

02:15.005 --> 02:17.166
...and give pretty girls
submarine rides.

02:17.774 --> 02:20.766
What's that, some weird sex thing?

02:21.645 --> 02:24.443
No. You take girls underwater
in your private submarine...

02:24.614 --> 02:26.275
...and you show them fish.

02:26.850 --> 02:29.011
Why does everything
have to be dirty with you?

02:30.186 --> 02:33.678
I think we could work on this at night
and maybe in a couple of weeks...

02:33.857 --> 02:37.315
...we'll have ourselves an app to sell.
- Sounds like we're in business.

02:37.494 --> 02:41.487
- I think we should capture this moment.
- Yeah, let's do it.

[FART NOISE]

02:46.636 --> 02:50.299
Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent
or what?

03:15.398 --> 03:16.660
I checked the App Store.

03:16.833 --> 03:20.325
No one is doing handwriting recognition
differential equation solving.

03:20.503 --> 03:22.971
Oh, dear Lord, shush.

03:23.973 --> 03:27.374
- What?
- You have so few good ideas, Leonard.

03:27.544 --> 03:31.674
And you're just gonna spill the beans
in front of an outsider?

03:37.353 --> 03:38.911
Who, me?

03:39.122 --> 03:43.058

about handwriting-recognition based...

Whatever your secret is,
I'm sure it's boring. So I'm not interested.

04:03.880 --> 04:07.372
Well, it's not boring at all.
You see, in higher-order mathematics...

04:07.550 --> 04:09.882
...there are certain sets of equations...
- Bored.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.717
- Satisfied?
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] Hardly.

04:12.889 --> 04:15.824
Consider this unlikely
but very plausible scenario.

04:15.992 --> 04:18.688
A young woman alone in the big city.

04:18.862 --> 04:21.023
Her ridiculous dream
of becoming an actress...

04:21.197 --> 04:23.256
...lies shattered about her.

04:23.433 --> 04:26.459
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Hang on, let's see where he's going.

04:26.669 --> 04:29.502
Then it hits her,
how is she going to survive?

04:29.672 --> 04:33.199
But she has no prospects,
no marketable skills.

04:33.376 --> 04:36.573
And then one day,
she meets a group of geniuses...

04:36.746 --> 04:38.509
...and their friend Howard.

04:41.851 --> 04:44.342
- Hey, l...
- Hang on, let's see where he's going.

04:45.555 --> 04:50.754
She befriends them, and then lies in wait
until they reveal a marketable idea...

04:50.927 --> 04:53.896
...which she steals
and sells to the highest bidder.

04:54.063 --> 04:55.121
That is ridiculous.

04:55.298 --> 04:57.766
Is it? Let's see you come up
with an explanation...

04:57.934 --> 05:01.097
...as to why this woman
hangs out with us all the time.

05:04.741 --> 05:06.800

off you guys.

- I don't need to listen to this.
- There's your answer, free food.

05:12.248 --> 05:15.877
All right, I've taken the liberty
of drafting these workflow charts...

05:16.152 --> 05:18.916
...which outline our duties
and the path we will follow...

05:19.088 --> 05:21.989
...as we develop
our groundbreaking new app.

05:22.792 --> 05:25.352
Hey. Why am I in charge
of phone support?

05:27.697 --> 05:29.688
Seems a bit racist.

05:29.866 --> 05:32.664
A customer service representative
with an Indian accent...

05:32.836 --> 05:35.498
...will create the impression
we're a vast enterprise...

05:35.672 --> 05:37.503
...that uses overseas call centers.

05:37.674 --> 05:41.576
Oh, very clever. But still racist.

05:45.748 --> 05:49.275
Hey, why am I listed
as your executive assistant?

05:49.452 --> 05:53.047
Because the word secretary
has fallen into disrepute.

05:53.223 --> 05:55.282
Oh, FYI,
my mother's birthday is coming up.

05:55.458 --> 05:57.517
I'm going to need you
to pick up a present.

05:58.928 --> 06:01.123
Okay, we need to stop for a minute.

06:01.331 --> 06:04.232
We can talk during break.
We have one coming up at midnight.

06:04.400 --> 06:07.767
- And we'll need snacks.
- Sheldon, you're not in charge.

06:07.937 --> 06:10.269
- It's my idea. I'm in charge.
- Oh, of course, you are.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.637
Look at the organizational chart.
You're clearly listed as founder.

06:13.843 --> 06:17.438
Yes, and you're listed
as chief executive officer...

06:17.614 --> 06:20.549
...chief financial officer
and chief operating officer.

06:20.750 --> 06:23.742
You missed chief science officer,
chairman of the board and...

06:23.920 --> 06:27.151
...head of the Secret Santa committee.
- Okay.

06:27.357 --> 06:31.885
You need to get clear on this right now:
I am in charge of this project.

06:32.662 --> 06:36.393
Ooh, Leonard's going all alpha nerd
on Sheldon's ass.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.425
All right.
I'm not going to argue with you.

06:39.602 --> 06:41.832
Sheldon Cooper
is nothing if not a team player.

06:42.005 --> 06:45.463
Dr. Hofstadter, you have the con.

06:46.776 --> 06:49.643
Thank you. I thought we might start...

06:49.812 --> 06:52.975
...by talking about the user interface.
- Dear Lord, we're doomed.

06:55.451 --> 06:59.012
So this button here
will allow you to scan a new equation...

06:59.188 --> 07:01.053
...but over here, you can press this...

07:01.224 --> 07:03.920
...and just substitute
new values for the coefficients.

07:04.093 --> 07:05.958
Ha, ha. Good one, boss.

07:09.632 --> 07:11.463
- What?
- This diagram.

07:11.634 --> 07:13.761
Well, I assume
you were opening with a joke.

07:13.937 --> 07:18.203
It certainly buoyed up this employee's
esprit de corps.

07:19.642 --> 07:21.701
It's not a joke. It's the real design.

07:21.878 --> 07:26.975
In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks
to make it slightly less embarrassing?

07:27.583 --> 07:30.643
Sheldon, I think this will work.
Let's just try it my way.

07:30.853 --> 07:33.048
Oh, I'm sorry.
I assumed that you wanted...

07:33.222 --> 07:35.281
...candid truth-telling
from your employees.

07:35.458 --> 07:37.983
But I realize now,
you want the mindless nattering...

07:38.161 --> 07:40.561
...of complacent yes-men.

07:41.164 --> 07:43.564
- Are you done?
- Lf you say so, boss.

07:46.102 --> 07:49.594
Right now, this button-press event
is triggering a dummy procedure call.

07:49.772 --> 07:51.797
How about this for the app name?

07:51.975 --> 07:55.240
The Surprisingly Helpful
Equation-Linked Differential...

07:55.411 --> 07:58.073
...Optimized Numerator.

07:58.915 --> 08:01.475
So it spells "Sheldon."

08:02.785 --> 08:05.913
Does it? A happy accident.

08:06.756 --> 08:10.317
- We're not doing names now. Howard?
- Like I was saying...

08:10.493 --> 08:13.587
...now, it's a dummy procedure.
Eventually, it will drop us in...

08:13.763 --> 08:15.628
If we're not going to give it a name...

08:15.798 --> 08:18.528
...can we at least give it
a secret code designation?

08:18.701 --> 08:19.793
- No.
- Hear me out.

08:19.969 --> 08:22.199
The atomic bomb
was the Manhattan Project...

08:22.405 --> 08:25.033
...Windows 95
was originally Project Chicago.

08:25.208 --> 08:29.542
For our app, I would humbly suggest
Project Nodlehs.

08:30.513 --> 08:32.845
That's just Sheldon backwards.

08:33.049 --> 08:34.949
Another happy accident.

08:35.918 --> 08:38.648
We're not wasting time
with names right now.

08:38.821 --> 08:40.516
I see.

08:40.923 --> 08:43.483
- Is that decision open for discussion?
- No.

08:44.027 --> 08:45.654
Is the decision to not discuss...

08:45.828 --> 08:47.455
...open for discussion?
- No.

08:48.031 --> 08:49.658
Again, right now...

08:49.832 --> 08:52.699
...it's a dummy procedure,
but eventually, it will drop us...

08:52.869 --> 08:55.861
I call for a vote of no confidence
and a change in leadership.

08:56.039 --> 08:58.337
- Sheldon, stop it.
- When in the course of human events...

08:58.508 --> 09:00.806
...it becomes necessary
to dissolve the bonds...

09:00.977 --> 09:03.537
...that tie three scientists...
- Enough, Sheldon.

09:03.713 --> 09:05.647
Let's get to the vote. Show of hands...

09:05.815 --> 09:08.306
...all opposed to Leonard
and his reign of tyranny:

09:11.154 --> 09:14.988
- Okay, that's it, you're fired.
- Really?

09:15.158 --> 09:16.182
Why?

09:17.960 --> 09:20.588
Because you're impossible
to work with.

09:21.164 --> 09:22.188
I see.

09:26.235 --> 09:28.226
And is that open for discussion?

09:34.177 --> 09:37.908
- What are you doing?
- Oh, good morning, shoemaker.

09:38.081 --> 09:42.245
I think you'll be pleased with what
the elves were up to last night.

09:42.919 --> 09:44.250
But I fired you.

09:44.420 --> 09:46.479
Oh, I know.
I'm now an independent contractor.

09:47.924 --> 09:49.949
No, you are now nothing.

09:50.126 --> 09:52.856
You have no connection
to this project whatsoever.

09:53.029 --> 09:54.929
But I made it better.

09:55.098 --> 09:57.532
I don't want it better. I want it my way.

09:57.733 --> 10:00.099
Well, that speaks volumes, doesn't it?

10:01.204 --> 10:04.867
All right, I suppose
I'll go put on my bus pants.

10:05.041 --> 10:07.976
- What the hell are bus pants?
- They are pants one wears...

10:08.144 --> 10:10.704
...over regular pants
when one sits on bus seats...

10:10.880 --> 10:13.212
...that other people
have previously sat on.

10:14.450 --> 10:17.715
But, perhaps, from your lofty heights
atop the corporate ladder...

10:17.887 --> 10:21.914
...you've lost touch with the struggles
of the common man.

10:22.091 --> 10:24.651
Look, I'm still happy
to drive you to work.

10:24.827 --> 10:28.627
Nothing's changed in that regard.
We're still roommates, still friends.

10:28.798 --> 10:31.562
Except you identified me,
your best friend...

10:31.734 --> 10:33.099
...as a gangrenous limb...

10:33.269 --> 10:36.102
...that needed to be severed
from the organism and tossed.

10:36.272 --> 10:41.175
The desperate act of a little man
with a big Napoleon complex.

10:43.546 --> 10:46.310
You know what?
Go put on your bus pants.

10:53.489 --> 10:57.118
Mm, last night, I had a dream
we got so rich from the app...

10:57.293 --> 10:59.887
...you and I bought
matching side-by-side mansions.

11:00.062 --> 11:01.086
[CHUCKLES]

11:01.264 --> 11:02.891
But there was a secret tunnel...

11:03.065 --> 11:06.091
...connecting your front yard
to my back yard.

11:11.107 --> 11:12.540
What do you think that means?

11:14.076 --> 11:17.637
It means after we play handball,
I'm showering at home.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.913
Oh, good morning,
friend Howard, friend Raj.

11:24.086 --> 11:26.953
I see you gentlemen
are enjoying beverages.

11:27.123 --> 11:30.115
Perhaps, they would taste better
out of these.

11:31.761 --> 11:35.993
- "World's Greatest Astrophysicist"?
- Don't thank me, you earned it.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.094
"Howard Wolowitz."

11:42.305 --> 11:44.705
Why not "World's Greatest Engineer"?

11:44.874 --> 11:47.365
Oh, I'm sorry,
I typed that into the label maker...

11:47.577 --> 11:51.172
...but I just couldn't press enter.
Now down to business.

11:51.347 --> 11:53.815
What would it take
for you to abandon Leonard...

11:53.983 --> 11:55.848
...and join me in a rival company?

11:56.018 --> 11:57.986
Unless, of course, mugs are sufficient.

11:58.154 --> 12:00.486
In which case, welcome aboard.

12:01.090 --> 12:05.390
- We're not quitting on Leonard.
- I understand. Your loyalty is admirable.

12:05.595 --> 12:08.996
But what if I were to up the ante?

12:09.832 --> 12:11.163
What are you talking about?

12:11.801 --> 12:16.329
Monogrammed key chains
with a built-in laser pointer.

12:20.009 --> 12:21.033
No?

12:22.478 --> 12:27.381
How about can cozies
emblazoned with our university mascot?

12:28.484 --> 12:30.349
Go Beavers.

12:32.888 --> 12:34.480
I'll be back.

12:36.025 --> 12:38.186
Okay, let's try this one.

12:40.930 --> 12:42.591
Spherical Hankel function.

12:42.765 --> 12:44.426
Hold on.

12:44.634 --> 12:46.693
- That's it!
- Yes! Eureka!

12:46.869 --> 12:50.532
We agreed when it was "eureka" time,
we were all gonna say it together.

12:51.073 --> 12:54.873
