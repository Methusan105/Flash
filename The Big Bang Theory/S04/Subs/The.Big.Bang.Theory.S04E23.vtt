00:03.981 --> 00:06.245
Hey, do me a favor and take Table 7?

00:07.218 --> 00:10.676
You mean, the one with my 118-pound
rock-hard stud of a fiancÃ©...

00:10.855 --> 00:14.154
...who's prone to canker sores
and pinkeye?

00:14.325 --> 00:17.089
I prefer to look at it
as the one with my ex-boyfriend...

00:17.261 --> 00:22.289
...and his gorgeous, successful girlfriend
who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.

00:24.135 --> 00:26.126
Do you want me
to spill hot soup on her?

00:27.505 --> 00:29.370
Please, you're not that kind of person.

00:29.540 --> 00:30.598
I know.

00:30.775 --> 00:35.474
But if she orders something low-fat,
I'll totally give her the full-fat version.

00:37.748 --> 00:38.976
That's my water.

00:39.383 --> 00:41.351
- What?
- My water, you're drinking it.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.987
Dear Lord.

00:44.789 --> 00:47.656
- Have you been drinking it?
- Yes, it's my water.

00:48.159 --> 00:51.526
Well, that's it then. I'm dead.

00:52.163 --> 00:53.790
Here we go.

00:53.964 --> 00:56.296
I'm sorry,
do I need to connect the dots for you?

00:56.467 --> 00:57.957
The backwash into this glass...

00:58.135 --> 01:01.036
...is every pathogen that
calls your mouth "home sweet home."

01:01.205 --> 01:03.833
Not to mention
the visitors who arrive on the tongue...

01:04.008 --> 01:05.839
...of your subtropical girlfriend.

01:07.178 --> 01:10.341
Hey, that's my sister and my country
you're talking about.

01:10.514 --> 01:12.004
Leonard may have defiled one...

01:12.183 --> 01:15.277
...but I won't have you talking smack
about the other.

01:15.486 --> 01:17.078
- You guys ready to order?
- Yes.

01:17.288 --> 01:19.347
I'd like a seven-day course
of penicillin...

01:19.523 --> 01:23.687
...some syrup of ipecac
to induce vomiting and a mint.

01:24.595 --> 01:27.359
- I don't understand.
- He drank from Leonard's glass.

01:27.531 --> 01:29.055
"He drank from Leonard's glass."

01:29.233 --> 01:31.827
The words they'll be carving
into my tombstone.

01:32.403 --> 01:35.201
- That's actually my napkin.
- Oh, this is a nightmare.

01:36.106 --> 01:37.164
Where are you going?

01:37.341 --> 01:39.707
To the bar
to sterilize my mouth with alcohol.

01:40.511 --> 01:42.877
Gangway, dead man walking.

02:09.473 --> 02:12.499
All right, here we go.
Two lemonades...

02:12.676 --> 02:14.337
...one iced tea...

02:14.512 --> 02:16.742
...and a root beer for Priya.

02:16.914 --> 02:20.441
- Is it diet?
- That's what you ordered.

02:22.686 --> 02:26.178
Thank you. Hey, have you and Howard
started planning your wedding yet?

02:26.390 --> 02:30.121
Yeah. We're thinking of having it
on a cliff overlooking the ocean.

02:30.294 --> 02:32.353
Nothing soothes those
pre-wedding jitters...

02:32.530 --> 02:35.192
...like the thought of falling
and drowning.

02:36.133 --> 02:38.658
What'd your mother say
when you told her?

02:38.836 --> 02:41.498
He hasn't told her yet.
He's waiting for the right time.

02:41.672 --> 02:45.130
I was thinking of weaving it
into her eulogy.

02:45.543 --> 02:48.103
Howard,
you've got to tell your mother.

02:48.279 --> 02:52.010
Have you told your parents you're dating
this short glass of skimmed milk yet?

02:54.218 --> 02:57.051
That's different.
First of all, we're not engaged...

02:57.221 --> 03:00.952
...and second, Indian parents
are very protective of their children.

03:01.125 --> 03:06.290
Right. Whereas Jewish mothers take
a casual la-di-da approach to their sons.

03:09.033 --> 03:12.196
I gargled with tequila
and may have swallowed a teeny bit.

03:12.369 --> 03:15.065
- You all right?
- Fine. Thank you for asking.

03:15.239 --> 03:16.706
I love you so much.

03:20.844 --> 03:21.936
Fire demon.

03:23.747 --> 03:27.239
Fire demon.
Sheldon's turning up the heat.

03:29.320 --> 03:30.548
Troll master.

03:30.721 --> 03:34.213
Check it, Howard pulls one out
from under the bridge. Nice.

03:36.193 --> 03:37.251
Water nymph.

03:37.461 --> 03:40.521
Oh, yeah, she's got puddles
in all the right places.

03:41.665 --> 03:44.930
Could you please play the game
without commenting on every card?

03:45.102 --> 03:46.729
Sorry.

03:46.904 --> 03:49.202
Walking tree.

03:53.410 --> 03:56.607
- Last one.
- I'm taking a stroll and sporting wood.

03:59.550 --> 04:01.711
[PHONE CHIMES]

04:02.119 --> 04:05.179
- Okay, the eagle has landed.
- What's going on?

04:05.356 --> 04:09.258
Bernadette and my mother are having
a get-to-know-you lunch at the deli.

04:09.426 --> 04:10.586
That sounds lovely.

04:10.761 --> 04:13.059
Hope so.
Course, if history is any indication...

04:13.230 --> 04:16.757
...my mother will swallow her whole
and spit out her bones like an owl.

04:18.435 --> 04:21.802
- Have you met Bernadette's parents?
- You mean Adolf and Eva?

04:23.941 --> 04:27.604
Not yet. One goose step at a time.

04:28.078 --> 04:29.443
Sheldon, that's my water.

04:29.613 --> 04:32.138
Oh, dear Lord.

04:34.952 --> 04:36.146
That's not your water.

04:37.421 --> 04:39.013
I know.

04:41.058 --> 04:43.618
SHELDON:
Where's the mouthwash?

04:43.927 --> 04:45.952
Where indeed.

04:48.732 --> 04:51.428
HOWARD:
Ma, I'm home!

04:51.835 --> 04:56.169
- Where are you?
MRS. WOLOWITZ: I'm in the toilet!

04:56.774 --> 04:58.298
So how'd it go?

04:58.475 --> 05:01.842
Too soon to say, I'm not done yet!

05:03.947 --> 05:06.575
No,
I mean lunch today with Bernadette.

05:06.750 --> 05:07.808
Oh!

05:07.985 --> 05:12.115
I had a pastrami sandwich.
She had eggplant lasagna.

05:12.289 --> 05:15.452
Like that's what a person orders
in a Jewish deli.

05:17.261 --> 05:19.161
Besides food, did you get along?

05:19.329 --> 05:21.126
- Did you talk?
- Oh, sure.

05:21.665 --> 05:26.125
Did you know she's going to school
to become a microbiologist?

05:27.271 --> 05:30.570
No, she never mentioned it.

05:31.075 --> 05:34.772
I bet she did and you didn't listen.

05:36.146 --> 05:38.205
Yeah, that's probably it.
What do you think?

05:38.382 --> 05:40.441
Do you like her?
I mean, she's great, huh?

05:40.617 --> 05:43.677
She's a lovely girl. Cute as a button.

05:43.854 --> 05:47.722
That's good to hear
because I've got some news.

05:47.891 --> 05:49.483
I hope it's good news...

05:49.660 --> 05:52.595
...because I've got nothing
but disappointment in here.

06:01.371 --> 06:05.102
Bernadette and I are getting married.

06:09.146 --> 06:10.977

- Hey.
- Hello.

I haven't seen you in a while.
How's it going?

06:43.714 --> 06:46.342
Other than waiting out
the exponential growth period...

06:46.517 --> 06:49.850
...of the virulent organisms
trooping through my microvilli...

06:50.020 --> 06:54.218
...into my circulatory system,

[CHUCKLING]

06:59.363 --> 07:00.796
Did I say something amusing?

07:01.565 --> 07:04.466
I don't know, maybe.
I have no idea what you said.

07:04.968 --> 07:07.801
So your mirth is merely a discharge
of nervous energy...

07:07.971 --> 07:10.303
...with no semantic content at all?

07:10.874 --> 07:13.308
My "mirth." Classic.

07:14.444 --> 07:15.934
Is there a station coming up...

07:16.113 --> 07:19.310
...where I can board
your giggling train of thought?

07:19.917 --> 07:23.978
It's not a big deal. It's just ever since
Leonard's been dating Raj's sister...

07:24.188 --> 07:28.625
...l've had to keep my distance.
I don't get to hear all your jibber jabber.

07:28.792 --> 07:31.727
Jibber jabber? I don't jibber jabber.

07:32.162 --> 07:33.686
What are you doing at work
these days?

07:33.864 --> 07:37.630
Oh. I'm working on time-dependent
backgrounds in string theory.

07:37.801 --> 07:41.897
Specifically, quantum field theory
in D-dimensional de Sitter space.

07:43.473 --> 07:46.237
Come on, even you have to admit
that's jibber jabber.

07:48.245 --> 07:52.079
Interesting. Do you know where
the phrase "jibber jabber" comes from?

07:52.482 --> 07:56.282
Oh, my God. You're about
to jibber jabber about jibber jabber.

08:00.090 --> 08:02.422
Howard and his mother
are at the hospital.

08:02.593 --> 08:05.858
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- I don't know, I just got a text. Hurry.

08:09.766 --> 08:11.427
Sheldon, let's go.

08:11.969 --> 08:14.870
To a hospital? Full of sick people?

08:16.506 --> 08:18.371
Oh, I don't think so.

08:18.842 --> 08:21.310
Your friend and his mother are there,
we're going.

08:22.112 --> 08:23.170
I can't.

08:23.747 --> 08:25.510
Don't tell me you're afraid of germs.

08:25.682 --> 08:28.480
Not all germs.

08:28.685 --> 08:30.243
Just the ones that will kill me.

08:31.455 --> 08:33.719
The same way I'm not afraid
of all steak knives.

08:33.891 --> 08:36.758
Just the ones that might be plunged
in my thorax.

08:37.828 --> 08:41.821
I'll tell Howard you're more concerned
about your own well-being than his.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.399
I would think he would know that.

08:46.203 --> 08:48.068
You know what? You are unbelievable.

08:48.272 --> 08:51.969
You buy all these superhero T-shirts
but when it's time for you to step up...

08:52.142 --> 08:55.373
...and do the right thing,
you just hide in the laundry room.

08:55.846 --> 08:57.074
Fine, I'll go.

08:58.315 --> 09:02.012
Just for the record,
my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital.

09:02.185 --> 09:05.313
She went in to visit my uncle Roger,
caught something...

09:05.489 --> 09:07.719
...and bit the dust a week later.

09:07.891 --> 09:11.224
The two of them now share a coffee can
on my mother's mantel.

09:16.366 --> 09:19.767
So I knocked down the bathroom door,
picked up my unconscious mother...

09:19.937 --> 09:23.600
...carried her to the car and drove
like a madman to the emergency room.

09:23.807 --> 09:27.766
- You're a real hero, Howard.
- No, I did what any son would do.

09:28.245 --> 09:31.214
Hang on a second,
you picked up your mother?

09:33.083 --> 09:35.950
Her own legs are barely able
to do that.

09:37.454 --> 09:39.388
I was filled with adrenaline.

09:39.556 --> 09:42.218
It happens to be
how women lift cars off babies.

09:42.392 --> 09:44.883
Yeah,
I'm saying it'd be easier to lift a car.

09:46.396 --> 09:48.728
What can I tell you,
after I found the courage...

09:48.899 --> 09:51.834
...to put her pants back on,
I was unstoppable.

09:53.704 --> 09:56.798
- So how is she?
- They're running tests, I don't know.

09:56.974 --> 10:00.637
It may have been a heart attack
or heart-attack-like event.

10:00.811 --> 10:03.336
- What's the difference?
- A heart-attack-like event...

10:03.513 --> 10:06.414
...is an event that's like a heart attack.

10:07.417 --> 10:09.442
Thanks for clearing that up.

10:09.619 --> 10:12.179
Regardless, coronary problems
are eminently treatable.

10:12.356 --> 10:14.517
What's more likely
to kill Howard's mother...

10:14.725 --> 10:16.784
...are the antibiotic-resistant
superbugs...

of this hospital.

10:33.643 --> 10:35.668
Is there heart disease in your family?

10:35.846 --> 10:39.543
My family is the history
of heart disease.

of one of my ancestors doing this:

- So it's probably genetic.
- Well, maybe.

that might have upset her.

- What?
- It's not important.

you can share anything with me.

11:00.971 --> 11:03.337
You'd think that, but no.

11:07.711 --> 11:11.203
You told her we were gonna get married
and she had a heart attack?

11:11.381 --> 11:14.509
You can't take that personally.

11:15.185 --> 11:18.154
How else is she supposed to take it?

is that ever since my dad left...

11:22.292 --> 11:24.590
...l've been the whole world
to my mother.

11:24.795 --> 11:29.755
I mean, she'd be threatened by any
woman who can give me what she can't.

11:29.933 --> 11:32.401
You mean, sexual intercourse?

11:35.238 --> 11:38.696
Well, when you say it like that,
you make it sound creepy.

- What happened?
- Howard's mother had a heart attack...

11:41.745 --> 11:45.545

and she can't.

Howard Wolowitz is my friend.

12:10.874 --> 12:14.605
You know he tried to stick his tongue
down my throat and I broke his nose?

12:15.445 --> 12:18.380
That's a little easier to believe
than he's your friend.

12:18.548 --> 12:20.379
Yeah, tell me about it.

12:20.550 --> 12:23.041
My brother had a group of friends
like this in India.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.085
They dressed up in leotards
and goggles.

12:25.255 --> 12:27.621
And called themselves
the New Delhi Power Rangers.

12:29.459 --> 12:30.926
You mean, when he was little.

12:31.094 --> 12:33.494
Not as little as you'd want him to be.

Wanna see if we can find real coffee?

12:39.636 --> 12:42.434
Sure. We're going to the cafeteria
to get some coffee.

- You want anything?
- I'm fine.

- One broke up with you.

telling the other one why?

I don't have anything to hide.

Good, good.
Then you have nothing to worry about.

because my parents didn't love me...

they loved me a great deal.

13:30.620 --> 13:33.646
...if the thought of us getting married
might kill your mother?

13:34.424 --> 13:37.416
It's the circle of life, sweetie.

13:38.962 --> 13:43.194
One day our son will marry someone
and it will kill you.

13:45.502 --> 13:48.835
Howard, I have to go to the bathroom
and no one will take me home.

13:49.005 --> 13:52.736
- What's wrong with the bathroom here?
- Pneumococcus, streptococcus...

13:52.943 --> 13:56.344
...staphylococcus
and other assorted coccuses.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.814
Sheldon,
my mother is on her deathbed...

13:58.982 --> 14:01.815
...and my fiancÃ©e is grief-stricken
over putting her there.

14:01.985 --> 14:04.545
I'm not taking you home.

14:04.721 --> 14:08.054
At least go with me so you can
open the door and flush the urinal.

14:08.225 --> 14:10.056
No.

14:10.227 --> 14:12.195
This might be a good time
to point out...

14:12.362 --> 14:15.263
...that friendship requires
a certain give and take.

14:16.399 --> 14:18.492
Hold the door.

14:24.507 --> 14:25.997
Mr. Wolowitz?

14:26.176 --> 14:28.235
- Is she okay?
- It wasn't a heart attack.

14:28.411 --> 14:31.778
She's awake, she's resting comfortably
and we're still running tests.

14:31.982 --> 14:33.745
- Can I see her?
- Actually, she said...

14:33.917 --> 14:37.216
...and I quote, she'd like to see
"the little Catholic girl first."

14:40.423 --> 14:42.084
Me? Why me?

14:42.259 --> 14:46.252
Jews have been asking that for centuries.
There's no real good answer.

14:48.598 --> 14:50.759
Okay, well, wish me luck.

14:50.934 --> 14:53.926
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
Let's just hide Mr. Cross.

14:55.071 --> 14:58.097
If it touches her, it burns, so...

15:01.077 --> 15:03.136
Brought a Catholic girl home
to your mother?

15:03.313 --> 15:04.371
Yeah.

15:04.547 --> 15:07.573
Why don't I write you a prescription
for Xanax?

15:11.788 --> 15:14.256
Finally.

[MAN COUGHING]

15:27.804 --> 15:29.795
Oh, what fresh hell is this?

15:29.973 --> 15:32.305
Wait, you can't leave here,
you've been exposed.

15:35.812 --> 15:37.780
SHELDON:
No, I haven't.

15:38.782 --> 15:40.807
It's all good.

15:42.619 --> 15:44.109
Wanna talk about crazy mothers?

15:44.287 --> 15:46.949
Leonard's mom wouldn't give him
any approval growing up.

15:47.123 --> 15:48.317
Oh, the poor thing.

15:48.491 --> 15:50.425
It makes him desperate
to please women.

15:50.593 --> 15:53.289
That's why the foreplay
goes on and on.

15:53.596 --> 15:54.858
It does, doesn't it?

15:55.065 --> 15:57.625
It's like he's trying to win a prize.

15:57.801 --> 16:01.430
A word of advice, don't doze off.
You will never hear the end of it.

16:01.604 --> 16:05.370
Help me! Come back!

16:05.575 --> 16:06.701
Penny!

16:08.845 --> 16:12.838
There are a couple of things I did with
Penny that might be a little silly, but...

16:13.016 --> 16:14.881
Like what?

16:15.118 --> 16:17.348
Every once in a while,
before we'd go to bed...

16:17.520 --> 16:20.182
...l'd put on a little show for her.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.183
What do you mean "a show"?

16:24.661 --> 16:29.155
Well, you know,
like the way I took my clothes off.

16:30.300 --> 16:31.597
Like to music?

16:32.836 --> 16:36.397
I'd look pretty stupid
if there was no music.

16:37.374 --> 16:38.841
So you'd do a striptease.

16:39.509 --> 16:42.535
Well, I wasn't swinging around a pole.

16:43.613 --> 16:45.740
Good, good.

16:46.916 --> 16:50.352
There was one time
I put body glitter on.

16:51.554 --> 16:54.546
I don't think you have to worry
about Penny telling my sister.

16:54.724 --> 16:58.558
- No, she wouldn't.
- Your big problem is me telling her.

17:01.030 --> 17:03.055
You really are a mean little man.

17:04.567 --> 17:07.058
PRIYA:
Oh, God, that is so true.

17:07.237 --> 17:08.431
Yeah. I know, eh?

17:08.638 --> 17:10.833
Hey, what took you guys so long?

17:11.007 --> 17:12.269
Oh, we were just chatting.

17:12.442 --> 17:13.909
That's nice. What about?

17:14.277 --> 17:17.405
We were just comparing notes
about how you are in the sack.

17:19.082 --> 17:20.640
[LAUGHING]

17:20.817 --> 17:23.285
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

17:24.387 --> 17:25.752
What if she wasn't kidding?

17:26.256 --> 17:30.158
Doesn't matter.
I'm the king of foreplay.

17:33.196 --> 17:34.754
Hey, how'd it go?

17:34.931 --> 17:36.865
You're a putz.

17:37.033 --> 17:41.436
- You know what that means?
- Yeah. Do you?

17:41.771 --> 17:43.398
Your mother just taught it to me.

17:43.573 --> 17:46.041
She thinks she got food poisoning
from that deli...

17:46.209 --> 17:48.370
...and she wanted to make sure
I was okay.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.035
And are you?

17:50.213 --> 17:53.273
No, because I'm engaged to a putz.

17:55.485 --> 17:58.613
You let me believe
I was the reason she had a heart attack.

17:58.788 --> 18:01.916
- Well, based on the available evidence...
- Shut up!

18:02.125 --> 18:04.923
She said I'm a wonderful girl
and you're lucky to have me.

18:05.295 --> 18:06.387
Where are you going?

18:06.563 --> 18:08.963
[IN GRUFF VOICE]
To the toilet! Is that okay with you?

18:15.071 --> 18:18.802
Is it just me, or does she sound sexy
when she's angry?

I got a colossal serpent right here.

being under quarantine...
