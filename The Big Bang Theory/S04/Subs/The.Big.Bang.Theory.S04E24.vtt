- Hey, you guys ready to order?
- Sure.

00:05.795 --> 00:08.161
- Okay, Priya.
- I'll have the Shepherd's Pie.

00:08.331 --> 00:11.357
- You want to split that with me?
- Oh, no, no, no, he doesn't.

00:11.534 --> 00:12.899
Why not?

00:13.069 --> 00:15.594
Milk in the taters,
milk in the gravy, Parmesan crust.

into a gas-filled Macy's Day balloon.

00:20.543 --> 00:22.534
[LAUGHING]

00:22.712 --> 00:25.738
Not quite accurate.
The Macy's balloons are filled with helium...

00:25.915 --> 00:29.578
...whereas Leonard produces
copious amounts of methane.

00:31.287 --> 00:32.982

00:34.290 --> 00:36.554
So no on the Shepherd's Pie.
Can we move on?

Yeah, a little tip. He says he can eat
frozen yogurt. Do not believe it.

Sea bass. I'll have the sea bass.

Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
I have amazing news.

01:05.188 --> 01:07.179
Bernadette,
before you change the subject...

01:07.357 --> 01:11.157
...does anyone have any final comments
on Leonard's faulty digestive system?

01:11.728 --> 01:13.252
So, what's your news, Bernadette?

01:14.464 --> 01:17.262
The thesis committee accepted
my doctoral dissertation.

01:17.433 --> 01:19.196
I'm getting my PhD.

01:19.369 --> 01:20.961
- Oh, congratulations.
- Oh!

01:21.538 --> 01:26.032
Wow! So that means you're a doctor,
you're a doctor...

...you're a doctor, you're a doctor.

01:28.444 --> 01:31.709
And, Howard, you know a lot of doctors.

01:31.881 --> 01:34.611
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Yeah, ha, ha!

01:34.784 --> 01:37.150
- Congratulations, honey.
- Thank you.

01:37.320 --> 01:40.778
So, Howard, tell us, how's it feel
knowing that when you two get married...

01:40.957 --> 01:43.949
...you'll be referred to
as Mr. And Dr. Wolowitz?

01:45.328 --> 01:47.159
Unless he takes Bernadette's last name.

01:47.330 --> 01:50.128
And considering her status,
that could open doors for him.

01:50.300 --> 01:52.200
Please, this isn't about me.

01:52.368 --> 01:55.565
- I'm proud of you.
- Well, you'll really be proud of this.

01:55.738 --> 01:58.366
I was headhunted
by a big pharmaceutical company.

a buttload of money.

Bernadette, that's great.

02:04.380 --> 02:06.314
Howard, do you make a buttload?

02:07.283 --> 02:09.513
Better than what you've got
a buttload of.

If I roll down the windows in the car,
everything's peachy.

If you do it, you're still not a doctor.

Yeah, just a heads-up
on the car window deal.

I must say, Amy, I was very impressed

04:58.988 --> 05:00.250
It's indeed admirable.

05:00.423 --> 05:03.392
Although, it is microbiology.

05:04.427 --> 05:08.625
Your doctorate is in neurobiology.
I fail to see the distinction.

I'll make it simple for you.

I study the brain, the organ responsible
for Beethoven's "Fifth Symphony."

What a remarkably fragile structure
to support such a valuable payload.

I'd like to respond to that sarcastically.

Hint: Sometimes they pack the alcohol
in their trunks.
