"Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter" in a notebook?

12:24.236 --> 12:27.103
Listening to my father go on
about what a great guy you are.

12:27.340 --> 12:30.241
You gotta admit, I'm delightful.

12:31.844 --> 12:33.675
Why are you making this so difficult?

12:33.879 --> 12:37.872
- It's not difficult for me, I'm having fun.
- Leonard.

12:38.084 --> 12:39.551
What do you want me to do?

12:39.719 --> 12:41.983
- Do you wanna tell him we're broken up?
- No.

12:42.154 --> 12:43.781
- Then what do you want?
- I don't know.

12:43.956 --> 12:47.687
Don't you think that's something
you should have figured out?

12:47.860 --> 12:49.521
Maybe.

12:49.862 --> 12:51.625
Leonard, Penny, excellent.

12:51.831 --> 12:54.629
I'd like to say I'm very happy
that you're back together...

12:54.834 --> 12:59.237
...and if I can figure out a way to do so
and sound sincere, I will.

12:59.438 --> 13:03.704
In the meantime, I'd like to go over some
changes to the Roommate Agreement...

13:03.876 --> 13:07.403
...specifically to address
Penny's annoying personal habits.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.912
Oh, my God. What personal habits?

13:10.116 --> 13:11.208
I have a list.

13:11.717 --> 13:15.153
FYI, overuse of the phrase
"Oh, my God" is Number 12.

13:16.722 --> 13:19.486
Sheldon, you don't have to do this,
because Leonard and I are no...

13:19.658 --> 13:23.094
- Bup, bup. You wanna include him in this?
- Include me in what?

13:23.262 --> 13:27.255
Is there a plot afoot?
I'll have no truck with plots.

13:27.900 --> 13:32.564
No, you're right.
No, there's no plots, no trucks, no feet.

13:32.738 --> 13:35.263
So, what other annoying habits
shall we discuss?

13:35.441 --> 13:36.999
We don't discuss anything.

13:37.176 --> 13:39.736
Leonard is the signatory
to the Roommate Agreement...

13:39.912 --> 13:44.372
...as such, he bears responsibility for all
your infractions and must pay all fines.

13:45.651 --> 13:46.811
- Fines?
- Yes.

13:47.019 --> 13:50.955
If Penny's spending nights here again,
you'll need to set up an escrow account.

to open that second bottle of wine.

14:17.516 --> 14:19.313
Well, live and learn.

14:19.852 --> 14:24.482
You think this planet you're looking for
has an atmosphere that supports life?

14:24.690 --> 14:25.782
Maybe.

14:25.958 --> 14:29.450
If it did, I'd be famous.
I'd be on the cover of magazines.

14:29.628 --> 14:33.359
And then instead of living alone in my
tiny apartment, I'd have a big mansion.

- It is.

empty house with no one to love you.

- We'd come visit you.
- No, you wouldn't.

You'd be intimidated
by my wealth and fame.

15:03.496 --> 15:05.327
Nope. He's gone.

15:05.998 --> 15:08.558
It's more than a year
since I've kissed a girl.

15:08.767 --> 15:11.668
What about that hookup at Comic-Con
you told me about?
