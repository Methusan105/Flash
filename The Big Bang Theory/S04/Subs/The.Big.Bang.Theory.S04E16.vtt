that if she disobeys...

any tension or awkwardness...

13:45.609 --> 13:49.306
Leonard, if your sister ever comes
to town, I shall have my way with her.

13:51.649 --> 13:53.742
My sister's 38 and married.

13:54.018 --> 13:57.146
All the more shame that will fall upon
the house of Hofstadter!

14:00.658 --> 14:03.456
- Ooh! I thought I smelled pizza.
- That's remarkable.

14:03.627 --> 14:05.720
If pepperoni were
an explosive substance...

14:05.896 --> 14:09.297
...you could replace German Shepherds
at our nation's airports.

14:10.534 --> 14:13.059
- Hi. Penny, right?
- Oh, yes, hi.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.966
Sorry, didn't know you had company.
I don't wanna impose.

14:16.140 --> 14:17.869
It's not an imposition.

14:18.042 --> 14:21.011
At this point in our ecosystem,
you are akin to the plover...

14:21.178 --> 14:22.839
...a small scavenging bird...

14:23.013 --> 14:25.982
...that eats extra food
from between the teeth of crocodiles.

14:28.152 --> 14:30.985
Please, fly into our open maw
and have at it.

14:33.557 --> 14:37.015
If I had more than a box of baking soda
I wouldn't have to take that.

14:39.930 --> 14:41.830
Hi, bestie.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.365
Hi.

14:46.837 --> 14:51.171
- So, um, Priya, you're a lawyer, right?
- I know, pretty boring, huh?

14:51.342 --> 14:54.778
Oh, come on, it's not boring at all.

14:54.945 --> 14:58.176
Uh, she's currently helping set up
a secondary derivative market...

14:58.349 --> 15:01.876
...which would allow overseas car firms
to hedge their investments...

15:02.052 --> 15:06.045
...against potential advancements
in battery technology.

15:06.557 --> 15:09.822
Thank you, Leonard.
That doesn't make it sound boring at all.

15:12.096 --> 15:14.064
LEONARD: I'm sorry, but...
- How you holding up?

15:15.866 --> 15:17.424
I'm fine.

15:17.601 --> 15:20.069
Who are you kidding?
She's breathtaking.

15:22.373 --> 15:24.898
So, Penny, Leonard tells me
you're an actress.

15:25.075 --> 15:28.442
- That must be pretty exciting.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's real great.

15:28.612 --> 15:32.378
Today I drove to an audition I thought
was gonna be for a cat food commercial.

15:32.549 --> 15:33.948
Turned out to be porn.

15:36.120 --> 15:37.849
Did you get the part?

15:40.257 --> 15:41.724
I didn't do the audition.

15:42.126 --> 15:45.289
Given the state of your career,
can you really afford to be picky?

15:48.132 --> 15:51.431
I took acting classes
when I was at Cambridge. I loved it.

15:51.602 --> 15:55.299
- We did Taming of the Shrew.
- Oh, wow, I love Taming of the Shrew.

15:55.472 --> 15:57.133
I did a paper on it in high school.

15:57.775 --> 16:00.505
Who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting?

16:00.677 --> 16:02.941
- In his tail.
- In his tongue.

16:03.113 --> 16:05.274
- Whose tongue?
- Yours, if you talk of tails...

16:05.449 --> 16:06.916
...and so farewell.

16:07.084 --> 16:08.915
What, with my tongue in your tail?

16:09.086 --> 16:11.111
[BOTH LAUGH]

16:16.460 --> 16:20.453
I'm regretting my earlier cattiness.
She is an absolute delight.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.066
Wow.

[PANTING]

16:32.409 --> 16:34.843
Wow indeed.

16:35.846 --> 16:39.282
- I can't believe we're living together.
- Yeah.

16:39.450 --> 16:41.315
You know what would make this
perfect?

16:41.485 --> 16:43.146
- What?
- A little snack.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.481
You got any string cheese?

16:46.924 --> 16:48.949
No. I might have some cheddar.

16:49.827 --> 16:52.660
Not as good.
You can't make strings with it.

16:53.831 --> 16:56.664
Remind me to put it
on your shopping list.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.024
Okay.

16:58.202 --> 17:00.898
- Do you have hypo-allergenic detergent?
- No.

17:01.071 --> 17:02.333
Better put it on the list.

17:02.506 --> 17:05.964
If you wash my underwear with regular
soap, I get little bumps on my tuchus.

17:06.143 --> 17:07.872
[CHUCKLES]

17:10.447 --> 17:13.211
Wait a second,
I'm doing your laundry?

17:13.684 --> 17:16.812
Well, honey, it's not gonna do itself.
Heh, heh.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.355
Oh, tomorrow morning
you're driving me to the dentist.

17:20.891 --> 17:22.358
I have to take you?

17:22.893 --> 17:25.453
You don't have to take me.
You get to take me.

17:27.030 --> 17:31.057
Wait a minute, are you telling me your
mother usually takes you to the dentist?

17:31.235 --> 17:35.365
Well, it's not weird. There's lots of kids
there with their moms.

17:37.174 --> 17:38.573
I can't believe this.

17:38.742 --> 17:40.334
What? It's fun.

17:40.511 --> 17:44.572
If I have no cavities,
afterwards we go out for a treat.

17:45.582 --> 17:48.016
Howard,
let's get something straight right now.

17:48.185 --> 17:49.880
I am not going to be your mother.

17:50.087 --> 17:53.181
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where did that come from?

18:01.732 --> 18:05.224
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Who's there? Is it a sex criminal?

18:06.436 --> 18:09.769
Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma!

18:10.607 --> 18:13.269
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Where were you?
- Didn't you read my email?

18:13.443 --> 18:17.641
MRS. WOLOWITZ: You know I can't turn on
that farkakt computer!

18:18.148 --> 18:21.208
I left you some brisket
on the kitchen counter.

18:21.385 --> 18:22.409
HOWARD:
Thank you!

18:22.586 --> 18:27.080
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Remember to floss after,
we have the dentist in the morning!

18:31.395 --> 18:33.795
- Oh, hey. What's up?
- I wanted to check in on you.

18:34.231 --> 18:36.495
- Why?
- Seems like the appropriate thing to do...

18:36.667 --> 18:40.501
...when one's best friend finds herself
replaced by a smart, beautiful woman...

18:40.671 --> 18:43.902
...with the smoldering sexuality
of a crouched Bengal tiger.

18:45.409 --> 18:47.240
I already told you, I'm okay with it.

18:47.411 --> 18:52.212
I mean, if anything, I'm quite pleased
that Leonard has found someone...

18:52.382 --> 18:55.078
[SOBBING]
...that makes him so happy.

18:55.252 --> 18:58.813
- Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
- Thank you.

18:59.256 --> 19:01.019
Let's get these electrodes
attached...

19:01.191 --> 19:03.682
...and see what's going on
in that noggin of yours.

It's actually Thai. You're slipping.

19:20.844 --> 19:24.302
- Are Leonard and Priya here?
- They went to Catalina for the weekend.

19:24.481 --> 19:28.542
- Oh, where's Raj?
- At home, forbidding it.

19:28.752 --> 19:29.946
How about Howard?

19:30.120 --> 19:34.318
I'm given to understand his mother
grounded him for running away.

19:34.891 --> 19:37.860
Oh, okay.

19:38.328 --> 19:41.695
Well, I guess
it's just the two of us, huh?

What up, bestie?

19:48.338 --> 19:51.535
Good news. Thanks to you, I was able
to make a rhesus monkey cry...

- Not really.

- Sheldon, you have a guest who's upset.
- Right. I'll make tea.
