["RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK"
THEME PLAYING ON TV]

00:17.814 --> 00:18.974
Okay, help me out here.

00:19.149 --> 00:22.846
How does an archeology professor
get that good with a whip?

00:23.420 --> 00:27.015
Maybe he took a class at the
adult bookstore. That's how I learned.

00:27.591 --> 00:29.855
I can't believe you've never seen
Raiders of the Lost Ark.

00:30.093 --> 00:33.585
And I can't believe you've never read
Eat, Pray, Love.

00:34.164 --> 00:38.999
When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run
Away From a Giant Boulder, I'll read it.

00:40.236 --> 00:44.798
I don't care if Eat, Pray, Love,
changed your life, I'm not reading it.

00:45.976 --> 00:48.001
You know,
I could totally rock a hat like that.

00:48.244 --> 00:51.839
That's the work of noted Hollywood
costume designer Deborah Nadoolman.

00:52.048 --> 00:56.178
She designed the red and black jacket
in Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video...

00:56.353 --> 00:58.548
...which I've never viewed
in its entirety...

00:58.755 --> 01:01.781
...as I find zombies dancing
in synchronicity implausible.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.628
And also, it's really scary.

01:06.830 --> 01:09.765
Could someone please turn off
the Sheldon commentary track?

01:10.500 --> 01:13.469
There's no switch.
Just listen and learn.

01:14.704 --> 01:16.865
Penny,
you should come with us Friday...

01:17.040 --> 01:19.338
...to see it on the big screen
at the Colonial.

01:19.509 --> 01:22.000
I'm watching it now.
Why would I wanna see it again?

01:22.178 --> 01:23.907
Because the print they're showing...

01:24.080 --> 01:28.141
...has an additional 21 seconds
of previously unseen footage.

01:28.351 --> 01:32.219
Wha... Twenty-one seconds?
That'll be like seeing a whole new movie.

01:32.856 --> 01:35.916
Exactly. They say it finally solves
the submarine controversy.

01:36.493 --> 01:40.429
Leonard, I'm no expert, but I believe
what we just heard from Penny...

01:40.597 --> 01:42.827
...was sarcasm.

01:43.033 --> 01:46.230
Oh, good. I'm 8-for-26 this month.

01:48.104 --> 01:51.665
Yeah, I think I'll pass. But you guys
enjoy your extra 21 seconds.

01:51.841 --> 01:55.675
If I could make you understand why this
is a cool thing, we'd still be together.

01:55.879 --> 01:58.871
Hmm... Yeah. No, we wouldn't.

01:59.949 --> 02:03.077
Uh-huh. I'm guessing 21 seconds
had something to do with that too.

02:03.253 --> 02:04.584
[CHUCKLES]

02:36.119 --> 02:39.748
May I point out to you all that
the screening is first come, first served?

02:39.956 --> 02:43.289
Relax, it's 5:00.
The movie doesn't start till midnight.

02:44.327 --> 02:49.094
Another way of saying that is: The movie
starts at midnight and it's already 5:00.

02:49.299 --> 02:52.291
If we miss it, we'll have the fun of
listening to Sheldon...

02:52.469 --> 02:54.630
...whine about it
for the rest of our lives.

02:54.838 --> 02:57.466
See? Howard's on my side.

02:57.974 --> 03:01.102
Actually, I'm not.
I'm using sarcasm to mock you.

03:01.311 --> 03:04.508
Drat. Now I'm 8-for-27.

03:05.181 --> 03:07.012
Don't worry, Sheldon. We'll be fine.

03:07.217 --> 03:11.119
What happened to the Leonard who
waited in line with me for 14 hours...

03:11.287 --> 03:13.619
...to see the premiere
of Star Trek: Nemesis?

03:13.823 --> 03:18.021
Oh, well, he waited in line for 14 hours
while you napped in a lawn chair...

03:18.194 --> 03:20.992
...he got in a fight
when he stepped out of line to pee...

03:21.164 --> 03:23.462
...and you wouldn't wake up
to vouch for him.

03:23.633 --> 03:26.534
And worst of all,
he saw Star Trek: Nemesis.

03:27.137 --> 03:28.661
But how were our seats?

03:29.205 --> 03:31.332
- Excellent.
- I rest my case.

03:31.541 --> 03:34.510
Amy, don't you agree we should
leave now and get in line?

03:36.379 --> 03:38.540
As the newest member
of your social group...

03:38.715 --> 03:43.049
...I'll gain more acceptance by siding
with your friends from time to time.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.015
Shrewd.

03:47.390 --> 03:50.416
Leonard, you're right.
We should enjoy our meal, arrive late...

03:50.627 --> 03:54.358
...and risk winding up with terrible seats,
assuming we get in at all.

03:55.064 --> 03:56.656
Thank you, Amy.

03:56.833 --> 03:58.926
See? It's working.

04:00.570 --> 04:02.538
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

04:02.705 --> 04:04.570
- Olive.
- "I love" you too.

04:04.741 --> 04:06.766
[CHUCKLES]

04:06.943 --> 04:09.036
Guys, that's really starting to get old.

04:09.712 --> 04:11.270
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

04:11.514 --> 04:12.845
I have a girlfriend and you don't.

04:13.016 --> 04:14.142
[CHUCKLES]

04:14.317 --> 04:16.182
Hysterical.

04:16.386 --> 04:21.221
We don't know that yet, he isn't finished.
I have a girlfriend and you don't who?

04:22.192 --> 04:25.184
So are you sure you don't wanna
come with us to Raiders?

04:25.361 --> 04:28.228
Oh, no. That movie has melting faces.

04:28.398 --> 04:29.729
It reminds me of the time...

04:29.899 --> 04:33.391
...I dropped that vial of flesh-eating
bacteria into the monkey lab.

04:35.672 --> 04:38.436
Besides, Penny and I
are having a girls' night tonight.

04:38.975 --> 04:40.602
Girls' night? What does that entail?

04:40.810 --> 04:44.541
Oh, you know, girls get together,
hang out, share girl talk.

04:44.981 --> 04:46.744
I'm a girl.

04:48.985 --> 04:51.385
Well, maybe you can join us.
I'll ask Penny.

04:51.588 --> 04:54.250
No need. Penny and I are very close.

04:54.991 --> 04:56.481
- You are?
- Yes.

04:56.693 --> 04:59.218
In fact, our menses are synchronized.

05:04.901 --> 05:07.597
Penny, Bernadette tells me
you're planning a girls' night.

05:07.804 --> 05:09.101
Yeah?

05:09.272 --> 05:11.001
I'm a girl.

05:12.141 --> 05:14.473
Oh, it was just gonna be
me and Bernadette.

05:14.644 --> 05:16.976
I thought you were going to movies
with the guys?

05:17.213 --> 05:19.841
Yes, but they're not girls. I'm a girl.

05:21.584 --> 05:24.075
Yeah. No, no. I got that.

05:24.988 --> 05:28.082
- What's the dress code?
- Just wear something comfortable.

05:28.291 --> 05:31.920
All right. I'll have to go shopping.

05:33.596 --> 05:34.858
Knock, knock.

05:35.098 --> 05:36.622
- Who's there?
- Hugh.

05:36.833 --> 05:40.291
- Hugh who?
- "You" people need to listen to me.

05:44.741 --> 05:47.266
It's time to get in line for the movie.

05:48.011 --> 05:50.639
And that's how you tell
a knock-knock joke.

05:53.650 --> 05:58.644
Under normal circumstances
I'd say I told you so...

05:59.389 --> 06:03.348
...but as I have told you so with such
vehemence and frequency already...

06:03.526 --> 06:05.551
...the phrase has lost all meaning.

06:05.762 --> 06:11.359
Therefore, I will be replacing it
with the phrase "I informed you thusly."

06:11.534 --> 06:13.661
Can't wait for that to start.

06:13.836 --> 06:15.997
I informed you thusly.

06:16.572 --> 06:19.541
Eight-for-28.

06:19.709 --> 06:23.338
This is where we could've been
if we hadn't stopped for dinner.

06:24.013 --> 06:27.881
This is where we could've been
if Koothrappali hadn't ordered dessert.

06:28.084 --> 06:29.984
I earned it, dude. I ate all my broccoli.

06:30.186 --> 06:35.180
And here's where we are,
the runts in a large litter...

06:35.391 --> 06:40.886
...unlikely to ever reach
the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.

06:41.097 --> 06:43.827
So I guess it's a good thing
we stopped for dinner.

06:44.734 --> 06:46.201
[SCOFFS]

06:46.869 --> 06:49.531

Eat, Pray, Love teaches us...

06:49.706 --> 06:51.936
Oh, shut up.

06:54.110 --> 06:56.340
So, anyway,
to make a long story short...

06:56.512 --> 06:59.845
...turns out I have
an unusually firm cervix.

07:02.018 --> 07:04.919
You know, heh, Amy,
when we say girl talk...

07:05.088 --> 07:09.047
...it doesn't just have to be
about our lady parts.

07:09.592 --> 07:13.392
Shame. Because I have a real zinger
about my tilted uterus.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.059
Penny, your nails look great.

07:21.270 --> 07:22.294
Oh, thanks.

07:22.472 --> 07:25.464
I found this place in Alhambra.
It's in a woman's basement.

07:25.641 --> 07:30.044
I think it's a front for human trafficking,
but they do a really good job.

07:31.914 --> 07:34.405
A colleague of mine did her thesis
on the fungus...

07:34.584 --> 07:37.883
...that grows on improperly sterilized
manicure implements.

07:38.421 --> 07:40.787
Well, don't tell me that's not girl talk.

07:41.958 --> 07:45.758
So where should we go tonight?
A bar? A club? A movie?

07:45.928 --> 07:47.589
Or we could just stay here.

07:47.797 --> 07:49.264
Yes, and continue to bond.

07:49.432 --> 07:52.993
I have a feeling that after tonight, one
of you will become my best friend forever.

Or BFF, if you prefer.

07:56.105 --> 07:57.766
Which I don't.

All right,
time to open Bachelor Number 2.

08:02.779 --> 08:06.010
Gee, I don't know if I should drink more.
I have to drive home.

08:06.182 --> 08:09.379
And I've got enough trouble
seeing over the dashboard as it is.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.150
That's okay. You can just sleep here.

08:13.322 --> 08:14.949
Oh, good, a slumber party.

08:15.124 --> 08:17.490
We'll do makeovers,
initiate phony phone calls...

08:17.660 --> 08:20.925
...and have spirited pillow fights
in our frilly nighties.

08:21.097 --> 08:24.430
Gosh, Amy, I don't know if I would
call this an actual slumber party.

08:24.634 --> 08:27.501
Oh, I've always wanted to be
invited to a slumber party.

08:27.703 --> 08:30.467
- Oh, you never were?
- Not even when you were a kid?

08:31.107 --> 08:33.166
There was the time
I had my tonsils out...

08:33.342 --> 08:36.311
...and I shared a room
with a little Vietnamese girl.

08:37.113 --> 08:40.810
She didn't make it through the night,
but up till then it was kind of fun.

08:42.452 --> 08:46.946
Okay, well, I guess we're having
a slumber party.

to use the bathroom.

every time. It's a vicious circle.

a stadium pal like me.

09:09.679 --> 09:10.873

and it keeps your calf warm.

Hey, guys, bad news,
I just did a quick calculation.

09:19.021 --> 09:22.855
Given the size of the theater
and this line, we might not get seats.

your relationship with him?
