00:03.689 --> 00:05.350
Here's what I wonder about zombies.

00:05.558 --> 00:07.685
[SHELDON, LEONARD & HOWARD GROAN]

00:07.860 --> 00:10.522
What happens if they can't get
any human flesh to eat?

00:10.696 --> 00:13.824
They can't starve to death,
they're already dead.

00:13.999 --> 00:16.297
You take this one.
I spent an hour last night...

00:16.469 --> 00:20.371
...on how do vampires shave when
they can't see themselves in the mirror?

00:21.707 --> 00:25.302
Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs
and shave each other. Case closed.

00:26.545 --> 00:30.709
- Yeah, okay, so, zombies?
- I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj.

00:30.883 --> 00:32.874
Are we talking slow zombies,
fast zombies?

00:33.052 --> 00:36.180
Like in 28 Days, if those zombies
didn't eat, they starved.

00:36.355 --> 00:39.688
That's 28 Days Later. 28 Days is where
Sandra Bullock goes to rehab...

00:39.859 --> 00:42.555
...and puts the audience
into an undead state.

00:43.028 --> 00:44.996
Hey, don't bag on Sandra Bullock.

00:45.164 --> 00:48.827
You think it makes you look cultured,
but you just come off as bitter.

00:50.002 --> 00:52.436
Dr. Siebert, 12 o'clock.

00:52.738 --> 00:56.196
Why's the president of the university
slumming in the cafeteria? Ha, ha.

00:56.375 --> 00:58.741
Perhaps he's emulating
Shakespeare's Henry V...

00:58.911 --> 01:01.004
...who dressed as a commoner
and mingled...

01:01.180 --> 01:03.671
...to find out how he was
perceived by his subjects.

01:03.849 --> 01:06.716
If he'd have read any of the
1300 e-mails I've sent him...

01:06.886 --> 01:10.845
...on the subject of his administration
he could have saved himself the trouble.

01:11.323 --> 01:13.518
Or maybe he heard
it's Tater Tot Tuesday.

01:14.093 --> 01:16.254
That's why I'm here.

01:16.595 --> 01:18.426
Hey, there's my favorite geniuses.

01:19.265 --> 01:21.358
- How are we doing today?
- That depends.

01:21.534 --> 01:24.765
How much longer do you plan
on fondling my shoulder?

01:24.937 --> 01:27.633
Sorry, Dr. Cooper.
I forgot you have a touch phobia.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.604
It's not a touch phobia,
it's a germ phobia.

01:30.776 --> 01:34.712
If you'd like to go put on latex gloves,
I'll let you check me for a hernia.

01:35.781 --> 01:39.308
Yeah. So listen, fellas, who's up for
a little party this Saturday night?

01:39.485 --> 01:42.545
Open bar, good eats,
might even be a few pretty girls.

01:42.721 --> 01:43.949
- Sounds good.
- I'm in. Ha, ha.

01:44.156 --> 01:47.125
Hold on. Just because
the nice man is offering you candy...

01:47.293 --> 01:50.729
...doesn't mean you should jump into
his windowless van.

01:52.431 --> 01:55.628
- What's the occasion?
- Just a fundraiser for the university.

01:55.835 --> 01:59.362
Aha. The tear-stained air mattress
in the back of the van.

01:59.905 --> 02:01.964
I understand your reticence,
Dr. Cooper.

02:02.141 --> 02:03.438
And I sympathize.

02:03.609 --> 02:06.009
But the facts are,
we have to shake a few hands...

02:06.178 --> 02:08.612
...and kiss butts to raise money
for our research.

02:08.781 --> 02:11.841
I don't care, it's demeaning
and I refuse to be trotted out...

02:12.017 --> 02:14.986
...and shown off like a prize hog
at the Texas State Fair...

02:15.154 --> 02:17.486
...which is something
you don't want to attend...

02:17.656 --> 02:20.124
...wearing a Star Trek
ensign's uniform.

02:20.493 --> 02:22.256
All right, let me put it this way.

02:22.428 --> 02:25.454
You're gonna put on a suit,
you're gonna come to this party...

02:25.631 --> 02:28.429
...and you're gonna explain
your research to old people...

02:28.601 --> 02:31.263
...or I swear to God, I'll blind you
with a hot spoon...

02:31.437 --> 02:34.600
...like they did to that little boy
in Slumdog Millionaire.

02:35.174 --> 02:36.937
Oh. You don't want that.

02:38.511 --> 02:40.502
So Saturday night.
It's gonna be off the hook.

02:40.679 --> 02:43.307
- Unh.
- Get over it.

02:44.817 --> 02:47.786
Oh, boy,
Tater Tots and a party invitation?

02:47.953 --> 02:49.648
What a great day.

03:17.683 --> 03:19.310
There you go.

03:23.155 --> 03:25.020
Are you sure this is right?

03:25.190 --> 03:27.988
Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants,
you'll be fine.

03:28.894 --> 03:33.593
Okay, let's go smooch
some rich, wrinkled tuchis.

03:33.766 --> 03:37.634
Oh, Howard, I can't believe Bernadette let
you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey.

03:37.803 --> 03:41.034
Ha, ha. Excuse me, my girlfriend
doesn't pick out my clothes.

03:41.206 --> 03:43.106
My mother does.

03:44.510 --> 03:45.670
Oh, we should get going.

03:45.844 --> 03:49.007
- What about Sheldon?
- Sheldon is not going.

03:49.181 --> 03:50.705
Really? What do we tell Siebert?

03:51.216 --> 03:54.344
Tell him Dr. Cooper feels
that the best use of his time...

03:54.520 --> 03:57.546
...is to employ his rare
and precious mental faculties...

03:57.723 --> 04:00.658
...to tear the mask off nature
and stare at the face of God.

04:02.428 --> 04:06.057
Sheldon, it's Saturday night.
You'll be doing laundry.

04:06.231 --> 04:08.563
Don't tell him that.
Tell him the mask thing.

04:15.140 --> 04:18.303
- Hey, put your tie back in your pants.
- Thanks.

04:18.744 --> 04:19.802
Nice place.

04:19.979 --> 04:22.539
Reminds me of my parents'
house back in New Delhi.

04:22.715 --> 04:24.706
- You're kidding.
- No, we are very wealthy.

04:24.883 --> 04:27.909
But the only difference is
we have more servants.

04:28.087 --> 04:30.180
- More than this?
- More than we can use.

04:30.356 --> 04:34.349
See, in India we don't make the mistake
of letting our poor people have dreams.

04:34.960 --> 04:38.953
Ah. There's my band of brainiacs.
Where's Dr. Cooper?

04:39.465 --> 04:40.489
[SIGHS]

04:40.699 --> 04:44.760
He's tearing the mask off nature
to look at the face of God.

04:45.504 --> 04:49.838
The board of directors insists he has a
beautiful mind, I think he's just bananas.

04:50.009 --> 04:53.001
Let me introduce you to
one of the university's leading donors.

04:54.013 --> 04:55.708
[CLEARS THROAT]

04:56.081 --> 04:59.073
I think we were misled
about the cute girls.

04:59.585 --> 05:02.611
Mrs. Latham, I'd like you to meet
our outstanding researchers.

05:02.788 --> 05:06.383
This is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali...

05:06.558 --> 05:07.684
...and Howard Wolowitz.

05:07.860 --> 05:09.384
What happened to you, Wolowitz?

05:09.561 --> 05:13.122
Couldn't stick with it
long enough to get your Ph. D?

05:13.298 --> 05:16.461
I'm an engineer. Most engineers
don't bother with a Ph.D.

05:16.635 --> 05:20.969
You may be interested to know I designed
the zero-gravity waste system for NASA.

05:21.140 --> 05:23.631
Got it. You're a space plumber.

05:26.278 --> 05:28.303
I'm gonna go hit the bar.

05:30.416 --> 05:31.610
Tell me about these two.

05:31.784 --> 05:33.877
Do him first.

05:34.253 --> 05:37.381
Dr. Hofstadter is representing our
experimental physics program.

05:37.556 --> 05:39.581
You'll hear about his fascinating work.

05:39.758 --> 05:41.953
Right. Fascinate me.

05:42.861 --> 05:44.522
[STAMMERS]

05:45.297 --> 05:48.425
They're cute when they're about
to wet themselves, aren't they?

05:48.600 --> 05:49.760
I'll make it easy.

05:49.935 --> 05:53.564
When you arrive at the lab in the
morning, what machine do you turn on?

05:54.973 --> 05:56.838
Coffee maker?

05:57.443 --> 06:00.640
All right, Dr. Kooth...
Whatever it is. You're up.

06:01.246 --> 06:04.443
It's Koothrappali. I have to tinkle.

06:08.253 --> 06:12.485
And so, instead of bowing to pressure
and going to that pointless soiree...

06:12.658 --> 06:15.923
...I stayed right here
and did a load of whites.

06:16.962 --> 06:21.422
Well, normally I respect your macho
rebellious attitude toward the man...

06:22.434 --> 06:25.198
...but in this case
I think you've made a foolish mistake.

06:25.671 --> 06:26.933
Unlikely...

06:28.173 --> 06:29.640
...but make your case.

06:29.808 --> 06:31.969
Keeping in mind
that your critical attitude...

06:32.144 --> 06:33.873
...is ruining our night together...

06:34.079 --> 06:36.604
...and I'm not above
minimizing your window.

06:37.716 --> 06:39.377
Sheldon, like it or not...

06:39.585 --> 06:43.453
...until you upload your intelligence
to a self-sustaining orbiting satellite...

06:43.622 --> 06:46.648
...equipped with high-speed Internet
and a cloaking device...

06:46.825 --> 06:50.192
...you will be dependent on other
members of the human race.

06:50.362 --> 06:52.557
That's it, prepare to be minimized.

06:52.731 --> 06:56.189
I'm not finished.
All scientists have to fundraise, Sheldon.

06:56.368 --> 06:58.029
How do you think I paid for my lab?

06:58.203 --> 07:01.969
I went to Saudi Arabia, met with a prince
who had an interest in neurobiology.

07:02.474 --> 07:05.807
Your lab is funded by some
Middle Eastern dilettante?

07:05.978 --> 07:08.538
Technically, Faisal is my fiancÃ©...

07:11.350 --> 07:13.545
...but I do have a
two-photon microscope...

07:13.719 --> 07:16.119
...and a place to stay in Riyadh
for the winter.

07:17.256 --> 07:22.091
That explains those puzzling camel race
photos on your Facebook page.

07:22.261 --> 07:25.992
And consider this: Without you to make
the case for the Physics Department...

07:26.165 --> 07:28.565
...the task falls to people
like Leonard and Raj.

07:28.734 --> 07:30.861
Are you trying to scare me?

07:31.036 --> 07:33.027
Because you're succeeding.

07:33.205 --> 07:34.934
Well, then prepare to be terrified.

07:35.140 --> 07:36.767
If your friends are unconvincing...

07:36.942 --> 07:39.911
...this year's donations might go to
the Geology Department.

07:40.078 --> 07:43.445
Oh, dear, no, not the dirt people.

07:45.083 --> 07:49.747
Or worse, it could go to
the Liberal Arts.

07:51.557 --> 07:53.047
No.

07:53.959 --> 07:57.122
Millions of dollars being showered
on poets, literary theorists...

07:57.296 --> 07:59.730
...and students of gender studies.

08:00.933 --> 08:03.800
Oh, the humanities.

08:05.671 --> 08:07.468
I don't think President Siebert...

08:07.673 --> 08:10.767
...will be making us
go to any more fundraisers.

08:10.943 --> 08:12.808
It was so much easier
at my bar mitzvah.

08:12.978 --> 08:17.540
The old people came up to you, pinched
your cheek, handed you a savings bond.

08:17.983 --> 08:19.883
Oh, don't be such gloomy Gusses.

08:20.052 --> 08:22.748
Look at the size of these shrimp.

08:23.222 --> 08:26.214
At what point
do we start calling them lobsters?

08:26.825 --> 08:29.623
Face it, Raj,
we crashed and burned tonight.

08:29.795 --> 08:31.763
Oh, you didn't do that badly.

08:33.398 --> 08:37.732
The first machine I turn on is the helium-
neon laser, because it needs to warm up.

08:37.903 --> 08:40.599
I no longer care, dear.

08:40.772 --> 08:43.832
But don't worry, I really enjoyed
meeting you this evening.

08:44.009 --> 08:45.840
You're kidding?
That was good for you?

08:46.011 --> 08:48.002
Because I was sweating
through my T-shirt.

08:48.780 --> 08:50.805
Excellent.
There's nothing I like better...

08:50.983 --> 08:54.180
...than making smart people
feel ill at ease.

08:54.353 --> 08:56.753
- Why?
- I don't know, it's one of the fun things...

08:56.922 --> 08:59.720
...you get to do
when you have lots of money.

09:00.492 --> 09:04.019
Watch. Hey! Who said
you could eat that shrimp?

09:08.267 --> 09:10.030
See? Fun.

09:10.235 --> 09:11.862
SHELDON:
No, no, no. I'm just...

09:12.037 --> 09:16.474
...here for your money. I don't wanna
shake anyone's germy hands.

09:17.309 --> 09:19.243
Explain it to them, Siebert.

09:24.316 --> 09:27.376
I must confess, I don't understand you,
President Siebert.

09:27.552 --> 09:30.248
First you say you want me to appear
at your fundraisers.

09:30.422 --> 09:33.914
But now you say you never want me
to go anywhere near your fundraisers.

09:34.092 --> 09:36.560
Forgive me, but that sounds
like a mixed message.

09:37.663 --> 09:42.726
Here we go again. If there's simply
no talking to me, then why did you call?

09:44.069 --> 09:45.934
I'm sorry, someone's on the other line.

09:46.104 --> 09:50.336
Uh, why don't you see if you can organize
your thoughts and we'll try again later.

09:51.376 --> 09:54.072
Cooper-Hofstadter residence.
Go for Cooper.

09:54.246 --> 09:55.713
Good morning, Mrs. Latham.

09:56.248 --> 09:57.875
Yes, of course I remember you.

09:58.050 --> 10:01.349
A woman well past her prime
seeking to augment her social status...

10:01.520 --> 10:04.387
...by doling out her late husband's
ill-gotten gains.

10:05.958 --> 10:08.586
So how much money
are you going to give me?

10:09.695 --> 10:12.596
I'm not crazy,
my mother had me tested.

10:13.732 --> 10:16.895
If you're not going to give me money,
then why are you calling?

10:18.036 --> 10:20.095
She wants to talk to you.

10:20.605 --> 10:22.596
Who's crazy now?

10:23.608 --> 10:25.769
Hello, Mrs. Latham.

10:25.944 --> 10:28.139
Yes, I live with him.

10:28.847 --> 10:30.781
I don't... I really don't know why.

10:36.955 --> 10:39.617
Tonight? Sure. That'd be great.

10:40.359 --> 10:43.954
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.

10:44.429 --> 10:47.489
Uh, she wants to have dinner
and talk about my research.

10:47.666 --> 10:50.260
An entire dinner
to talk about your research?

10:51.870 --> 10:54.634
Where are you going,
the drive-through at Jack in the Box?

10:58.243 --> 11:02.179
Well, wherever we're going,
she's sending a car to pick me up.

11:02.647 --> 11:05.741
- Okay, I see what's happening.
- What?

11:05.917 --> 11:07.817
My stature intimidates her...

11:07.986 --> 11:11.149
...so she's using you to get to me.

11:13.325 --> 11:15.418
Crafty old gal.

11:15.594 --> 11:16.618
Excuse me...

11:16.795 --> 11:19.593
...but you are not the only
scientist in this apartment.

11:19.765 --> 11:21.528
I've been published in journals...

11:21.700 --> 11:26.194
...I received a dissertation-of-the-year
award for experimental particle physics.

11:26.405 --> 11:27.963
No, that can't be it.

11:28.807 --> 11:30.468
Since you seem to have forgotten...

11:30.642 --> 11:33.167
...the reason we live together
is we're best friends.

11:33.345 --> 11:35.404
And I got your back, Jack.

11:38.950 --> 11:40.315
That was a great meal.

11:40.485 --> 11:41.850
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

11:42.020 --> 11:43.885
I eat this well
when my mom's in town...

11:44.056 --> 11:46.718
...and she takes me out to dinner.
- Is that so?

11:46.925 --> 11:48.517
You kind of remind me of her.

11:49.161 --> 11:52.187
She enjoys
making people uncomfortable too.

11:52.931 --> 11:55.365
Well, you remind me of a boy
I dated in college.

11:55.534 --> 11:58.094
- No kidding.
- Sweet boy, very smart.

11:58.270 --> 12:01.034
- Huh.
- Lf only he'd had money.

12:03.842 --> 12:06.072
Yeah, um, so hey...

12:06.244 --> 12:10.180
...speaking of money, how are you feeling
about helping the Physics Department...

12:10.348 --> 12:13.181
...get a cryogenic centrifugal pump
and molecular sieve?

12:13.385 --> 12:16.684
Well, I must say you make
a very persuasive case for it.

12:17.022 --> 12:18.353
Oh, good, good.

taking it to the next level.

Okay, now you don't remind me
of my mom.

I'm sorry, so eventually zombies...

12:44.349 --> 12:48.080
...are going to attack the rehab facility
where Sandra Bullock is?

12:51.189 --> 12:52.884
Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.

12:54.626 --> 12:57.254
It's a shame,
all that work she's doing to get sober...

12:57.429 --> 12:59.590
...only to be torn apart and eaten alive.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.232
- Hey, how was dinner?
- Swell. I need a drink.

13:06.404 --> 13:08.031
Do we have any alcohol?

13:08.206 --> 13:09.798
No. But we have potatoes.

13:10.008 --> 13:12.135
I could make you vodka.

13:12.310 --> 13:13.538
It'll take two weeks.

13:15.013 --> 13:16.446
Leonard, are you okay?

13:16.615 --> 13:18.378
Uh, I'm not sure.

- What's going on?
- Well...

13:20.619 --> 13:23.884
...Mrs. Latham said she was seriously
considering donating money...

13:24.055 --> 13:26.319
...so we could get
a cryogenic centrifugal pump.

13:26.525 --> 13:27.651
- Oh, wow.
- Yes!

13:27.826 --> 13:30.294
Then she stuck her tongue
down my throat.

13:31.129 --> 13:32.562
Why?

13:33.798 --> 13:37.757
We can't keep explaining everything.
Read that book we got you.

13:38.937 --> 13:40.165
She hit on me.

13:40.338 --> 13:44.104
Wait. Are you telling us that old lady
wanted to have sex with you...

13:44.276 --> 13:47.768
...in exchange for giving
your department millions of dollars?

13:47.946 --> 13:51.040
- I think so.
- You lucky duck.

13:52.150 --> 13:54.482
You're really a broken toy, aren't you?

13:55.854 --> 13:59.847
I was able to get out of there, but she
wants to see me again tomorrow night.

Excellent.
What are you planning to wear?

14:03.595 --> 14:04.960
- What?
- Penny.

sexual favors for gain.

Whoa, uh, hold on a second.
I'm not going to sleep with her.

14:14.806 --> 14:17.673
But we need
a cryogenic centrifugal pump.

14:18.677 --> 14:20.440
Forget it. It's not gonna happen.

14:20.612 --> 14:22.102
Well, come now, Leonard...

to make a real contribution to science.

14:32.958 --> 14:36.792
What was all that about me trading
sexual favors for material gain?

14:36.962 --> 14:39.021
It was a compliment.

14:39.864 --> 14:42.128
I believe in giving credit
where credit is due.

is here for you.

I won't be late. I'm gonna make a pitch
for the funding and say good night.

Hold on. I have something for you.

14:57.882 --> 15:00.180
- What's this?
- Few things you may need tonight.

15:00.352 --> 15:02.183
There's baby oil, condoms...

15:02.354 --> 15:06.222
...and, uh, a little something I procured
from the School of Pharmacology.

15:06.391 --> 15:10.327
They say it is to Viagra
as Viagra is to a green M&M.

15:14.666 --> 15:17.032
I am not going to have sex with her.

15:17.202 --> 15:19.193
Maybe this will overcome
your reluctance.

15:19.371 --> 15:21.669
I went on the Internet
and found a photograph...

15:21.840 --> 15:25.401

Given how much time you spend
engaging in pointless self-abuse...

15:49.601 --> 15:51.762

...using your genitalia
to actually accomplish something.

15:57.742 --> 16:02.611
- Still won't shag the old lady, huh?
- No. But thank you for asking.

- Hey, hi.
- Hello, Leonard.

16:08.620 --> 16:10.144
