If they took all the money they spent
trying to make a decent Hulk movie...

...they could probably
just make an actual Hulk.

00:12.756 --> 00:14.383
That is apt and amusing.

00:15.392 --> 00:18.452
I think I shall share that
with Amy Farrah Fowler.

00:19.563 --> 00:22.157
- She'll appreciate the witticism.
- Thank you.

00:22.366 --> 00:25.563
It will also help improve
her initial impression of you.

- Oh, the status is as it always was.

- No, no.

Maybe a little.

01:08.479 --> 01:11.880
May I suggest that your criticism
is based on jealousy?

01:12.049 --> 01:14.677
Heh, jealousy? What do I have
to be jealous of?

01:14.852 --> 01:18.618

02:39.770 --> 02:41.795
Is it because of the conflict
that arises...

02:41.972 --> 02:43.940

to pair bond with a woman...

LEONARD: Who is it?
AMY: Amy Farrah Fowler.

12:19.382 --> 12:22.783
- Darn! She found me.
- She's been here before.

12:24.654 --> 12:27.214
The only flaw
in an otherwise perfect plan.

12:29.426 --> 12:31.656
- Now get my back, Jack.
- What do you wanna do?

12:31.828 --> 12:33.420
- Tell her I'm not here.
- Where are you?

12:33.596 --> 12:35.530
I don't know.
You'll have to devise a scenario...

12:35.699 --> 12:37.326
...that plausibly explains
my absence...

12:37.500 --> 12:42.096
...keeping in mind that the key
to a good lie lies in the details.

12:42.839 --> 12:43.863
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

12:55.118 --> 12:58.884
- Hi, Amy. Sheldon's not here.
- All right.

13:04.327 --> 13:06.056
Way to go on the details.

13:08.698 --> 13:12.600
- Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.
- Oh, I take pacts very seriously.

13:12.769 --> 13:13.861
One time at my lab...

13:14.037 --> 13:17.097
...a Petri dish of genetically modified
super-virus went missing.

13:17.273 --> 13:18.900
That day, we made a pinky swear...

13:19.075 --> 13:22.636
...never to admit that we crossed
Ebola with the common cold.

13:23.546 --> 13:27.448
Heh. Why the hell would you cross
Ebola with the common cold?

13:28.151 --> 13:32.747
We never did.
That would be a terrible, terrible thing.

13:34.391 --> 13:36.154
Hi, sorry I'm late.
I was at the gym.

13:36.626 --> 13:40.392
Spin class,
worked up quite a sweat.

13:43.299 --> 13:45.392
Joy, this is Leonard.
Leonard, this is Joy.

13:45.568 --> 13:47.695
- Hi.
- Hi. You don't look like a genius.

13:47.871 --> 13:48.895
- Go ahead, say something smart.
- Um...

13:49.072 --> 13:50.096
Ehh, time's up.

13:50.273 --> 13:52.241
[LAUGHS]

13:52.642 --> 13:55.236
Just kidding. First thing
you need to know about me...

13:55.412 --> 13:56.674
...I’m hilarious.

13:56.846 --> 13:58.609
[LAUGHS]

13:58.782 --> 14:00.374
Yeah.

14:01.184 --> 14:04.176
So Bernadette tells me she knows you
from, uh, self-defense classes.

14:04.387 --> 14:07.322
Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga.
Lots of fun.

14:07.824 --> 14:11.157
Basically, a hundred different ways
to rip a guy's nuts off.

14:12.429 --> 14:14.192
Wouldn't think there'd be that many.

14:14.397 --> 14:16.763
- Number 42.
- Whoa!

14:16.933 --> 14:18.423
Isn't she a pip?

14:26.109 --> 14:28.873
SHELDON:
Proxima Centauri's the nearest star.

Hey. This is a date, right?

15:57.500 --> 15:58.728

Ahem, excuse me, I have to go
to the little girls' room...

16:04.874 --> 16:06.136
...and take a wicked whiz.

16:07.210 --> 16:08.609
I'll go with you.

Fair warning, I had the asparagus.

Excuse me, madam.

16:37.907 --> 16:39.602
Sheldon?

16:39.976 --> 16:41.341
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Rats!

16:42.445 --> 16:44.572
I believe a misunderstanding
may have occurred...

16:44.747 --> 16:46.738
...when I asked you
to meet my mother.

16:46.916 --> 16:48.042
No misunderstanding.

16:48.218 --> 16:50.743
I've learned what
that request actually means...

16:50.920 --> 16:53.411
...and I don't want
to be joined to another object...

16:53.590 --> 16:57.185
...by an inclined plane
wrapped helically around an axis.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.193
In what way are you screwed?

17:01.064 --> 17:03.965
All I wanna do is present you
as my boyfriend to my mother...

17:04.133 --> 17:06.966
...so she'll be satisfied
that I'm in a relationship.

17:07.136 --> 17:10.537
- So we'd be perpetrating a ruse?
- Precisely.

17:10.707 --> 17:14.143
And you haven't fallen
hopelessly in love with me?

17:14.310 --> 17:15.777
Don't be absurd.

17:17.313 --> 17:20.544
I find the notion of romantic love to be
an unnecessary cultural construct...

17:20.717 --> 17:22.844
...that adds no value
to human relationships.

17:24.320 --> 17:28.723
Amy, that's the most pragmatic thing
anyone has ever said to me.

17:29.125 --> 17:31.457
I trust this clarification
allows us to return...

17:31.628 --> 17:34.392
...to boy-slash-friend-
slash-girl-slash-friend status.

17:34.597 --> 17:35.996
Of course.

17:36.165 --> 17:38.395
Would you like to join me
for Chinese food?

17:38.601 --> 17:40.728
Sheldon, please,
you're suffocating me.

My apologies.

- Good night, Amy.
AMY: Good night, Sheldon.

Come on, just give her a chance.
Maybe she'll grow on you.

17:52.115 --> 17:55.744
Or maybe she'll finally succeed
in ripping my nuts off.

17:57.387 --> 18:00.117
There's still 93 ways
she hasn't tried yet.

18:01.057 --> 18:02.718
Uh, Howard, I appreciate the effort...

18:02.892 --> 18:05.326
...but this is, like,
the worst date of my life.

18:05.495 --> 18:06.985
Heh, seriously?

18:07.163 --> 18:10.189
I was once robbed by a pre-op
transsexual I met on JDate...

18:10.366 --> 18:13.665
...and that didn't
even crack my top 10.

18:14.170 --> 18:17.196
Well, I guess the difference is
I have some self-respect.

18:17.373 --> 18:19.671
Not that I've ever seen.

18:19.842 --> 18:21.275
It's relatively new.

18:22.412 --> 18:25.347
I just know I'm not gonna
spend time with someone I don't like...

18:25.515 --> 18:26.948
...simply to have a girlfriend.

18:27.150 --> 18:28.549
I'm okay on my own.

18:28.718 --> 18:32.210
Good news,
I made lots of room for dessert.

18:33.856 --> 18:36.882
- Uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but, uh...
- Yeah, you too.

18:37.060 --> 18:40.552
You got anything for next weekend?
I need a date for my cousin's wedding.

18:40.730 --> 18:42.857
- You're asking me out?
JOY: Yeah.

18:43.032 --> 18:47.093
And it's an open bar,
so I'll probably be giving it away.

when she told me she had a boyfriend.

I assure you I am quite real...

19:08.324 --> 19:12.124
...and I'm having regular intercourse
with your daughter.

19:13.963 --> 19:15.954
- What?
- Oh, yes.

neither of us has been hurt.
