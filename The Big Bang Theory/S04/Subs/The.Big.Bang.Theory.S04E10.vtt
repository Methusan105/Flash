WEBVTT

00:12.434 --> 00:14.231
Clarify something for me.

00:14.402 --> 00:19.601
Isn't the point of a communal meal
the exchange of ideas and opinions...

00:19.774 --> 00:22.743
...an opportunity to consider
important issues of the day?

00:22.911 --> 00:25.937
It is. You just kind of put a damper
on things when you said:

00:26.114 --> 00:30.141
"The next person I see talking with
food in their mouth will be put to death."

00:30.919 --> 00:33.149
We could argue about
who said what all night...

00:33.321 --> 00:35.915
...but to set things back on course...

00:36.091 --> 00:38.616
...I will propose a new topic
of conversation.

00:38.793 --> 00:39.851
- Oh!
- Great.

00:40.028 --> 00:42.758
What is the best number?

00:42.931 --> 00:46.423
By the way,
there's only one correct answer.

00:47.802 --> 00:50.771
Five million, three hundred,
eighteen thousand and eight?

00:50.939 --> 00:55.399
Wrong. The best number is 73.

00:58.813 --> 01:00.007
You're probably wondering why.

01:00.181 --> 01:01.273
- No.
RAJESH: No, we're good.

01:01.449 --> 01:03.610
Seventy three
is the 21st prime number.

01:03.785 --> 01:05.810
It's mirror, 37, is the 12th...

01:05.987 --> 01:10.481
...and its mirror, 21, is the product
of multiplying... Hang on to your hats.

01:10.659 --> 01:12.684
- Seven and three.

01:13.728 --> 01:16.925
Heh? Heh? Did I lie?

01:17.098 --> 01:20.761
We get it.
73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.

01:21.503 --> 01:23.869
Chuck Norris wishes.

01:24.072 --> 01:26.302
In binary, 73 is a palindrome:

01:26.474 --> 01:27.702
One, zero, zero, one...

01:27.876 --> 01:29.036
...zero, zero, one.

01:29.210 --> 01:32.441
Which, backwards,
is one, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one.

01:32.614 --> 01:33.774
Exactly the same.

01:33.948 --> 01:38.112
All Chuck Norris backwards
gets you is "sirron kcuhc."

01:38.987 --> 01:43.856
Just for the record, when you enter
5,318,008 in a calculator...

01:44.025 --> 01:46.459
...upside down, it spells "boobies."

01:50.398 --> 01:53.196
Remember wondering why
the girls didn't wanna eat with us?

01:53.368 --> 01:54.995
Yeah, I get it now.

01:57.172 --> 02:01.165
- I love your heart locket, Bernadette.
- Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me.

02:01.342 --> 02:02.366
It's the cutest thing.

02:02.544 --> 02:06.310
Every time I have dinner with his mom,
the next day I get jewelry.

02:07.916 --> 02:11.682
Did you know the Valentine's heart
is not based on the shape of a heart...

02:11.853 --> 02:15.152
...but rather on the shape of
the buttocks of a female bending over?

02:18.193 --> 02:22.493
Oh. So I spent seventh grade
dotting my I's with little asses?

02:23.631 --> 02:24.825
Cool.

02:26.334 --> 02:29.201
- Hey, Penny, how's it going?
- Zack. What are you doing here?

02:29.370 --> 02:31.668
My dad's company prints menus
for this place.

02:31.840 --> 02:33.603
Dropping off some new ones,
laminated.

02:33.775 --> 02:36.005
Easier to clean
if people throw up on them.

02:37.545 --> 02:40.343
- Guess how I got the idea.
- Yeah, I got it. I got it.

02:40.815 --> 02:43.943
Ahem. Uh, Zack, these are my friends
Bernadette and Amy.

02:44.152 --> 02:45.210
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:45.386 --> 02:47.581
Hoo.

02:49.924 --> 02:53.257
- Okay, well, it was good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

02:53.428 --> 02:56.727
- He's really cute. How do you know him?
- Oh, we went out a couple times.

02:56.898 --> 02:58.695
I'm often flummoxed by current slang.

02:58.867 --> 03:01.461
Does "went out" mean
"had intercourse"?

03:02.036 --> 03:03.663
- Yes.
- No. No.

03:04.405 --> 03:06.168
But in this case, yes.

03:06.775 --> 03:09.869
- Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?
- No, it was great.

03:10.044 --> 03:13.411
He just didn't really challenge me
on an intellectual level.

03:13.581 --> 03:17.073
Couldn't you just fool around with him
and then listen to NPR?

03:18.620 --> 03:21.487
Wouldn't help.
Zack can't even spell NPR.

03:22.223 --> 03:23.554
It's what I do with Howard.

03:23.725 --> 03:25.158
I'm much smarter than he is...

03:25.326 --> 03:27.726
...but it's important
to protect his manhood.

03:30.098 --> 03:31.622
Hoo.

03:33.001 --> 03:35.731
- What's the matter?
- I'm suddenly feeling flushed.

03:35.904 --> 03:40.238
My heart rate is elevated,
my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry.

03:40.408 --> 03:43.900
In addition,
I keep involuntarily saying "hoo."

03:45.013 --> 03:47.607
Oh, we know what's causing that,
don't we?

03:47.782 --> 03:48.840
It's no mystery.

03:49.017 --> 03:53.078
I obviously have the flu, coupled with
sudden-onset Tourette's syndrome.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.808
You hear about the accident
at the bio lab?

04:23.985 --> 04:25.213
- No.
- What happened?

04:25.386 --> 04:29.880
They were injecting rats with radioactive
isotopes and one of the techs got bit.

04:30.058 --> 04:32.253
Did he get super powers?

04:34.329 --> 04:37.924
No, he got five stitches
and a tetanus shot.

04:38.099 --> 04:39.123
Oh.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.165
Well, that's disappointing.

04:41.336 --> 04:42.496
- Why?
- Oh.

04:42.670 --> 04:44.831
You get bit by radioactive animal
in a lab...

04:45.006 --> 04:47.065
...you kind of wanna
turn into a superhero.

04:47.775 --> 04:50.266
Yeah, but who'd wanna become
Rat Man?

04:51.145 --> 04:52.578
Who wouldn't?

04:54.015 --> 04:56.381
You could zip through a maze
in nothing flat...

04:56.551 --> 05:00.681
...squeeze through small holes and
shut down restaurants in a single bound.

05:00.855 --> 05:02.846
And the best part is,
if I were Rat Man...

05:03.024 --> 05:05.288
...you could be my sidekick,
Mouse Boy.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.163
Mouse Boy?

05:12.333 --> 05:15.825
You don't like Mouse Boy?
How about, uh, Kid Vermin?

05:16.004 --> 05:19.167
First of all, if we had super powers,
I wouldn't be the sidekick.

05:19.340 --> 05:23.242
- You'd be the sidekick.
- Rat Man is nobody's sidekick.

05:23.811 --> 05:27.212
Leonard, settle this, of the two of us,
who's the obvious sidekick?

05:27.382 --> 05:28.406
Yeah, Leonard, who?

05:31.886 --> 05:34.946
Twelve years after high school
and I'm still at the nerd table.

05:39.327 --> 05:43.195
Aren't you slicing that man's brain
a little too thin?

05:47.568 --> 05:51.129
It's too thin if I were making a foot-long
brain sandwich at Quizno's.

05:52.607 --> 05:54.905
For examination
under a two photon microscope...

05:55.076 --> 05:57.237
...it's fine.

06:00.415 --> 06:01.882
Well, you're the expert.

06:02.050 --> 06:05.884
If the correct way to do it
is the wrong way, then I yield.

06:06.054 --> 06:08.784
Very well, if you die and donate
your body to science...

06:08.957 --> 06:11.391
...I promise to slice your brain
like Canadian bacon.

06:12.727 --> 06:14.422
Thank you.

06:14.595 --> 06:17.860
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to take my temperature.

06:18.066 --> 06:20.159
Are you monitoring
your circadian rhythms...

06:20.368 --> 06:23.565
...in order to identify your periods
of maximum mental acuity?

06:23.738 --> 06:24.830
I did that one summer.

06:25.006 --> 06:27.236
Ah, youth.

06:28.142 --> 06:30.633
No, I experienced distressing symptoms
last night...

06:30.812 --> 06:32.973
...so I'm checking
my vital signs every hour.

06:33.648 --> 06:37.812
I'd be happy to create a chart and
participate in a differential diagnosis.

06:37.986 --> 06:39.647
Oh, that sounds like fun.

06:41.956 --> 06:44.322
All right. Ahem.

06:44.525 --> 06:46.083
What were the symptoms?

06:46.260 --> 06:49.855
Elevated heart rate, moist palms,
dry mouth...

06:50.031 --> 06:52.898
...and localized vascular throbbing.

06:54.202 --> 06:57.103
Localized to what region?

06:58.539 --> 07:01.269
Ears and genitalia.

07:02.276 --> 07:03.300
Interesting.

07:03.478 --> 07:06.038
Not body parts that usually team up.

07:09.350 --> 07:13.184
What about environmental factors?
Describe the scene for me.

07:13.354 --> 07:16.050
I was in a restaurant with Penny
and Bernadette, drinking water.

07:16.224 --> 07:19.125
Carbonated, as it was
a special occasion.

07:19.293 --> 07:23.730
Penny's friend Zack stopped by
and said hello and I said "hoo."

07:24.365 --> 07:26.299
- Who?
- Zack.

07:27.001 --> 07:30.061
- Then why did you ask?
- Ask what?

07:30.238 --> 07:32.433
- "Who?"
- Zack.

07:33.541 --> 07:35.509
All right, let's start over.

07:35.676 --> 07:37.769
What did you say
when Zack walked in?

07:37.945 --> 07:40.413
- Hoo.
- Zack.

07:40.581 --> 07:43.812
- Why do you keep saying Zack?
- Because you keep saying, "Who?"

07:43.985 --> 07:46.545
I'm not saying "hoo" now,
I said "hoo" last night.

07:46.721 --> 07:48.848
And the answer was Zack, correct?

07:49.557 --> 07:52.321
There was no question,
I simply said, "Hoo."

07:54.595 --> 07:56.859
All right.
I think I have enough to go on.

07:58.599 --> 08:00.999
Possible explanations
for your symptoms are...

08:01.169 --> 08:03.034
...in descending order of likelihood...

08:03.204 --> 08:04.501
...hyperthyroidism...

08:04.672 --> 08:06.003
...premature menopause...

08:06.174 --> 08:08.506
...hosting an alien parasite...

08:08.676 --> 08:13.045
...or, and I only include it for the sake of
covering absolutely all bases...

08:13.214 --> 08:15.478
...sexual arousal.

08:17.685 --> 08:20.711
Where would I have picked up
an alien parasite?

08:23.591 --> 08:25.354
- There you are.
- Oh, hey.

08:25.526 --> 08:28.427
Let me ask you a question.
What are you most afraid of?

08:29.130 --> 08:30.222
I don't know. Uh...

08:30.398 --> 08:34.095
Nuclear war, being buried alive.
Any of those movies where you get...

08:34.268 --> 08:38.204
...that phone call that says
you're going to die, and then you do.

08:38.372 --> 08:41.068
No, something very specific
that we both know you...

08:41.242 --> 08:44.143
...Rajesh Koothrappalli,
are terrified of.

08:44.812 --> 08:47.110
Well, type two diabetes
runs in my family.

08:47.281 --> 08:51.149
- The thought of losing a toe...
- Spiders. You're afraid of spiders.

08:51.919 --> 08:55.082
- What the heck is this?
- A jar with a big spider in it, of course.

08:56.290 --> 09:00.420
Bravery test. First one to take
his hand out is the sidekick.

09:00.595 --> 09:01.960
RAJESH:
Wha...?

09:02.763 --> 09:05.561
- Are you crazy?
- Perhaps.

09:07.268 --> 09:09.793
- Are you scared?
- No. But it's a stupid test.

09:09.971 --> 09:11.063
Oh, really?

09:11.239 --> 09:14.231
What if the Earth was in danger
and the only way to save it...

09:14.408 --> 09:17.502
...was to stick your hand in a jar
with a spider?

09:17.678 --> 09:21.114
Yeah? What if only way to save it
was to shower in the locker room...

09:21.282 --> 09:23.045
...and let other guys see you naked?

09:25.119 --> 09:27.587
Oh, come on.
That's never gonna happen.

09:28.656 --> 09:32.683
Now, put your hand in the jar
or forever be revealed as my sidekick.

09:33.828 --> 09:36.422
All right, I will.

09:37.598 --> 09:39.759
How did you get so brave
all of a sudden?

09:39.934 --> 09:42.368
It's easy.
The spider's crawling up your arm.

09:42.737 --> 09:45.137
[SCREAMING]

09:48.509 --> 09:50.443
Get it off me, get it off me.

09:50.611 --> 09:52.374
Please, Raj!

09:54.682 --> 09:56.513
Please!

10:01.155 --> 10:03.214
My blood work shows
thyroid function normal.

10:03.391 --> 10:04.619
Cortisol levels normal.

10:05.693 --> 10:08.457
How about your
follicle-stimulating hormone levels?

10:08.629 --> 10:11.154
Sheldon, I am not going
through menopause.

10:11.832 --> 10:16.735
Are you sure? You said that
with the testy bark of an old biddy.

10:17.972 --> 10:20.372
I think we need to face
the cold, hard truth.

10:20.541 --> 10:23.806
I was sexually aroused
by Penny's friend Zack.

10:23.978 --> 10:25.002
Hang on.

10:25.179 --> 10:29.809
I don't know that we've given the
alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.

10:29.984 --> 10:33.010
Let's look at this logically.
I have a stomach, I get hungry.

10:33.187 --> 10:35.917
I have genitals, I have the potential
for sexual arousal.

10:37.024 --> 10:38.753
A cross we all must bear.

10:41.195 --> 10:44.323
You know,
in difficult moments like this...

10:44.498 --> 10:47.262
...I often turn to a force greater
than myself.

10:47.435 --> 10:49.130
- Religion?
- Star Trek.

10:50.571 --> 10:52.698
Did you see
Star Trek: The Motion Picture?

10:52.873 --> 10:54.204
- No.
- Don't. It's terrible.

10:54.375 --> 10:57.344
However, in it we learn that...

10:57.511 --> 11:00.275
...when Spock finds himself
drawn off the path of logic...

11:00.448 --> 11:02.939
...by feelings bubbling up
from his human half...

11:03.150 --> 11:07.018
...he suppresses them, using the
Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinahr.

11:07.221 --> 11:10.213
You suggesting we live our lives
guided by philosophies...

11:10.391 --> 11:14.384
...found in cheap science fiction?
- Cheap science fiction?

11:19.233 --> 11:20.257
What are you doing?

11:20.434 --> 11:26.031
Using Kolinahr to suppress my anger
at that last comment.

11:26.907 --> 11:28.966
Is it possible
that your concern for me...

11:29.176 --> 11:31.701
...is motivated by nothing more
than simple jealousy?

11:33.547 --> 11:37.779
I hadn't considered that.
Give me a moment.

11:40.187 --> 11:42.280
- All right. I've considered it.
- And?

11:42.456 --> 11:43.946
I reject it.

11:44.625 --> 11:46.923
You reject it
because you don't feel jealousy...

11:47.094 --> 11:49.961
...or because you are
suppressing jealousy?

11:50.931 --> 11:52.956
I think I'll eat my lunch at home.

11:55.403 --> 11:59.499
That's not your lunch, Sheldon.
Those are the cadaver brain specimens.

12:00.207 --> 12:01.299
Oh.

12:02.276 --> 12:03.937
As they were incorrectly sliced...

12:04.111 --> 12:07.740
...you can see how I could
mistake them for my sashimi.

12:15.456 --> 12:17.390
- Hello.
- Hey.

12:17.558 --> 12:19.822
Isn't tomorrow
your usual laundry night?

12:19.994 --> 12:22.986
The supermarket was out of
my regular fabric softener.

12:23.164 --> 12:28.466
If this one under or over-softens,
I'll need time to make things right.

12:28.669 --> 12:30.227
That's thinking ahead.

12:30.404 --> 12:33.271
The alternative would be
to think backwards...

12:33.474 --> 12:34.964
...and that's just remembering.

12:37.078 --> 12:40.411
- So how's Amy?
- Amy's changed.

12:40.581 --> 12:42.981
I might have to let her go.

12:43.184 --> 12:44.674
Oh, no. Why?

12:44.852 --> 12:49.585
I thought she was a highly evolved
creature of pure intellect, like me...

12:49.757 --> 12:53.693
...but recent events indicate that
she may be a slave to her baser urges.

12:53.894 --> 12:55.555
Like you.

12:57.398 --> 12:59.559
I'm just gonna skip over that insult.

13:00.501 --> 13:02.128
What insult?

13:02.303 --> 13:04.931
Yeah, that's why
I'm gonna skip over it.

13:05.439 --> 13:07.134
Are you saying that Amy is...

13:07.308 --> 13:09.299
...what's the scientific word...?

13:09.510 --> 13:12.604
Forget science. She's horny.

13:15.082 --> 13:16.879
Oh, okay. Wow!

13:17.051 --> 13:19.952
It's simple biology.
There's nothing I can do about it.

13:24.892 --> 13:26.291
Are you sure?

13:27.828 --> 13:29.022
What are you suggesting?

13:29.797 --> 13:32.994
I'm suggesting there might be
something you could do...

13:33.167 --> 13:35.829
...about Amy's urges.

13:39.807 --> 13:42.605
It's illegal to spay a human being.

13:45.446 --> 13:47.607
Yeah, that's not what I had in mind.

13:47.782 --> 13:49.044
Oh.

13:49.216 --> 13:50.706
Oh!

13:51.986 --> 13:56.355
- You mean something I could do.
- Exactly.

13:56.557 --> 13:59.754
Well, I was hoping to avoid this.

14:00.494 --> 14:03.190
But I might as well get it over with.

14:03.864 --> 14:05.422
Thank you, Penny.

14:05.599 --> 14:07.863
I'll let you know what happens.

14:10.638 --> 14:14.074
Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.

14:16.110 --> 14:18.510
Yes, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

14:18.679 --> 14:23.776
Is this the Zack Johnson who used to
have coitus with my neighbor Penny?

14:25.319 --> 14:26.377

Hello. I'm looking for a Zack Johnson...

14:36.197 --> 14:39.530
...who used to have coitus
with my neighbor Penny.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.993
Coitus. It means intercourse.

14:42.169 --> 14:45.229
And I have a feeling
I'm speaking to the right Zack.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.831
This is Sheldon Cooper.

14:48.008 --> 14:49.942
Fine, Shelly.

14:50.110 --> 14:52.908
Yes, that does sound like a girl's name.

14:53.113 --> 14:55.377
No, it doesn't bother me.

14:55.549 --> 14:59.417
Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me.
Let me tell you why I'm calling.

14:59.620 --> 15:05.058
I'd like to know if you'd be interested
in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler.

15:05.226 --> 15:07.524
Amy Farrah Fowler.

15:07.695 --> 15:10.220
Yes, that is a girl's name.

15:10.397 --> 15:13.560
Good grief,
it's like trying to talk to a dolphin.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.733
Really?

15:16.904 --> 15:21.136
This is gonna decide
who's the hero and who's the sidekick?

15:29.383 --> 15:33.911
- You got a better idea?
- Every idea is better than this idea.

15:35.022 --> 15:36.046
Ding!

15:36.223 --> 15:38.953
- Wait, what the hell is "ding"?
- It's a bell.

15:39.159 --> 15:42.390
- I don't think this wrestling has a bell.
- How do you wanna start?

15:42.563 --> 15:44.531
I say, how about one, two, three, go?

15:44.698 --> 15:47.030
One, two, three, go?
That's for babies.

15:47.668 --> 15:50.637
Okay. How about
"On your mark, get set, go."

15:50.804 --> 15:53.238
That's for a foot race.
We'd have to go outside.

15:53.407 --> 15:55.807
No, it's chilly outside.
I didn't bring my jacket.

15:57.678 --> 16:01.136
Oh, for crying out loud.
What kind of superhero needs a jacket?

16:02.816 --> 16:05.182
"Dibs on the red tights,
dibs on the red tights"?

16:06.320 --> 16:08.151
How about this?
Ready? Wrestle.

Are you sure
this is what you want to do?

It's not what I want to do,
it's what I have to do.

Well, go, Amy Farrah Fowler.

We met the other night.

I have spent my life
in pursuit of pure knowledge.

17:22.329 --> 17:25.355
Until I met you, my decisions
were founded in logic and reason.

17:25.532 --> 17:28.831
And yet here I stand before you,
130 pounds of raging estrogen...

...longing to grab hold of your
gluteus maximus...

17:31.538 --> 17:35.474
...and make Shakespeare's
metaphorical beast with two backs.

17:37.311 --> 17:39.404
My gluteus what?

17:40.814 --> 17:44.545
On the other hand, as I look at the blank,
ape-like expression on your face...

17:44.718 --> 17:48.085
...I have decided to adopt
the Vulcan practice of Kolinahr.

17:48.689 --> 17:50.987
- Goodbye, Zack.
- Bye.

17:51.358 --> 17:53.622
Oh, hoo!

17:57.297 --> 17:59.731
That should hold me for a while.

18:09.443 --> 18:14.847
I'm legally obligated to inform you
that I took a karate lesson when I was 11.

18:15.382 --> 18:16.906
I'd be a regular ninja by now...

could have arranged a carpool.

a Pilates class at the rec center.

of a Hershey bar.

it's you.

to the realm of pure intellect.

As am I.

- What are you doing?
- An experiment.

18:54.054 --> 18:56.887
Nope, nothing. Never mind.

19:08.202 --> 19:09.635
You realize you can't win.

wasn't valid, you bloviating buffoon.
