LEONARD:
I can't hear you. I'm in the shower.

00:09.817 --> 00:13.719
I asked if you were in the shower,
but that's moot now.

Count the first:
On or about the 28th day of April...

02:19.547 --> 02:22.448
...the accused did knowingly
and with malice aforethought...

02:22.617 --> 02:25.950
...deny access to the shared bathroom
in a time of emergency...

02:26.120 --> 02:28.918
...to wit, my back teeth were floating.

02:29.757 --> 02:32.317

03:19.107 --> 03:20.369
No, that's ridiculous.

03:20.541 --> 03:22.634
A bathroom emergency
is self-explanatory.

If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair...

03:25.713 --> 03:28.113
...could he barge in
while you were showering?

03:28.282 --> 03:30.716
Irrelevant.
Leonard doesn't trim his nose hair.

03:30.918 --> 03:34.012
He thinks because he's short,
nobody can see up there.

03:37.792 --> 03:39.783
Point is, Sheldon, the legal principle...

03:39.961 --> 03:43.362
...is ambiguity in a contract
benefits the party that did not draft it.

03:43.531 --> 03:46.227
