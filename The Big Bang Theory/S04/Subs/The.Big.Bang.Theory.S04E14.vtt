00:03.481 --> 00:07.918
Good evening. I'm your guest lecturer,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

00:12.423 --> 00:15.915
I was expecting applause.

00:16.093 --> 00:20.052
But I suppose stunned silence
is equally appropriate.

00:20.231 --> 00:23.200
I agreed to speak to you
this evening...

00:23.367 --> 00:26.268
...because I was told
you're the best and the brightest...

00:26.437 --> 00:28.997
...of this university's
doctoral candidates.

00:29.173 --> 00:32.438
Hmm. That's like saying
you're the most important electron...

00:32.610 --> 00:34.908
...in a hydrogen atom. Ha, ha.

00:38.249 --> 00:40.740
Because, you see,
there's only one electron...

00:40.918 --> 00:42.943
...in a hydrogen atom.

00:46.090 --> 00:47.921
Best and brightest,
my sweet patootie.

00:48.092 --> 00:50.322
All right. Let's begin. Show of hands.

00:50.495 --> 00:54.488
Who here is familiar with the concept
of topological insulators?

00:55.733 --> 00:56.995
Heh. Don't kid yourselves.

00:59.670 --> 01:02.161
I found another tweet from a student.

01:02.340 --> 01:04.865
"Dr. Cooper has taken
a relatively boring subject...

01:05.042 --> 01:08.409
...and managed to make it
completely insufferable.

01:09.146 --> 01:11.046
Plus, he looks like a giant insect."

01:11.215 --> 01:12.375
[RAJ LAUGHS]

01:12.550 --> 01:15.348
Look. Listen to this one.
"Does Einstein's theory...

01:15.520 --> 01:18.284
...explain why time flies
when you're having fun...

01:18.456 --> 01:22.119
...but when you're listening to
Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky dead?"

01:22.293 --> 01:23.317
[LAUGHS]

01:23.494 --> 01:27.191
Ooh, somebody took pictures and
uploaded them to their Flickr account.

01:28.165 --> 01:33.000
Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall
to flip you off at the same time?

01:33.471 --> 01:36.133
Apparently, if you're Sheldon,
all you need to do is turn your back.

01:36.307 --> 01:37.706
[RAJ LAUGHS]

01:37.875 --> 01:40.343
Hey, Leonard, is your Wi-Fi down?
I can't get on.

01:40.511 --> 01:44.379
Oh, Sheldon changed the password.
It's now "Penny is a freeloader."

01:45.683 --> 01:46.911
No spaces.

01:47.084 --> 01:49.018
Thanks. What are you guys doing?

01:49.186 --> 01:51.984
Sheldon gave a lecture tonight.
We're reading the reviews.

01:52.156 --> 01:53.350
Oh, how did he do?

01:53.524 --> 01:58.018
Picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl
meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.

01:59.163 --> 02:00.221
That bad, huh?

02:00.398 --> 02:02.525
Read this woman's tweet.

02:03.734 --> 02:07.170
"Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me
wanna start cutting myself again."

02:07.338 --> 02:08.600
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

02:10.741 --> 02:13.574
Well, good evening,
Leonard, Howard, Raj.

02:13.744 --> 02:15.575
Freeloader.

02:16.881 --> 02:18.576
So how did the lecture go?

02:18.749 --> 02:21.217
In a word, triumphant.

02:22.420 --> 02:25.184
- Really? Triumphant?
- Oh, yes.

02:25.356 --> 02:28.291
Should've seen those people.
They're thirsty for knowledge...

02:28.492 --> 02:29.789
...drinking in my wisdom.

02:30.261 --> 02:32.889
I may have changed a few lives today.

02:34.065 --> 02:36.693
Oh, please, let me tell him.

02:36.867 --> 02:38.835
I don't know.
I kind of promised Howard.

02:39.804 --> 02:42.398
- Tell me what?
- Actually, we should share the moment.

02:42.573 --> 02:43.665
Raj, if you would.

02:46.577 --> 02:49.876
Oh, tweets about my lecture.

02:52.416 --> 02:54.111
Hmm.

02:54.919 --> 02:57.285
That's rather unfair.

02:57.655 --> 02:59.418
That's downright cruel.

02:59.590 --> 03:01.922
Plus, insects have six legs.

03:03.594 --> 03:06.154
I'm not familiar
with the acronym KMN.

03:06.330 --> 03:09.493
Oh, from the context,
we think it means "kill me now."

03:12.837 --> 03:16.739
Well, I suppose everyone's entitled
to their own opinion.

03:16.907 --> 03:18.204
I think I'll turn in.

03:20.611 --> 03:23.546
I didn't wanna teach
those poopy heads anyway.

03:26.283 --> 03:28.774
FYI,
I think that's what Darth Vader said...

03:28.953 --> 03:32.116
...just before
he started building the Death Star.

03:58.049 --> 04:00.449
- Sheldon still moping?
- Yeah, it's weird.

04:00.651 --> 04:04.883
Though he didn't wanna give the lecture,
being rejected by students hit him hard.

04:05.056 --> 04:08.116
Hmm, I know the feeling. Like
accidentally walking into a gay bar...

04:08.292 --> 04:10.658
...then having no one hit on you.

04:17.535 --> 04:20.436
It happened to a friend of mine.

04:22.206 --> 04:24.868
- Are you doing okay?
- Yeah, Leonard and I are fine...

04:25.042 --> 04:27.704
...but I think Raj
needs to meet a girl really soon.

04:28.913 --> 04:31.074
That shouldn't be too hard.
He's a cutie.

04:31.248 --> 04:33.273
Oh, thank you.
But cute is for bunnies.

04:33.451 --> 04:38.081
I want to be something with sex appeal,
like a Labradoodle.

04:40.057 --> 04:41.115
Labradoodle?

04:42.126 --> 04:44.993
We might be starting to zero in
on your problem.

04:45.596 --> 04:48.463
Don't you listen to them.
You've got plenty of sex appeal.

04:48.632 --> 04:50.896
- You really think so?
- Yeah, you're a hottie.

04:51.702 --> 04:53.829
Thanks, Bernadette.

04:55.573 --> 04:58.064
For the record,
Labradoodles are hypoallergenic...

04:58.242 --> 05:01.507
...which is a very sexy quality
to those troubled by animal dander.

05:04.915 --> 05:06.507
AMY [OVER COMPUTER]:
So, what do you think?

05:09.620 --> 05:12.646
It's a charming illusion,
but it does not cheer me up.

05:12.823 --> 05:14.814
Not even when I do this?

05:14.992 --> 05:19.292
[MIMICS AIR BUBBLES POPPING
UNDERWATER]

05:21.232 --> 05:22.665
No.

05:23.667 --> 05:27.262
Well, that was the last arrow
in my quiver of whimsy.

05:27.671 --> 05:30.936
Do you realize teaching
is the first thing I've failed at...

05:31.108 --> 05:35.477
...since my ill-fated attempt
to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?

05:35.980 --> 05:40.144
If this experience is troubling you
there are things we could do about it.

05:40.317 --> 05:43.115
- For instance?
- The first thing that comes to mind...

05:43.287 --> 05:46.017
...is isolating the part of your brain
where memory is stored...

05:46.190 --> 05:48.283
...and destroying it with a laser.

05:48.893 --> 05:49.917
Hmm.

05:50.094 --> 05:54.292
No. One slip of the hand and I'm sitting
in the Engineering Department...

05:54.465 --> 05:57.161
...building doodads with Wolowitz.

05:57.768 --> 06:01.363
All right. Have you considered
improving your socialization skills...

06:01.539 --> 06:04.133
...thus allowing you
to communicate more effectively?

06:04.308 --> 06:05.639
Isn't that their burden?

06:05.810 --> 06:08.677
I'm the one
with something interesting to say.

06:09.280 --> 06:12.681
Fair enough. But in its essence,
teaching is a performance art.

06:12.850 --> 06:16.684
In the classroom paradigm, the teacher
has the responsibility to communicate...

06:16.854 --> 06:18.981
...as well as entertain and engage.

06:19.557 --> 06:22.048
I sense you're trying to slow walk me
to an epiphany.

06:22.226 --> 06:24.319
Would you mind very much
jumping to it?

06:25.196 --> 06:27.687
Perhaps you should consider
taking acting lessons.

06:28.165 --> 06:29.723
Acting lessons.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.731
Interesting.

06:31.902 --> 06:35.065
It might help if I could act
as though I care about my students...

06:35.239 --> 06:37.434
...and whether or not they learn.

06:39.710 --> 06:41.007
Penny.

Penny.

06:42.613 --> 06:44.103
Penny.

06:45.416 --> 06:49.250
- What?
- You're an "actress," correct?

06:50.054 --> 06:54.081
I'm not an "actress." I'm an actress.

06:54.925 --> 06:57.723
All right. You're an actress.

06:59.163 --> 07:01.893
- I need you to teach me.
- You want an acting lesson?

07:02.066 --> 07:05.092
Perhaps two.
I'd like to master the craft.

07:06.203 --> 07:07.932
Okay, where is this coming from?

07:08.405 --> 07:12.933
It has been suggested to me that acting
techniques could improve my lecturing.

07:13.110 --> 07:18.047
At which, if certain tweets and blogs
are to be believed, I "suck the big one."

07:18.215 --> 07:19.239
[LAUGHS]

07:19.416 --> 07:23.648
I saw those. They were funny. I printed
a few out and put them on my fridge.

07:24.221 --> 07:25.552
So when can we start?

07:25.723 --> 07:27.156
Okay, just to be clear.

07:27.358 --> 07:29.952
You are asking me for help
because I know something...

07:30.127 --> 07:32.561
...that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper
doesn't.

07:33.664 --> 07:36.292
I suppose that's one way to look at it.

07:37.001 --> 07:39.094
I think it's the only way to look at it.

07:39.803 --> 07:43.261
- Are you going to help me or not?
- Probably. Just enjoying the foreplay.

07:44.775 --> 07:47.073
Does this mean
you are done mocking my career?

07:47.244 --> 07:48.336
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:48.512 --> 07:51.743
I thought making the transition
from actor to acting teacher...

07:51.916 --> 07:55.317
...was the signal that one's career
had reached the end of the road.

- I'll pay you $40.

at the Weizmann Institute in Israel.

Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

- Are you going with him?
- I have to stay for school.

08:20.477 --> 08:26.313
That's what we're here to talk to you
about. You see, Bernadette has needs.

08:28.485 --> 08:29.645
What kind of needs?

08:30.220 --> 08:32.154
Sexual needs.

08:33.190 --> 08:37.058
Most of them regular,
some of them kind of messed up.

08:39.830 --> 08:43.926
So while I'm gone,
you're gonna have to satisfy her.

08:45.169 --> 08:46.693
What do you say?

08:48.138 --> 08:50.470
I say okey-dokey.

08:56.747 --> 08:58.442
What you thinking so hard about?

08:59.183 --> 09:02.346
Just that I'm definitely not gay.

- Nothing. I was acting.

[SIGHS]

09:19.603 --> 09:20.763
You were acting?

09:20.971 --> 09:25.340
Yes. In preparation for today's studies,
I read Stanislavski's An Actor Prepares...

09:25.509 --> 09:27.568
...Stella Adler's
The Technique of Acting...

09:27.745 --> 09:32.512
...Uta Hagen's Respect for Acting,
and Henry Winkler's Eh, I'm an Actor.

09:33.617 --> 09:36.415
Well, good for you. Come on in.

09:36.587 --> 09:39.112
- How should we begin?
- Well, I thought we'd start...

09:39.289 --> 09:41.416
...with some
basic movement exercises.

09:41.592 --> 09:43.526
You know, get our bodies warmed up.

09:43.694 --> 09:45.685
- All right.
- I just want you to relax...

09:45.863 --> 09:48.297
...and kind of move around
in the space, you know.

09:48.499 --> 09:51.491
Just do whatever feels natural.

09:58.409 --> 10:02.140
- Sheldon.
- You said to do whatever feels natural.

10:02.312 --> 10:03.643
This feels natural.

10:04.782 --> 10:07.649
Certainly more natural
than what you're doing.

10:07.818 --> 10:10.753
Gotta work with me. We need
to get connected with our bodies.

10:10.921 --> 10:14.550
Penny, my body and I
have a relationship that works best...

10:14.725 --> 10:18.024
...when we maintain a cool,
wary distance from each other.

10:18.695 --> 10:20.492
[SIGHS]

10:20.664 --> 10:22.757
All right,
let's just say we've warmed up.

10:23.133 --> 10:24.725
You're the "teacher."

10:25.335 --> 10:26.359
[SIGHS]

10:26.537 --> 10:28.767
Okay. One of the things
that might help you...

10:28.939 --> 10:32.170
...in connecting with students
is being a little more spontaneous.

10:32.342 --> 10:34.105
Why don't we try
some improvisation?

10:34.278 --> 10:38.180
Why not? It seems like you're
improvising your entire curriculum.

10:39.983 --> 10:43.612
- This is about listening and responding.
- Gotcha.

10:43.787 --> 10:46.654
I'm gonna create a character
and situation and just jump in.

10:46.824 --> 10:48.121
- All right.
- All right.

10:48.292 --> 10:49.987
Action.

10:52.362 --> 10:55.820
Okay. It's not a movie, it's improv.
So no one calls, "Action."

10:55.999 --> 10:57.762
Hey, you taught me something.

10:58.802 --> 11:00.201
Who would've thought it?

Ahem. Okay.

No, the shipment hasn't arrived
and I need those shoes.

I'd like a frozen yogurt, please.

Yogurt?

11:23.927 --> 11:29.160
Um, okay. Sure. You... Luckily,
we sell both shoes and yogurt here.

11:30.667 --> 11:32.532
You do?

11:33.370 --> 11:38.103
Yes. Look up at the sign and remember,

11:41.078 --> 11:42.602
Yes.

11:43.714 --> 11:45.181
I see a sign.

It says,
"Camarillo State Mental Hospital."

11:52.356 --> 11:54.347
The only explanation
I can come up with...

...for why you think
you sell shoes and yogurt.
