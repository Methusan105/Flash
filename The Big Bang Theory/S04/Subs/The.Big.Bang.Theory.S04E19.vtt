oh, deity, whose existence I doubt?

00:10.191 --> 00:12.819
Here, breathe into this bag.

00:14.195 --> 00:17.961
- What's going on?
SHELDON: They stole everything, Leonard.

00:18.132 --> 00:19.326
Everything.

00:20.201 --> 00:23.227
- Are you the roommate?
- Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?

00:23.404 --> 00:25.497
Your friend called 911
to report a robbery.

00:25.673 --> 00:27.368
Oh, my God, what did they get?

00:27.541 --> 00:28.633
What didn't they get?

00:28.809 --> 00:32.540
They got my enchanted weapons,
my Vicious Gladiator armor...

00:32.713 --> 00:37.343
...my Wand of Untainted Power
and all my gold.

00:38.519 --> 00:39.679
You called the police...

00:39.854 --> 00:43.187
...because someone hacked
your "World of Warcraft" account?

00:43.357 --> 00:44.722
What choice did I have?

00:44.892 --> 00:47.918
The mighty Sheldor,
level 85 blood elf...

00:48.095 --> 00:49.858
...hero of the Eastern Kingdoms...

00:50.030 --> 00:54.694
...has been picked clean
like a carcass in the desert sun.

00:55.536 --> 00:57.766
Plus, the FBI hung up on me.

Into the bag.

01:01.876 --> 01:04.902
They took my battle ostrich.

01:05.079 --> 01:08.344
- Oh, no, not Glenn.
- Yes. Glenn.

01:08.516 --> 01:11.314
Only bird I ever loved.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.085
Good luck, fellas.

01:14.255 --> 01:15.779
Oh, thank you, officer.

01:15.956 --> 01:18.550
Wait a minute.
You're not going to do anything?

01:18.726 --> 01:21.024
- Mr. Cooper, there's nothing...
- Dr. Cooper.

01:23.030 --> 01:24.759
Seriously?

01:25.232 --> 01:27.462
Not the kind with access to drugs.

01:28.736 --> 01:32.069
Fine. Dr. Cooper,
I'm sorry for your loss...

01:32.239 --> 01:37.609
...but the Pasadena Police Department
doesn't have jurisdiction in Pandora.

That's from Avatar.

01:44.118 --> 01:47.144
Goodness gracious,
how are you allowed to carry a gun?

01:47.955 --> 01:51.721
Can you at least refer me
to a rogue ex-cop?

01:52.493 --> 01:53.892
What?

01:54.061 --> 01:57.622
One who was drummed off the force
because he refused to play by the rules.

01:57.798 --> 02:02.462
And now he hires himself out to impose
his own brand of rough justice?

02:04.638 --> 02:06.128
No.

02:07.107 --> 02:09.337
Thank you, officer.

02:09.510 --> 02:11.910
It's all gone. All gone.

02:12.279 --> 02:15.339
- I'm really sorry, Sheldon.
- What kind of world do we live in...

02:15.516 --> 02:19.384

another man's battle ostrich?

02:19.920 --> 02:21.114
I don't know.

02:22.089 --> 02:26.025
This act of aggression must be met
with swift and cruel ferocity.

02:26.193 --> 02:30.630
It is time to cry havoc
and let slip the dogs of war.

02:32.099 --> 02:33.760

02:36.604 --> 02:39.630
Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is Howard there?

02:40.774 --> 02:42.207
Okay, thanks.

02:42.409 --> 02:46.505
That particular dog of war
will have to call you back after his bath.

mouse, collecting weapons and gold.

03:25.953 --> 03:29.047
It's almost as if
it was a huge waste of time.

03:41.268 --> 03:43.896
...to quell the rage in my heart.

03:45.339 --> 03:48.172
I'm talking to an orc under the bridge
in Thunder Bluff...

03:48.342 --> 03:51.209
...says if we pay him,
he'll help us track down your things.

03:51.378 --> 03:53.369
- Can we trust him?
- I should say so.

03:53.547 --> 03:57.347
He appears to be a member
of the Nigerian royal family.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.353
Whoa, somebody's auctioning off
a jeweled ostrich bridle.

04:02.523 --> 04:03.854
No, Glenn's was leather.

04:05.159 --> 04:07.150
He was a simple ostrich.

04:07.327 --> 04:09.887
Is. Is. I haven't given up hope.

04:12.066 --> 04:13.328
- Hey.
- Hey, Penny.

04:13.500 --> 04:17.596
- We're in the middle of a crisis here.
- Oh, I know. Bernadette told me.

04:17.805 --> 04:20.797
I'm sorry, Sheldon,
I know that game meant a lot to you.

04:21.241 --> 04:22.674
That game?

04:24.211 --> 04:27.772
Excuse me, Penny,
but "Doodle Jump" is a game.

04:27.948 --> 04:30.508
"Angry Birds" is a game.

04:30.684 --> 04:35.849
"World of Warcraft" is a massively
multiplayer online role-playing...

04:36.023 --> 04:37.854
All right, technically it's a game.

04:39.593 --> 04:43.051
Bad news.
The Nigerian prince may be a fraud.

04:44.198 --> 04:46.894
Okay, I brought you a day-old
cheesecake to cheer you up.

04:47.334 --> 04:51.737
Stale pastry is hollow succor
to a man who is bereft of ostrich.

04:53.407 --> 04:56.740
- Just say thank you.
- I thought I just did.

04:58.245 --> 05:00.372
All right, see you later.

05:00.714 --> 05:01.840
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hi.

05:02.282 --> 05:04.716
I was just dropping off a cheesecake
to Sheldon.

05:04.885 --> 05:07.046
He was robbed
of a bunch of imaginary crap...

05:07.221 --> 05:09.553
...that's useful
in a make-believe place.

05:10.657 --> 05:12.090
I don't know what that means.

05:12.259 --> 05:14.727
Yeah, well, sadly, I do.

05:17.364 --> 05:20.458
Did you know Priya took Leonard
Rollerblading at the beach?

05:21.168 --> 05:22.260
Can you believe that?

05:23.070 --> 05:25.300
I feel like I'm supposed to say
"that bitch"...

05:25.472 --> 05:27.770
...but I don't have
enough information.

05:29.009 --> 05:32.809
I am the one who spent two years
trying to get him to go to the beach.

05:32.980 --> 05:36.916
He was so phobic about stepping
on medical waste, I had to carry him.

05:37.885 --> 05:39.614
I took Howard to the beach once.

05:39.787 --> 05:43.154
He almost burst into flames
like a vampire.

05:44.792 --> 05:48.489
What's the thanks I get for turning
Leonard into quality boyfriend material?

05:48.662 --> 05:50.755
I have to tiptoe
around his new girlfriend.

05:52.032 --> 05:53.431
I think you're on.

05:54.134 --> 05:56.432
That bitch.

05:57.704 --> 06:00.366
You want some coffee liqueur
on your ice cream?

06:00.541 --> 06:03.704
Here's the alcohol and drug peer pressure
mother warned me about.

06:05.145 --> 06:07.670
I was starting to think
it was never gonna happen.

06:07.981 --> 06:09.915
Yes, please.

06:10.684 --> 06:13.152
Should've seen Leonard when we met.
No eye contact.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.721
He was either looking up at the ceiling
or down at his shoes.

06:16.924 --> 06:17.948
I'm drunk.

06:21.195 --> 06:23.686
For the first months
whenever I'd take off my bra...

06:23.864 --> 06:27.698
...he would giggle and say,
"Oh, boy, my breast friends."

06:29.736 --> 06:32.728
If it makes you feel better,
I'm never speaking to Priya again.

06:32.940 --> 06:35.465
No, don't do that.
No reason to be mean to her.

06:36.510 --> 06:40.810
This may be the alcohol talking,
but I believe there is.

06:40.981 --> 06:43.814
Are you familiar with the study
of Tanzanian chimpanzees...

06:43.984 --> 06:46.919
...by Nishida and Hosaka
out of Kyoto University?

06:47.087 --> 06:50.147
No, but I can name
all the Kardashians.

06:50.858 --> 06:53.349
Primates such as ourselves
have a natural instinct...

06:53.527 --> 06:55.893
...to ostracize ill-mannered
members of the troop.

06:56.063 --> 06:58.190
Bernadette's urge to shun, scowl...

06:58.365 --> 07:01.994
...or fling her waste at Priya
is hardwired into her DNA.

07:03.003 --> 07:05.938
I don't have an urge
to fling my waste.

07:06.106 --> 07:08.904
Believe me, it's there. We all have it.

07:09.109 --> 07:11.270
Hit me with some more booze
and I'll show you.

07:14.114 --> 07:15.240
All right, here we are.

07:15.415 --> 07:19.010
This is the tavern where all
the black market weapon trades go down.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.518
I don't think my character
should be in a place like this.

07:22.689 --> 07:24.680
Everyone's undressing her
with their eyes.

07:25.525 --> 07:28.858
Maybe if you stop dropping your sword
and bending over to pick it up.

07:30.697 --> 07:34.189
- What exactly are we looking for?
- Redheaded troll by the name of Glumly.

07:34.368 --> 07:36.859
According to this,
if you wanna move stolen goods...

07:37.037 --> 07:39.597
...and it's after school hours,
he's your guy.

07:39.773 --> 07:43.300
Is this going to take much longer?
We were gonna spend some time together.

07:43.510 --> 07:44.738
We are. In the meantime...

07:44.912 --> 07:47.574
...you're welcome to whip up
a character and join us.

07:48.215 --> 07:49.807
Seriously?

07:50.017 --> 07:53.646
Well, you have to put in
a credit card number, but it's fun.

07:54.221 --> 07:55.552
Maybe I should just go home.

07:55.722 --> 07:58.782
- Our troll walked in. I got him.
- We got him. We're almost done.

07:59.526 --> 08:01.084
How do you guys wanna play this?

08:01.261 --> 08:05.095
Be ruthless. Tell him if he doesn't start
talking, we'll register a complaint...

08:05.265 --> 08:07.665
...with his Internet service provider.

08:08.268 --> 08:11.237
Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet
from his cable company?

08:11.405 --> 08:15.603
He could lose his HBO and all
their delightful original programming.

08:16.410 --> 08:19.470
I don't care. I'm losing it, man.

08:19.746 --> 08:23.341
Why don't we play this smart?
Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.

08:23.550 --> 08:25.450
Oh, dear Lord.

08:25.619 --> 08:27.450
No, I think we have to be more subtle.

08:27.621 --> 08:30.784
Okay, I see where this is going.

08:30.958 --> 08:33.051
Fine, I'll have sex with him.

08:36.263 --> 08:38.322
That's not where it was going.

08:39.299 --> 08:42.268
Good, because I would hate that.

08:43.770 --> 08:45.863
Leonard, you're busy,
let's talk tomorrow.

08:46.073 --> 08:48.166
Oh, wait, hang on. Are you upset?

08:48.342 --> 08:51.607
No, no, I think it's sexy
to date a boy trapped in a man's body.

08:52.980 --> 08:55.642
Good, good.
I'll tell you what happens.

08:57.584 --> 09:00.075
People think I don't get sarcasm.

09:04.091 --> 09:06.184
Well, well, well.

09:07.861 --> 09:09.021
Look who it is.

09:09.196 --> 09:11.164
- Okay. Be nice.
- Hello.

- We're just heading out for a drink.
- Because I do that now.

- Don't listen to her.

She's had a lot of ice cream.

Do you wanna join us?

09:27.614 --> 09:29.809
Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.

How many reach the lobby?

09:42.629 --> 09:45.427
Did your sister say anything
when you got home last night?

09:45.599 --> 09:49.057
Don't put me in the middle of this.
I'm not going to be your go-between.

09:49.236 --> 09:51.033
Come on, help me out.
Am I in trouble?

09:52.072 --> 09:54.802
- There's no reason to worry.
- That's a relief.

- What else do we know about him?
- Quite a bit, actually.

10:32.145 --> 10:35.012
I bet he's some loser
who lives with his parents.

10:40.387 --> 10:42.355
Yes, he does live with his parents.

Here's a Google Earth shot

10:46.860 --> 10:49.727
Excellent. It's in a cul-de-sac.
We can box him in.

10:51.031 --> 10:55.024
- Hold on, you're thinking of going there?
- Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.

10:55.535 --> 10:58.971
You walk up to the house, knock
on the door and demand your stuff back.

10:59.139 --> 11:02.336
- What if he says no?
- I don't know if you've been following...

Fine, we'll abide

In the course of our lives, how much
lunch money has been taken from us?

11:17.657 --> 11:19.090
How many kites?

11:19.259 --> 11:21.625
How many Scooby-Doo
Trapper Keepers?

11:22.662 --> 11:24.994
- I totally had one of those.
- Of course you did.

of organizing your schoolwork.

Well, no more.

our birthright and our pride.

11:35.775 --> 11:37.936
What do you say? Who's with me?

11:42.349 --> 11:46.012
I have a hip-hop aerobics class at 5,
could we go after?

11:47.420 --> 11:49.513
- Sure.
- Also, tonight's the Sabbath...
