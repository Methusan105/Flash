WEBVTT

00:03.412 --> 00:06.040
All right.
I'm ready for my next question.

00:06.682 --> 00:09.549
In a world where rhinoceroses
are domesticated pets...

00:09.719 --> 00:11.516
...who wins the Second World War?

00:15.091 --> 00:16.991
- Uganda.
- Defend.

00:17.160 --> 00:20.220
Kenya rises to power
on the export of rhinoceroses.

00:20.396 --> 00:24.423
A central African power block is formed
colonizing North Africa and Europe.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.899
When war breaks out,
no one can afford the luxury of a rhino.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.334
Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.804
Correct. My turn.

00:36.946 --> 00:41.007
In a world where a piano is a weapon,
not a musical instrument...

00:41.184 --> 00:44.745
...on what does Scott Joplin
play the "Maple Leaf Rag."

00:45.955 --> 00:48.617
- Tuned bayonets.
- Defend.

00:48.824 --> 00:51.952
- Isn't it obvious?
- You're right, my apologies.

00:54.697 --> 00:57.222
What the hell are you guys playing?

00:57.400 --> 01:00.733
It's a game we invented.
It's called Counterfactuals.

01:00.903 --> 01:04.304
We postulate an alternate world
that differs from ours in one aspect...

01:04.473 --> 01:09.274
...then pose questions to each other.
- It's fun for ages 8 to 80. Join us.

01:10.246 --> 01:13.374
All right. I like a good brainteaser.
I'll give it a whirl.

01:13.549 --> 01:15.278
You're in luck. This is an easy one.

01:15.451 --> 01:20.787
In a world where mankind is ruled
by a giant intelligent beaver...

01:20.957 --> 01:23.585
...what food is no longer consumed.

01:24.427 --> 01:25.758
Uh...

01:25.928 --> 01:29.557
A BLT where the B stands for beaver?
I don't know.

01:30.866 --> 01:33.391
Leonard, be serious.
We're playing a game here.

01:33.970 --> 01:35.597
Ahem, I can figure this out. Let's see.

01:35.771 --> 01:36.795
Um...

01:36.973 --> 01:39.271
Well, beavers eat tree bark.

01:39.442 --> 01:42.502
The only tree bark I know
that humans consume is cinnamon.

01:42.678 --> 01:44.839
- So I'll say cinnamon.
- Incorrect.

01:45.014 --> 01:48.472
Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.

01:49.485 --> 01:52.784
- What?
- In a world ruled by a giant beaver...

01:52.955 --> 01:56.015
...mankind builds many dams
to please the beaver overlord.

01:56.192 --> 01:59.525
The low-lying city of Copenhagen
is flooded, thousands die...

01:59.695 --> 02:03.756
...devastated, the Danes never invent
their namesake pastry.

02:06.702 --> 02:09.000
How does one miss that?

02:10.306 --> 02:12.831
This is ridiculous.
You're just making stuff up.

02:13.409 --> 02:15.172
Is he always like this when he loses?

02:15.344 --> 02:20.281
Oh, yes. You should have been here
for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.

02:22.051 --> 02:24.349
You bumped the table
and you know it.

02:28.624 --> 02:32.492
Perhaps it would be kinder to play
a game more suited to his abilities.

02:32.662 --> 02:36.359
We'll close our eyes and count to ten
while you hide.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.324
I'm going to my room.

02:38.501 --> 02:42.301
Very good, Leonard. But next time,
don't tell us where you're hiding.

03:11.067 --> 03:14.264
See the paper in The American
Physics Journal on supersolids?

03:14.437 --> 03:16.735
This guy's working
from a hypothesis where...

03:16.906 --> 03:19.568
- Spoiler alert, spoiler alert.
- What?

03:19.742 --> 03:23.337
Don't ruin it for me, man.
I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.

03:23.512 --> 03:25.503
On the potty? What are you, 5?

03:25.681 --> 03:27.808
- It's a potty. What do you call it?
- Toilet.

03:27.983 --> 03:30.611
A little vulgar for the dinner table,
don't you think?

03:30.786 --> 03:32.754
Oh, and potty is okay?

03:32.922 --> 03:34.822
Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.525
What do you do in the potty,
wee-wee?

03:38.327 --> 03:40.921
If I don't have to boom-boom.

03:41.097 --> 03:42.121
Greetings.

03:42.298 --> 03:45.028
- Uh, you all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.
LEONARD: Sure, hi.

03:45.201 --> 03:46.793
- Hello.
- Sorry we're late.

03:46.969 --> 03:49.995
I must take responsibility. I had to stop
for feminine hygiene supplies.

03:50.172 --> 03:51.605
LEONARD: Ah!
HOWARD: Okay.

03:51.774 --> 03:53.537
I believe she's experiencing her menses.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.608
Actually, I'm not.
In order to avoid surprises...

03:56.779 --> 03:58.679
...I wear them all the time.
HOWARD: Okay.

03:59.949 --> 04:02.144
Toilet's sounding
pretty good now, huh?

04:03.619 --> 04:05.712
Hey, look, it's Shamy.

04:05.955 --> 04:09.982
- Shamy?
- A juvenile amalgamation of our names.

04:10.159 --> 04:12.787
Sheldon, Amy. Shamy.

04:13.162 --> 04:14.186
Oh.

04:14.363 --> 04:16.126
I don't like that. Don't do that.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.360
Heh. Alrighty. What's new?

04:19.535 --> 04:23.027
Recently, I learned that you refer to us
as Shamy and I don't like that.

04:23.873 --> 04:27.741
I got it. But what I was going for was,
you know, how's your life?

04:27.943 --> 04:29.376
Like everybody else's.

04:29.545 --> 04:32.480
Subject to entropy,
decay and eventual death.

04:34.216 --> 04:37.049
Thank you for asking.
Why is she not taking our order?

04:37.219 --> 04:38.413
I should have warned you.

04:38.587 --> 04:41.522
One has to navigate
a labyrinth of social nonsense...

04:41.690 --> 04:43.487
...before one can be fed here.

04:44.226 --> 04:47.320
I assumed that an establishment
called the Cheesecake Factory...

04:47.496 --> 04:49.327
...would function more efficiently.

04:49.498 --> 04:52.695
It's how they lure you in.
I believe it's called "bait and switch."

04:53.903 --> 04:57.669
Okay, I'm just gonna walk away
because I don't wanna be here.

05:00.543 --> 05:01.703
[RAJESH SIGHS]

05:02.344 --> 05:05.677
So this is nice. First time
we've all gotten together to eat.

05:06.382 --> 05:08.748
You're right, he's a festival
of humdrum chitchat.

05:10.686 --> 05:13.917
Okay, that's all I got.
Howard, you're up.

05:14.290 --> 05:19.250
- Um, tell us about your work, Amy.
- I doubt you'd understand.

05:19.428 --> 05:21.919
Sheldon tells me
you only have a Master's degree.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.300
Raj? Do you have
any questions for Amy?

05:30.239 --> 05:32.730
I'm curious as to why
we're not eating alone.

that holds this little group together.

You're welcome.

Listen, can I talk to you
about your girlfriend?

05:46.522 --> 05:47.989
She's not my girlfriend.

05:48.157 --> 05:50.057
She's a girl and she's my friend...

05:50.226 --> 05:51.625
...but there's no touching...

05:51.794 --> 05:54.922
...or unsanitary exchange of saliva.

Got it.

05:58.734 --> 06:01.225
...she licked her thumb

we both regret to this day.

Uh-huh. Anyway. I'm not sure
she's the best fit...

rebel alliance.

06:12.815 --> 06:15.978

with the Rebel Alliance.

You're intimidated by Amy's intellect.
To that, I say buck up.

06:29.832 --> 06:31.527
LEONARD:
Okay, let me just get right to it.

06:31.700 --> 06:37.468
Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious
and frankly, just obnoxious.

06:38.474 --> 06:40.374
So?

06:40.576 --> 06:42.476
So we already have you for all that.

06:44.280 --> 06:47.272
Are you suggesting
I terminate my relationship with Amy?

06:47.449 --> 06:51.818
No, no, of course not. Just have
your relationship someplace else.

06:51.987 --> 06:54.888
May I point out
that for eight long months...

06:55.090 --> 06:57.888

as your female companion...

...against her calloused feet
in our living room...

Yes.

hide out here to avoid the Shamy?

- Well, what did he say?

sort of, had to put up with you.

can be tough.

13:00.289 --> 13:02.257
Penny, I assure you, I'm fine.

13:02.424 --> 13:05.450
My relationship with Amy
was purely intellectual.

13:05.661 --> 13:07.253
There were no emotional bonds...

13:07.429 --> 13:10.091
...the severing of which
would cause me any discomfort.

13:10.265 --> 13:12.699
The relationship simply outlived
its utility...

13:12.868 --> 13:15.701
...and I'm continuing on
with my life as before.

13:16.405 --> 13:17.702
Okay. Good.

I'm off to buy a pussycat.

I gotta tell you guys,
I'm a little worried about Sheldon.

13:27.115 --> 13:29.777
We're all a little worried
about Sheldon.

13:29.952 --> 13:32.785
No. I mean, since the Shamy
hit a reef.

13:32.955 --> 13:34.980
Oh, I thought you were
making a generalization.

13:35.190 --> 13:38.785
I'm worried about Sheldon someday
setting off a low-yield nuclear device...

13:38.961 --> 13:41.259
...because the cafeteria
ran out of lime Jell-O.

13:42.297 --> 13:45.266
- What does "hit a reef" mean?
- Uh, went splitsville.

13:45.801 --> 13:48.895
- Pardon?
- Turned to boom-boom.

13:49.371 --> 13:50.736
Ah.

13:51.306 --> 13:53.240
I think Sheldon really misses Amy.

13:53.442 --> 13:57.435
You should lend him your copy
of Bombay Badonkadonks.

13:58.013 --> 14:00.573
- He got a cat to keep him company.
- You're kidding.

14:00.749 --> 14:03.650
He takes it everywhere.
To bed, to the bathroom.

14:03.819 --> 14:05.616
He takes the kitty to the potty?

14:06.588 --> 14:08.283

to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

- Hi.

Yeah.

Hey. Oh, no.

14:45.994 --> 14:48.827
Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.

14:48.997 --> 14:52.330
So you decided to get
the whole Manhattan Project?

14:52.501 --> 14:55.698
Yes. This is Enrico Fermi,
Richard Feynman...

- Zazzles.
- Zazzles?

15:01.877 --> 15:04.175
I was going to name him
Hermann von Helmholtz...

15:04.346 --> 15:06.837

- About what?

15:13.655 --> 15:15.054
Cats, Sheldon.

15:15.223 --> 15:17.316
You're clearly upset
about Amy being gone...

15:17.492 --> 15:19.858
...and you're trying to replace her
with cats.

15:20.028 --> 15:21.495
- Clowder.
- What?

15:21.663 --> 15:24.894
- Group of cats is a clowder or a glaring.
- Okay, yeah...

15:25.067 --> 15:29.197
It's the kind of thing you ought to know
now that we have one.

15:29.805 --> 15:34.606
Terrific. My point is, you need to face up
to what you're feeling with this breakup.

15:34.810 --> 15:37.608
It wasn't a breakup. A breakup
would imply that Amy was...

15:37.813 --> 15:40.077
Okay, I got it.
She's not your girlfriend.

15:40.248 --> 15:44.207
Now, listen to me.
I know about loneliness.

15:44.386 --> 15:47.082
I know about trying
to replace someone with other stuff.

15:47.255 --> 15:50.247
When I broke up with Penny,
I got back into my cello...

I got those weightlifting gloves
and that five-pound dumbbell.

15:57.766 --> 16:00.257
You didn't break up, she dumped you.

16:00.435 --> 16:03.598
She didn't dump me. It was mutual.

16:03.772 --> 16:06.605
- I was there. She dumped you.
- Okay, fine.

16:06.775 --> 16:09.767

She had dozens of them.

16:09.945 --> 16:13.073

after she died? They ate her.

- He's in his bedroom.

16:37.172 --> 16:40.073
Now, when you said on the phone
"he broke up with a girl"...

16:40.242 --> 16:42.107
...you meant an actual girl...

I should prepare you for.

Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf...

Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats...

17:30.559 --> 17:33.119
...and you gave them
cute Jewish names.

17:33.328 --> 17:36.491
- What are you doing here?
- Leonard called.

17:36.665 --> 17:39.498
He said that you were pining
for a young lady.

17:39.668 --> 17:43.468
Oh, that's preposterous.
I'm not pining over anyone.

Oh, lamb chop,
we can quibble what to call it...

17:46.141 --> 17:49.542

we can both agree it's creepy.

I do not agree.

I think you'll find to be quite zazzy.

You're not fooling me.
Whenever you say we have to talk...

18:44.299 --> 18:45.960

- Then stop talking.
- Yes, ma'am.

18:48.136 --> 18:50.934
Now, the reason I called Amy over...

18:51.106 --> 18:53.438
...was to find out
what type of person she is.

18:53.608 --> 18:55.200

...I have to say that while she is

to end the relationship...

I believe we may have acted rashly.
