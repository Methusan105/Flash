You do what you want. I'm not touching

13:53.978 --> 13:55.536
All right, uh, forget pulling.

13:55.713 --> 13:58.147
How about we get an electric saw
and cut it off?

13:58.349 --> 13:59.941
What? No saws!

14:00.117 --> 14:03.052
One circumcision was enough.

14:05.589 --> 14:07.284
How about an acetylene torch?

14:07.491 --> 14:09.755
I can't believe
this needs to be said out loud.

14:09.927 --> 14:13.761

- Then what do you want us to do?

- Don't come up here!
MRS WOLOWITZ: Why not?

14:25.910 --> 14:27.935
Are you ashamed of your mother?

14:28.112 --> 14:30.672
Yes, but that's not the point!

14:31.682 --> 14:32.740
Get me out of here.

14:32.917 --> 14:34.817
You have any ideas, Raj?

Right now, all I can think about
is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.

This is a big night for Sheldon.

14:52.403 --> 14:55.702
- Right, Sheldon?
- Big night?

14:55.906 --> 14:58.204
The winter solstice is a big night.

14:59.343 --> 15:01.709
It's over 14 hours
in Southern California.

15:03.447 --> 15:07.315
- That's an amusing factoid.
- Thank you.

15:08.786 --> 15:14.156
No, no. My point is, uh,
tonight is Sheldon's first official date.

15:14.325 --> 15:15.917

15:16.460 --> 15:19.452

So, um, Amy, what about you?
Do you date much?

15:27.371 --> 15:29.703
Once a year.
It's a deal I made with my mother...

15:29.873 --> 15:31.738
...in exchange for her silence
on the matter...

15:31.909 --> 15:36.812
...and the use of her George Foreman Grill
that seals in the flavor without the fat.

15:39.383 --> 15:41.180
What about you?
Do you go on many dates?

15:41.585 --> 15:44.145
Uh, yeah, I wouldn't say many. A few.

[IMITATES SHELDON'S GIGGLE]

15:50.694 --> 15:54.687
Your characterization of approximately
171 different men as a few.

15:54.865 --> 15:56.526
What...?

15:57.067 --> 15:59.558
Where did you get 171 men?

15:59.737 --> 16:01.068
Simple extrapolation.

16:01.238 --> 16:04.435
In the three years that I've known you,
you were single for two.

16:04.608 --> 16:07.406
During that time,
I saw 17 different suitors.

16:07.578 --> 16:08.704
If we work backwards...

16:08.879 --> 16:13.077
...correcting for observation bias
and postulate an initial dating age of 15...

16:13.250 --> 16:16.777
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.
I did not start dating at 15.

16:16.987 --> 16:19.080
- I'm sorry. Sixteen?
- Fourteen.

16:20.924 --> 16:22.016
My mistake.

16:22.192 --> 16:25.525
Now assuming the left side of a bell curve
peaking around the present...

16:25.696 --> 16:31.601
...that would bring the total
up to 193 men, plus or minus eight men.

16:33.771 --> 16:37.138
Remarkable. Did you have
sexual intercourse with all of these men?

16:37.308 --> 16:38.536
- No.
SHELDON: No.

16:38.709 --> 16:41.644
Although that number
would be fairly easy to calculate.

16:41.812 --> 16:43.973
Based on the number
of awkward encounters I've had...

16:44.148 --> 16:45.979
...with strange men
leaving her apartment...

16:46.150 --> 16:48.550
...plus the number of times
she's returned home...

16:48.719 --> 16:51.051
...wearing same clothes
she wore the night before...

16:51.221 --> 16:54.622
- I think you've made your point.
- So we multiply a 193...

16:54.792 --> 16:57.317
...minus 21 men
before the loss of virginity...

16:57.528 --> 17:04.024
...so 172 times 0.18
gives us 30.96 sexual partners.

17:05.436 --> 17:06.801
Let's round that up to 31.

17:08.305 --> 17:10.603
Okay, Sheldon. You are so wrong.

17:10.774 --> 17:12.765
That is not even close
to the real number.

- I slipped and fell.
- Yeah, we get that a lot.

- What is this?
- It's a robot arm.

18:27.484 --> 18:29.349
Where's the rest of the robot?

18:29.820 --> 18:31.549
I only built the arm.

- But it's frozen.

and back on again?
