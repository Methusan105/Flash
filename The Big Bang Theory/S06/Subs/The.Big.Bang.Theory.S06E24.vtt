00:03.420 --> 00:08.424
So anyway, last night on video chat, l spent,
like, 20 minutes just staring into Lucy's eyes.

00:08.633 --> 00:12.136
-That sounds romantic.
-It was, until I realized the screen had frozen.

00:13.888 --> 00:16.223
Still one of my top three dates of all time.

00:16.599 --> 00:18.517
So we ever gonna hang out with this girl?

00:18.727 --> 00:21.937
Ahh, l'd love that, but she's not
really comfortable around people.

00:22.147 --> 00:26.775
Yeah, l used to be uncomfortable
around people, but then l learned a trick.

00:26.985 --> 00:31.238
I pretend everyone I meet
is a beloved character from Star Trek.

00:32.574 --> 00:33.866
How's that working for you?

00:34.075 --> 00:37.411
Oh, like a charm,
unnamed crewman in a red shirt.

00:38.747 --> 00:41.623
Leonard, l may have gotten you a job.

00:42.208 --> 00:46.462
-I have a job.
-Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.

00:47.088 --> 00:51.216
No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking's
team is sending an expedition...

00:51.426 --> 00:54.553
...to the North Sea to test
hydrodynamic simulations of black holes.

00:54.763 --> 00:58.807
One of their experimental physicists
dropped out and l recommended you.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.477
Well, do you really think l have a shot?

01:01.686 --> 01:05.230
Yeah, l've worked with Hawking,
I talked you up. He knows your research.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.357
-I think this could happen.
-He kno--?

01:07.567 --> 01:08.609
Wow.

01:08.818 --> 01:12.112
Wait, now, but do you think
that's a good idea?

01:13.448 --> 01:14.573
You know Star Trek.

01:14.783 --> 01:19.036
Should a guy with no name
and a red shirt really go on an expedition?

01:20.663 --> 01:23.499
Hey, don't discourage him.
This is a fantastic opportunity.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.793
No one asked you, Uhura.

01:29.631 --> 01:33.467
Would you like to hear a classic
Sheldon Cooper factoid?

01:33.676 --> 01:35.385
-What do you think?
-Great.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.265
I've been doing some reading
about vehicular safety.

01:40.475 --> 01:44.436
Did you know that the highest number
of drowning accidents...

01:44.646 --> 01:48.190
...happen on or around boats?

01:48.650 --> 01:52.486
Interesting that you would bring that up
when l might go work on a boat.

01:52.695 --> 01:55.656
Well, that's the thing about factoids,
they're interesting.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.701
I know what you're doing.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.539
You don't want me going on this trip
because you're afraid to be alone.

02:03.998 --> 02:05.916
I'm not afraid to be alone.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.209
On land.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.171
On the sea, it would be terrifying.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.676
Because of all the drowning.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.638
-Sheldon.
-Fine, no more drowning talk.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.682
I'll change the subject.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.269
Who do you think would win in a fight...

02:25.478 --> 02:28.480
...you or a shark?

02:29.774 --> 02:34.778
Look, l appreciate your signature blend of
concern for me and incredible selfishness...

02:36.030 --> 02:40.617
...but if I get the chance to do this, there's
nothing you can say that's going to stop me.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.244
Very well.

02:44.038 --> 02:46.415
Things between you and Penny
have never been better.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.251
I hope four months apart
doesn't change anything.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.800
I should've opened with that, huh?

03:23.995 --> 03:25.913
If you look carefully at Venus...

03:26.122 --> 03:30.209
...you should be able to see
the lnternational Space Station pass by.

03:30.418 --> 03:33.378
Wow, your friend was actually up there?

03:33.588 --> 03:36.006
Yeah, he brought me back
a T-shirt that said:

03:36.216 --> 03:40.427
"My Friend Went to the Space Station
and All l Got Was This Lousy T-shirt."

03:41.471 --> 03:43.096
Did he take the T-shirt to space?

03:43.306 --> 03:45.807
Nope. It's exactly as lousy as advertised.

03:47.602 --> 03:51.021
Speaking of friends,
they have been asking to meet you.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.942
I was thinking maybe
we could all hang out sometime?

03:55.151 --> 03:56.944
I don't know, how many are there?

03:57.362 --> 03:59.446
Let's see. Six.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.949
That's pretty cool. l have six friends.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.036
I'm kind of like Sinatra.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.749
Six strangers, that's a lot of pressure.

04:10.959 --> 04:15.212
Staring at me, asking me
personal questions like, "What do you do?

04:15.672 --> 04:19.967
Where are you from? Why did you
lock yourself in the bathroom?"

04:20.343 --> 04:24.554
Okay, how about you just
dip your toe in and meet one of them?

04:26.015 --> 04:28.475
-Will you be there?
-Of course.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.979
Well, that's two. Three if you count me.
This is getting out of hand.

04:34.857 --> 04:39.361
So then, during my afternoon shift,
I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.364
-Oh, that's awful.
-Not really. My shirt was soaking wet.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.825
I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.

04:47.495 --> 04:50.622
So listen, do you remember
when l said the similarities...

04:50.832 --> 04:53.625
...of the equations of general relativity
and hydrodynamics...

04:53.835 --> 04:58.213
...suggest you could find the equivalent
of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?

04:59.007 --> 05:01.008
I thought I said that to you.

05:05.555 --> 05:10.892
Anyway, Stephen Hawking's team is looking
into that, and I've been invited to join them.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.562
Wow, Hawking. Good for you.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.815
Well, it is,
just, you know, l'd be gone for a while.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.192
-Well, how long?
-Three, four months.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.153
Whoa.

05:21.362 --> 05:23.739
-When would you leave?
-Couple of weeks.

05:24.824 --> 05:25.866
Wow.

05:26.075 --> 05:29.161
-Okay, well, l'll just come visit you.
-That's the thing, you can't.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.330
I'll be on a ship in the North Sea.

05:31.539 --> 05:35.334
On a ship? Aren't they afraid
Hawking will just roll overboard?

05:37.795 --> 05:41.757
He's not gonna be there. He's just
sending a team to research his theory.

05:41.966 --> 05:46.178
Oh, sure. Like when you send me
to kill spiders in your bathtub.

05:49.265 --> 05:52.017
Oh. Okay. So four months.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.435
Yeah.

05:53.644 --> 05:57.522
And I'm a little worried because
things between us have been so great...

05:57.732 --> 06:00.525
...and I'd hate to do anything
that screws that up.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.361
If you're gonna screw things up...

06:02.570 --> 06:05.405
...it's gonna be while you're here,
not while you're away.

06:10.453 --> 06:13.914
I mean, look, you have to go.
It sounds like an amazing opportunity.

06:14.123 --> 06:17.834
And I'm just basing that on how much
I didn't understand what you said about it.

06:19.587 --> 06:23.256
Okay. I'll confirm the travel arrangements
in the morning.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.966
Okay, good.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.261
-I do have to ask you one favor.
-Sure.

06:28.471 --> 06:31.723
Sheldon's nervous about me leaving,
keep an eye on him while l'm gone.

06:31.933 --> 06:36.269
Oh, I don't know. Remember what happened
when l took care of your goldfish?

06:37.605 --> 06:40.482
Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet
and get me a new one.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.067
[LAUGHS]

06:43.611 --> 06:46.321
Really, you guys do not need
to throw me a going away party.

06:46.531 --> 06:49.408
Are you kidding me?
How often can you say bon voyage...

06:49.617 --> 06:52.869
...to somebody when they're
actually going on a voyage?

really don't need to make a big deal.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.015
Leonard, you're being selfish.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.269
We need to give you a proper send-off
so we'll have closure...

One of the things that helped me get through
Howard being in space for so long...

Okay, I have a request to make.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.461
And now he can talk.

07:42.879 --> 07:46.506
I want to cut open your brain
and see what the heck's going on in there.

07:47.717 --> 07:51.094
The only person allowed
inside this head is Dr. Phil.

07:52.430 --> 07:55.307
Anyway, I spoke to my new lady friend
about meeting you all.

07:55.516 --> 07:58.310
She thought it would be easier
for her to start with just one.

07:58.519 --> 08:02.355
Gee, I don't know,
my schedule is a little busy.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.691
Actually, I was thinking Leonard.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.527
Well, thank you, Raj, l'd be honored.

08:07.737 --> 08:11.156
What the hell?
I thought I was your best friend.

08:11.365 --> 08:14.034
You are, but you've got
kind of a big personality...

08:14.243 --> 08:18.413
...with your flashy clothes
and your Woody Allen swagger.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.835
Maybe she'd be more comfortable
meeting a girl first.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.796
-Good idea. Bernadette?
-What the hell?

08:27.632 --> 08:31.009
Well, you're very pretty, that could
be intimidating to another woman.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.719
Oh, yeah.

08:33.387 --> 08:36.932
Hey, you don't think l'm pretty enough
to scare your girlfriend?

08:37.141 --> 08:40.101
Calm down, Bernie, you're very scary.

08:41.812 --> 08:42.979
It should be me.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.566
Why? So you can make jokes
about cutting open my brain?

08:47.610 --> 08:51.112
A, that was not a joke,
that was a sincere request.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.951
And B, more importantly,
I was the outsider to this group...

08:56.160 --> 08:58.161
...and I know how frightening that can be.

08:58.371 --> 09:03.166
But you guys took me in
and made me feel loved, like I was family.

I met Leonard and then everybody else...

Don't put her on the spot,
she hates that. Am l right?

09:27.149 --> 09:30.485
Tell her how much you hate being
put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her.

the severity of your social anxiety.

You can't talk about social anxiety
to someone who has social anxiety...

...it makes them socially anxious.

I don't understand why you, of all people...

10:38.179 --> 10:40.013
...are encouraging Leonard to do this.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.974
Well, I'm his girlfriend,
of course l'm gonna support him.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.185
Well, you're his girlfriend for now.

but there is a rich tradition of men at sea...

...finding comfort in each other's arms

10:58.157 --> 11:02.911
He gets to work with Stephen Hawking, who,
by the way, will not be on the boat, I checked.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.624
It's not that big of an opportunity. l mean,
even if Hawking's theories are correct...

11:07.833 --> 11:10.210
...all they prove is
where the universe came from...

11:10.419 --> 11:14.005
...why everything exists
and what its ultimate end will be.

We were both up for the same part
in a toothpaste commercial. She got it.

11:50.751 --> 11:54.379
I was so jealous, but instead of
ripping out her fake blond hair--

11:54.588 --> 11:56.965
You ripped out your own fake blond hair.

11:58.259 --> 12:02.262
I looked her in the eye, smiled and said,
"l'm happy for you."
