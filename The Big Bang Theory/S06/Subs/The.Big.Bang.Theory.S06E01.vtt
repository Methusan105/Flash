husband and wife.

00:07.757 --> 00:08.799
[CHEERlNG]

00:10.051 --> 00:13.512
-I love this part!
-Me too!

00:13.680 --> 00:16.890
I have strongly mixed feelings.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.187
So Howard's really in space?

00:22.355 --> 00:25.858
The lnternational Space Station,
250 miles that way. Heh.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.819
Right now Howard
is staring down at our planet...

00:28.987 --> 00:31.488
...like a tiny Jewish Greek god.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.200
Zeus-owitz.

00:35.660 --> 00:39.038
I must admit,
I can't help but feel a twinge of envy.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.040
He can look out the window...

00:41.207 --> 00:44.960
...and see the majesty of the universe
unfolding before his eyes.

00:45.128 --> 00:48.380
His dim, uncomprehending eyes.

00:51.217 --> 00:54.553
It's like a cat in an airport carrying case.

00:56.347 --> 00:58.557
You know,
it's not exactly glamorous up there.

00:58.725 --> 01:02.144

is made from each other's recycled urine.

Nobody wants anything
that comes out of me.

01:13.990 --> 01:18.577
-I wonder what he's doing this very second.
-Conducting experiments in zero gravity.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.371
Peering through his telescope
at the birth of the cosmos.

we know his life will never be the same.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.856
How about calling her my wife? Heh.

Wives don't take boys from their mothers.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.195
They do, that's why we marry them.

Now.

03:04.851 --> 03:08.395
So does Sheldon have anything special
planned for you tomorrow night?

03:08.563 --> 03:13.025
Yes. According to the relationship agreement,
on the anniversary of our first date...

03:13.193 --> 03:16.028
...he must take me to a nice dinner,
ask about my day...

03:16.196 --> 03:18.197
...and engage in casual physical contact...

03:18.364 --> 03:21.491
...that a disinterested onlooker
might mistake for intimacy.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.243
That's hot.

03:24.829 --> 03:27.039
You kids better use protection.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.751
-How long does this stay on?
-Just a couple minutes.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.630
-You've really never done this before?
-Once in high school. But I dozed off...

03:34.797 --> 03:37.674
...and woke up with second degree
chemical burns on my face.

03:38.343 --> 03:41.345
Oh, my gosh, that's awful.
Did the other kids make fun of you?

03:41.512 --> 03:44.389
No, I had a cover story.
I told everyone it was herpes.

03:46.226 --> 03:50.395
-So how's everything with you and Leonard?
-I don't know. It's still kind of weird.

03:50.563 --> 03:54.024
We haven't really recovered
since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.443
Oh. Boo-hoo.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.862
If Sheldon proposed to me during sex...

03:59.030 --> 04:01.740
...my ovaries would grab onto him
and never let go.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.291
Leonard, where do you stand
on the anthropic principle?

04:11.751 --> 04:15.754
-Interesting question. On the one hand--
-You don't even know what it is, do you?

04:16.756 --> 04:18.882
The anthropic principle states...

04:19.050 --> 04:22.970
...that if we wish to explain
why our universe exists the way it does...

04:23.137 --> 04:25.889
...the answer is that
it must have qualities...

04:26.057 --> 04:28.392
...that allow intelligent creatures
to arise...

04:28.559 --> 04:30.560
...who are capable of asking the question.

04:30.728 --> 04:34.064
As l am doing so eloquently right now.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.025
I know what the anthropic principle is.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.403
Of course.
I just explained it to you.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.948
Now, where do you stand on it?

04:43.116 --> 04:45.117
-Where do you stand on it?
-Strongly pro.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.953
Then l believe that God
created the world in six days...

04:48.121 --> 04:50.414
...and on the seventh
he made you to annoy me.

04:54.919 --> 04:56.128
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.506
Raj, where do you stand
on the anthropic principle?

04:59.674 --> 05:01.591
-I'm all for it.
-Thattaboy.

05:01.759 --> 05:04.636
Why do you believe that he knows
what it is, and l don't?

05:04.804 --> 05:06.263
Oh, Leonard...

05:06.431 --> 05:09.975
...let's not take a saw to the branch
we're sitting on, shall we?

05:10.810 --> 05:13.687
Hey, if you guys are free tonight
I heard about a spa...

05:13.855 --> 05:16.315
...where you soak your feet
in a pool of fish...

05:16.482 --> 05:18.191
...that eat the dead skin off them.

05:19.777 --> 05:21.820
I don't need to tell you, in Los Angeles...

05:21.988 --> 05:23.989
...sandal season is year round.

05:25.366 --> 05:28.160
-Actually, I'm hanging out with Penny.
-Oh, okay.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.953
Sounds like it's me and you.

05:30.121 --> 05:32.497
How about we sic some guppies
on those puppies?

05:33.958 --> 05:36.460
As l've stated before
on numerous occasions...

05:36.627 --> 05:39.379
...the only sea creature
I would consider being eaten by...

05:39.589 --> 05:43.633
...is the Kraken. Because the last words
I would hear are "release the Kraken."

05:44.886 --> 05:46.678
That never gets old.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.430

Oh, okay. l'll just go home and be alone.

05:56.105 --> 06:00.484

I eat alone, I sleep alone, l cry alone, so...

on your date night?

06:15.666 --> 06:17.376
Oh, absolutely.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.003
I have a contractual obligation...

06:20.171 --> 06:23.757
...to provide Amy with conversation
and casual physical contact.

06:23.925 --> 06:28.387

that I can't outsource that to an lndian.
