Is anyone else troubled
by the Spider-Man theme song?

00:08.383 --> 00:11.677
Why would it trouble you?
It's your third-favorite cartoon theme song.

00:11.845 --> 00:16.181
It is, right behind,
"Do, do, do, do, do, lnspector Gadget."

-...does whatever a spider can.
-Yeah, so?

Spider-Man can't do that a spider can.

without a passport.

And three, have sex with a spider.

Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.719
It's "heebie-jeebies."

Movies that killed their franchises.

United States, Alaska or Hawaii...

Sadly, yes. Amy's taking me

It's for one of her colleagues
who is of Asian descent...

02:19.639 --> 02:22.766

is to casually remark...

02:22.976 --> 02:28.021
...that no matter how deep they dig his grave,
he'll never make his way back to China.

[CLlCKS]

15:34.600 --> 15:37.602
Oh, Sheldon, am l glad you're back.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.188
I've taken a turn for the worst.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.608
I think I'm gonna need another bath.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.611
I'm surprised to hear that.

15:46.779 --> 15:50.490
You see, the other day,
I was concerned that you weren't recovering...

15:50.741 --> 15:53.117
...so while you were sleeping,
I took a cheek swab...

15:53.327 --> 15:54.994
...and had it cultured in the lab.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.206
-Oh?
-I got the results back.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.334
Have you developed any
of the following symptoms?

16:01.585 --> 16:07.966
A growing nose or perhaps a warm sensation
in the trouser region?

16:08.634 --> 16:12.470
Also known as full-blown
Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.474
All right, all right.
But l really was sick at the beginning.

16:16.725 --> 16:19.852
It's just been so nice
having you take care of me.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.940
It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.818
I thought our relationship
was based on trust...

16:26.986 --> 16:31.030
...and a mutual admiration
that skews in my favor.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.449
I feel terrible I did this.

16:33.659 --> 16:37.829
It pains me to say it,
but l think some form of penalty is in order...

16:37.997 --> 16:41.374
...so as to discourage this type of behavior
in the future.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.377
I suppose that's fair. What do you suggest?

16:44.628 --> 16:48.798
In a perfect world, I'd lock you in a stockade
in the public square.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.968
And that probably requires a permit.

16:54.513 --> 16:58.307
I could not be allowed to go to the opening
of the next Star Trek movie.

16:58.517 --> 17:01.519
Oh, that seems overly harsh.

17:02.396 --> 17:05.398
You gave in to a human weakness.
You didn't kill a man.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.652
You know, it's a tad old-school...

17:09.862 --> 17:12.530
...but my father was not one
to spare the rod...

17:12.781 --> 17:17.201
...when my brother would sneak into his truck
and drink his driving whiskey.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.832
Are you saying you wanna spank me?

17:25.210 --> 17:27.795
I don't want to...

17:29.048 --> 17:31.716
...but it looks like you left me no choice.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.803
That's true.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.185
I've been a very bad girl.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.399
Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to fish we go.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.904
-That's what you're wearing?
-No good?

17:53.113 --> 17:56.866
The guy at the sporting goods store
said these are what fishermen wear.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.410
Maybe in cartoons.

18:00.913 --> 18:05.083
I wish I had known that before
I posted all those pictures on Facebook.

18:07.586 --> 18:11.422
All right. Let's hit the road. I wouldn't mind
shooting some ducks in the morning.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.966
Wait, now we're shooting things?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.844
I like using a big shell.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.348
You can't eat them afterwards
but it's fun watching them blow up.

18:25.062 --> 18:31.234
Sir, l'm flattered that you invited me
and I really want you to like me...

18:31.443 --> 18:36.781
...but l don't think this trip is the way to do it.

18:37.908 --> 18:41.577
And I can't return these things
if there's chunks of duck all over them.

18:41.995 --> 18:45.957
-So why'd you agree to come?
-Because Bernadette made me.

18:46.166 --> 18:50.461
I tried to back out too.
My wife said I had to go.

18:50.671 --> 18:54.924
Really? Your wife makes you do stuff?
You're a big, scary cop.

18:55.592 --> 18:58.136
You're an astronaut
and your wife makes you do things...

18:58.387 --> 19:01.139
...and she's only 4 feet tall.

19:04.518 --> 19:09.272
So, what do we do now?
They expect us to go away for the weekend.

19:15.195 --> 19:18.823
There's an lndian casino near Palm Springs.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.285
You know how to shoot craps?

19:22.494 --> 19:24.954
No, but l'm not a stranger to dice games.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.416
I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School
Yahtzee champion.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.137
Thank you, sir.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.515
Call me Mike.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.227
Okay.

19:51.523 --> 19:55.484
Boy, we're just married to
a couple of ball-busters, huh, Mike?

19:57.029 --> 19:59.864
That's my wife and daughter
you're talking about.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.493
Great couple of gals.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.704
I wouldn't go that far.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.631
Are you prepared to receive
your punishment?

20:20.802 --> 20:23.721
One second. l wanna put on some music.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.724
Why?

20:26.975 --> 20:30.645
I don't wanna disturb the people next door
while you discipline me.

Very well, then.
Get over my knee. Let's begin.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.664
Oh, my.

20:50.082 --> 20:54.085
Excuse me. You're not supposed
to be enjoying this.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.505
Then maybe you should spank me harder.

Maybe I will.
