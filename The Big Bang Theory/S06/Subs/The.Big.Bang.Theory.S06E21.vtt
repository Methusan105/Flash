-Answer honestly. This is not a trial.

There's no season three.
They canceled that show.

Well, they can't cancel it.
It ended on a cliffhanger.

Well, they did.

of New York either dead or unconscious.

I'll rub pudding on my gums.

a show like Alphas.

-Yes.

People change names on blogs...

05:45.678 --> 05:48.263
Okay. Well, what I think is going on here...

You know, I might be able

There's a field of behavioral neuroscience
that examines...

06:05.907 --> 06:09.409

your relationship, use it to your advantage.

-Is something going on?
-What do you mean?

14:44.842 --> 14:47.302
Well, you're acting all weird,
and I'm pretty weird...

14:47.511 --> 14:50.305
...so l think I know what l'm talking about.

14:50.514 --> 14:54.642
I don't know, maybe it's all those
steroids I've been taking.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.480
I think I'm gonna go. Thank you
for the burrito and the pork rinds...

14:59.690 --> 15:04.152
...and the 20-minute lecture on why
monster trucks are better than regular trucks.

15:04.361 --> 15:05.737
Wait, wait.

15:07.364 --> 15:10.533
I found your blog
where you wrote about me.

15:11.201 --> 15:15.455
Oh. I just write that for myself.
I didn't think anybody actually read it.

15:15.664 --> 15:19.417
No kidding. You didn't make it easy to find.
I spent hours digging around online.

15:21.045 --> 15:24.213
For the record, you have excellent credit
and your diabetic aunt...

15:24.423 --> 15:27.175
...seems to be adjusting to her new leg
just fine.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.387
Why were you acting so strange tonight?

15:32.723 --> 15:34.682
You called me "feminine."

15:34.892 --> 15:37.518
I wanted you to think I was more manly.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.396
Raj, l didn't say feminine was a bad thing.

15:40.606 --> 15:44.275
I meant you're sweet and thoughtful
and your skin looks so much like caramel...

15:44.485 --> 15:47.236
...I just want to dip an apple in your face.

15:48.322 --> 15:51.699
I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall
moisturizing regimen.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.702
So are you okay?

15:55.579 --> 15:56.955
-Yeah.
-Good.

15:58.082 --> 16:01.167
-Do you even like hockey?
-Heh. No.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.796
I bought this at the Staples Center
when l went to see Taylor Swift.

16:07.633 --> 16:12.845
So I was thinking how excited you get
about stuff like Buffy or science...

16:13.055 --> 16:15.723
...or which TV remote
you and Sheldon should buy--

16:15.933 --> 16:18.476
The Harmony One was fine.
We didn't need the 1 1 00...

16:18.727 --> 16:21.312
...which he knows is too big for my hand.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.608
See, that's the kind of passion
I didn't think l had.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.111
But then l realized
I'm passionate about you.

16:29.071 --> 16:32.782
Oh. My cute little tushy strikes again.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.746
I'm serious. l've always had these plans.
I was gonna be in movies...

16:38.956 --> 16:41.666
...and live this glamorous life,
and anything less than that...

16:41.875 --> 16:45.545
-...wasn't worth getting excited about.
-Those things can still happen.

16:45.754 --> 16:49.173
Obviously, it's gonna happen.
A psychic at a bachelorette party told me.

16:50.050 --> 16:54.303
Anyway, what I meant was
I shouldn't wait, you know?

16:54.513 --> 16:57.682
I've got you, l've got Sheldon...

16:57.891 --> 16:59.726
...and all these wonderful friends.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.936
My life is exciting right now.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.898

17:09.570 --> 17:12.655
So does that mean we get to do stuff
like talk about cool shows...

17:12.865 --> 17:16.993
...or get dressed up in matching costumes
and go to Comic-Con?

17:18.662 --> 17:21.164
Leonard, l had an epiphany, not a stroke.

17:25.169 --> 17:28.379
Amy, l must say, l was skeptical at first...

17:28.589 --> 17:31.424
...but this has truly been
a transformative evening.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.177
I'm a little surprised to hear you
feeling so positive.

17:34.386 --> 17:38.598
Well, you're an excellent neuroscientist,
you're a wonderful girlfriend...

17:38.807 --> 17:40.349
...and....

17:43.312 --> 17:47.231
-And?
-Doesn't matter, does it?

17:48.525 --> 17:50.318
I'm proud of you, Sheldon.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.531
And a complete sucker.

who wrote the season finale ofAlphas?
