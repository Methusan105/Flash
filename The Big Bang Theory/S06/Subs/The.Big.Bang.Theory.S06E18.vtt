WEBVTT

00:03.670 --> 00:06.588
I know you guys don't want to do this,
but we have no choice.

00:06.756 --> 00:09.466
You can either bitch and whine
or we can get it over with.

00:09.634 --> 00:11.969
-I got whine.
-I got the B-word.

00:12.846 --> 00:16.140
Yeah, well, it's in our contract
to serve on a university committee.

00:16.307 --> 00:18.726
And frankly,
this is one I believe in, okay? Here:

00:18.893 --> 00:21.687
Encouraging more women
to pursue a career in the sciences.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.565
Come on, if l was good
at convincing women to do stuff...

00:24.733 --> 00:27.776
...I wouldn't have spent
so much of my 20's in the shower. Heh.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.406
If you ask me,
this whole thing is a waste of our time.

00:32.574 --> 00:35.492
-Helping women?
-Yeah, helping anyone.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.746
People should take care of themselves.

00:38.913 --> 00:42.416
Oh, like yesterday when you
made me drive you to the dry cleaners...

00:42.584 --> 00:44.334
...the pharmacy and the post office?

00:44.502 --> 00:46.962
I'm not saying people can't use tools.

00:48.965 --> 00:51.633
Even an otter picks up a rock
when he wants a clam.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.388
You don't think it's worthwhile to get
more women in science?

00:56.556 --> 00:58.682
I think that's incredibly sexist of you.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.519
I believe in a gender-blind society
like in Star Trek...

01:02.687 --> 01:07.566
...where women and men of all races
and creeds work side by side as equals.

01:07.734 --> 01:11.862
You mean where they were advanced
enough to invent an interstellar warp drive...

01:12.030 --> 01:15.365
...but a black lady
still answered the space phone?

01:16.159 --> 01:19.953
Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time
with Lieutenant Uhura.

01:22.123 --> 01:24.917
Howard's disturbing recollections aside...

01:25.376 --> 01:28.462
...I don't appreciate being forced
to do banal committee work.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.297
I know. You're too smart for this.

01:30.465 --> 01:35.052
Exactly. lt's like asking the Human Torch
to heat up your frozen burrito.

01:35.929 --> 01:40.057
Got it. All right, l'm thinking one way
to counter bias in the peer-review process...

01:40.225 --> 01:43.393
...is for papers to be submitted
under gender-neutral names...

01:43.561 --> 01:45.646
...like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.315
I suppose there is a history
of professional women...

01:48.483 --> 01:51.068
...using their initials
so as not to be pre-judged.

01:51.236 --> 01:55.572
Harry Potter's J.K. Rowling,
uh, Star Treks D.C. Fontana.

01:55.740 --> 01:58.367
Van Nuys pole-dancer, D.D. Melons.

02:01.204 --> 02:04.832
All right. I think we've really helped
women today. Let's fire up the Xbox.

02:04.999 --> 02:08.544
Don't make this a school project
where l'm the smart kid doing the work...

02:08.711 --> 02:10.587
...while the slackers sit and watch.

02:10.755 --> 02:13.298
We're not. You're the smart kid
doing all the work...

02:13.466 --> 02:15.926
...while the even smarter kids
sit back and watch.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.138
So you think I'm one of the smarter kids?

02:19.305 --> 02:22.266
No, you're a tool I was using
to make my point.

02:51.087 --> 02:54.089
Guys, our topic is
"Encouraging Women in Science."

02:54.257 --> 02:56.258
Can you at least play a less sexist game?

03:01.431 --> 03:02.806
How is it sexist?

03:03.474 --> 03:06.518
My character wields a battle ax
as well as any man.

03:07.979 --> 03:11.273
Not to mention she has mammary glands
that could nurse a family of 30.

03:12.942 --> 03:16.820
And have enough milk left over
to open a Baskin-Robbins.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.575
Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner...

03:21.743 --> 03:24.661
...I hear glass ceilings shattering
all over town.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.916
Sheldon, you're always saying
how much smarter you are than me.

03:29.083 --> 03:33.253
Spend five seconds and come up with one
idea on how to get more women into science.

03:34.547 --> 03:38.842
All your ideas address the issue
at a university level. By then it's too late.

03:39.010 --> 03:42.721
You need to design a program that
targets girls at the middle-school level...

03:42.889 --> 03:46.058
...and sets them on an academic track
towards the hard sciences.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.561
That's actually good.
Why didn't I think of that?

03:50.480 --> 03:53.148
Some people are otters,
some people are rocks.

03:56.402 --> 04:00.239
I wonder if there's a way
we could give the idea a trial run.

04:00.698 --> 04:06.495
I could call my old middle school, see if
we can talk to some of the female students.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.331
Great. Try to set up something
for us to go over there.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.417
Hold on. While I'm comfortable
speaking about science...

04:12.585 --> 04:16.922
...I'm not sure l know how to spark the
interest of school children. Better Google it.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.925
What exactly are you looking up?

04:20.093 --> 04:24.096
"How do I get 1 2-year-old girls excited?"

04:24.264 --> 04:26.014
-No!
-No!

04:30.937 --> 04:33.438
Thanks again for letting me crash
girl's night.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.441
Are you kidding?
You brought fancy wine and made fondue.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.777
I've slept with guys for less.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.284
It's a joke.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.911
Based on real events.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.999
Anyway, I was hoping
I could, uh, pick your brains a little.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.877
I'm supposed to take Lucy out Friday
and I need a killer first date.

04:56.421 --> 04:59.423
Evolutionary biology
says that women are attracted to a man...

04:59.590 --> 05:04.052
...who is steady in the face of danger,
so I recommend an unsafe environment.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.016
A seedy bar
on the wrong side of the tracks...

05:09.183 --> 05:11.893
...a picnic near a lunatic asylum...

05:12.603 --> 05:15.272
...a wine-tasting on skid row.

05:17.859 --> 05:22.070
Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues,
we could start with something simpler.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.323
Why don't you take her to Disneyland?

05:24.490 --> 05:27.826
You go on Space Mountain,
you're in the dark, she's holding onto you.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.078
That ride is shorter than you think...

05:30.246 --> 05:34.249
...and they take a picture of you at the end,
so make sure you got your clothes on.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.670
It's a joke.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.590
Based on real events.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.633
Disneyland? I don't know.

05:43.801 --> 05:46.803
With all the crowds
and the weird characters walking around...

05:46.971 --> 05:48.930
...just reminds me too much of India.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.268
I haven't been since I was a kid.
We should go one weekend.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.686
Weekends are too crowded.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.689
-So blow off work, go on a weekday.
-Hooky?

05:57.857 --> 06:00.025
I've never played hooky in my life.

06:00.193 --> 06:04.196
My mom said that's how girls end up
addicted to reefer and jazz music.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.784
More like how girls end up
at a Best Western hotel...

06:08.951 --> 06:11.661
...with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.750
-Joke?
-I can laugh about it now.

06:20.171 --> 06:23.256
What do you say? This Friday
we ditch work and go to Disneyland?

06:23.424 --> 06:25.634
-I'm in.
-Me too.

06:25.802 --> 06:29.262
Excuse me, l thought we were
trying to solve my problem.

06:29.430 --> 06:30.806
Oh, yeah, right.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.141
Wait, what was your problem again?

06:33.351 --> 06:37.562
I'm a man who can't talk to women, trying
to figure out how to go on a romantic date...

06:37.730 --> 06:43.026
...with a girl who suffers from social
anxiety, she can't be around other people.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.654
Yeah, that's a toughie.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.074
Let's think.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.750
Are we doing just Disney
or California Adventure too?

07:01.671 --> 07:05.882
It's nice of your old school to let us try out
our science talk on some female students.

07:06.050 --> 07:09.094
They were actually pretty excited.
I'm their most famous alum.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.556
If you don't count the serial killer
who ate all those prostitutes.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.270
This must feel good for you, coming
back to your alma mater as an astronaut.

07:18.438 --> 07:22.858
Yeah. Last time I was here
I was just a scrawny little nerd.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.111
And now you're also an astronaut.

07:27.071 --> 07:30.449
So many memories.
How many times in these hallways...

07:30.616 --> 07:34.411
...was I tripped, punched and spit on? Heh.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.913
Oh, look, here's my old locker.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.416
I have a masters in engineering...

07:39.584 --> 07:45.088
...I still can't figure out how Scott Kapinski
got me and my briefcase to fit in there.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.970
-Hey.
-What?

07:52.138 --> 07:53.722
Nothing.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.727
Smart, we don't want any problems.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.398
I can't believe I ditched work
for Disneyland.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.900
What did you tell your boss?

08:05.067 --> 08:07.194
Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.988
At 7 last night I called
about a problem at the lab...

08:10.156 --> 08:12.991
...and casually mentioned
I was going out for seafood.

08:13.826 --> 08:17.871
At 9:30, l called and told him
that one of my scallops tasted weird.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.583
At 1 1 :30, I called and said
I was throwing up like a fire hose.

08:22.919 --> 08:27.255
At 12:45, I called and made nothing
but dry-heaving sounds.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.758
And now l'm going to Disneyland!

08:31.469 --> 08:32.969
Penny, what did you say?

08:33.137 --> 08:36.431
I work at the Cheesecake Factory.
I said, "Bye."

08:38.601 --> 08:40.101
So, what are we gonna do first?

08:40.269 --> 08:44.648
I don't know about you, but l'm going to the
place that gives you a princess makeover.

08:44.815 --> 08:45.857
Ooh, that sounds like fun.

08:46.025 --> 08:49.653
You're kidding, right? We're not just
gonna get drunk and go on rides?

08:50.905 --> 08:52.781
Come on, do it with us.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.242
Ah, all right, whatever. How does it work?

08:55.409 --> 08:59.079
Okay, so you pick your princess,
Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.456
They give you hair, makeup, the works.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.668
I guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.

09:04.835 --> 09:06.962
-I want to be Cinderella too.
-Yeah.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.297
We can't all be Cinderella.

09:12.426 --> 09:13.677
Then how do we decide?

09:13.844 --> 09:18.014
Well, it's simple. This was my idea,
I'm driving, I'm Cinderella.

09:18.182 --> 09:21.518
You bitches got a problem with that,
we can stop the car right now.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.074
Excuse me.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.369
I'm meeting a girl here.
It's kind of a first date.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.955
In a library?

09:43.082 --> 09:48.169
She and l are both a little awkward in social
situations so this seemed like a good idea.

09:48.337 --> 09:52.048
Ah. People say I'm a little awkward too.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.010
May I join you?

09:56.220 --> 09:58.346
No, you can't join us.

09:58.514 --> 10:02.183
Go climb back up whatever beanstalk
you came down from.

Me too.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.779
Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

10:55.946 --> 11:00.992
I'm here with my friends, Dr. Cooper,
and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

11:01.160 --> 11:06.122
And we are going to show you girls
how cool a job in science can be.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.499
How cool, you ask?

11:07.667 --> 11:10.669
Well, how about negative 273 degrees...

11:10.836 --> 11:14.923
...because that's the temperature at which
entropy reaches its minimum value.

11:17.927 --> 11:22.305
Did l just learn something new
and have fun doing it? What?

11:25.226 --> 11:27.352

Hello, female children.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.203
Allow me to inspire you...

11:45.371 --> 11:48.873

a great female scientist.

11:49.041 --> 11:52.669
Polish-born, French-educated...

11:52.837 --> 11:53.878
...Madame Curie.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.756
Co-discoverer of radioactivity...

11:56.966 --> 12:01.594
...she was a hero of science.
Until her hair fell out...

12:01.762 --> 12:04.848
...her vomit and stool
became filled with blood...

12:05.975 --> 12:09.227
...and she was poisoned to death
by her own discovery.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.148
With a little hard work...

12:13.315 --> 12:16.901
...I see no reason
why that can't happen to any of you.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.490
Are we done? Can we go?

12:27.621 --> 12:31.583
The thing to remember is
you can go to outer space too.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.710
Heh. I mean, look at me.

12:33.878 --> 12:38.256

Mm-hm.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.346

12:45.514 --> 12:49.476
No, but l did go
to the International Space Station.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.019
Did you fly the rocket?

12:52.021 --> 12:55.315
No, but l was in the rocket.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.650
-I didn't actually--
-So you just flew around?

12:57.818 --> 13:00.320
That's kind of like my uncle.
A flight attendant.

13:05.034 --> 13:09.037
No, heh, l'm an American hero,
your uncle brings people nuts, okay?

13:09.205 --> 13:10.830

14:37.918 --> 14:40.295
RAJESH:
That's a fitting pun-ishment.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.761
I still don't know what you do for a living.

14:50.764 --> 14:51.848
LUCY:
Web design.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.645
RAJESH:
Anything l might've seen?

14:59.648 --> 15:03.318
LUCY: l don't know.
You ever look at porn websites?

15:13.871 --> 15:17.081
RAJESH:
No. Never. What is porn?

15:21.587 --> 15:23.087
LUCY:
Sorry, auto-correct.

15:23.255 --> 15:26.507
That was supposed to say "prom websites."

15:31.347 --> 15:33.848
RAJESH:
Ooh, fun. l love prom.

15:34.016 --> 15:37.727
The romance, the gowns,
it's like a fairy tale come to life.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.570
Sorry, auto-correct.

15:47.738 --> 15:50.949
That was supposed to say "I like sports."

15:54.370 --> 15:57.288
I never wanted to play the cello.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.376
How do you meet girls playing the cello?

16:01.543 --> 16:04.754
"Hey, wanna come over to my house
and hear me play an instrument...

16:04.922 --> 16:07.215
...that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?"

16:08.509 --> 16:11.636
Quick, pull the fire alarm,
let's get out of here.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.263
Uh, hello again. Um....

16:14.431 --> 16:17.475
Yeah, l don't know if women in general...

16:17.643 --> 16:21.312
...have been actively discouraged
from pursuing the sciences...

16:21.480 --> 16:25.733
...but it's clear you young women
here today have been.

16:30.155 --> 16:33.199
While l was listening to my colleagues
waste your time...

16:33.367 --> 16:36.911
...it occurred to me that it might be
much more meaningful...

16:37.079 --> 16:41.541
...to hear about women in science
from actual women in science.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.752
And, uh, l happen to know
two brilliant examples...

16:44.920 --> 16:48.089
...who have agreed to speak to you
on the phone right now.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.384
Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler?
Are you there?

16:51.552 --> 16:53.052
AMY [OVER PHONE]:
We're here.

16:53.262 --> 16:58.933
Thank you for taking time out of your busy
schedule to enlighten these young women.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.768
It's our pleasure.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.900
I'm Dr. Fowler, and I'm a neuroscientist.

17:08.068 --> 17:12.196
And I'm Dr. Rostenkowski-Wolowitz,
and I'm a microbiologist.

17:12.364 --> 17:15.700
The world of science needs more women,
but from a young age...

17:15.868 --> 17:19.662
...we girls are encouraged to care
more about the way we look...

17:19.830 --> 17:22.165
...than about the power of our minds.

17:24.835 --> 17:29.338
That's true. Every one of you has
the capacity to be anything you want to be.

17:29.506 --> 17:31.883
Unless you wanna be Cinderella.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.636
Come at me, see what happens.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.100
RAJESH:
This was really fun.

17:44.104 --> 17:47.940
My battery's dying, so I'm just gonna talk.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.692
Thanks for today.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.445
I've been trying to do more things
that scare me.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.573
And coming here
was definitely one of them.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.159
But it was also really nice.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.579
So thanks, and, um, l'm gonna go.

18:06.585 --> 18:12.423
Maybe I could do one more scary thing
before I go and give you a kiss goodbye?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.635
You know, if that's okay.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.388
Oh, okay.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.140
Okay.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.853
Panic attack! Maybe next time.

18:29.858 --> 18:32.151
I'm counting that as foreplay.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.828
Bernie, I'm home.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.746
You have fun today?

18:44.164 --> 18:46.999
BERNADETTE:
Yes. And l have a surprise for you.

18:47.501 --> 18:50.545
Please be Cinderella, please be Cinderella.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.881
Well, hello, Prince Charming.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.012
Milady.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.899
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

19:12.067 --> 19:14.193
Hey, how was your--? What?

19:15.737 --> 19:20.616
I can explain. I played hooky with the girls
and we all went to Disneyland and go--

19:20.784 --> 19:23.995
-What are you doing?
-Disneyland, go on, I'm listening.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.500
Sheldon.

19:29.835 --> 19:33.838
All Snow White needs
is one little kiss to wake up.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.466
Heard you the first time.
