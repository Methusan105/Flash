00:03.461 --> 00:06.255
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

00:06.423 --> 00:10.259
Welcome to
Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun With Flags.

00:11.845 --> 00:12.928
Before we get started...

00:13.096 --> 00:16.765
...I'd like to announce the winner of our
"design your own flag" competition...

00:16.933 --> 00:18.600
...but l can't.

00:18.768 --> 00:24.648
The only entry was from GameyGamer75,
I know that was a JPEG of your buttocks.

00:25.483 --> 00:28.277
Now, this week,
we have a very special episode...

00:28.445 --> 00:32.948
...where we explore the flags of the popular
entertainment franchise Star Trek.

00:33.116 --> 00:37.077
And to help me, l'm pleased to introduce
Internet personality...

00:37.245 --> 00:39.997
...former star of
Star Trek: The Next Generation...

00:40.165 --> 00:45.502
...and the only guy I know lucky enough
to be immortalized in one-sixteenth scale.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.005
Set phasers to "fun"...

00:50.759 --> 00:53.135
...for my friend Wil Wheaton.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.723
-Hi, thanks for having me. Happy to be here.
AMY: Cut.

00:59.517 --> 01:02.978
-What's wrong?
-Sorry, you were brilliant as always.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.397
Wil, that was a little wooden.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.151
-Wooden?
-Don't worry, it wasn't terrible.

01:09.319 --> 01:13.030
Just this time,
try to say it the way people sound.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.533
And action.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.994
My friend Wil Wheaton.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.497
Hi, thanks for having me.
I'm excited to be here.

01:21.664 --> 01:26.043
-So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
-Well, this is an exciting one.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.670
This is the flag
of the United Federation of Planets.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.632
-Now, what's interesting about this flag--
AMY: Cut.

01:32.634 --> 01:36.553
-What was wrong with that?
-It's called Fun With Flags.

01:36.721 --> 01:40.432
They're not at half-mast. Nobody died.
Let's try and keep it upbeat.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.978
Um, no offense,
but l've been acting since I was a kid.

01:45.146 --> 01:47.564
I can handle a web show
without a lot of direction.

01:47.732 --> 01:48.774
SHELDON:
It's true.

01:49.025 --> 01:53.028
In 1 982 Wil played the voice
of Martin the mouse in The Secret ofNIMH.

01:53.571 --> 01:54.947
You moved me.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.407
You'll have to forgive me.

01:57.575 --> 02:00.744
This is my first time directing.
I just want it to be good.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.204
-So do l.
AMY: Great.

02:02.372 --> 02:05.749
So this time, let's try more real boy,
less Pinocchio.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.878
-And action.
-And cut.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.257
You realize I'm doing this for free, right?

02:13.466 --> 02:17.094
Yes, and so far,
we're still not getting our money's worth.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.598
Let's try it again.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.892
Everybody's having fun.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.061
And action.

02:26.229 --> 02:27.896
So, Wil...

02:35.780 --> 02:38.365
...what do you have for us first?

02:38.533 --> 02:41.785
Well, this is an exciting one.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.622
This is the flag
of the United Federation of Planets.

02:45.790 --> 02:46.915
Cut.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.668
Problem, first-time director?

02:50.545 --> 02:51.712
None that I could see.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.423
I saw a man who loved flags
almost as much as l do.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.925
I got goose bumps.

02:57.093 --> 03:00.262
-He was overacting on purpose.
-Really?

03:00.430 --> 03:03.223
Oh, he reminded me
of a young William Shatner.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.143
I'm really happy to do this for you...

03:06.311 --> 03:09.771
...but not if she's gonna be a huge
pain in the ass the whole time.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.900
Are you gonna let him speak to me
like that?

03:13.067 --> 03:14.735
Well...

03:16.362 --> 03:19.364
...you're my girlfriend,
and I don't want you to be upset.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.452
Then again, Wil Wheaton's my friend,
and I don't want him to be upset.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.412
Hmm....

03:25.580 --> 03:26.955
This is a sticky wicket.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.042
What do you think?

03:31.044 --> 03:33.003
Can l speak to you for a second?

03:33.171 --> 03:34.922
I'll be right back.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.965
Feel free to play with yourself.

03:43.973 --> 03:46.934
I don't care for your friend,
and he's being rude to me.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.435
You need to ask him to leave.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.396
Amy, l can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.232
He's a minor celebrity.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.611
Once you explain who he is,
many people recognize him.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.072
Fine, then maybe l should go.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.407
Could you? That would solve everything.

04:04.702 --> 04:08.121
You are the best.
I'll see you at dinner tonight?

04:08.289 --> 04:11.375
Sure you wouldn't rather have dinner
with your friend Wil Wheaton?

04:11.542 --> 04:13.627
Come to think of it, l would.

04:14.545 --> 04:17.005
You, little lady, are on fire.

04:44.784 --> 04:48.120
Every time we eat here, your mom refuses
to let me help with the dishes.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.496
Don't take it personally.

04:49.664 --> 04:53.667
She likes doing them by herself so she can
lick the plates with no one looking.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.585
You ready to go?

04:55.753 --> 05:00.007
Yeah, let me just grab a couple
of fresh turtlenecks.

05:00.174 --> 05:03.760
I don't understand why you keep your stuff
here when there's room at home.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.178
What are you talking about?

05:05.430 --> 05:09.558
All l have here is a few sweaters,
books, bank stuff...

05:09.726 --> 05:13.103
...computers, mail, collectibles, medicine
and my electric body groomer.

05:14.897 --> 05:17.649
Ooh! There's my plaid dickey.

05:17.817 --> 05:22.654
Oh. Got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents.
Can you believe it? Heh.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.700
Fifty cents sounds right.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.787
-Let's go.
-You know, it's kind of late.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.957
-Why don't we spend the night here?
-Because we don't live here.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.667
-I know.
-Do you?

05:35.835 --> 05:37.711
You said when you got back from space...

05:37.879 --> 05:41.256
...you were gonna move into my apartment,
but half the time we stay here.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.883
That's not true.

05:43.134 --> 05:47.387
MRS. WOLOWlTZ: Howard, l'm doing laundry!
You want me to put anything in for you?!

05:47.555 --> 05:50.640
There's some underwear in the hamper!

05:51.100 --> 05:53.894
MRS. WOLOWlTZ:
Oh, good, I got that new stain stick to try out!

05:56.689 --> 06:00.275
Thank you.
I only put it on the list two weeks ago!

06:01.736 --> 06:03.528
Okay, I see what you're getting at.

06:04.822 --> 06:09.076
How about this weekend,
I'll box up all my things...

06:09.243 --> 06:11.661
...and move them to our place?

06:11.829 --> 06:13.163
Thank you.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.832
The lightsabers will look great
in the living room.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.877
Or in the closet. We can decide later.

06:20.004 --> 06:23.924
MRS. WOLOWlTZ: Howard, help!
My hand's stuck in the garbage disposal!

06:24.175 --> 06:28.095
Just let go of whatever piece of food
you're holding!

06:28.763 --> 06:33.058
MRS. WOLOWlTZ: Are you kidding?!
It's a perfectly good chicken leg!

06:35.520 --> 06:38.438
Hey, look who's out after dark
like a big boy.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.317
I was out raising heck
with Mr. Wil Wheaton.

06:42.485 --> 06:46.321
Four hours more and we would have
closed down the HomeTown Buffet.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.282
-I thought you had plans with Amy.
-Yeah, l did.

06:49.450 --> 06:52.786
But then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.998
She got huffy and left,
and then Wil and l headed out to dinner.

06:57.166 --> 07:01.044
That place really did remind me
of my hometown.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.713
Because there we also have
a HomeTown Buffet.

07:06.134 --> 07:10.303
-Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?
-Yes, quite the kerfuffle.

07:10.471 --> 07:14.266
-Then Amy got mad and left?
-Walked right out the door.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.976
And you...?

07:16.144 --> 07:18.812
Enjoyed a delightful dinner
at a reasonable price.

07:20.064 --> 07:24.651
The manager recognized Wil and let us sit
right next to the frozen-yogurt machine.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.111
Right next to it.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.656
I was closer to it than l am to you right now.

07:31.993 --> 07:35.620
-Buddy, l think Amy might be upset.
-Why's that?

07:35.788 --> 07:39.332
Because your friend was rude to her
and then you went to dinner with him.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.502
You're just repeating what I said.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.547
It's like living
with a lactose-intolerant parrot.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.634
Trust me. Call her.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.428
Fine.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.805
It's a shame you didn't go
to dinner with us...

07:53.973 --> 07:57.142
...because the buffet you're about to enjoy
only serves humble pie...

07:57.310 --> 07:59.936
...a dessert much less tasty
than frozen yogurt.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.354
I was this close.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.693
What?

08:07.612 --> 08:08.695
You'll appreciate this.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.531
Leonard has some ridiculous notion
that you're mad at me.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.701
Tell him you're not mad at me.
Go ahead, set him straight.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.369
I'm mad at you, Sheldon.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.788
Hmm....

08:18.956 --> 08:20.624
Eat one of your Luna Bars.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.962
Very often, when women think
they're angry, they're really just hungry.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.007
I'm not hungry.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.219
Your friend insulted me
and you didn't do anything.

08:32.386 --> 08:36.056
Precisely. l didn't do anything.

08:37.141 --> 08:40.018
Now, does someone feel like checking
her emotional math?

08:40.728 --> 08:43.230
Keep going, buddy. You're doing great.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.067
Sheldon, I'm your girlfriend
and you should have taken my side.

08:47.235 --> 08:50.695
That's it. End of story. Good night.

08:51.948 --> 08:56.910
Wow, Amy's mad and Leonard was right.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.079
What a weird day.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.084
Hey, sorry this took so long.
But you used to work here.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.920
-You know how it is.
-Kitchen slammed again?

09:07.088 --> 09:09.256
No, I'm a terrible waitress, remember?

09:11.092 --> 09:13.343
So anything l can do
to help you move tomorrow?

09:13.511 --> 09:17.764
Now that you mention it,
I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.

09:18.307 --> 09:20.934
-What's your excuse this time?
-No excuse.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.727
It's just, you know, l'm Jewish...

09:22.895 --> 09:26.773
...and technically, we're not supposed
to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath...

09:26.941 --> 09:28.775
...so this one's on God.

09:29.860 --> 09:34.114
That might be more convincing if you didn't
have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.576
My religion's kind of loosey-goosey,
you know.

09:37.743 --> 09:41.997
As long as you got your schmeckel
clipped and don't wear a cross, you're good.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.375
Howie, you promised you'd move.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.919
-And I will.
-Yeah, right.

09:48.087 --> 09:53.133
I'm not going to live in my mother's house
for the rest of my life. l'm not a child.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.802
I've seen her burp you.

09:58.806 --> 09:59.889
She did not burp me.

10:00.057 --> 10:03.268
She was patting me on the back
and I happened to burp.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.148
Don't you have other tables
you should be waiting on?

10:08.316 --> 10:10.734
Yeah, but l told you, I'm not good at my job.

10:11.444 --> 10:15.447
-Listen to me. He is never gonna leave.
-I'm starting to think you're right.

10:15.615 --> 10:19.659
All right, I've had enough of this.
I'm a grown man. l have a successful career.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.162
I mean, for the love of God,
I've been to space.

10:22.413 --> 10:26.166
I will move out when l'm ready, and l don't
need anyone badgering me into it.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.336
Wow. Excuse me.

10:30.796 --> 10:34.674
That was just for her benefit. l'll move
tomorrow. l love you. Don't leave me.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.680
Amy?

10:40.848 --> 10:42.265
Amy.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.559
Angry Amy?

10:46.520 --> 10:47.604
What?

10:48.105 --> 10:54.194
I've been thinking about what happened,
and I hope this gift will make things better.

10:56.697 --> 10:59.199
Star Trek DVDs?

10:59.367 --> 11:00.700
Why would l want this?

11:01.369 --> 11:02.702
First of all, you're welcome.

11:04.038 --> 11:07.290
Furthermore, not being familiar
with Wil Wheaton's body of work...

11:07.458 --> 11:11.503
...there was no way for you to know
you were being rude to a national treasure.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.340
Get ready for 1 30 hours of "I told you so."

11:20.388 --> 11:22.764
Fine, l'll just tell you what happens.

11:23.474 --> 11:26.601
Episode one, "Encounter at Farpoint."

11:26.769 --> 11:27.852
Fade in.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.480
The new Enterprise heads out
on its maiden voyage...

11:30.648 --> 11:33.108
...to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV.

11:33.275 --> 11:36.736
Enter Wesley Crusher,
played by my buddy--

11:40.991 --> 11:42.742
She's hooked.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.879
Wow, an end of an era.

11:55.548 --> 11:59.092
Boy, if these walls could talk.

12:00.177 --> 12:03.304
They'd say,
"Why does he touch himself so much?"

12:08.602 --> 12:09.686
Yeah.

12:12.106 --> 12:15.400
I can't believe
I'm not gonna live here anymore.

12:15.651 --> 12:18.903
This has always been my bedroom.

12:19.071 --> 12:22.657
Right here is where my mom
used to mark my height.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.409
Oh, yeah.

12:24.577 --> 12:30.915
"Fifth grade, sixth grade,
seventh grade, eighth grade, ninth grade."

12:32.084 --> 12:35.253
Yeah, l remember when I was 5...

12:35.421 --> 12:38.757
...hiding under this desk
with all my Halloween candy.

12:39.341 --> 12:41.551
Had some Peanut M&M's...

12:41.719 --> 12:46.848
...went into my first anaphylactic shock,
had to be rushed to the hospital...

12:47.016 --> 12:50.769
...came home, celebrated with a Snickers,
went into my second anaphylactic shock.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.190
When did you figure out
you're allergic to nuts?

12:55.357 --> 12:57.192
Sometime around the third Almond Joy.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.863
Okay, wanna start loading this stuff
into the truck?

13:02.031 --> 13:03.907
Yeah, l guess.

13:04.074 --> 13:06.576
Hey, would you do me a favor?
Go on ahead.

13:06.744 --> 13:11.623
I just want one last moment alone
in my old room.

13:11.791 --> 13:15.710
We're not standing outside by the U-Haul
while you fondle yourself.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.253
[SCOFFS]

13:18.589 --> 13:19.672
Fine, let's go.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.224
Hey, what brings you in?

13:29.391 --> 13:34.562
Penny, if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to have a conversation about girls.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.651
Had a feeling we'd have a talk like this
sooner or later.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.571
Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?

13:43.739 --> 13:47.700
Penny, please, I'm on the horns
of a relationship dilemma.

13:47.868 --> 13:51.704
And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair
by the time l was 1 9.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.874
And for the record:

13:55.042 --> 13:56.501
[MlMlCS VOMlTlNG]

13:57.878 --> 14:00.797
-So, what are you drinking?
-Well, it's been a rough day.

14:00.965 --> 14:04.175
I usually go chamomile tea,
but l don't think that's gonna cut it.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.595
You could have a Long Island iced tea.

14:10.808 --> 14:13.142
Will that calm my nerves?

14:13.853 --> 14:17.230
It's calmed the pants off me a couple times.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.775
-Sold.
-Oh.

14:21.235 --> 14:25.196
So the heart you got from the wizard
giving you trouble?

14:25.364 --> 14:28.491
The trouble isn't with me, Penny,
it's with your gender.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.326
Someday scientists will discover...

14:30.494 --> 14:34.747
...that second X chromosome contains
nothing but nonsense and twaddle.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.041
Yeah, Amy told me what happened.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.753
Look, just apologize. It'll warm her twaddle.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.172
That's a Band-Aid at best.

14:43.340 --> 14:46.801
The core problem is that Amy and Wil
do not like each other...

14:46.969 --> 14:50.388
...which is baffling
because they're both crazy about me.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.184
And I like them, which indicates
they're bright and interesting...

14:55.352 --> 14:57.729
...and/or were on Star Trek.

14:58.647 --> 15:00.773
Honey, you can't make people
like each other.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.319
Not true. Leonard made me like you.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.654
Let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe.

15:08.198 --> 15:10.116
Cheers, pal.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.745
Ooh!

15:14.163 --> 15:17.165
Boy, that is a treat that's hard to beat.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.836
Get the Mad Hatter on the horn.
I'm having a tea party.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.052
You might wanna pace yourself.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.222
I drink tea all the time.
I think I know what l'm doing.

15:34.308 --> 15:37.435
Far be it for me
to criticize a man with a full pubis.

15:40.147 --> 15:44.525
Look, your problem is not Wil Wheaton.
Your problem is the way you treated Amy.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.111
Problem is l'm out of tea.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.699
Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend,
you just let him do it?

15:51.867 --> 15:54.535
Thought you Texas guys stood up
for your womenfolk.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.371
Oh, Penny, please.

15:56.538 --> 15:59.624
Think I've evolved
beyond my simple rustic upbringing.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.875
Sorry.

16:01.043 --> 16:05.004
On the other hand, that low-down polecat
done wronged my woman.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.885
Welcome to Long Island, Tex.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.930
Amy deserves better.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.474
You know,
when we buy the Planters Deluxe Mix...

16:16.642 --> 16:19.936
...she eats all the Brazil nuts
so I don't have to look at them.

16:21.563 --> 16:24.440
She's a unique blend of saint and squirrel.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.819
Yup, that she is. Here you go.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.531
I'm a callous egomaniac.
She's gonna leave me.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.742
-No, she won't.
-No, she won't. l'm great.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.627
Ah!

16:46.088 --> 16:51.259
Okay, I have now officially moved out
of my mother's house.

16:51.427 --> 16:55.013
You are now the only woman in my life
who l'll see naked in the bathroom.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.641
I know this wasn't easy. You doing okay?

16:58.809 --> 17:02.103
Well, I'm fine. It's just her l'm worried about.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.815
-She'll be okay. She's a grown woman.
-I know.

17:05.983 --> 17:11.070
It's just ever since my dad left,
I've felt responsible for her.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.197
That's a lot for a kid to deal with.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.117
She was just so sad all the time.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.287
I was the only person
who could cheer her up.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.706
Well, me and Ben and Jerry.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.168
She's lucky you were there.

17:27.087 --> 17:30.298
You know, she's why l first got into magic.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.133
I would do little shows for her.

17:32.301 --> 17:37.472
Hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain,
put on a top hat and cape.

17:37.639 --> 17:43.144
And partway through the act, I would say
I needed a volunteer from the audience...

17:43.312 --> 17:49.317
...to be my beautiful assistant
and invite her up on-stage.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.987
I can still remember the way she'd smile.

17:53.572 --> 17:58.201
For a few minutes,
she'd forget how lonely she was.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.372
Aw, crap. Let's go.

18:04.541 --> 18:05.833
Where are we going?

18:06.001 --> 18:08.544
Grab a box.
We'll sleep at your mother's place tonight.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.421
No, but l want to live here.

18:10.589 --> 18:14.675
Well, you should've thought of that before
you told me the stupid magic-trick story.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.220
Can't we talk about this?

18:17.387 --> 18:21.474
No husband of mine
is gonna break his mother's heart.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.029
Wait, how many was that?

18:37.825 --> 18:42.078
-Hey, Sheldon, what's up?
-Wouldn't you like to know.

18:43.372 --> 18:46.582
-Have you been drinking?
-Just tea.

18:47.501 --> 18:50.294
It was the best tea I've ever had.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.047
Why are you here?

18:53.715 --> 18:55.174
I'll tell you.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.552
I'm from Texas.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.513
Need l say more?

19:01.640 --> 19:04.308
Yeah, actually,
a little more would be helpful.

19:04.476 --> 19:09.063
You insulted my woman.
I'm here to defend her honor.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.648
Two. lt was two.

19:15.904 --> 19:19.657
Now prepare yourself for what may come.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.954
Oh, Sheldon,
do you really think we're gonna fight?

19:25.122 --> 19:29.292
My fists are not up here
because l'm milking a giant invisible cow.

19:31.211 --> 19:34.255
They're up to beat an apology out of you.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.465
Okay, I'm sorry.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.136
Well, that was a long bus ride
for not very much.

19:41.638 --> 19:42.722
Are you okay?

19:42.890 --> 19:45.516
You're asking a lot of questions,
Wil Wheaton.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.393
As a matter of idle curiosity...

19:47.561 --> 19:52.273
...which of your shrubberies do you feel
would benefit from a thorough vomiting?

19:52.774 --> 19:54.775
Never mind, l'll choose.

...where we explore the flags of the popular
entertainment franchise Star Trek.

And to help us,
I'm pleased to introduce a special guest.

the promise of free food to get him here.

-Cut.

but l'm obligated to agree with her.

-She's my girlfriend.
-Ah. l hear you, brother.
