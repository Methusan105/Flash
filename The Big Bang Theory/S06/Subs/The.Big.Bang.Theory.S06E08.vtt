00:04.754 --> 00:06.213
What are you drawing over there?

00:06.381 --> 00:10.592
A hypothetical containment field
for a Frisbee-sized wormhole...

00:10.760 --> 00:13.429
...that could serve as a portal
to a parallel universe.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.849
Oh, you silly doodlebug.

00:18.226 --> 00:21.270
A lot of scientists believe
making contact with other life-forms...

00:21.438 --> 00:23.605
...would probably not end well for us.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.691
It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.110
You could block it with a Frisbee.
Calm down.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.782
Do you expect me to build this? Heh.

00:33.950 --> 00:37.202
I expect you to wipe the pudding
off your chin. Gentlemen.

00:39.122 --> 00:43.125
Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon
always disappears every day at 2:45?

00:43.334 --> 00:45.586
-Really?
-He probably just goes to the bathroom.

00:45.754 --> 00:48.547
Actually, no. He goes at 8 a.m.
with optional follow-ups...

00:48.715 --> 00:52.634
...at 1 :45 and 7:1 0 on high-fiber Fridays.

00:53.803 --> 00:55.429
It's sad that you know that.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.474
Oh....
That's just the tip of the sadness iceberg.

01:00.643 --> 01:02.644
I'm looking at his public calendar.

01:02.812 --> 01:05.731
Two-forty-five to 3:05, nothing.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.150
Yesterday, 2:45 to 3:05, nothing.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.944
Last week, nothing. Last month, nothing.

01:11.112 --> 01:13.655
He never has anything booked
during that time.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.658
Twenty minutes a day
completely unaccounted for.

01:16.868 --> 01:20.496
-We should figure out where he goes.
-Ooh, this is exciting.

01:21.664 --> 01:24.500
Like one of my classic
murder-mystery dinner parties.

01:24.667 --> 01:29.838
Right, the case of who murdered
three Saturday nights of my life.

01:30.006 --> 01:33.300
Colonel Koothrappali in the kitchen
with the olive spread.

01:34.844 --> 01:37.888
It was tapenade and you guys suck.

02:04.791 --> 02:05.916
So how was work today?

02:06.084 --> 02:09.461
Well, I spent most of the afternoon
growing isotopically pure crystals...

02:09.629 --> 02:11.630
...for neutrino detection.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.425
That sounds like fun.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.263
-Yeah, it was.
-Oh, good, I guessed right.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.140
[PHONE BEEPS]

02:21.307 --> 02:24.017
-Who you talking to?
-Oh, just this guy l met at school.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.937
Oh, great. We're still dating, right?

02:28.106 --> 02:32.151
Relax, he's just a friend. We're doing
an oral report together. He's really nice.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.654
I'm sorry, what was that?
I had a little stroke after "oral."

02:36.531 --> 02:37.906
Would you stop?

02:38.074 --> 02:39.116
[PHONE BEEPS]

02:39.325 --> 02:41.660
He moved here from London.
He doesn't know anybody.

02:41.828 --> 02:45.664
Oh, good, an English accent,
the sexiest accent you can have.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.374
No, that's not true.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.377
There's French, there's Italian.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.838
No, you're right, it's the best.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.341
-Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
-It didn't come up.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.051
Maybe you should tell him.

02:58.219 --> 02:59.845
What am I supposed to say?

03:00.013 --> 03:02.514
Say, "Can't talk right now.
Hanging with my boyfriend.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.475
England sucks, you suck,
U.S.A. number one."

03:08.813 --> 03:13.650
Fine. "Hanging with my boyfriend.
Talk to you later."

03:13.818 --> 03:15.277
-Happy?
-Yes. Thank you.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.528

Mm-hm.

[PHONE BEEPS]

03:18.698 --> 03:20.282
Huh.

03:22.952 --> 03:25.204
-What did he say?
-Nothing.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.455
What?

03:27.081 --> 03:29.458
"Did your boyfriend make you type that?"

03:37.592 --> 03:38.675
I hate this guy.

03:41.888 --> 03:45.307
-Don't be like that.
-Oh, come on. Trust me, he's hitting on you.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.101
He's not, we're just friends.
Is this gonna be a problem?

03:48.269 --> 03:50.562
He's supposed to come over
tomorrow to work.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.897
Really? Here?

03:52.065 --> 03:55.901
If it makes you uncomfortable, l'll switch
partners even though the thing's due...

03:56.069 --> 04:00.030
...and everyone already has a partner
and I'll probably end up failing the class.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.490
That'd be great. Thank you.

04:06.704 --> 04:08.413
Two forty-four. Right on schedule.

04:08.581 --> 04:09.915
Hey, Sheldon.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.875
Oh, hello.

04:12.043 --> 04:16.213
Raj and l are heading over to the genetics lab
to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.049
-Wanna come with us?
-No, thank you.

04:19.217 --> 04:24.096
You sure? They turn off the lights and it's
like a little laser show that poops all over.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.556
I'm quite sure. Good day.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.725
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

04:28.977 --> 04:30.602
-We told you.
-Yeah, l just told you.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.772
-No, you didn't.
-Your word against mine. See you in court.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.861
-Should we follow him?
-I don't know. I'm torn.

04:40.029 --> 04:43.615
I want to know where he's going but
now l kind of want to play with the bunny.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.452
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Alex.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.621
-Do you know where your boss just went?
-No.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.332
-Don't you know his schedule?
-All l know is corduroy...

04:52.542 --> 04:55.419
...makes too much noise
and I have to go find quieter pants.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.258
Come on.

05:01.426 --> 05:05.971
Boy, what l wouldn't give
to get her out of those pants.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.099
And into something a little more stylish.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.324
This is where he goes?

05:25.491 --> 05:28.118
-What's in there?
-I think it's an old storage room.

05:28.703 --> 05:32.664
What could he be doing in there every day
for 20 minutes?

05:32.832 --> 05:34.541
Well, he's not doing 20-minute abs...

05:34.709 --> 05:37.502
...because if he were,
he'd have way better abs.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.343
-Can you hear anything?
-Not yet.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.815
What are you doing?

05:58.983 --> 06:01.193
I'm listening.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.404
Can't you face the other way and listen?

06:04.614 --> 06:07.532
I can't do anything right for you, can l?

06:08.201 --> 06:09.701
What the hell is he up to?

06:10.703 --> 06:12.329
He is kind of a weirdo.

06:12.497 --> 06:15.665
Maybe he's got Leonard Nimoy
chained up in there.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.627
Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.381
Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?

06:23.257 --> 06:27.844
Howard, you can't treat the man differently
just because he's disabled. That's not okay.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.559
If you're wondering why l've been staring...

06:34.727 --> 06:37.896
...I'm trying to get a look at this guy
who's coming over to Penny's.

06:38.439 --> 06:41.024
To be honest, I didn't know you were here.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.695
It's not a big deal.
He's just in her history class.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.573
They're working on a project.
I don't even know why l care.

06:48.741 --> 06:52.244
-You know what, I don't care.
-You think you don't care.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.873
This is silly. l have nothing to worry about.

06:57.041 --> 06:59.251
Oh, I don't know.

07:00.586 --> 07:04.381
Hey, statistically speaking, l'm sure
you have something to worry about.

07:05.591 --> 07:06.633
What do you mean?

07:06.801 --> 07:10.887
Well, if we assume
that your looks are average...

07:11.055 --> 07:14.724
...right off the bat, 50 percent of men on
Earth are more attractive than you.

07:17.186 --> 07:22.816
That's 1 .5 billion handsome lads
standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.112
Well, yeah, but this isn't just about looks.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.157
I'm way above average
in a lot of other things.

07:30.324 --> 07:35.787
Not height, vision, athleticism,
or ability to digest dairy products.

07:36.789 --> 07:40.459
I'm talking about important things
like emotional maturity.

07:40.626 --> 07:44.337
You were just spying on your girlfriend
through a peephole.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.508
I liked it better
when you thought l wasn't here.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.428
I'm not saying
you don't have attractive qualities.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.139
Your choice of friends is impeccable.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.765
You're a good sleeper.

07:56.934 --> 08:01.313
And last but not least,
you buy the grapes I like.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.484
You're a real catch compared
to some snoring guy...

08:05.651 --> 08:08.528
...with a fridge full of lousy grapes.

08:09.780 --> 08:10.822
None of this matters.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.618
I trust that Penny cares about me
and nothing's gonna happen with this guy.

08:14.785 --> 08:17.954
Unless of course he's a skilled hypnotist.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.665
What?

08:21.292 --> 08:24.002
While unlikely,
it's still a statistical possibility.

08:24.170 --> 08:29.257
She might be performing sexual acts
with him and not even know it.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.720
-Now you're just being ridiculous.
-Am l?

08:33.888 --> 08:36.681
The mind's a mysterious thing, Leonard.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.808
He could be having the time of his life...

08:38.976 --> 08:41.686
...while she thinks she's a chicken
pecking for corn.

08:52.782 --> 08:58.787
Look at us, sneaking around in the middle
of the night like a couple of cat burglars.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.164
I think we're more like ninjas.

09:01.332 --> 09:04.376
I don't wanna be a ninja.
I wanna be a cat burglar.

09:05.211 --> 09:09.798
-Fine. l'll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.
-No, we both have to be the same thing.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.553
Okay, we're ninjas.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.055
Thank you.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.100
But next time we'll be cat burglars.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.232
-It's locked.
-Are you sure?

09:28.067 --> 09:29.734
Yes, l'm sure.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.404
Now, you stand guard, I'm--

09:35.741 --> 09:37.409
It's locked.

09:38.578 --> 09:42.289
Just keep an eye out.
I'll have this open in a minute.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.249
When did you learn how to pick locks?

09:44.417 --> 09:47.877
When I was starting to do magic
in junior high...

09:48.045 --> 09:51.298
...I thought l could be an escape artist
like Harry Houdini.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.258
-How did that work out?
-Pretty good.

09:53.426 --> 09:58.555
I managed to escape friends, popularity,
and every party thrown in a 1 2-mile radius.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.641
-There. Ready?
-Hold on, hold on.

10:01.851 --> 10:02.892
What?

10:03.060 --> 10:06.896
Sheldon is a very smart man, and
he obviously wants to keep this a secret.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.607
Yeah, so?

10:08.774 --> 10:11.610
What if it's booby-trapped?

10:11.944 --> 10:14.613
Don't worry, I'm one step ahead of him.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.157
Oh, great, what's your pl--?

10:22.288 --> 10:23.955
Are we good?

10:24.415 --> 10:25.457
Yeah.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.923
Huh.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.968
Forty-three.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.595
What the hell does that mean?

10:38.763 --> 10:40.263
I don't know.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.808
-The solution to an equation?
-Maybe.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.810
It's a prime number.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.855
Encryption systems are built
on prime numbers.

10:49.023 --> 10:52.525
What kind of secret
does Sheldon have to encrypt?

10:52.693 --> 10:57.322
He's always been very cagey about what
he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.370
It's paprika.

11:03.537 --> 11:04.829
Really?

11:04.997 --> 11:07.832
Well, okay, one mystery solved.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.505
COLE: Okay, good night.
PENNY: Thanks, Cole. See you at school.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.131
See you.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.802
I'll be right back.

11:18.969 --> 11:21.179
I thought you left a long time ago.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.691
What's up?

11:34.527 --> 11:36.486
Hey.

11:36.654 --> 11:39.364
You, uh, moving into the apartment
on the fifth floor?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.866
No. I was just visiting a friend.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.076
Oh, cool.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.745
-That cute blond on 4?
-Yeah. You know her?

11:45.955 --> 11:48.540
Oh, well, l see her around.

11:48.708 --> 11:53.712
I like to keep my distance
because her boyfriend's a pretty scary dude.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.756
-Really?
-Yeah.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.008
He's ganged up.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.178
She told me he's a scientist.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.473
That's the name of his gang.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.228
The Scientists.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.231
They are crazy.

12:14.024 --> 12:17.902
-Well, thanks for the tip.
-No problem, brother. Stay frosty.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.041
We're still dating, right?

12:42.636 --> 12:44.596
-Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.
-Oh, hey, Alex.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.223
And call me Leonard.
Dr. Hofstadter is my father.

12:47.391 --> 12:48.558
And my mother.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.936
And my sister.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.897
And our cat.

12:55.399 --> 13:00.111
Although, l'm pretty sure Dr. Boots
Hofstadter's degree was honorary.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.114
-May I join you, Leonard?
-Sure.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.657
Thanks.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.118
Hey, Alex, let me ask you something.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.915
My girlfriend knows this guy at school.
He's got an English accent--

13:12.082 --> 13:13.833
Ooh, I love English accents.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.419
Yeah, you all do.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.631
Anyway, I feel like he's hitting on her.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.425
She says he's just being nice
and I should trust her.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.427
It's probably harmless.

13:24.595 --> 13:28.056
You know how it is.
I'm sure you get hit on all the time.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.768
Right.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.939
Because girls are always like,
"Ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms...

13:36.106 --> 13:40.109
...and gets a lot of ear infections.
I gotta get me some of that."

13:41.654 --> 13:43.988
I don't know.
Bet it happens more than you realize.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.448
Trust me, it doesn't.

13:45.616 --> 13:46.950
You sure?

13:47.117 --> 13:48.827
You're cute, you're funny.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.830
Maybe you're getting hit on
and you don't even know it.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.625
Really?

13:55.793 --> 13:58.461
I'm pretty sure.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.424
[LAUGHlNG]

14:04.802 --> 14:08.179

that you love me.

16:56.473 --> 16:59.058
We're just supposed to pretend
it's not a big deal?

That's exactly what we're gonna do...

17:06.191 --> 17:09.736
