00:03.712 --> 00:05.504
Hey, will you steam my uniform next?

00:05.714 --> 00:08.507
Interesting.
Do you recall this conversation?

00:08.717 --> 00:11.051
"Leonard, wanna go halfsies
on a steamer?"

00:11.302 --> 00:13.887
"No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer."

00:15.348 --> 00:18.058
Looks like that rumpled
chicken's come home to roost.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.186
Hi. Here are the makeup
sponges you asked for.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.981
-Oh, thanks, l thought l had more.
-Hmm.

00:27.485 --> 00:30.320
Damn, you've got more makeup than I do.

00:30.530 --> 00:34.033
You've got better makeup than l do.
Yeah, l'm borrowing this.

00:34.242 --> 00:37.369
Hey, hey, hey,
this is my Comic-Con makeup.

00:37.579 --> 00:41.331
I love you, but there are some things
a man doesn't share with his girlfriend.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.709
That's a wise policy.

00:43.918 --> 00:46.670
I once borrowed my sister's makeup
for a costume contest...

00:46.880 --> 00:48.589
...got a terrible case of pink eye.

00:48.798 --> 00:52.217
Yeah, well, luckily, I was going
as a zombie, I won second place.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.220
You guys just went to Comic-Con.

00:55.430 --> 00:58.432
That was San Diego Comic-Con.
This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.351
-Is that better?
-Well, it's a lot smaller.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.811
It's about the comic books.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.939
The way these conventions used to be
before they went Hollywood.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.609
So to answer your question,
no, it's not better.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.278
Then why are you going?

01:11.821 --> 01:13.405
It's a comic book convention.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.532
Like pizza or particle accelerators...

01:15.742 --> 01:17.951
...even the stinky ones, still pretty good.

01:18.828 --> 01:21.371
Well, you guys have fun.
I guess l'll see you Sunday.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.749
-Yeah. Oh, hang on a second.
-Okay.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.793
Hold this.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.967
-What was that for?
-To show people when they don't believe me.

02:02.455 --> 02:06.041
This is the best. You have booze with
breakfast on Tuesday, you got a problem.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.627
You do it on the weekend,
you got brunch.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.754
Sheldon doesn't believe in brunch.

02:10.964 --> 02:15.551
Can't stand a table where one person's having
an omelet and another is having a sandwich.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.929
That's not exhausting at all.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.682
[PHONE BEEPS]

02:21.891 --> 02:22.933
Oh.

02:23.143 --> 02:27.563
It's Leonard. He says they're on the road
and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed.

02:28.064 --> 02:31.066
Maybe it's the mimosa,
but l'm gonna give the kid an LOL.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.361
Cute how excited they are.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.322
You should have seen Howard
sewing his costume all week.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.241
When did Howard learn to sew?

02:39.492 --> 02:43.537
When he was a little boy, every couple of
months he'd have to let his mom's pants out.

02:46.791 --> 02:49.168
I don't understand
why they go to these conventions.

02:49.377 --> 02:52.462
The four of them work at a major university,
they're all smart...

02:52.672 --> 02:55.048
...how can they be into something
for 12-year-olds?

02:55.258 --> 02:59.052
I don't mind it. l think Howie's
just in touch with his inner child.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.096
Although when he's in Batman pajamas...

03:01.347 --> 03:04.349
...sometimes it feels like
I'm touching his inner child.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.772
It's probably because they were bullied.
In a world where you can't fight back...

03:11.024 --> 03:13.025
...superheroes provide
meaningful wish-fulfillment.

03:13.234 --> 03:16.904
Hmm. Now l feel bad for picking on
all those kids.

03:17.113 --> 03:20.115
Although if Danny Biffle
didn't want to eat a mouthful of dirt...

03:20.366 --> 03:23.035
...he shouldn't have shown up
to school wearing a bow tie.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.538
I've never even read a comic book.
You guys?

03:26.748 --> 03:27.748
PENNY: Mm-mm.
-No.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.917
It's such an important part of their lives.

03:30.126 --> 03:33.045
-Maybe we should try reading some.
-Seriously?

03:34.005 --> 03:36.089
The comic book store isn't far from here.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.884
That is an amazing idea.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.136
Okay, how many of these have I had?

03:47.018 --> 03:49.436
I think you should turn on the GPS.

03:49.646 --> 03:50.729
It is on.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.357
But the turn-by-turn voice option isn't on.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.860
I know l'd feel more safe
if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.321
I love the turn-by-turn voice option.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.116
Has it really only been 1 0 miles?

04:04.077 --> 04:06.912

I'd put on my listening ears if l were you.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.638
-What did you do?
-I found a hack online.

04:24.847 --> 04:28.642
I was able to upload MP3 recordings
of my voice to your GPS.

04:28.851 --> 04:31.853

-Counterpoint, no, it's not.

-Really?
-Shh!

04:49.205 --> 04:52.958
Even-numbered routes run east and west.

04:53.459 --> 04:57.129
Odd-numbered routes run
north and south.

04:57.505 --> 05:02.968
Three-digit route numbers
indicate bypasses or spurs.

05:04.887 --> 05:08.015
Look, Leonard, there's a bridge.
Drive off it.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.601
You know, we're not that far
from Vasquez Rocks.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.855

Star Trek episodes out there.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.024
We got our costumes in the trunk...

05:17.233 --> 05:19.609
...we could go there
and have a little photo shoot.

a carbohydrate in two weeks.

Well, I recommend you don't
open a store and sell them.

like this stuff, so we thought we'd try it.

...stranded in an alien
and unforgiving environment.

13:43.197 --> 13:47.158
Relying only on our wits,
our fortitude and our moxie.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.619
As long as we have those things...

13:49.829 --> 13:51.621
-...nothing can stop us--
MAN: Nerds!

13:58.212 --> 13:59.629
I hate this planet.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.345
It says right here on the hammer:

14:07.555 --> 14:11.641
"Whoever holds this hammer, if he be
worthy, shall possess the power of Thor."

14:11.851 --> 14:14.644
Hold on. Who decides who's worthy?
Does the hammer decide?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.479
-Yes!
-No!

14:18.691 --> 14:22.026
-It can't decide, it's a hammer.
-You said it's a magic hammer!

14:22.236 --> 14:23.987
Yeah, but it can't make decisions.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.240
If Harry Potter's wand can make decisions,
why can't Thor's hammer?

14:27.491 --> 14:32.829
Okay, if you're gonna start comparing wands
and hammers, I can't even take you seriously.

14:50.764 --> 14:55.184
Hello.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.689
Four glasses of water, please.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.525
Anything for you guys?

15:03.944 --> 15:06.905
Can l use your phone?
Our car got stolen.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.073
Why don't you ask Scotty
to beam you up?

15:09.283 --> 15:11.159
[ALL LAUGHING]

15:12.578 --> 15:17.457
Scotty was on the original series
and we're Next Generation.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.752
So joke's on you.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.257
We're not with him.

15:30.804 --> 15:33.473
You can't pick something up
in outer space.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.183
In space, there is no up.

15:35.392 --> 15:38.478
Oh, yeah? Then how does
the sun come up every day?

15:40.481 --> 15:42.815
Hard to argue
with those kind of street smarts.

15:48.113 --> 15:51.449
Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics.
Why don't we go look at those?

15:51.659 --> 15:54.285
Oh, great. And then you will see,
I am not wrong.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.330
If we were in outer space,
anyone could pick up the hammer...

15:57.539 --> 16:00.291
...because it would be floating
in a weightless environment.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.795
Yeah, that's right,
the slow reader used science. Suck on that.

16:07.007 --> 16:11.594
-Was there anything valuable in the car?
-Our clothes, our wallets, phones.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.304
And about $300 worth of makeup...

16:13.514 --> 16:16.599
...so this thief could look like
anyone right now.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.770
Makeup? Sure.

16:23.607 --> 16:28.152
We're going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield.
They have a big costume contest.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.530
It's cooler than it sounds.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.200
I don't know, sounds pretty cool.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.662
It is. lt's not just comic books.

16:37.871 --> 16:41.124
They've got action figures,
toys, a Tron themed dance party--

16:41.333 --> 16:43.167
Okay, he gets how cool it is.

16:44.169 --> 16:47.296
I think I have all I need here.
You guys need me to call someone?

16:47.506 --> 16:49.882
I'm guessing your moms?

16:52.511 --> 16:54.137
Thanks, but we've got it covered.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.848
Okay, I just talked to my mom.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.312
She arranged for us to get a rental car.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.398
Great, we can still make it to Comic-Con.

17:05.649 --> 17:09.027
Are you kidding me? After all we've
been through? I just want to go home.

17:09.236 --> 17:12.321
Don't be like that.
Come on, Howard, talk to him.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.283
I'm with Leonard. I'm done.

17:15.492 --> 17:19.370
Fine, then l guess it's two against two.
How do we decide?

17:21.582 --> 17:23.207
Actually, it's three against one.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.503
What? Well, what about the mission?
You said we're a real-life landing party.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.297
Well, we're not.

17:29.506 --> 17:32.008
We're an imaginary landing party.

17:32.217 --> 17:37.096
Who had real-life garbage thrown at us
by real-life strangers who think we're idiots.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.600
And to tell you the truth,
I'm starting to feel like one.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.311
I want to go home now.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.272
Okay.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.692
Did we at least rent the car
from Enterprise?

17:52.780 --> 17:54.739
Get it? Enterprise? Heh.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.618
Screw you, that's funny.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.291
Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor
while Thor is holding the hammer?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.627
-Yeah?
-Then by the transitive property...

18:07.878 --> 18:10.755
...of picking things up,
Hulk picked up the hammer.

18:12.466 --> 18:15.259
No, Hulk picked up Thor,
Thor picked up the hammer.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.888
Hang on, if I go to a bar and pick
up a guy, and he picks up a girl...

18:19.098 --> 18:21.891
...and then we all leave together,
did l pick up the girl?

18:26.355 --> 18:28.272
Did that ever happen?

18:30.150 --> 18:32.735
Hey, we talking about me
or are we talking about Thor?

18:39.993 --> 18:42.954
Well, I say that's the last time
we ever go outside.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.624
AMY: Look right here,
Red Hulk is picking up Thor's hammer...

18:46.834 --> 18:48.292
...because Thor is touching it.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.878
PENNY:
No, it's because they're in space!

18:51.088 --> 18:53.798
BERNADETTE: He's touching the strap.
AMY: The strap's part of the hammer!

18:54.007 --> 18:55.675
PENNY:
No, it's not!

18:56.510 --> 18:59.262
Are they actually
arguing about comic books?

18:59.471 --> 19:00.888
No, that can't be right.

19:01.098 --> 19:05.309
Maybe Thor's Hammer
is a new color of nail polish.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.271
BERNADETTE:
Then Red Hulk must be worthy!

19:08.480 --> 19:10.273
PENNY:
How could Red Hulk be worthy?

19:10.482 --> 19:12.441
BERNADETTE:
You don't know his life.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.700
There's only one logical explanation:
Somewhere in the desert...

19:20.909 --> 19:23.369
...we crossed into
an alternate dimension...

19:23.829 --> 19:27.665
...where the women in our lives
can finally appreciate great literature.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.128
If it's an alternate dimension...

19:32.337 --> 19:34.672
...that sounds like a job
for a landing party.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.512
Captain, what are your orders?

19:43.056 --> 19:45.057
I say we investigate.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.312
Wait.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.482
They might be hostile.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.987
Fine, but set them to stun.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.657
If we vaporize Penny, l'll never
find a girlfriend that pretty again.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.335
GPS:
Fun fact:

20:13.170 --> 20:16.923
President Eisenhower
signed the Federal Aid Highway Act...

20:17.132 --> 20:19.342
...from his hospital room.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.511
Wow, that is interesting.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.848
You learn something new every day.

20:27.267 --> 20:33.314
GPS: Say, can you name the four state capitals
that are not served by the lnterstate System?

20:33.523 --> 20:36.734
-Ooh, another quiz?
-Yes!

21:03.053 --> 21:05.096
