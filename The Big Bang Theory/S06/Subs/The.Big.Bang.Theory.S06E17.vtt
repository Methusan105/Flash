RAJESH:
Can l have your attention, please?

00:07.549 --> 00:10.926
We're all here tonight because
we have no one to be with.

00:11.553 --> 00:14.972
We gotta stop defining our self-worth...

00:15.140 --> 00:17.433
...by whether or not we're in a relationship.

00:18.309 --> 00:20.436
We are a community...

00:20.603 --> 00:25.107
...and as long as we have each other,
we're never truly alone.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.031
That was cool. What you said.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.574
Thank you.

00:36.202 --> 00:41.957
Uh, would you like to, uh,
get a cup of coffee?

00:42.125 --> 00:43.167
Okay.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.591
Later, losers!

00:53.928 --> 00:56.847
So then l went to Cambridge,
which was wonderful...

00:57.015 --> 01:01.518
...not only because it's a good school,
but because it totally looks like Hogwarts.

01:02.270 --> 01:06.732
That's where l fell in love with astronomy,
and now l'm an astrophysicist at Caltech.

01:06.900 --> 01:12.488
So I guess you could say, uh,
Raj is my name, and stars are my game.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.949
And rhyming is also my game.

01:16.117 --> 01:19.078
So, uh, two games.

01:19.954 --> 01:23.248
Uh, anyway, that's enough about me,
I want to hear everything about you.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.293
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.338
I go to the bathroom too.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.674
Sometimes more frequently
than l care to admit.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.511
I've had it checked out, it's nothing.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.516
This is going great.

01:41.392 --> 01:45.062
Mm. Can l have a refill on my chai tea?

01:45.230 --> 01:48.982
Ah, yes, l have a good feeling about this.

01:52.028 --> 01:54.196
I should have bought condoms.

Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.773
Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents:
Fun With Flags.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.779
My apologies
that this episode is coming late.

02:35.947 --> 02:39.449
I did shoot one last week
in honor of Black History Month...

02:39.617 --> 02:42.744
...but l was informed by my roommate
that my spot-on portrayal...

02:42.912 --> 02:47.207
...of George Washington Carver
could be considered "wildly racist."

02:49.544 --> 02:52.880
My heart goes out to the members
of the African-American community...

02:53.047 --> 02:56.133
...who, like me,
have been kept down by the man.

02:58.219 --> 03:02.681
Now, Fun With Flags
is not just for the flag aficionado...

03:02.849 --> 03:04.933
...it's also for the flag novice.

03:05.101 --> 03:09.897
So to help me with that, please welcome
my friend, neighbor and flag virgin...

03:10.064 --> 03:12.191
...not a real virgin.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.861
She's had coitus many times.

Penny.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.125
Hello.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.543
So, Penny, l understand...

03:31.711 --> 03:35.422
-...you'd like to learn more about flags.
-I can't tell you how many times...

03:35.590 --> 03:39.927
...I've been at a party, everyone's talking
about flags and l just couldn't join in.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.180
Well, you came to the right place.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.936
I'm sorry, can we just pause for a minute?

03:50.772 --> 03:51.897
What's wrong?

03:52.065 --> 03:55.651
I think it'd look more natural
if you talked to me instead of the camera.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.569
You know, like a real conversation?

03:57.737 --> 03:59.821
It's something we work on
in acting class.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.031
Interesting.

04:01.491 --> 04:06.161
A few people in the Comments section
have said that my delivery is robotic.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.290
Perhaps that isn't the compliment
it sounds like.

04:11.626 --> 04:15.170
Let's try it again. Maybe this time
you could work on body language a bit.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.423
When you're hunched like that,
you're shutting the audience out.

04:18.591 --> 04:22.427
But when you're relaxed and open,
you're inviting them in.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.388
Right.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.516
And which one do I want?

Let's try open.

04:29.936 --> 04:33.939
If our friend the flag has taught me anything,
it's to go where the wind takes you.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.692
As long as you remain
firmly attached to a rigid pole.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.028
And action.

[PENNY CHUCKLES]

04:50.415 --> 04:56.003
So, Penny, what sort of flag questions
keep you awake at night?

05:01.009 --> 05:03.135
Um, well, l'm from Nebraska.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.679
So, what can you tell me
about the state flag?

05:05.847 --> 05:08.015
Gosh, Penny...

05:08.891 --> 05:13.312
...what did you have for breakfast,
a big glass of good question juice?

05:14.272 --> 05:19.651
The Nebraska state flag
is simply the state seal on a field of blue.

05:32.248 --> 05:34.499
Spread your legs, invite them in.

05:39.797 --> 05:44.092
I'm telling you, something's wrong.
I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.678
Jeez, how close were you
before we got married?

Go away.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.314
-Come on, buddy, open up.
-We're worried about you.

RAJESH: Oh, just because l stop going to work
and answering my phone...

06:00.651 --> 06:03.278
...you think something bad happened?

06:03.446 --> 06:05.614
Maybe something good happened.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.657
Did something good happen?

06:07.825 --> 06:10.952
Of course not, nothing good ever happens!

06:15.958 --> 06:17.376
Whoa.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.629
-What?
-Just whoa.

06:30.848 --> 06:33.558
You kind of feel it in your eyes.

06:34.644 --> 06:35.811
Raj, what's going on?

06:36.396 --> 06:39.272
I was humiliated by yet another woman.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.652
You didn't kill her and chop her up,
that's not what we're smelling, right?

06:43.820 --> 06:46.405
No, I took her for coffee...

06:46.572 --> 06:49.950
...and she snuck out the bathroom window
to get away from me.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.660
Oh, you poor baby.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.161
I went and looked.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.330
It was a high and tiny window.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.334
She must've been very motivated.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.711
I'm sorry, that's awful.

07:01.879 --> 07:05.799
-But come on, you gotta shake it off.
-You can't stay in your apartment...

-Why not?

of Dinty Moore beef stew...

...and two live lobsters on Amazon.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.691
-Lobsters overnight?
-You're kidding. Let me see.

07:22.859 --> 07:27.195
Well, I'll be. Look, you can throw in
a couple steaks and have a surf and turf.

07:28.364 --> 07:31.533
Surf and turf sounds good.
See if they have corn on the cob.

07:33.035 --> 07:36.830
Guys, we're trying to get
him out of here, not you in.

07:37.457 --> 07:41.793

07:45.965 --> 07:48.550
-Now what?
-I don't know.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.887
We could go to Red Lobster
and talk about it.

-Much better than l expected.

Why would l do that?

Because she's your friend

14:35.499 --> 14:36.916
All right.

14:43.465 --> 14:46.092
Thanks for ruining lobster for me.

14:51.098 --> 14:53.141
RAJESH:
Wait! Give me the number!

14:55.477 --> 14:58.271
Give me the number! Give me the number!

14:59.815 --> 15:02.942
So, Amy, what's going on
with your addiction study?

15:03.736 --> 15:06.321
Sadly l'm no longer associated
with that project.

15:06.488 --> 15:09.407
-Why? What happened?
-Typical bureaucratic nonsense.

15:09.575 --> 15:13.620
You can get animals addicted to a harmful
substance, you can dissect their brains...

15:13.787 --> 15:17.707
...but you throw their own feces back at them
and suddenly you're unprofessional.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.461
I'm sorry.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.755
That I asked.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.508
All right, let's get this stupid play over with.

15:27.676 --> 15:29.886
Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.972
-Why?
-You know why. The Nintendo DS.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.182
[GROANS]

15:37.728 --> 15:38.770
And the PSP.

15:38.938 --> 15:39.979
[GROANS]

15:43.901 --> 15:44.943
Now the Game Boy.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.362
Oh, for Pete's sake.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.199
-Can we go now?
-Is that all of it?

16:01.210 --> 16:03.002
Just set it down.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.965
Just so you know,
this is not a stupid play.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.425
A Streetcar Named Desire
is an American classic.

16:09.843 --> 16:12.011
It's about streetcars?

16:12.179 --> 16:14.347
Great. Then l won't need this.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.154
Just a sec.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.992
Oh, who says "just a sec"?
I hate myself.

16:38.747 --> 16:39.789
Hello.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.417
-Hi.
-Uh, would you like to come in?

16:42.584 --> 16:45.253
Uh, no, l can't stay.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.921
Oh.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.007
I just wanted to say...

16:49.174 --> 16:52.552
...I'm sorry for running out
of the coffee shop. That wasn't cool.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.180
So yeah.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.724
I'm sorry.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.934
Wait.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.480
Can you at least tell me what went wrong?

17:04.648 --> 17:06.357
It's okay, l can take anything.

17:06.525 --> 17:10.570
Unless it's something I did, or said, or am,
because those are like my buttons.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.199
No, it's not any of that.

17:17.161 --> 17:20.788
It's just, l kind of have a hard time
around people l don't know.

17:20.956 --> 17:24.459
Really? Then what were you doing
at the comic book store that night?

17:25.544 --> 17:29.130
I've been trying to force myself
into situations l'm not comfortable with.

17:29.923 --> 17:34.052
I saw the flyer in the store window
and I made myself go in.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.970
I don't even like comic books.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.389
-Yeah, me neither.
-What were you doing there?

17:38.557 --> 17:40.224
I lied. l love them.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.146
I only said that so you'd go out with me.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.814
You don't want to do that.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.399
I'm kind of broken.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.777
That's great. l'm broken too.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.904
-No, you're not.
-I totally am.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.908
If it wasn't for this beer, l couldn't even
talk to you right now. l'm a wreck.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.911
There are many things
seriously wrong with me.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.581
And not quirks either...

18:03.749 --> 18:07.460
...like, diagnosable psychological problems.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.422
Maybe brain damage.

18:13.884 --> 18:17.011
Well, how do l know
you're not just saying that?

18:18.639 --> 18:22.475
Go out with me on one date
and I promise you you'll see.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.270
Okay.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.898
Text me.
Bye.

18:29.983 --> 18:33.194
You won't regret it.
I'm the most pathetic guy you've ever met.

18:35.447 --> 18:39.492
And that, boys and girls, is how it's done.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.876
You love her very much, don't you?

18:49.294 --> 18:50.711
Yes.

18:50.879 --> 18:53.381
PENNY:
I think you have great capacity for devotion.

18:54.174 --> 18:57.135
You will be lonely
when she passes on, won't you?

18:58.846 --> 19:00.429
I understand what that is.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.224
MAN: To be lonely?
-She's pretty good, huh?

19:03.392 --> 19:04.684
She is.

19:05.435 --> 19:07.937
But when do they get to the part
about streetcars?

19:11.483 --> 19:13.526
When I was a very young girl.

19:14.736 --> 19:17.989
When I was 1 6 years old,
I made the discovery:

19:18.657 --> 19:19.699
Love.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.996
All at once and much, much too completely.

19:25.914 --> 19:28.541
It was like you turned
a blinding light on something...

19:28.709 --> 19:30.585
...that had always been half a shadow.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.172
That's how it struck the world for me.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.217
But l was unlucky.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.428
Deluded.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.014
-She's remarkable.
-She really is.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.390
Our Penny's a star.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.269
How can she remember all those lines...

19:48.437 --> 19:52.356
...but as a waitress, she can't remember
no tomato on my hamburger?
