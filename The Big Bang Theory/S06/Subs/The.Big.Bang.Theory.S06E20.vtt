I was reading about this jellyfish
that never dies.

00:06.715 --> 00:09.883
Instead it reverts to its asexual state
and then grows up again.

00:10.093 --> 00:13.470
We thought my 90-year-old grandfather
had reverted to an asexual state...

00:13.680 --> 00:16.890
...but the lawsuit from his Jamaican
caregiver proved us all wrong.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.853

a possibility, it is real.

You have some nerve showing up
just to schmooze the tenure committee.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.135
You're here.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.264
Excuse me, l'm here to pay my respects
to Professor Tupperware...

14:09.473 --> 14:10.932
...or whatever his name is.

14:11.141 --> 14:15.770
So am l. His passing makes me feel bad.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.526
Well, well, well, Sheldon,
fancy meeting you here.

14:21.735 --> 14:25.405
I guess the train store in Glendale
wasn't having a cotillion after all.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.242
And you.
You said you weren't coming here either.

14:29.451 --> 14:31.995
I have a thick accent.
You don't know what I said.

14:33.163 --> 14:37.750
-I'd like to know why Penny's here.
-I'm here to support my man, just like you.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.127
What are you going to do?

14:39.336 --> 14:41.921
Take people's drink orders
and get them wrong?

14:43.924 --> 14:45.466
Do it.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.357
What? Did she do it yet?

15:04.194 --> 15:08.323
She plans on flirting with members of the
tenure committee to further Leonard's cause.

15:08.532 --> 15:11.492
Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.370
Don't just stand there,
take your breasts out.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.667
Ooh, meerkat fight.

15:21.378 --> 15:24.797
You're all wasting your time.
Sheldon is the most qualified for the job...

15:25.007 --> 15:28.468
...and no amount of gravity-defying bosom
is gonna change that.

15:30.054 --> 15:33.306
Seriously, is that tape?
Like, how are they staying up like that?

15:34.391 --> 15:36.976
Way to hit them with both barrels.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.855
You two should be ashamed
of yourselves.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.399
Using women to advance your cause
with sexuality...

15:43.609 --> 15:45.401
...and whatever Amy plans on doing.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.405
Are you implying my girlfriend...

15:49.615 --> 15:51.908
-...has no sexuality to exploit?
-Yes.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.077
-Okay, because that wasn't clear.
-Sheldon.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.707
What? That was ambiguous.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.377
Well, now it's biguous.
What are you gonna do about it?

16:02.586 --> 16:04.837
-Um....
-Talk some smack about his mother.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.174
Yes, of course, he wouldn't like that at all.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.052
Last night, l was feeling in need
of sexual release...

16:11.261 --> 16:14.430
...when l happened to come across
your mother.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.727
-Okay, guys, what are we doing here?
-I don't know what you're doing...

16:19.937 --> 16:24.857
...but l was about to insinuate that
I had coitus with Raj's mother for a dollar.

16:26.527 --> 16:30.071
Well, you do what you want,
but l don't wanna lose my friends over tenure.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.490
-Friends are forever.
-Ahem. So is tenure.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.367
Walk.

16:36.328 --> 16:39.163
I'm just gonna go home
and let my work speak for itself.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.249
You're right. This is beneath me.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.293
Like your mother was last night.

16:46.588 --> 16:47.630
How about it, Sheldon?

16:48.674 --> 16:51.092
What do you think l should do?

16:51.301 --> 16:54.178
Well, you'll always
be an academic success...

16:54.388 --> 16:59.684
...but l seriously question
whether you'll make any more friends.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.772
Oh, I don't want any more, but let's go.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.942
Are you kidding?
I would love to babysit for you.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.029
JANlNE: l could not ask you to do that.
-Nonsense, children love me.

17:11.238 --> 17:15.199
Something about me
just makes them laugh and laugh.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.876
No, we cannot lose to that jerk.

17:25.085 --> 17:28.254
-Yeah, screw it. l'm going in.
-Hold on.

17:29.339 --> 17:32.800
"Screw it, I'm going in"
is what I said to your mother last night.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.847
Don't worry, I didn't really say that.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.768
I find the concept of coitus ridiculous
and off-putting.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.606
Should have taken my breasts out
while l had the chance.

17:54.698 --> 17:59.869
Mrs. Davis. Mrs. Davis. Mrs. Davis.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.373
I know you're in there.
I saw your car in the parking lot.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.168
What?

18:07.377 --> 18:10.171
I just found out
that you recommended myself...

18:10.380 --> 18:14.300
...Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali
to be on the short list for tenure.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.302
Well, despite your quirks...

18:16.512 --> 18:19.889
...the three of you are very accomplished
in your respective fields.

18:20.974 --> 18:27.063
I don't know what you mean by quirks,
but l do want to express my gratitude.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.817
-You didn't bring another gift, did you?
-No, no, l learned my lesson.

18:31.026 --> 18:33.903
-I understand that was inappropriate.
-Good.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.573
-Anyway, thank you.
-You're welcome.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.167
I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.837
Right on, sister.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.241
