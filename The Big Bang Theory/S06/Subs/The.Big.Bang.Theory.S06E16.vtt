This old guy was choking on his food
and I saved his life.

00:09.551 --> 00:10.676
Did you Heimlich him?

00:10.885 --> 00:13.262
No, I said,
"l think that old guy's choking."

Romance! Watch out! Hearts, kisses, love!

cooler than you used to be...

00:55.722 --> 00:56.930
...then you go
and do that.

00:59.684 --> 01:03.729
So in conclusion,
I believe the painful sensation felt...

01:03.938 --> 01:06.899
...after passing a meal
of spicy chilies is proof...

01:07.108 --> 01:10.861

the sense of taste.

I was gonna spend the night
with my special little lady...

and then I had to take her to the vet.

we can do.

Uh, how about, uh,
you keep the store open late...

who don't have dates?

02:53.256 --> 02:55.048
That actually sounds kind of nice.

02:55.258 --> 03:00.387

a man can have is love he has with himself.

Fermilab to take this job with you.

really romantic to give Bernadette...

that plays one of her favorite songs.
