as Cooper studies the board.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.186

01:44.354 --> 01:47.689
He's dividing both sides by l,
he's adding back the coefficient.

01:47.857 --> 01:50.275
He has a value for P.
He's plugging that back in.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.903

and he solves the equation.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.553
...here comes the bride.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.807
-Oh, Howie, l love these.
-I thought you might.

14:10.975 --> 14:14.143
-Were they expensive?
-It didn't cost a thing. I made them myself.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.645
-How?
-Koothrappali and l...

14:15.813 --> 14:19.190
...bought a used 3D printer for $5000.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.650
Heh, heh.

14:20.818 --> 14:24.821
Five thousand dollars for a couple of dolls?
Are you out of your mind?

14:25.698 --> 14:28.324
Not just a couple of dolls.

14:28.492 --> 14:31.828
For as many dolls as we want.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.497
And whistles.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.711
At any point did it dawn on you to talk
to me about spending this kind of money?

14:40.671 --> 14:42.839
It's kind of dawning on me now.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.009
I don't believe you.

14:46.176 --> 14:49.012
Howie, we can't afford to waste money
on junk like this.

14:49.179 --> 14:52.682
What are you talking about?
We make plenty of money.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.727
I make plenty of money.
You make peanuts.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.188
Well, yes, but we're married now.

14:59.690 --> 15:03.276
That means when you get sick,
I take care of you.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.195
And when you make a bunch of money...

15:06.363 --> 15:08.531
...I get to buy stuff.

15:10.367 --> 15:14.746
Sorry if you don't like it,
but that's how love works.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.708
No. Here's how love works.
You're gonna return the machine...

15:18.876 --> 15:22.545
...or you could print out a working set
of lady parts and sleep with those.

15:24.381 --> 15:27.133
Oh, my God.
Are you actually thinking about it?

15:31.013 --> 15:34.098
I don't understand.
Why didn't you just tell Kripke the truth?

15:34.266 --> 15:36.476
Because the truth made me look bad.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.562
Whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie
makes me look good.

15:40.814 --> 15:42.649
Anyway, if Kripke asks...

15:42.816 --> 15:48.947
...tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent,
intense and whimsically inventive.

15:55.079 --> 15:58.164
Is my coitus whimsically inventive?

15:58.332 --> 16:00.416
That is what l write
on the bathroom walls.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.211
"For a whimsically inventive time,
call Leonard Hofstadter."

[CHUCKLlNG]

16:06.590 --> 16:09.133
I know you're joking,
but l'd be okay with that.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.096
-Sheldon, can l ask you a question?
-Of course.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.098
Are you ever gonna sleep with Amy?

16:17.601 --> 16:20.687
-That's awfully personal.
-We don't ask Sheldon things like that.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.939
Maybe you don't, l do. What's the deal?

16:24.108 --> 16:26.776
Well, word around the university is...

16:26.944 --> 16:30.071
...I'm giving her sex organs
a proper jostling.

16:30.614 --> 16:33.866
All right, come on, be serious.
You have been going out a long time.

16:34.076 --> 16:37.120
She would clearly like
to have a physical relationship with you.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.663
So, what are you doing?

16:38.831 --> 16:41.958
All right, we're down the rabbit hole.
What are you doing?

16:42.960 --> 16:45.545
Well, first of all, l'm quite fond of Amy.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.005
Then what's the problem?

16:47.464 --> 16:48.965
Penny...

16:49.633 --> 16:52.468
...all my life I have been uncomfortable...

16:52.636 --> 16:56.139
...with the sort of physical contact
that comes easily to others...

16:56.306 --> 16:58.683
...handshaking, hugging...

16:58.851 --> 17:00.727
...prostate exams.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.150
But l'm working on it, you know?

17:07.317 --> 17:11.154
Just recently, l had to put VapoRub
on Amy's chest.

17:11.321 --> 17:14.032
A year ago,
that would have been unthinkable.

17:14.199 --> 17:17.410
Now you know how l feel
when l have to put it on you.

17:19.747 --> 17:20.830
Okay, hang on.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.750
Are you saying
someday you and Amy might...

17:23.917 --> 17:27.003
...actually get physical?

17:30.257 --> 17:31.340
It's a possibility.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.888
Oh, my God.

17:42.770 --> 17:46.439
Sheldon, l know this wasn't easy
and I'm glad we can have this conversation.

17:46.648 --> 17:50.026
-Hey.
-Oh, my God.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.367
Sure you wanna do this?

17:58.535 --> 18:01.788
-Give up your half of the 3D printer?
-Yes.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.207
And can you please make that out
to Bernadette?

18:04.374 --> 18:08.544
I was taken off the joint account
until l learn the value of money.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.215
Well, that's harsh.

18:12.382 --> 18:14.217
Tell me about it.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.469
Aren't you gonna eat lunch?

18:16.637 --> 18:20.181
No, I blew my food allowance
on Pokémon cards.

18:22.893 --> 18:28.106
Well, the equation balances,
but it's certainly not elegant.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.650
Whatever. You get any last night?

18:32.694 --> 18:34.278
Yes.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.614
Gave it to her good, huh?

18:37.699 --> 18:40.284
No, I gave it to her well.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.123
Now, over here l was thinking...

18:45.290 --> 18:47.959
-...turbulence could be reduced if we put--
-Yeah, yeah.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.879
Was she naked,
or was she wearing lingerie?

18:54.424 --> 18:55.550
I didn't notice.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.053
How could you not notice?

18:59.221 --> 19:03.683
I was too busy squishing
all the desirable parts of her body.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.936
Oh, you're killing me, Cooper!

19:08.063 --> 19:09.230
Can we get back to work?

19:09.398 --> 19:11.440
Sure, sure, sure.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.527
You guys ever used any toys?

19:17.447 --> 19:19.490
Toys?

19:20.242 --> 19:23.035
I do have a model rocket next to my bed.

19:23.203 --> 19:26.247
A rocket? You're a freak. l love it.
