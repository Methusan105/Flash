Hey, Stuart, l got you
a little souvenir from my trip to space.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.759
Wow, Howard, that's very nice of you.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.137
Yeah, maybe. Open it first.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.849
It's my official NASA portrait.

"To Stuart, your comic book store
is out of this world...

00:22.313 --> 00:24.982
...just like the guy in this picture was."

00:25.483 --> 00:28.193
For the record,
he also thinks that Walgreens...

00:28.361 --> 00:31.030
...and the drycleaners
are out of this world.

00:31.197 --> 00:37.036
That's not true. At Walgreens I was "over
the moon" for their store-brand antacids.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.497

for your Halloween party.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.542

to meet women.

je ne sais quoi when it comes to soirees.

Thanks, but I can't afford je ne sais quoi.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.221
How much for just quoi?

You know what wasn't a party?
That hotel in Kazakhstan...

01:07.901 --> 01:12.112
...they put you up in before the launch.
You'd think you'd get one porn channel.

01:14.074 --> 01:18.744
Have you noticed Howard can take any topic
and use it to remind you he went to space?

01:19.037 --> 01:21.246
Interesting hypothesis.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.625
Let's apply the scientific method.

Okay. Hey, Howard.

01:26.836 --> 01:30.464
-Thoughts on where we should get dinner?
-Anywhere but the space station.

01:31.925 --> 01:35.427
On a good day,
dinner was a bag full of meatloaf.

01:35.637 --> 01:39.431
But, hey, you don't go there for the food,
you go there for the view.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.391
That's fascinating.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.393
I'm gonna see if l can duplicate it.

01:43.770 --> 01:48.357
Howard, l've always thought the lemon
was an underrated fruit.

Not really.

-Oh, well.
-People say the Soyuz capsule's a lemon....

02:36.990 --> 02:38.615
I hope so.

Question: Do you think your husband's
fondness for turtle-necks...

02:43.621 --> 02:46.999
...is an expression of longing

-I thought you liked Halloween.
-I do...

03:01.431 --> 03:05.684
...he wants to go party at the comic store.
Lot of the guys there are kind of creepy.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.520
-Like my husband?
-And my boyfriend?

03:11.399 --> 03:14.776
I'm sorry, Amy, you were saying something
about Howard's foreskin?

03:15.111 --> 03:18.113
Nice try, but you have to go to
that party because we're going.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.033
I'm gonna go, it's just not my idea
of a good time.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.952
Leonard does things he doesn't like
to make you happy.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.706
Yeah, he's my boyfriend.
Isn't that, like, his job?

03:28.416 --> 03:31.501
-Then what's your job?
-Letting him make me happy.

Last night I gave Sheldon
my best come-hither look...

03:41.221 --> 03:45.474
...and he responded by explaining
how wheat came to be cultivated.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.936
I guess l could probably try a little harder.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.730
You could start
by taking an interest in his work.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.941
-That's kind of a problem.
-Why?

03:54.150 --> 03:56.401
Not really clear on what he does.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.862
He's an experimental physicist.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.573
Yeah, l'm not really clear
on what that means.

04:02.742 --> 04:07.204
He takes hypotheses and designs protocols
to determine their accuracy.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.915
Yeah, you're really just making it worse.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.086
What kind of tea would you like?

04:14.337 --> 04:18.757
I think I'm going to try
green tea mixed with lemon zinger.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.845
You're not at a rave.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.935
So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking...

04:30.395 --> 04:34.273
...since this is our first Halloween
party as boyfriend and girlfriend...

04:34.565 --> 04:37.693
...I thought it might be fun for us
to go in a couples' costume.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.112
I couldn't agree more.

04:40.780 --> 04:44.783
Really? l find that inconsistent
with everything I know about you.

04:45.785 --> 04:51.123
Couples' costumes are one of
the few benefits of being in a relationship.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.625

I meant, like, Romeo and Juliet...

...or Cinderella and Prince Charming.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.734
-No.
-Yes.

14:23.153 --> 14:25.196
We seem to have different approaches here.

14:25.364 --> 14:30.702
I was going for helpful honesty,
I have no idea what you're doing.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.872
It's called being nice.

14:34.164 --> 14:38.668
Okay, if you think being nice
will get him to shut up, l'll try it.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.713
You know what, guys, never mind.

14:41.922 --> 14:46.134
I just won't talk about the greatest
achievement of my life ever again.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.720
Look at that, the problem solved itself.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.896
Hello, boys.

15:00.733 --> 15:05.904
What if we were to go
as dinner table favorites, salt and pepper?

15:06.363 --> 15:08.239
You know salt makes me retain water...

15:08.407 --> 15:12.160
...and my cousin, William, was ground
to death in a pepper factory accident.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.581
Raggedy Ann and Andy?
I loved them growing up.

15:16.749 --> 15:20.376
I don't think so. Those dolls represent
three things I don't care for:

15:20.586 --> 15:23.922
Clowns, children, and raggedyness.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.926
-I think it's a lost cause.
-No.

15:28.093 --> 15:32.472
There are things that say to the world,
"l have a boyfriend and he's not made up."

15:33.807 --> 15:37.310
Matching costumes, hickies, and sex tapes.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.813
Pick one.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.191
What's a hickey?

16:00.125 --> 16:02.251
-How do l look?
-Fine.

16:02.419 --> 16:06.589
Uh-oh. Is someone a little blue?

16:10.636 --> 16:14.806
Come on, Howie, that's, like,
the funniest thing I've ever said in my life.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.225
What do you say, you ready to go?

16:17.434 --> 16:19.852
To tell you the truth,
I'm not really in the mood.

16:20.145 --> 16:23.356
What are you talking about? lt'll be fun,
your friends will be there.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.817
Some friends. They all think I'm boring.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.610
Maybe you should go without me.

16:27.820 --> 16:33.658
No, if l'm there alone people might think
I'm just a really short person from Avatar.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.244
I'm sorry, l just don't wanna go.

16:36.620 --> 16:40.164
Hey, I just spent the last three hours
coloring myself blue.

16:40.374 --> 16:44.377
I'm gonna be washing paint
out of my smurf for a month!

16:45.462 --> 16:47.255
Fine.

16:47.464 --> 16:49.132
Two weeks ago l was an astronaut.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.509
Yeah, well, now you're a Smurf.
Keep walking.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.809
Oh, my God, you guys look adorable!

17:00.019 --> 17:01.394
Thanks, so do you.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.688
-Slutty cop?
-No, sexy cop.

17:03.897 --> 17:07.525
Slutty cop only came
with a skirt and two badges.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.570
And Albert Einstein?

17:10.779 --> 17:16.492
Ja. Und later she's going to arrest me
for going faster than the speed of light.

17:17.411 --> 17:21.372
-I thought we said in the car, no accents.
-Sorry, officer.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.712
Hello!

17:30.049 --> 17:33.051
-It's a great party.
-Thank you.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.387
The monster foods, they're really fun.

17:36.555 --> 17:40.224
Oh, yes, thank you.
I like to think of fun things like that...

17:40.434 --> 17:45.438
...because l'm fun,
I'm not clinically depressed at all.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.900
Sheldon, get in here.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.328
SHELDON:
I should have picked hickey.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.455
STUART:
Hey, look at you guys!

18:02.706 --> 18:06.084
I'm Raggedy Anne and he's Raggedy C-3PO.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.754
SHELDON:
It was a compromise. I lost.

18:11.882 --> 18:15.093
Can you believe Stuart's walking around
taking credit for this party?

18:15.636 --> 18:17.970
-Who cares?
-What do you mean, who cares?

18:18.222 --> 18:20.723
Look what l pulled off here.
The DJ's on fire...

18:20.933 --> 18:23.101
...there's a TARDlS photo booth
in the back...

18:23.268 --> 18:28.064
...oh, my God, the food.
Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and Cheese.

18:28.398 --> 18:30.775
You're right, the party's fantastic!
Tell me more.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.570
I haven't heard enough about it,
because hearing about that never gets old!

18:34.738 --> 18:38.407
-Is this about the space thing again?
-I'm not allowed to talk about it...

18:38.617 --> 18:43.246
...but since you brought it up,
I went to space. Space, space, space!

18:43.747 --> 18:46.290
Oh, Drinky Smurf!

18:48.001 --> 18:51.295
-Can l talk to you for a second?
-Great, now l'm in trouble.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.131
You happy?

18:53.966 --> 18:56.509
You, out!

18:57.761 --> 18:59.011
You are being very rude.

18:59.429 --> 19:02.515
No l'm not. They're all being rude,
and you're being rude.

19:02.766 --> 19:03.933
Me? What did I do?

19:04.143 --> 19:10.648
[AS BERNADETTE] "Oh, Howie,
stop talking about space so much."

19:10.899 --> 19:13.484
"Nobody likes it."

19:14.903 --> 19:17.321
I don't sound like that.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.659
[lN NORMAL VOICE]
You're supposed to be on my side.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.911
I'm always on your side.

19:24.121 --> 19:27.165
Then why are you trying to
take this away from me?

19:27.332 --> 19:32.211
Being an astronaut is the coolest thing
I'm ever going to do...

19:32.671 --> 19:36.507
...and if l stop talking about it
then l'm just....

19:37.342 --> 19:39.135
Just what?

19:39.678 --> 19:43.181
Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.351
Plain old Howard Wolowitz
is the best guy I know.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.521
-You're just saying that.
-No, I'm not.

19:50.731 --> 19:54.317
I married him. On purpose.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.153
Come here.

19:57.821 --> 20:00.823
-I love you.
-I love you too.

20:07.372 --> 20:10.333
Nothing to see here,
just sexy police business.

Just explaining the theory of relativity.

Twice.

20:23.096 --> 20:24.472
Hey, what you watching?

20:24.681 --> 20:29.185
I don't know.
Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.

20:29.686 --> 20:33.898
Here you go, it's a Milky Way.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.568
The Milky Way is a galaxy in space.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.571
I've been in space.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.284
Here's a Mars bar.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.120
I'm an astronaut.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.669
And this one's a MoonPie.

20:55.045 --> 20:57.463
I walked on the Moon.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.049
What have you done?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.389
Okay, I get it.
