00:03.753 --> 00:07.506
I don't know why l avoided the Harry Potter
books for so long. These are great.

00:07.716 --> 00:10.801
-I just started number six.
-That's a good one.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.553
Dumbledore dies in that one.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.434
Yeah, l know, I didn't see it coming, either.

00:19.519 --> 00:20.936
Why would you say that?

00:21.104 --> 00:24.523
You brought up a subject,
I contributed a fact on that subject.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.901
It's called the art of conversation.
Okay, your turn.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.530
That was a huge spoiler.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.323
Good.

00:34.242 --> 00:38.412
What is wrong with you?
If I did that, you'd bitch about it for weeks.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.956
Really, Leonard?
Gonna have one of your hissy fits?

00:41.458 --> 00:43.125
Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?

00:43.334 --> 00:45.878
Yes. And l have a theory why.

00:46.087 --> 00:50.215
Because of your lactose intolerance,
you switched over to soy milk.

00:50.425 --> 00:53.761
Soy contains estrogen-mimicking
compounds.

00:53.970 --> 00:59.099
I think your morning Cocoa Puffs
are turning you into a hysterical woman.

01:03.229 --> 01:06.315
You are unbelievable.
I don't know why l put up with you.

01:06.483 --> 01:11.111
-You're controlling, you're irritating--
-There you go again. Nag, nag, nag.

01:12.113 --> 01:14.323
You're only proving my point, little lady.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.159
You know what, screw you, Sheldon.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.745
You're the most annoying person
I've ever met.

01:19.954 --> 01:23.916
I'm annoying?
You criticize my behavior all the time.

01:24.125 --> 01:28.170
"Sheldon, don't talk about
your bowel movements over breakfast."

01:28.379 --> 01:30.631
"Sheldon, when the president
of the university...

01:30.840 --> 01:34.593
...is giving a eulogy at a funeral,
don't yawn and point at your watch."

01:34.803 --> 01:37.638
"Sheldon, don't throw away my shirts
because they're ugly."

01:37.847 --> 01:39.139
You're impossible.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.184
That's it, l don't have to put up with this.

01:42.435 --> 01:46.396
Actually, I have your signature
on a roommate agreement that says you do.

01:46.564 --> 01:50.150
Aww. Here's what l think
of your roommate agreement.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.031
-You pick that up right now.
-No.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.283
Roommate agreement,
section 27, paragraph 5:

01:58.493 --> 02:02.329
"The roommate agreement, like the
American flag, cannot touch the ground."

02:03.456 --> 02:05.040
I don't care.

02:05.208 --> 02:10.712
I don't have to do anything you say, because
I don't think I wanna live here anymore.

-Where are you going?
-To live with Penny...

02:13.800 --> 02:15.300

-Crazy bastard?
-Yes.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.757
Here you go.

-Great. Come on in.
-What, you don't say thank you?

02:59.512 --> 03:02.598
It's my suitcase.
I lent it to you two years ago.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.559
I should tell you
I broke the wheel and the handle.

03:09.105 --> 03:12.191
So is everyone from Bernadette's company
going to Vegas?

03:12.400 --> 03:15.110
No, just me, her,
and a couple of the bigwigs.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.029
It's part of a bonus she got.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.364
Cool. Did she discover a cure
for something?

03:19.574 --> 03:23.619
Not exactly. They spent a ton of money
developing this dandruff medication...

03:23.786 --> 03:27.372
...that had the side effect
of horrible anal leakage.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.793
Is there a good anal leakage?

03:34.631 --> 03:39.092
Anyway, it was Bernie's idea to rebrand
the stuff as a cure for constipation.

03:39.636 --> 03:44.640
Way to make lemonade, you know, from
around the corner where fudge is made.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.729
-Hey, I got a favor to ask.
-Sure.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.607
My mom's been
kind of an emotional wreck...

03:53.775 --> 03:56.777
...since that dentist she was dating
dumped her.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.780
Dumped her? What did he use, a forklift?

04:02.492 --> 04:03.909
Sorry.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.787
There's nothing funny
about morbid obesity.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.289
She's huge, it was funny.

04:10.166 --> 04:13.835
Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you
could check in on her tomorrow night...

04:14.087 --> 04:17.923

...hit a few hot spots,

04:29.352 --> 04:32.187
Tell me if this sounds familiar. Ahem.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.983
You pay $1 5 to park,
you stand on the sidewalk for an hour...

04:36.192 --> 04:39.027
...until you break down and
give the bouncer 20 to let you in.

04:39.195 --> 04:42.656
You push your way to the bar
where you drink an $1 8 cosmopolitan.

04:42.865 --> 04:46.285
Then you stare at a pretty girl
and imagine your perfect life together.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.288

Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy...

04:49.497 --> 04:51.873

Beverly Hills Chihuahua.

go to Marie Callender's...

...buy a pie and eat it in your car
in the parking lot.

-What time should I be at your mother's?
-I told her around 7.

insufferable human being I have ever met.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.604
Yeah, but you two
make such a cute couple.

about words and numbers.

Well, I was thinking here with you.

No, no, no. It's great.

help feel bad about Sheldon.

get by without you...

-He's got Amy now.
-Yeah, he does...

05:53.061 --> 05:55.562
-...but it's not the same.
-Why?

05:56.856 --> 05:58.190
Um....

05:58.941 --> 06:02.361
Well, all right, you know how
in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince...

06:02.570 --> 06:05.906
...Ron didn't abandon Harry
because Harry started dating Ron's sister?

06:06.115 --> 06:08.742
Harry and Ginny get together?

06:13.081 --> 06:17.709
Sorry, spoiler alert. My point is,
as much as l want to live with you...

06:17.919 --> 06:20.295
...I can't do it knowing how much
Sheldon needs you.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.465
Please. The only thing he needs me for
is to be his whipping boy.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.467
His stooge, his doormat.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.470

Wow, it sounds to me like
you don't want us to live together.

No. No, no, l do. I do.
It's just-- lt's a really big step.

Financially, it makes great sense.

why we shouldn't do this?

Russian nesting dolls.

I put a little doggie bag together for you?

MRS. WOLOWlTZ:
Rajesh? You up?

13:32.561 --> 13:33.853
You ready for breakfast?

13:34.063 --> 13:35.688
Oh, boy, breakfast.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.400
Okay, Raj, listen.
You need to get out of there.

13:39.610 --> 13:43.738
But l have a cream sherry hangover
and I smell blintzes.

13:45.241 --> 13:49.410
If you don't leave now, she'll use food and
guilt to keep you there the rest of your life.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.662
Oh, Howard, stop.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.706
Trust me, you're not Jewish,
that's how they get you.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.710
You're being silly.
I can leave whenever I want.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.588
Oh, really?
Where are your clothes and your shoes?

14:00.798 --> 14:03.132
They're on the chair right over--

14:04.426 --> 14:06.219
Oy vey.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.393
Hello, homewrecker.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.772
What did l do?

14:17.982 --> 14:19.899
You gave Leonard somewhere to go.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.403
Thanks to you, Amy's out
buying his and hers bath towels.

14:23.612 --> 14:27.323
Like l'd ever dry myself with something
that has a possessive pronoun on it.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.869
Okay, listen...

14:31.161 --> 14:33.329
...the truth is
I don't want him living with me.

14:33.539 --> 14:37.166
Great. Kick him out, break his heart,
everybody wins.

14:37.793 --> 14:41.421
No, I don't wanna break his heart,
I love him. This is happening too fast.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.714
You think this is fast?

14:42.923 --> 14:46.426
It is just a matter of time before
I see Amy's leg stubble in my shower.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.638
Yeah, and I've seen those legs.
You might wanna get some Drano.

14:51.807 --> 14:56.060
Hold on. lf you don't want to live
with Leonard, why don't you just tell him?

14:56.270 --> 14:58.980
Well, you know how he is.
He's sensitive and emotional.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.649
That's because he drinks
too much soy milk.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.862
I don't know what else
we can do but tell them the truth.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.907
I suppose there's no choice
but to face the crying...

15:09.116 --> 15:13.161
...angry accusations,
and the high-pitched wails of despair.

15:13.370 --> 15:16.414
Yeah. And who knows
how Amy will react.

15:20.628 --> 15:21.794
Here's some more ice.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.506
-Thanks.
-What were we thinking?

15:25.716 --> 15:28.426
We should have just done it
the regular way.

15:29.303 --> 15:33.765
Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque Du Soleil
made it look so easy.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.686
Honestly, if l could bend that far,
what would I need with you?

15:41.231 --> 15:44.317
If you could bend that far,
you'd be doing us both a favor.

Hey, Raj, what's up?

15:53.702 --> 15:56.621
You were right. l can't get out of here.

15:57.498 --> 16:00.166
-You're still at my mother's?
-I'm trapped.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.544
My clothes have been in the laundry
all day, and she hid my keys.

16:03.754 --> 16:07.966
I think they might be in her bra
because she jingles when she walks.

16:08.592 --> 16:09.676
What do l do?

16:09.885 --> 16:12.845
Hey, you wanted a woman in your life,
now you got one.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.223
Come on, Howard, help me.

16:15.432 --> 16:19.268
MRS. WOLOWlTZ:
Rajesh, tatellah, l ran you a bath!

16:19.770 --> 16:24.065
Oh, my God,
she's not gonna bathe me, is she?

16:27.069 --> 16:30.029
Gee, I wish I could tell you no.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.494
All right, well, thanks again
for helping me out.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.204
Howard--

16:38.747 --> 16:43.042
-Should we go back and rescue him?
-Too late. We'll see him at his bar mitzvah.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.005
Here you go.

16:47.214 --> 16:50.425
I picked up the Chinese food
just the way Leonard used to.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.176
-Is it kung pao chicken?
-Yes.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.053
-Brown rice, not white rice?
-Yes.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.180
-Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?
-Yes.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.683
-I did good, right?
-Yes.

17:01.478 --> 17:05.106
Amy, are you worried
that us living together...

17:05.315 --> 17:07.734
...will take the mystery
out of our relationship?

17:07.943 --> 17:11.070
-No.
-Yeah, why would you?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.822
Oh, and check this out.

17:13.032 --> 17:17.577
I took the liberty of scripting a new
outgoing voicemail message for both of us.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.999
"Hello, this is Sheldon."

17:23.208 --> 17:24.250
"And this is Amy."

17:24.460 --> 17:25.918
"We're not home right now."

17:26.128 --> 17:28.755
"'Cause we out dropping science, son."

17:34.762 --> 17:36.888
-"Leave a message."
-"Leave a message."

17:38.974 --> 17:40.808
Beep. Heh.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.979
You can't live here.

17:46.148 --> 17:49.233
What? Why? ls it the message?

17:49.443 --> 17:53.988
I only used urban slang to sound tough
so people wouldn't break in.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.406
It's not the message.

17:55.616 --> 17:59.077
Well, what is it then?
I did everything just the way you like it.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.954
-You did.
-Then what the hell, Sheldon?

18:04.625 --> 18:08.920
We have been going out for over two years,
and I've been nothing but patient with you.

18:09.129 --> 18:13.091
I watch your dopey space movies,
I signed your ridiculous contracts.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.803
I stopped wearing lip gloss because
you said it made my mouth look slippery.

18:18.972 --> 18:21.432
I am the best girlfriend
you're ever gonna have.

18:21.642 --> 18:24.227
You give me one good reason
why l can't live here.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.355
It's Penny's fault.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.233
-What?
-She doesn't wanna live with Leonard...

18:30.442 --> 18:33.986
...so he has to come live here again.
She's the snake in our garden.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.031
She's the reason we can't be happy.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.953
-Hey, Ames.
-Yeah, "Hey, Ames" nothing.

18:42.162 --> 18:44.914
I was all set to move in
with Sheldon and l can't because...

18:45.082 --> 18:47.917
-...you don't wanna live with Leonard.
LEONARD: What?

18:49.545 --> 18:51.796
Sheldon, what did you say?

18:52.005 --> 18:55.007
The truth. You don't wanna live
with Leonard and you know it.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.511
-Since when don't you want to live with me?
-You decided to move in...

18:58.720 --> 19:02.640
-...without even asking me if I was ready.
-I think we should talk about that.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.017
Since you love the truth so much...

19:05.227 --> 19:08.563
...why not tell Amy you don't wanna
live with her instead of blaming me?

19:08.772 --> 19:11.023
I thought we were talking about
the other thing.

19:12.526 --> 19:16.487
-You're a coward.
-Well, the evidence does support that.

19:18.949 --> 19:22.994
Come on, Amy. Let's go drink wine and talk
about what jerks our boyfriends are.

19:23.203 --> 19:26.706

I should move in here with you.
