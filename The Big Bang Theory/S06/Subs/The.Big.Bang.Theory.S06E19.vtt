00:06.548 --> 00:09.550
You said clean up. l'm cleaning up, heh.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.303
You can't just throw everything
in the closet.

00:13.471 --> 00:16.473
You can tell me what to do
or you can tell me how to do it...

00:16.641 --> 00:19.852
...but you can't do both.
This isn't sex.

00:21.896 --> 00:23.647
Well, what if someone looks in there?

00:23.815 --> 00:26.734
They're coming over for dinner,
no one will look in the closet.

00:26.943 --> 00:30.195
You don't know that. What if someone's
looking for the bathroom?

00:30.363 --> 00:31.405
It could work out.

00:31.573 --> 00:34.491
For all we know,
there's a toilet in there somewhere.

00:35.827 --> 00:38.495
Fine. After tonight,
we need to get a handle on this mess.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.706
We should show the closet to Sheldon.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.166
Why?

00:42.333 --> 00:44.835
Ha. Are you kidding?
He's like a savant at organizing.

00:45.003 --> 00:47.212
Everything in his apartment
has a label on it...

00:47.380 --> 00:51.258
...including his label maker,
which has a label that says "label maker."

00:52.385 --> 00:56.847
If you look really close at that label-maker
label, you'll see a label that says "label."

00:57.724 --> 01:00.768
No, he's our guest. We can't ask him
to straighten our closet.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.811
No, we wouldn't ask him.

01:02.979 --> 01:08.275
We'd just show him the closet and
let the goblins in his head take it from there.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.361

Hey, guys, come on in.

AMY: Hi.
-Ooh, it smells good.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.201
Thanks. Sheldon, I know tonight's
the night you eat Thai food.

01:17.368 --> 01:20.621
I went to the Asian market,
got the ingredients, made it from scratch.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.706
Oh, you shouldn't have.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.166
It was my pleasure.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.460
No, you really shouldn't have.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.670
I brought my own.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.173
You stopped and got him takeout?

01:31.341 --> 01:34.676
I had no choice.
He kept kicking the back of my seat.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.929
Sheldon, l've been cooking all day.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.431
Well, now don't you feel silly?

01:42.352 --> 01:43.560
Show him the closet.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.550
These spring rolls are amazing.
Good job, Bernadette.

02:15.009 --> 02:17.511
That's the takeout that Sheldon brought.

02:20.181 --> 02:25.018
I'm sure they wouldn't have tasted nearly as
good if I hadn't tried your food first.

02:29.274 --> 02:33.652
Howard, did you want your clothes
arranged seasonally or by color?

02:34.028 --> 02:36.613
-Color's fine.
-Wrong, they'll be arranged seasonally.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.492
Aren't you gonna spend
a little time with Amy?

02:40.660 --> 02:42.077
Oh, it's okay, I'm used to it.

02:42.245 --> 02:46.665
The other day at Whole Foods, he spent
an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.

02:46.833 --> 02:47.958
And some thanks l got.

02:48.126 --> 02:51.545
The assistant manager chased me out
with an artisanal salami.

02:53.631 --> 02:56.049
His quirks just make you love him more.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.720
Someone please agree with me.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.811
Come on. It's getting late. Time to go.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.689
Oh! Five more minutes.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.400
That's what you said five minutes ago.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.694
Amy and Penny are already in the car,

anything l wanna do?

03:19.282 --> 03:22.367
If he really wants to stay and finish,
I can give him a ride home.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.454
Please, Leonard. He said it's okay.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.499
Sheldon, it's--
Wait, l can go home without you? Bye.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.545
Howard, l have a few questions.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.340
I found three bowling pins.

03:36.507 --> 03:40.719
Now, do you juggle these
or are you missing seven?

03:41.638 --> 03:43.889
-Juggle.
-You health nuts kill me.

03:48.144 --> 03:51.021
Oh, my God, it's beautiful!

03:51.189 --> 03:53.899
And look,
you found the juggling pins I hid.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.984
Now, a couple more items.

03:56.152 --> 03:59.154
Howard, l found this letter
from your dad in a box.

03:59.322 --> 04:03.200
-Based on content, it could either be filed--
-Wait, you opened this?

04:03.368 --> 04:06.370
I had to find out if it's
personal correspondence or memorabilia.

04:06.537 --> 04:09.122
-Based on the content--
-I couldn't be less interested.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.710
Now, come on, I'll take you home.

04:13.878 --> 04:18.173
-Don't you want to know what's in it?
-If I did, I would've opened it years ago.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.760
The closet looks great.
Let's get out of here.

04:21.928 --> 04:25.931
Can l bring this box of extra shirt buttons
to sort on the ride?

04:27.642 --> 04:30.143
-Do whatever you want.
-Thanks.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.187
Oh!

04:32.689 --> 04:34.648
Great party.

04:38.319 --> 04:41.780
When I first met Howard, he'd pull
his scrotum out of his shorts and say:

04:41.948 --> 04:44.366
"Oh! l sat in gum."

04:49.414 --> 04:50.539
What is your point?

04:50.707 --> 04:55.377
It's kind of weird how grown up he is now.
Happily married, throwing dinner parties.

04:55.545 --> 04:59.715
Really? You couldn't just say that?
You had to tell the scrotum story?

It was a nice change of pace,
not eating takeout around a coffee table.

05:09.475 --> 05:13.770
We could throw a dinner party too.
Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.

05:13.938 --> 05:17.232
Sure. Just, when you say "dressed up,"
you mean nice clothes, right?

-No.

-Howie, you okay?
-Yeah, l just couldn't sleep.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.504

have espresso after dinner.

I know the little cups make you
feel big, but it's not worth it.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.429
It's this stupid letter.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.390
-Did you read it?
-No.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.602
-You must be curious.
-Of course I'm curious.

What's that about?

06:03.112 --> 06:04.404
Then why don't you read it?

06:04.614 --> 06:07.449
Maybe he apologizes
or explains why he left.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.368
He abandoned me and my mother.

06:09.535 --> 06:14.289
Why does he deserve a chance
to explain anything?

06:14.457 --> 06:16.124
I get that.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.710
So, what do you wanna do with it?

06:20.296 --> 06:22.923

really freaked him out.

And he was already having a tough day.
He accidentally wore my pants to work.

They were bigger on him than me.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.201
-Why?
-Got a little surprise for you.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.744
Come on.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.789
Oh, honey...

13:52.957 --> 13:55.959
...I am in no mood to have sex tonight.

13:57.461 --> 14:00.880
I mean, I'll lay there
if you absolutely have to have it, but--

14:01.048 --> 14:02.090
Oh.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.635
What are you guys doing here?

14:05.803 --> 14:09.305
You weren't sure whether you wanted
to know what was in your dad's letter...

14:09.473 --> 14:12.016
...so we came up with
kind of a cool solution.

14:12.643 --> 14:13.810
Oh, yeah? What's that?

14:13.978 --> 14:15.228
It's simple, really.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.481
It occurred to me that
knowing and not knowing...

14:18.649 --> 14:23.695
...can be achieved by creating a macroscopic
example of quantum superposition...

14:23.863 --> 14:29.868
...the principle that a physical system exists
partially in all its possible states at once.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.911
We were all thinking it, really.

14:34.498 --> 14:36.833
It was kind of the elephant
in the room, so....

14:38.961 --> 14:42.964
Anyway, um, l realized
if we each present you...

14:43.132 --> 14:45.633
...with an account of
what your father wrote to you...

14:45.801 --> 14:49.721
...only one of which is true,
and we don't tell you which one it is...

14:49.889 --> 14:54.058
...you will forever be
in a state of epistemic ambivalence.

14:54.226 --> 14:57.979
Yeah, and I said if it wasn't epistemic,
we might as well not do it.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.734
Sit down, honey.

15:03.652 --> 15:06.279
-Raj, you're up.
-Okay, um, ahem.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.616
It was a card for your 1 8th birthday.

15:09.783 --> 15:14.871
Inside it said, "Happy birthday, Howard.
I love you. Dad."

15:16.040 --> 15:17.790
Oh, and it was a "Far Side" card...

15:17.958 --> 15:21.836
...the one where the frog has its tongue
stuck to the underside of an airplane.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.798
Thinks it's a fly.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.384

[CLEARS THROAT]

15:33.307 --> 15:34.974
It was a map...

15:35.142 --> 15:39.729
...leading to the lost treasure
of famous pirate "One-Eyed Willy."

15:42.399 --> 15:45.193
Nice try. That's the plot for Goonies.

-Don't.

Amy?

15:52.743 --> 15:54.577
You didn't know it...

15:54.745 --> 15:58.581
...but your father was in the auditorium
at your high school graduation...

15:58.749 --> 16:01.125
...and he cried
because he was so proud of you.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.169
Really?

16:03.337 --> 16:06.923
Or that's complete poppycock which Amy
made up. It still could be the map.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.135
Penny?

16:11.637 --> 16:15.390
It was a letter explaining that your dad
wasn't who he said he was.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.684
Eventually his other life caught up to him...

16:17.851 --> 16:20.770
...and the only way to keep
you and your mom safe was to leave.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.855

-Don't.

is the most important thing...

throw it away like he did.

In the envelope was a picture of your dad
holding you the day you were born.

16:57.474 --> 17:02.562

"Howard, my son, my greatest gift."
