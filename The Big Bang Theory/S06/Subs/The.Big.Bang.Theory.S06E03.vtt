-Yeah.

color and consistency.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.572
Oh!

01:56.658 --> 01:58.325
Disgusting.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.954
No, what's disgusting
is he's still keeping track.

-No, no, no.

-Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?

Heh. Of course.

02:12.340 --> 02:16.927
It is-- It's been in the news.
And it's a very famous boson.

Nice try. No, in 1 964...

02:20.932 --> 02:24.184
...Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished
self-promoter and physicist...

02:24.352 --> 02:26.645
...he wrote a paper
postulating the existence...

02:26.813 --> 02:29.648
...of a subatomic particle
called the Higgs boson.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.401
Now, initially, the paper was rejected.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.695
But recently, he was proven right.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.698
And now he's on the fast track
to win a Nobel Prize.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.868
-Yeah. That's basically what l said.
-Yeah--

02:41.870 --> 02:46.707
The point is, Higgs is being celebrated
for work he did 50 years ago.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.083
So that got me thinking.

02:48.251 --> 02:52.880
Perhaps l've already hit upon the idea
that will win me my Nobel Prize.

I didn't know they gave Nobel Prizes
for making boom-boom in the potty.

scientific discovery in here?

my work through nursery school.

There's a good deal more to come.
I didn't really hit my academic stride...

...until I cut out that time-suck
known as playing outdoors.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.904
You're gonna spend hours and hours
combing through all this stuff?

03:17.071 --> 03:20.073
That's a good point.
My time is much too valuable.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.576
Perhaps l should find someone
to do it for me.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.287
Someone with a rudimentary
understanding of science...

in menial labor.

I wouldn't be asking.

may I offer you a refreshment?

an unacceptable choice.

to Leonard...
