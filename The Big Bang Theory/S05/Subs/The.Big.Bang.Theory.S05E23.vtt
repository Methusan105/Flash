Well, their technology isn't that bad.

When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz
capsule, you free-fall from space...

03:04.225 --> 03:07.477
...at 500 miles per hour, and the only
thing that slows you down...

03:07.687 --> 03:10.939

before you crash into the ground.

by the same brilliant minds...
