the street whose unknown provenance...

14:12.017 --> 14:15.478
...jeopardizes the health and welfare
of every resident in our building.

14:15.646 --> 14:19.649
Just because you have a focus on
cleanliness bordering on the psychotic...

14:19.817 --> 14:21.734
...doesn't mean I have to participate.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.822
All right. Name your price.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.618
Kiss me
where I've never been kissed before.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.789
You mean like Salt Lake City?

14:37.251 --> 14:38.751
Never mind. I'll talk to Penny.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.378
Thank you.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.380
Will you listen to me
play my harp now?

14:42.548 --> 14:45.258
No. I dislike the sound of the harp.

14:45.426 --> 14:48.469
Its overuse
in classic television sitcoms...

14:48.637 --> 14:52.432
...always makes me think I'm going
to experience an episode from my past.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.644
I'm sorry, Mommy. Don't be mad at me.
Don't do that.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.025
I don't know about this, Howard.

15:02.192 --> 15:05.570
What? You're having trouble
with the long-distance love-making.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.946
This is your answer.

15:07.114 --> 15:10.617
There are two interfaces
that simulate a human mouth.

15:10.784 --> 15:14.537
You have one, Priya has one in India.
When you move your lips and tongue...

15:14.705 --> 15:17.248
...it transmits exactly
what you're doing to hers.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.834
See? Internet kissing.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.509
Give it a try.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.054
I don't think so.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.723
I'll try it.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.355
Like this?

15:40.522 --> 15:41.606
Almost.

15:41.774 --> 15:45.109
Really get your tongue in there
to activate the motion sensor.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.196
Like this?

15:48.364 --> 15:52.575
-Close. Really French it.
-All right.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.752
-Better?
-Yeah, you got it, you got it.

16:04.922 --> 16:08.007
I'm impressed. This is very lifelike.

16:08.884 --> 16:11.135
Whoa, you just bit my tongue.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.596
Oh, I nibbled. I was being playful.

16:15.432 --> 16:18.309
Why do you have to
make everything weird?

16:18.477 --> 16:20.520
Sorry.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.485
-Better?
-Oh, yeah.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.996
Pretty cool, huh? Probably would have
cost, like, 200 bucks in a store.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.664
I do appreciate a bargain.

16:39.832 --> 16:43.418
This entire ensemble
once belonged to my dead grandmother.

16:43.585 --> 16:46.754
-You're kidding?
-Everything except bra and panties.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.425
They're a leopard-spotted secret
I share with Victoria.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.511
And now me, heh.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.848
I just have one question
about the chair.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.558
And what's that?

16:58.726 --> 17:01.686
Aren't you worried about it
being unhygienic?

17:03.605 --> 17:06.149
No. It's completely fi--

17:07.234 --> 17:08.609
Hmm.

17:08.777 --> 17:12.155
I get it. Sheldon sent you.
He put you up to this.

17:12.322 --> 17:13.448
-No, he didn't.
-Really?

17:13.615 --> 17:16.367
Yes, he did, he absolutely did.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.912
Oh, my God, Amy,
that's really crappy of you.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.330
-It is?
-Yeah.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.750
Letting Sheldon use you
to manipulate me?

17:23.917 --> 17:25.334
I thought you were my friend.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.920
No, I am your friend.
Please don't be mad at me.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.631
I can't even believe this.
Maybe you should just go.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.176
No, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I take it all back.

17:33.343 --> 17:36.596
Look, I'm, uh.... I'm sitting in your chair,
there's nothing wrong with it.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.557
Please let me continue
to be part of your world.

17:40.726 --> 17:41.768
Ow.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.144
What's wrong?

17:43.312 --> 17:46.272
Something in the chair is
biting my tushy. It's not importa-- Ow.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.982
Wait, wait, get up. Get up.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.818
[BOTH SCREAMING]

17:59.244 --> 18:00.703
Swear you won't tell Sheldon!

18:00.871 --> 18:02.830
I swear!

18:06.210 --> 18:08.377
Can I tell my doctor?
I'm gonna need shots!

18:08.545 --> 18:10.338
PENNY:
Yeah, sure!

18:16.386 --> 18:18.930
Oh, hey, babe.
I think I've figured this thing out.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.140
-Oh, Leonard, listen--
-No, you listen.

18:21.308 --> 18:25.853
You're my woman and I'm gonna make
you feel things you've never felt before.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.523
-Leonard--
-That's right, say my name.

18:28.690 --> 18:32.944
And beg me for more
because I'm gonna give it to you.

18:35.739 --> 18:38.324
My parents are here.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.121
Hello, Leonard...

18:43.288 --> 18:46.290
...if I may also say your name.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.174
-Check it out. Free chair.
-Yeah.

18:55.342 --> 18:58.219
You know, if this was in Sheldon
and Leonard's apartment...

18:58.387 --> 19:01.055
...I wouldn't wind up sitting on the floor
all the time.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.432
On three.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.143
[CHUCKLES]

19:05.310 --> 19:06.894
-Three.
-Three.

19:08.021 --> 19:11.357
What kind of idiot throws away
a terrific chair like this?

19:40.929 --> 19:42.930
