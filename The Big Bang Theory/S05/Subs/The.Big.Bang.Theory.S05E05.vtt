WEBVTT

00:08.550 --> 00:10.259
It's from Game of Thrones.

00:10.427 --> 00:13.095
-What do you think?
-I don't know.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.848
If we're going to start
a fantasy sword collection--

00:16.016 --> 00:17.683
And I've long thought we should.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.186
--is this really the sword to start with?

00:21.354 --> 00:22.980
What did you have in mind?

00:23.148 --> 00:27.234
Well, off the top of my head,
I'd have to go with Excalibur.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.987
It gives you the right to rule England.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.781
It would be a replica of a movie prop.

00:33.867 --> 00:34.908
Fair enough.

00:35.076 --> 00:38.454
It would give you the right
to rule a replica of England.

00:39.456 --> 00:42.833
Well, they don't have an Excalibur here,
so, what do you want to do?

00:43.001 --> 00:45.127
Ugh, tough decision.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.671
There's no weaponry
from Lord of the Rings...

00:47.839 --> 00:50.340
...forged in a Chinese sweatshop?

00:51.676 --> 00:54.303
Mm-hm, just Bilbo Baggins'
sword over there.

00:54.804 --> 00:58.682
Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger,
wouldn't we look silly?

01:00.894 --> 01:02.686
-Okay, let's go for it.
LEONARD: Heh.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.189
Oh, I see you guys have found
my little treasure.

01:05.356 --> 01:07.983
Yeah, pfft, it's okay, I guess.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.818
Okay? It's magnificent.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.487
Buh-buh-buh-buh.

01:13.531 --> 01:15.074
What do you want for it?

01:15.241 --> 01:17.159
Oh, it's hard to
put a price on something...

01:17.327 --> 01:19.828
...that's a copy of something
that was on pay cable.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.332
But for my friends, let's say 250.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.460
-Ooh, that's pretty steep.
-It's a limited edition.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.922
They only made 8000 of these
bad boys.

01:30.090 --> 01:33.467
Only 8000.
We're wasting precious time. Buy it.

01:34.302 --> 01:37.387
Hang on. Can you do any better?

01:37.555 --> 01:40.432
I'm already giving
you the friends and family discount.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.185
Oh, did you hear that?
The friends and family discount.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.646
We are honored and we will take it.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.065
Slow down. Two hundred.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.818
What are you doing?
250 is already a discounted price.

01:50.985 --> 01:53.904
-Will you shut up?
-Tell you what, I'll go 235.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.322
Nope. Maybe another time.

01:55.490 --> 01:59.451
-Okay, 225, my final offer.
-Take it, take it.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.497
-Two hundred.
-Man, you're killing me.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.707
Killing you? I can't breathe.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.044
Two ten and I'm losing money.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.880
Oh, no, we can't let him lose money,
Leonard. I'm so sorry.

02:12.590 --> 02:15.008
Two ten and you throw in
the Iron Man helmet.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.803
Are you crazy? That helmet's
signed by Robert Downey, Jr.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.054
So?

02:19.556 --> 02:22.266
If you're gonna question
the importance of a signature...

02:22.433 --> 02:25.310
...on a plastic helmet from a movie
based on a comic book...

02:25.478 --> 02:28.772
...then all of our lives
have no meaning.

02:32.819 --> 02:37.739
-Okay, fine. Just the sword, 21 0.
-Thank you. I can eat meat this week.

02:40.034 --> 02:42.202
See that? I just saved us 40 bucks.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.621
I've long said that what you lack
in academic knowledge...

02:44.789 --> 02:47.166
...you make up for in street smarts.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.209
-You want me to wrap it?
-No, it's okay.

02:49.377 --> 02:52.212
I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.299
-Hey, Stuart.
-Ah, hey, Wil.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.843
Hello, Wil Wheaton.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.515
-Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.
-It's part of my sword collection.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.976
-Do you have a sword collection?
-No.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.395
Heh, I'm not surprised.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.190
Here's the Batman six twelve...

03:11.357 --> 03:13.859
...with the Jim Lee alternate cover
that you wanted.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.528
-Oh, awesome. What do I owe you?
-Forty bucks.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.488
-Good deal.
-Sucker.

03:18.656 --> 03:21.450
He didn't even ask
for the friends and family discount.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.703
I'm having a party on Friday
and I was hoping you would stop by.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.997
-Will there be girls there?
-Of course.

03:27.165 --> 03:30.209
Because there wasn't last time.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.212
There will be girls.

03:33.796 --> 03:35.881
You guys are invited
if you want to come by.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.843
-Thank you.
-All right, great. Later.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.764
I see what you're doing.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.100
You accept an invitation to a party
at the home of my sworn enemy.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.269
He tells everyone
we're going to be there.

03:49.437 --> 03:52.397
And when we don't show,
he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.693
I was actually thinking about going.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.947
And then declaring the party
a fiasco and storming out...

04:00.114 --> 04:03.825
...leaving him humiliated
in front of his guests. Love it.

04:04.953 --> 04:09.081
No, I was gonna grab Raj
and Howard and have a good time.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.166
Ah, great, more guys.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.294
It's gonna be another Wil Wheaton
sausage-fest.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.782
-Sheldon, can you grab me a water?
-Possibly.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.452
-Can you or can't you?
-It's not that simple, Leonard.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.038
It never is, is it?

04:50.707 --> 04:53.166
At this moment,
our relationship exists...

04:53.334 --> 04:55.585
...in two mutually contradictory states.

04:55.753 --> 04:59.715
Until you either do not go
or go to Wil Wheaton's party...

04:59.882 --> 05:03.135
...you are simultaneously
my friend and not my friend.

05:05.013 --> 05:09.099
I'm characterizing this phenomenon
as Schrödinger's friendship.

05:11.394 --> 05:14.062
-Got it. Can I have my water?
-Yeah, of course.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.481
Now get it yourself, you traitor.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.903
-Wait, what is going on?
-In case you have forgotten...

05:22.071 --> 05:25.407
-...Schrödinger's cat is a thought--
-No, I didn't forget.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.452
Um, there's this cat in a box
and until you open it...

05:28.619 --> 05:30.579
...it's either dead or alive or both.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.707
Although our cat got stuck
in my brother's camp trunk...

05:33.875 --> 05:37.919
...and we did not need to open it to know
there was all kinds of dead cat in there.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.591
Homespun stories, knowledge
of physics and a bosom that defies it.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.302
You're the whole package,
aren't you?

05:46.554 --> 05:49.931
Sorry I'm late. Ugh, I got great news.

05:50.099 --> 05:53.935
NASA picked my team's design
for the deep field space telescope...

05:54.103 --> 05:56.563
...that's going on the
International Space Station this spring.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.482
SHELDON: Oh, woo, heh.
AMY: Wow, heh.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.984
-Howie, that's wonderful! Congratulations!
HOWARD: Uh, heh.

06:01.152 --> 06:04.237
It gets better. Someone has
to go up with the telescope...

06:04.405 --> 06:09.117
...as a payload specialist,
and guess who that someone is, heh.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.495
Muhammad Li.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.873
Who's Muhammad Li?

06:15.041 --> 06:17.626
Muhammad is the most
common first name in the world...

06:17.794 --> 06:19.378
...Li, the most common surname.

06:19.545 --> 06:23.048
As I didn't know the answer, I thought
that gave me a mathematical edge.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.427
It's me, Sheldon. It's me.
I'm going up in space!

06:27.595 --> 06:29.888
Technically, I'm an astronaut.

06:31.974 --> 06:33.850
-Heh.
-Hang on a second.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.519
NASA doesn't have a shuttle anymore.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.771
-How are you gonna get up there?
-Oh, uh, it's cool.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.190
You fly to Moscow,
they take you to Kazakhstan.

06:40.358 --> 06:44.194
Then you get in a Russian Soyuz rocket
which shoots you into a low earth orbit.

06:44.362 --> 06:47.656
Or it just sits on the launch pad because
the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel...

06:47.824 --> 06:50.367
...on the black market, heh.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.537
Are those Russian rockets safe?

06:53.704 --> 06:54.788
Safe as it can be...

06:54.956 --> 06:57.916
...when it was built by the folks
who brought you Chernobyl. Ha, ha.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.421
I'd like to propose a toast.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.090
The dream to go up into space
is one we all share...

07:05.258 --> 07:08.844

We're all very proud of you.

You're really quiet. Is everything okay?

Fine.

particularly masculine right now.

bugging you.

there's a saying we have at NASA.

What makes the right stuff so right
is that it always comes home.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.166

I was gonna be an astronaut.

you included me in the decision.

You actually asked Bernadette
to leave your house?

She went behind my back...

my own mother against me.
