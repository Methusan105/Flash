Hello.

00:11.803 --> 00:13.345
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper...

00:13.513 --> 00:16.682
...and welcome to the premiere episode
of Sheldon Cooper Presents:

00:16.850 --> 00:19.018
Fun with Flags.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.687
Over the next 52 weeks...

00:21.855 --> 00:27.026
...you and I are going to explore
the dynamic world of vexillology.

00:27.193 --> 00:31.321
Hang on, Dr. C. What's vexillology?

00:32.949 --> 00:36.326
Vexillology is the study of flags.

00:36.494 --> 00:38.245
Cool.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.707
I think I just learned something.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.085
-Did you have fun doing it?
-I'll say.

00:46.254 --> 00:50.049
Fun and information
are two sides to this video podcast.

00:50.216 --> 00:54.678
Not unlike the only two-sided state flag:
Oregon.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.473
Oh, look.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.933
Hello, Mr. Beaver.

01:00.852 --> 01:04.480
In future episodes,
we'll answer some burning questions.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.732
What's the only non-rectangular flag?

01:06.900 --> 01:09.526
What animal appears most often on flags?

01:09.694 --> 01:12.988
What animal appears second most often
on flags?

01:13.156 --> 01:14.990
And more.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.701
Sweet.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.871
Why are you waving a white flag?

01:21.039 --> 01:24.083
I'm surrendering to fun.

01:27.378 --> 01:29.296
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

01:30.006 --> 01:34.760
Now, today's episode of Fun with Flags
is not fun...

01:34.928 --> 01:36.512
...but it is important.

01:36.679 --> 01:39.098
Flags, you gotta know how to hold them...

01:39.265 --> 01:41.600
...you gotta know how to fold them.

01:41.893 --> 01:45.062
Let's start by identifying
the parts of our flag.

01:45.230 --> 01:50.067
-This edge is the hoist and it's used to--
-Excuse me. Sorry, excuse me.

01:50.568 --> 01:52.319
Cut.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.196
Did you not see we are rolling?

01:54.364 --> 01:56.907
I'm having dinner with Penny.
I have to get out of here.

01:57.075 --> 02:00.911
And I have flag knowledge
that I have to get out of here.

02:04.874 --> 02:05.916
[BOTH SIGH]

02:06.084 --> 02:09.044
-You okay?
-No, I'm a little rattled.

02:09.212 --> 02:12.089
But like the flag over Fort Sumter,
I'm still here.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.176
And take two.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.806
Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper...

02:20.974 --> 02:24.184

the dynamic world of vexillology.

02:34.279 --> 02:38.407
Hang on, Dr. Cooper.
What's vexillology?

02:38.575 --> 02:42.119
Vexillology is--
Why is there a face on that flag?

02:43.496 --> 02:44.872
It's Ferdinand T. Flag.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.666
I thought he might help
bring in some younger viewers.

02:48.084 --> 02:52.004
Confound it, you're right.
It's brilliant. Let's take it from the top.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.488
That was a really nice dinner.

03:18.656 --> 03:22.659
-I'm glad you asked me out again.
-Me too. I missed you.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.578
You see me all the time.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.830
You sure you just don't miss the sex?

[LEONARD CHUCKLES]

03:28.208 --> 03:32.711
Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great.
Have you ever tried it? Heh, heh.

03:34.088 --> 03:36.924
PENNY:
I have. You are not wrong.

03:37.508 --> 03:41.511
If we're gonna try dating again,
we should take things slow.

03:41.679 --> 03:44.389
Oh, I can take it slow.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.809
Did I tell you about my girlfriend
in high school, Karen Berberick?

03:47.977 --> 03:51.063
To this day she doesn't know
we were going out.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.651
Made it easier on her
when I broke things off.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.321
Okay, well, maybe not that slow.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.864
How about this:

04:01.032 --> 04:04.701
Are you familiar with the typical
development for computer software?

04:04.869 --> 04:07.371
You know, just for fun,
let's say I'm not.

04:07.956 --> 04:11.166
Before an application is released,
they give it a trial run.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.876
We could do that.

04:13.044 --> 04:16.255
And if we hit a rough spot,
instead of getting mad, we say:

04:16.422 --> 04:20.592
''Hey, we found a bug''
and report it, so it can be fixed.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.678
You mean like a beta test?

04:24.013 --> 04:25.973
Technically, this would be an alpha test.

04:26.140 --> 04:29.309
A beta test requires people that
weren't involved in the develop--

04:29.477 --> 04:32.312
Seriously? Do I not get credit
for knowing beta test?

04:33.648 --> 04:36.441
No, you should. Absolutely.
That was me being pedantic.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.735
And that's our first bug.

04:39.362 --> 04:42.698
You reported it, I can fix that.
See? This is good.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.325
All right. Let's give it a shot.

04:45.493 --> 04:49.621
Great. You keep a list, I'll keep a list,
at some point, we'll exchange.

-Night.

than software development analogies.

SHELDON: Cut.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.522
Take 47.

05:19.193 --> 05:21.611
Well, here's an interesting fact
about flags.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.905
I will take that action.

05:24.073 --> 05:28.201
''The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti
were identical by coincidence.

05:28.369 --> 05:31.788
A fact that wasn't discovered
until they competed against each other...

05:31.956 --> 05:34.166
...at the 1 936 Olympics.''

05:34.334 --> 05:37.878
And thankfully, their embarrassment
was overshadowed by rise of Fascism.

Let's see the new phone.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.842

peel the plastic off with me?

-Grab a corner.

has not one, but two cows on its flag?

for ''Why don't women like me?''

and allowing yourself...

14:32.454 --> 14:35.707
I certainly can be quieter
when we kiss.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.209
It was an expression of passion...

14:38.377 --> 14:42.463

as ''juicy and weird,'' who wants that?

on how my eyebrows are ''stupid''?

No, never mind. It's right here.

about four Chinese grocers...

Who's Siri?
Is he dating somebody new?

Yes. His phone.

Can I pour you some wine?
I think you'll enjoy it.

15:39.021 --> 15:42.023
Traditional choice with Peking duck
is a sauvignon blanc...

15:42.191 --> 15:44.859
...but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.152
I wasn't sure...

15:46.320 --> 15:50.198
...but I didn't wanna have an argument
with her in the middle of Trader Joe's.

for dinner?

15:58.040 --> 16:00.541

16:04.463 --> 16:08.383
''You can never go wrong
with a little black case.''

16:51.719 --> 16:55.346
I called your dad. I asked what things
you liked to do when you were a kid.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.726

out here so you could tip it.
