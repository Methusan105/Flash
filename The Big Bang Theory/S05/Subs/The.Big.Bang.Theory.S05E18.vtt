00:04.254 --> 00:07.214
I'm gonna run to the store.
I'll pick you up when you're done.

00:07.424 --> 00:10.968
Okay. I like it a little better
when you stay, but all right.

00:11.511 --> 00:12.803
-Hey, Sheldon.
-Hello.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.347
I'm here for my haircut
with Mr. D'Onofrio.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.517
I'm sorry, Uncle Tony is in the hospital.
He's pretty sick.

00:19.102 --> 00:22.396
Oh, dear, Mr. D'Onofrio's
in the hospital.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.691
Why do these things
always happen to me?

00:25.900 --> 00:28.610
-I can cut it for you.
-You're not Mr. D'Onofrio.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.739
I get my hair cut by Mr. D'Onofrio.

00:32.532 --> 00:33.991
You believe this guy?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.285
Excuse us for a second.

00:36.494 --> 00:38.871
Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it.
He's a barber.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.707
He's not a barber, he's the nephew.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.043
An example of the nepotism...

00:44.252 --> 00:46.503
...that runs rampant
in the barbering industry.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.299
Besides Mr. D'Onofrio knows exactly
how I like my hair done...

00:50.508 --> 00:53.886
...because he has all my haircut records
from my barber in Texas.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.013
What are you talking about?

00:56.222 --> 00:59.475
When I first moved here, I was nervous
about finding a new barber...

00:59.684 --> 01:03.395
...so my mother had all my haircut
records sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.025
There's no such thing
as haircut records.

01:08.568 --> 01:12.112
-Yes, there are.
-Have you ever seen them?

01:12.322 --> 01:14.740
No, but my mother assured me
they were sent here...

01:14.949 --> 01:18.619
...and I'll bet you dollars to donuts
that this one doesn't have them.

01:18.828 --> 01:19.953
Excuse me.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.498
Do you have access
to my haircut records?

01:22.707 --> 01:24.083
Your what?

01:24.626 --> 01:27.377
To paraphrase T.S. Eliot,
this is the way the world ends.

01:27.587 --> 01:30.672
Not with a bang but with a nephew.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.635
Sheldon, you're a grown man,
he's a professional...

01:34.844 --> 01:38.639
...and your haircut is number three
on that poster from 1 946.

01:39.474 --> 01:42.101
-Just sit down and let him do it.
-Fine.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.896
But if I come out of this
looking like a dork, it's on you.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.406
-So my kid said the funniest thing today.
-Nope.

02:01.955 --> 02:06.542
When you tell this story later,
the word we usually use is ''quirky.''

02:32.360 --> 02:35.237
-Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?
-Sure.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.364
[BLOWING]

02:43.496 --> 02:46.874
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to get the hair out of my eyes.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.878
Sheldon, you are one day late
for your haircut.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.380
Thank you
for captioning my nightmare.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.927
-Lookie here, I got my travel orders.
-Hmm.

02:59.470 --> 03:02.347
''Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz
is requested to report...

03:02.557 --> 03:05.559
...to the NASA Johnson Space Center,
Houston, Texas...

03:05.768 --> 03:07.769
...for astronaut training
Monday 8 a.m.''

03:07.979 --> 03:10.898
Yeah, but it's from NASA,
so it's 0800.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.274
But it says 8 a.m.

03:14.235 --> 03:18.238
-You read it as 0800.
-It doesn't have an O in front of it.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.991
It does have an O in front of it.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.703
Oh, my God, I'm an astronaut,
and you're dying of jealousy.

03:26.247 --> 03:29.416
So, what kind of things are they--?
Will you stop that?

03:30.376 --> 03:33.921
I can't help it,
I feel like a teen heartthrob.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.592
Sheldon, I used to cut my brother's hair.
I could do it.

03:38.801 --> 03:44.431
Penny, I know you mean well,
offering the skills of the hill folk...

03:45.433 --> 03:48.018
...but here in town,
we don't churn our own butter...

03:48.228 --> 03:50.354
...we don't make dresses
out of gunny sacks...

03:50.563 --> 03:53.815
...and we sure as shooting
don't get our hair cut by bottle-blond--

03:54.025 --> 03:55.734
Sheldon, be nice.

03:56.778 --> 04:00.656
I'm sorry, it's the bad-boy attitude
that comes with this hair.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.370
You could go to my guy.
He's at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.830
They bring you a cup of tea,
massage your scalp.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.500
It's $200 but sometimes
you look in the next chair...

04:11.709 --> 04:14.711
...and you see a superstar
like Tony Danza.

04:16.172 --> 04:19.258
Quick question here, have we actually
changed the conversation...

04:19.467 --> 04:23.220
...from ''I'm going to astronaut training''
to ''Sheldon can't get a haircut'?

04:23.429 --> 04:27.557
Now who's dying of jealousy?
''Oh,'' it's you.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.438
[SINGING]
I'm a cowboy

04:33.648 --> 04:36.400
On a steel horse
I ride

04:36.609 --> 04:43.907
I'm wanted

04:45.910 --> 04:49.913
Wanted
Dead or alive

04:50.498 --> 04:54.042
Sheldon, you're ruining
girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night.

04:54.544 --> 04:58.422
I'm sorry. I'm looking for a barber
and I'm running out of time.

04:58.631 --> 04:59.673
My hair is growing...

04:59.882 --> 05:03.510
...at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers
per femtosecond.

05:04.053 --> 05:07.347
If you're quiet, you can hear it.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.101
-What about Supercuts?
-No, I tried once.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.938
They do men's and women's hair
in the same room at the same time.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.899
It's like Sodom and Gomorrah
with mousse.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.904
Well, this isn't a crisis. Why don't
you just let your hair grow out a little?

05:23.114 --> 05:25.240
Why don't I let my hair grow out?

05:25.450 --> 05:27.367
Why don't I start wearing
Birkenstocks...

05:27.577 --> 05:31.997
...and seeking validation of my opinions
by asking, ''Can you dig it?''

05:33.666 --> 05:36.668
I don't know. I think
you might look sexy with long hair.

05:38.379 --> 05:41.840
With the kind
that flows down to your shoulders...

05:42.050 --> 05:44.134
...and blows back
while riding on a horse.

05:46.554 --> 05:49.514
Bareback and bare-chested.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.852
I'm gonna go brush my teeth,
it might take a while.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.777
-Hi.
-Hi, sweetie.

06:01.986 --> 06:04.446
-I miss you.
-I miss you too.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.948
So tell me all about your first day.

06:07.158 --> 06:12.788
Oh, wow, where do I even start?
I got to experience zero gravity.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.040
-Cool. How do they do that?
-It's pretty neat.

06:15.249 --> 06:20.379
You get in this plane that goes
almost straight up for like 20 seconds...

06:20.588 --> 06:24.966
...and then straight back down
like it's gonna crash...

06:25.176 --> 06:30.430
...and they do it over and over again,
no matter how many times you throw up.

06:31.432 --> 06:34.559
-You threw up?
-Yeah. And the craziest part is...

06:34.769 --> 06:39.856
...because there's no gravity,
the throw-up kind of floats there.

06:40.942 --> 06:44.945
In a little ball,
and if your mouth is open...

06:45.154 --> 06:47.406
...because you're screaming...

06:48.741 --> 06:52.786
...sometimes it just floats right back in.

06:55.039 --> 06:58.041
Boy, does everyone laugh at you
when that happens.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.043
-That sounds mean.
-No.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.753
I would have laughed too...

07:01.963 --> 07:03.797
...but I didn't want
the vomit to come back out.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.841
[LAUGHS]

07:06.050 --> 07:08.802
Heh. Anyway....

07:09.011 --> 07:10.679
Oh, could you do me a favor...

07:10.888 --> 07:14.015
...and overnight me
some more underwear?

07:14.225 --> 07:16.351
-Sure, why?
-I got a look at the centrifuge...

07:16.561 --> 07:18.687
...they're gonna
spin me around in tomorrow...

07:18.896 --> 07:22.190
...and I have a hunch
I packed a little light.

07:29.907 --> 07:31.533
Mr. D'Onofrio?

07:31.742 --> 07:33.118
It's me, Sheldon.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.873
They didn't have anything
barber-themed in the gift shop...

07:38.082 --> 07:40.083
...so I got you this.

07:40.293 --> 07:44.713
Don't know if you can read his little
T-shirt. It says, ''Get well beary soon.''

07:46.716 --> 07:49.676
Trust me, if you were even a little
conscious right now, you'd be laughing.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.470
[CHUCKLES]

07:53.514 --> 07:55.348
Anyway....

07:56.851 --> 07:58.477
There's new studies that show...

07:58.686 --> 08:02.939
...people in comas are aware
of everything going on around them.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.859
With that in mind, if you can hear me...

08:06.068 --> 08:11.615
...move away from the light
and toward the sound of these scissors.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.619
-Can I help you?
-Yes.

08:15.828 --> 08:19.206
Do you have something
I could use as a cape?

08:20.208 --> 08:23.585
Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills,
slip out of the ninth floor...

08:23.794 --> 08:25.795
...and go on a little adventure?

08:27.215 --> 08:31.134
Oh, no, I'm just here
to get my hair cut.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.594
[BLOWS]

08:34.805 --> 08:38.558
I see. Just wait here one moment.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.602
Security!

08:41.687 --> 08:47.025
I gotta run. But not with scissors.
That would be unsafe.

08:52.448 --> 08:56.743
So if I move my horsey here...

08:58.287 --> 09:00.956
...isn't that checkmate and I win?

09:07.922 --> 09:09.297
Hmm.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.718
Oh-- Is it or isn't it?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.680
You know, I think
this is a good stopping point.

09:18.516 --> 09:22.769
It's your first real game.
I threw a lot of information at you.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.145
No, your king is trapped.

09:24.355 --> 09:27.065
He can't go here
because of my lighthouse...

09:27.275 --> 09:28.942
...and...

09:29.819 --> 09:34.114
...he can't go here
because of my pointy-head guy.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.617
Like I said, complicated game.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.453
-So did I win or not?
-Did you have fun?

09:40.663 --> 09:42.789
Because if you had fun,
then you are a winner.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.083
That's what chess is all about.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.169
-Hello.
-Hey.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.338
Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move.

09:50.548 --> 09:54.009
Why? My spot, your spot.
What difference does it make?

09:57.888 --> 10:01.600
-Okay, what just happened?
-I don't know.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.019
Between you playing chess
like Bobby Fischer...

10:04.228 --> 10:06.646
...and Sheldon being okay
with you in his spot...

10:06.856 --> 10:08.940
...I'm guessing
someone went back in time...

10:09.150 --> 10:12.152
...stepped on a bug,
and changed the course of human events.

10:13.529 --> 10:17.449
-Sweetie, are you all right?
-No, I'm not all right.

10:17.658 --> 10:20.452
It's been six days
since I was supposed to get a haircut...

10:20.661 --> 10:22.495
...and nothing horrible has happened.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.582
Okay, I'm sorry, I don't understand.

10:26.292 --> 10:30.170
-Leonard, explain it to her.
-Oh, uh, he's crazy.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.508
I have spent my whole life
trying to bring order to the universe...

10:35.718 --> 10:38.345
...by carefully planning
every moment of every day.

10:38.554 --> 10:42.057
But all my efforts, our dinner schedule,
my pajama rotation...

10:42.266 --> 10:44.225
...my bowel movement spreadsheet....

10:45.853 --> 10:48.563
It's clear now,
I've been wasting my time.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.776
Good. I'm taking that disgusting chart
off the fridge.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.778
You know...

10:54.987 --> 10:57.280
...sometimes it's nice
not knowing what's coming.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.573
Look at me and Leonard.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.492
We went out, broke up,
trying again.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.118
We don't know what's gonna happen.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.788
Oh, please, everyone knows
what's going to happen.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.583
But I see your point.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.418
I think this could be good for you.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.797
Maybe it's time for you
to shake things up a bit.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.340
You're right.

11:15.549 --> 11:17.217
I should embrace the chaos.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.554
-Great. What are you gonna do first?
-I don't know.

11:21.764 --> 11:25.475
I could do anything. All bets are off.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.395
The world is my oyster.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.563
I got it.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.982
I'm gonna put on
my Tuesday pajamas tonight.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.240
I got to tell you,
I'm a little worried about him.

11:40.449 --> 11:41.950
If I were you, I'd be worried...

11:42.159 --> 11:45.704
...that a girl who's never played chess
in her life just kicked your ass.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.260
Hi.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.971
Howie, what happened to you?

12:03.180 --> 12:07.350
We did overnight survival training
in the wilderness.

12:07.935 --> 12:11.312
Big fun. Big, big fun.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.023
I was gonna freshen up for you...

12:14.233 --> 12:19.070
...but I blacked out a little
on the way to the bathroom.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.781
Survival training?
Is that like camping?

12:21.991 --> 12:26.327
Uh-huh. Except you don't have food
or water...

12:26.537 --> 12:29.247
...and they don't have
a sunset Sabbath service...

12:29.457 --> 12:32.125
...like they do at Camp Hess Kramer.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.795
-Do you sleep in tents?
-No.

12:36.005 --> 12:43.011
I slept in a hole I dug in the ground
with my bare hands.

12:43.763 --> 12:49.309
And at some point during the night,
an armadillo crawled in...

12:50.478 --> 12:52.729
...and spooned me.

12:54.690 --> 12:58.276
-Poor baby.
-But I did it. I survived.

12:58.486 --> 13:02.947
I wasn't sure
I was going to when the sandstorm hit.

13:04.116 --> 13:09.829
I just pulled my turtleneck up
over my head and waited for death.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.459
But somehow as I sat there...

13:14.668 --> 13:18.755
...wrapped in a cocoon
of my own neck-sweat...

13:19.340 --> 13:23.051
...I found that primal part
of the human spirit...

13:23.260 --> 13:29.933
...that just wants to keep on living,
heh-heh, no matter what the cost.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.977
You're so brave. I'm proud of you.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.939
I ate a butterfly.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.782
It was so small...

13:47.159 --> 13:49.035
...beautiful...

13:50.037 --> 13:52.580
...but I was so hungry.

13:55.417 --> 13:59.420
-Are you crying?
-No, I don't think it's possible.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.715
I'm severely dehydrated.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.469
My pee is like toothpaste.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.640
Howie, if you're not able to do this,
come home.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.601
It won't change how I feel about you.

14:13.811 --> 14:17.188
Thanks, honey, but I can't quit.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.649
If I do, I'd just be a guy...

and gave it up.

[SINGING] Penny meant
If he were a purple leprechaun

17:33.302 --> 17:36.846
I foolishly thought
it was some sort of musical booty call.

He must have been exhausted.

on long enough.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.327
Please come home
so I can cut your hair.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.872
Penny, you're not trained.
You're not licensed.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.959

access to my haircut records.

Thank you for letting me sleep
