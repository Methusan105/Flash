12:42.094 --> 12:44.637
Hello again, Sheldon.

12:45.514 --> 12:48.266
What is it now, Tiny Spock?

12:48.476 --> 12:50.393
I am very disappointed in you.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.062
You broke your toy
and switched it with Leonard's.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.398
You should be ashamed of yourself.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.609
You're the one who told me
to play with it.

12:57.818 --> 13:01.946
If I told you to jump off the bridge
of the Enterprise, would you do it?

13:02.156 --> 13:03.198
No.

13:03.407 --> 13:07.452
If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise,
I would never ever leave.

13:07.661 --> 13:11.331
Trust me, it gets old after a while.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.959
You must right your wrong, Sheldon.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.670
Why? I got away with it.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.799
Leonard has his toy,
and he's never going to open it.

13:21.008 --> 13:24.511
So he won't know it's broken.
And I have a toy that isn't broken.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.970
Everybody's happy.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.764
Well, I am unhappy.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.725
I thought where you come from
they don't have emotions.

13:31.477 --> 13:35.021
I come from a factory in Taiwan.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.690
Now, do the right thing.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.526
You know what you are?

13:39.735 --> 13:42.654
Well, you're a green-blooded buzzkill.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.948
Perhaps it's time you beam on
out of here.

13:45.157 --> 13:48.034
Fine. I will just use the Transporter.

13:48.244 --> 13:51.746
Oh, right, you broke it.

13:53.249 --> 13:57.710
Very well. Cooper to Enterprise,
one to beam up.

-Yeah, one sec. Ahh.

if she found out I broke my retainer.

Hey, uh, can I run something by you?
It's about Lakshmi.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.205
Yeah, sure. How are things going?

14:34.415 --> 14:35.582
We hit a couple of bumps.

14:35.791 --> 14:39.544
She lives over in Manhattan Beach,
so it takes like an hour to get there.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.462
And she's a lesbian.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.549
What do you mean, a lesbian?

14:44.758 --> 14:48.052
Well, you know whenever you and I
would try to hit on women in bars...

14:48.262 --> 14:51.264
...they'd blow us off,
then we'd tell each other they were gay?

14:51.473 --> 14:52.807
It's like that.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.310
Except this time, it's true.

14:56.478 --> 14:59.772
-Why did she even go out with you?
-She was looking for a husband...

14:59.982 --> 15:01.774
...so she can appear to be straight.

15:01.984 --> 15:05.361
And, you know,
it sounded crazy to me at first...

15:05.738 --> 15:08.323
...but I'm actually thinking about doing it.

15:08.866 --> 15:14.245
Okay. Well, so the reason that might
sound crazy is because it's crazy!

15:14.788 --> 15:16.748
Look, Howard, you're in a relationship.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.666
You know you have to make
compromises.

15:18.876 --> 15:22.128
Yes, but my compromises
are about which bedspread to buy...

15:22.338 --> 15:25.757
...or whose turn it is to do the laundry,
Bernadette's or my mom's.

15:29.803 --> 15:32.847

carbs again and let myself go.

Why don't you tell your parents
you wanna try to find someone else?

15:45.778 --> 15:48.571
You know, one who hasn't slept
with more women than you.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.699
Because this one wants to marry me.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.202
I might never find another one who does.

You're thinking about marrying someone
you're never gonna have sex with?

My problem is that I don't want you
to break Leonard's toy...

...which you probably did by shaking it.
She shook it, we all saw her.

Leonard, I bought you this
because I wanted you to have fun with it.

...discovered it was broken,
and didn't tell you.

-I didn't. That was a lie.

...and it was already broken,
so I switched them.

-I can't, because that was a lie.

And when the toy broke,
I switched it for yours.

the right thing and I defied him.
