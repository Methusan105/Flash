00:03.420 --> 00:04.962
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

00:05.171 --> 00:07.715
Hi. Did Sheldon
change the Wi-Fi password again?

00:07.924 --> 00:12.886
Uh, yeah, it's 'Penny already eats
our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.'

00:14.180 --> 00:16.015
No spaces.

00:16.224 --> 00:20.519
Okay. What makes you think you
can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?

00:20.729 --> 00:23.313
I believe that you're capable
of great change.

00:23.523 --> 00:27.109
Like, when I finally got you
to stop saying 'Valentime's Day.'

00:28.570 --> 00:30.195
-Wanna hear something weird?
-Sure.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.114
In the year 2000...

00:32.323 --> 00:37.244
...Pope John Paul ll was named
an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.540
What are you talking about?

00:41.750 --> 00:44.710
You asked Penny if she wanted
to hear something weird.

00:44.919 --> 00:47.254
Well, yeah, because I have
something weird to tell her.

00:47.464 --> 00:50.758
Oh. I thought it was a game.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.554
-What's yours?
-There's this guy, Jimmy Speckerman.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.931
He used to torment me
in high school.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.892
He sent me a message
through Facebook.

01:00.101 --> 01:02.811
-He's in town and wants to have drinks.
-Okay, Penny.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.938
If it were a game,
here are your choices.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.940
An e-mail from an old acquaintance...

01:07.150 --> 01:10.736
...or the head of one of the largest
religious institutions in the world...

01:10.945 --> 01:14.531
...slam-dunking
to 'Sweet Georgia Brown.' Pick.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.745
Just do it,
because he's not gonna let it go.

01:19.954 --> 01:22.956
-Basketball Pope.
-And that's how it's done.

01:25.376 --> 01:26.418
What are you gonna do?

01:26.628 --> 01:28.462
-Are you gonna see him?
-I don't know.

01:28.671 --> 01:31.840
Is this the fellow who peed
in your Hawaiian Punch?

01:32.592 --> 01:34.301
No, that was a different guy.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.971
Was he the one who wedgied you
so hard your testicle reascended...

01:38.181 --> 01:42.059
...and you spent your whole Christmas
break waiting for it to come back down?

01:45.480 --> 01:47.564
No, that was a different different guy.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.568
Was he the one who used your head
to open a nut?

01:53.196 --> 01:55.239
-No.
-Oh, oh, oh.

01:55.448 --> 01:58.325
Was he the one
who made you eat your arm hair?

01:59.744 --> 02:02.621
No, but actually,
that was this guy's sister.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.874
-Well, what do you think he wants?
-I don't know.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.918
The holidays
are just around the corner.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.964
Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge
the other testicle up there.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.049
I told you. That was a different guy.

02:14.676 --> 02:18.720
Mm, that's too bad. Could've spent New
Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.

02:22.809 --> 02:23.892
[LAUGHS]

02:51.796 --> 02:53.839
It's 2 a.m. What are you doing up?

02:54.048 --> 02:58.844
Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony
streaming live from Stockholm.

02:59.429 --> 03:03.182
Sure. Wanna see what all the scientists
are wearing this year.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.642
Look at these men.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.687
They've managed to win
the top science prize in the world...

03:08.897 --> 03:11.773
...with no more understanding
of the quantum underpinnings...

03:11.983 --> 03:15.194
...of the expansion of the early universe
than God gave a goose.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.116
You should pay attention, Leonard.
Someday it's gonna be you up there.

03:22.327 --> 03:25.037
-Thanks.
-So, what's got you up?

03:25.246 --> 03:27.664
Did you have a bad clam?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.834
-I didn't have clams.
-I don't watch you 24 hours a day.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.003
I don't know what you do.

03:35.173 --> 03:38.467
It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing.
I can't decide if I should agree...

03:38.676 --> 03:42.262
...to see him or not. That might be
because the last time I ran into him...

03:42.472 --> 03:45.307
...he made me floss
with my own shoelaces.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.684
Wear loafers.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.981
Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there
clutching that Nobel Prize.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.817
What's the matter, Saul?
Afraid someone's gonna steal it?

03:56.027 --> 03:58.946
Like you stole Einstein's
cosmological constant?

04:00.823 --> 04:04.034
You know what?
I am tired of living in fear of this guy.

04:04.702 --> 04:05.953
I'm gonna go see him...

04:06.162 --> 04:08.789
...and say the things
I should have said in high school.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.749
'Pick on someone your own size.'

04:10.959 --> 04:14.336
'No, you did not have sex
with my mother.'

04:15.129 --> 04:18.507
And, 'Yes, I do know
why I'm hitting myself.'

04:19.133 --> 04:20.968
Oh. Now Perlmutter shaking
the king's hand.

04:21.177 --> 04:24.263
Yeah. Check for your watch,
Gustaf, he might've lifted it.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.684
I love this dress.

04:28.893 --> 04:32.562
-How come I never see you wear it?
-Because when I wear it, it's a shirt.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.900
So, what's Howard doing tonight?

04:37.110 --> 04:39.653
Oh, they all went with Leonard
to confront his childhood bully.

04:39.862 --> 04:44.408
Oh. Terrific. High-school quarterback
against four mathletes.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.078
When Leonard gets back,
I'd love to check serotonin levels.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.914
Do you think he'd let me
draw a syringe full of his blood?

04:51.124 --> 04:52.958
Hmm. He's not crazy about needles.

04:53.167 --> 04:57.004
But if you get him to go jogging,
it'll just pour out of his nose.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.382
I don't think I can meet the girl
who was always mean to me.

05:00.591 --> 05:03.510
Tammy Bodnick.
One time while I was in gym class...

05:03.720 --> 05:08.181
...she stole all my clothes
and left an elf costume in my locker.

05:09.017 --> 05:13.103
-Oh, that's awful.
-Worst part was it was too big.

05:14.731 --> 05:19.151
That's nothing. In ninth grade,
the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.237
Within six months,
the nicknames began to fly.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.866
I think the one that hurt the most
was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.162
Oh. Wow, you poor thing.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.247
What about you?

05:32.457 --> 05:35.542
Oh, I don't know. My school
was a nice place. We didn't have bullies.

05:35.752 --> 05:39.546
Come on, no one ever gave anyone
mean nicknames, or picked on them...

05:39.756 --> 05:44.593
...or put gum in their hairy knuckles
so the nurse had get it out?

05:44.802 --> 05:46.303
No, we weren't really like that.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.056
We played pranks on each other,
but it was never mean.

05:49.265 --> 05:52.351
This girl, Kathy Geiger, got good grades
so we blindfolded her...

05:52.560 --> 05:55.395
...tied her up
and left her in a cornfield overnight.

05:57.607 --> 06:01.651
-God. That's awful.
-No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.904
Did Kathy Geiger laugh?

06:04.113 --> 06:08.533
Uh, probably. It's hard to say. She kind
of had an ear of corn in her mouth.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.370
Who would've thought?

06:11.579 --> 06:14.748
Fuzzy Fingers Fowler
is best friends with a bully.

06:15.583 --> 06:19.294
-What--? I was not a bully.
-Kind of sounds like you were.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.296
And maybe a felon.

06:23.925 --> 06:27.719
Shh. That's how you
wind up in a cornfield.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.267
Is that him over there?

06:34.477 --> 06:35.769
No.

06:35.978 --> 06:39.147
How about that guy?
He looks like he'd hate you.

06:39.357 --> 06:42.359
-I can really do this by myself.
-We're here to support you.

06:42.568 --> 06:46.780
No, you're not. You're here to see if I
get my underwear pulled over my head.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.366
You wore underwear?
Ha, ha. You fool.

06:51.619 --> 06:54.287
-You figured out what you're gonna say?
-You bet.

06:54.497 --> 06:58.542
I am going to make him apologize for
all the crap he pulled on me in school.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.795
That's quite a list.
I can't read your handwriting.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.088
What's that word?

07:03.756 --> 07:05.549
Scrotum.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.218
What's that one?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.512
Uh, stapled.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.265
Leonard?

07:13.474 --> 07:15.434
[LAUGHING]

07:16.185 --> 07:19.521
-Oh, hi.
-Holy crap, man, it's good to see you.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.273
Yeah, you too.

07:21.482 --> 07:24.025
Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon, and Raj,
and Howard.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.528
-Hi.
-Fellows. Can I get a beer?

07:26.737 --> 07:29.322
Wow, look at you.
Little Leonard Hofstadter.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.366
I hear you're a big-time scientist now.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.743
And there's the first zinger. Ouch.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.706
-I'm doing okay, I guess.
JIMMY: Okay?

07:37.915 --> 07:42.085
Come on, I read online you're a physicist
at a university. You won some medal.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.629
-The Newcomb medal.
-Yeah. Congratulations.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.882
Congratulations?
For the Newcomb med--?

07:47.091 --> 07:49.092
Oh, please.
That's the scientific equivalent...

07:49.302 --> 07:51.887
...of a smiley-face sticker
on your homework.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.557
-It sounded like a big deal.
-Oh, good Lord.

07:55.766 --> 07:59.895
Are we gonna stand here and listen
to him tear Leonard apart like this?

08:00.104 --> 08:03.106
-Hey, I won a Newcomb medal too.
-My point.

08:04.692 --> 08:07.110
You should've seen this guy
back in the day. Huh?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.154
He was so little,
he could fit anywhere.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.281
Lockers, trash cans.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.367
Oh, man,
how did you get inside that backpack?

08:16.579 --> 08:19.998
Oh, I can't take all the credit.
You helped a lot.

08:20.208 --> 08:24.753
-We were practically a comedy team.
-Like the Black Death in Europe.

08:26.672 --> 08:29.382
Jimmy, I'm kind of curious
why you wanted to see me.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.385
Okay, here it is.
I have this great money-making idea.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.846
I need a gear-head
to get it to the finish line.

08:35.056 --> 08:39.518
Mm, technically, Howard's the gear-head.
Leonard's just a dime-store laser jockey.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.019
What's the idea?

08:41.646 --> 08:43.480
-This is just between us, right?
-Right.

08:43.689 --> 08:48.443
Okay. What do you think about a pair of
glasses that makes any movie into 3D?

08:49.278 --> 08:53.615
That sounds amazing.
First movie I'm watching, Annie.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.911
How exactly
would these glasses work?

08:58.120 --> 09:00.956
How the hell should I know?
That's why I need a nerd.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.668
I don't think something
like that's even possible.

09:04.877 --> 09:08.004
Aw, come on. You could figure it out.
You're, like, the smartest guy.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.924
The smartest--? All right.

09:11.133 --> 09:16.096
I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm,
but, uh, even I know that was a doozy.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.100
You can't live
in fear of this man forever.

09:20.309 --> 09:23.186
-Sheldon, I got this.
-You clearly don't.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.855
What my spineless friend
lacks the courage to say...

09:26.065 --> 09:29.776
...is you're a terrible person
who took advantage of his tiny size...

09:29.986 --> 09:34.072
...his uncoordinated nature,
and his congenital lack of masculinity.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.575
-Sheldon.
-Leonard, I platonically love you, man.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.368
But face it, you're a mess.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.248
I don't understand.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.209
I think what he's trying to say
is that maybe...

09:46.419 --> 09:48.712
...in high school,
you picked on me a little bit.

09:48.921 --> 09:53.508
A little bit? The man super-glued
Hershey's kisses to your nipples.

09:56.220 --> 10:00.223
That's funny because those aren't the
kind of kisses you want on your nipples.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.310
-What is that?
-This is a list...

10:03.519 --> 10:05.478
...of your heinous acts
against Leonard...

10:05.688 --> 10:10.483
...one of which is certainly the cause of
him wetting his bed well into his teens.

10:11.152 --> 10:14.446
Fourteen is not--
Uh, yeah, never mind.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.241
What's this word?

10:18.784 --> 10:20.702
Nancy.

10:21.871 --> 10:24.456
You called me Nancy
for three years.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.127
You really need to work
on your penmanship.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.380
Man, l--

10:32.673 --> 10:34.633
I don't know what to say.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.676
I thought
we were just having some fun.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.511
Well, it wasn't fun for me.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.974
You're being too kind, Leonard.
You ruined him.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.477
Come on, guys.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.105
-That was pretty bad-ass, dude.
-I help the weak.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.483
It's yet another way
I'm exactly like Batman.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.029
And for the record,
Jimmy wasn't the reason I wet the bed.

10:56.238 --> 10:59.491
That one has my mother
written all over it.

11:03.621 --> 11:06.831
Anyway, I'm really sorry I made fun
of your stutter in high school.

11:07.833 --> 11:08.875
You're doing great.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.919
Uh-huh.

11:11.379 --> 11:15.256
Uh-huh.
Oh, God, just finish the sentence.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.930
Ah. Okay, well,
I'm sorry you feel that way.

11:22.139 --> 11:23.390
Bye.

11:23.599 --> 11:27.352
-No one wants to hear my apologies.
-Your mistake is doing it over the phone.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.355
I mean, if they could look into your eyes,
they'd melt.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.443
It doesn't matter what you did
in the past. You're a good person.

11:35.653 --> 11:40.615
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
You weren't just called a 'b-b-bitch.'

11:42.660 --> 11:45.245
Perhaps you could assuage your guilt
through altruism.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.209
Which word's tripping you up?

11:51.419 --> 11:53.294
Assuage or altruism?

11:55.047 --> 11:56.881
Both.

11:57.466 --> 12:00.051
You'll feel better
by doing something nice for someone.

12:00.261 --> 12:03.179
-Oh, I actually knew that.
-I never doubted you.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.766
Every other week,
I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.935
Ooh. I can't do that.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.855
If I stand over a steaming pot,
my hair just goes: 'Boing!'

12:13.607 --> 12:16.025
-Ah. What else can I do?
-There's Habitat for Humanity.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.736
Building houses for the poor.

12:17.945 --> 12:21.239
I don't have my own house,
I'm gonna build one for someone else?

12:22.324 --> 12:24.701
How about donating
some of your clothes?

12:25.619 --> 12:29.247
Oh, my God, that's perfect, because
I have so many clothes I don't wear.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.791
They're taking up space
I go shopping to buy more.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.294
I have no place to put it.
This would fix that.

12:34.503 --> 12:38.214
-What about helping people?
-And helping people.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.302
