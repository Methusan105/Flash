00:03.878 --> 00:06.588
SHELDON: The entrance to the dungeon
is a moss-covered door.

00:06.756 --> 00:09.967
You manage to open it
only to find yourself face-to-face...

00:10.135 --> 00:13.762
...with a hideous,
foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.681
What do you do?

00:15.849 --> 00:18.308
I say, ''Hey, Ma, what's for dinner?''

00:21.312 --> 00:23.313
Seventeen.

00:23.481 --> 00:26.775
The ogre is amused by your joke
and allows you to pass.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.612
By the by, I liked it too.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.116
How go the wedding plans, Howard?

00:34.284 --> 00:38.162
Great. Spent five hours last night
at Macy's registering for gifts.

00:38.329 --> 00:42.207
I'm finally gonna have that earthenware
asparagus dish I've always wanted, heh.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.503
See, this is the good thing about
having a girlfriend 9000 miles away.

00:46.671 --> 00:49.048
I can spend my nights
doing whatever I want.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.924
Like playing nerd games with us...

00:51.092 --> 00:54.219
...and then taking
a suspiciously long shower?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.515
Maybe.

01:00.351 --> 01:02.561
We enter the dungeon.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.730
You see a dragon.

01:05.356 --> 01:07.524
Really?
So we're playing Dungeons and Dragons.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.818
And we walk into a dungeon
and see a dragon?

01:11.446 --> 01:15.324
-Isn't that a little on the nose?
-When you play Chutes and Ladders...

01:15.492 --> 01:18.160
...do you complain about all the chutes
and the ladders?

01:20.455 --> 01:22.581
Are you gonna eat that whole pie?

01:23.541 --> 01:25.167
Maybe. Why not?

01:25.335 --> 01:27.753
Who do I have in my life
to watch my figure for?

01:28.755 --> 01:31.173
Oh, God,
did you watch Bridget Jones again?

01:32.383 --> 01:34.968
No, it's just that
everybody's got someone.

01:35.136 --> 01:37.471
Sheldon's with Amy,
Howard's getting married...

01:37.639 --> 01:40.307
-...you're dating my sister.
-Now that Howard's getting married...

01:40.475 --> 01:43.268
...maybe he'll inflate
one of his old girlfriends for you, heh.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.271
You know who I blame
for my loneliness?

01:46.439 --> 01:47.856
The United States of America.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.817
Your movies and your TV shows...

01:49.984 --> 01:54.071
...promised streets paved with beautiful
blonde women with big bazongas.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.699
Eat another pie,
you'll have your own bazongas.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.537
That's cruel.
You know it goes straight to my hips.

02:02.038 --> 02:04.081
Gentlemen, please focus.

02:04.249 --> 02:08.460
-You're facing a fire-breathing dragon.
-Unh, I don't know if I wanna play anymore.

02:09.087 --> 02:12.172
Because you don't have a girlfriend?
If that becomes a reason...

02:12.382 --> 02:15.717
...not to play Dungeons and Dragons,
this game's in serious trouble.

02:42.078 --> 02:45.038
Now, I assume we use this same wax
later on...

02:45.206 --> 02:47.916
...to neaten up
each other's bikini regions.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.044
Yeah, my bikini region is fine.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.255
Who's shocked? I'm not.

02:54.048 --> 02:56.216
[GIGGLES]

02:56.384 --> 02:58.760
So, Bernadette,
how's the wedding planning going?

02:58.928 --> 03:01.263
And I'm not asking
as a prospective bridesmaid.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.307
[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
Pick me. Pick me.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.978
We went cake tasting yesterday.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.563
Raj came along.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.900
He cried and ate half the samples.

03:13.067 --> 03:16.945
Oh, poor guy. He's so lonely.
We should set him up with someone.

03:17.739 --> 03:20.199
You know,
I met a really cute girl at work.

03:20.366 --> 03:23.202
She's married to a guy
in one of our drug trials.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.497
Well, hello? She's married, heh.

03:27.790 --> 03:31.793
Yeah, but her husband
is in serious congestive heart failure...

03:31.961 --> 03:36.298
...and a little birdie told me
he's in the placebo group.

03:38.259 --> 03:41.970
Okay, so future grief-stricken widow
is the one to beat.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.267
-You ready to order?
-One moment.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.186
I'm conducting an experiment.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.981
With Dungeons and Dragons dice?

03:53.816 --> 03:55.776
Yes. From here on in...

03:55.985 --> 03:59.488
...I've decided to make all trivial
decisions with a throw of the dice.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.032
Thus freeing up my mind
to do what it does best...

04:02.200 --> 04:04.576
...enlighten and amaze.

04:06.371 --> 04:10.082
Page 14, item seven.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.167
So, what's for dinner?

04:12.335 --> 04:14.878
A side of corn succotash.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.298
Hmm, interesting.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.509
Um, Howard,
can I see you for a minute, please?

04:20.677 --> 04:25.764
Ugh, I don't wanna show any more of your
friends how I can fit in the booster seats.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.017
Uh, no, that's not it.
Just come with me, please?

04:31.062 --> 04:34.815
Let's see what l'll be washing
that succotash down with.

04:36.693 --> 04:39.444
A pitcher of margaritas.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.698
Do you really want that?

04:43.074 --> 04:45.075
That's the great thing.
It doesn't matter.

04:45.243 --> 04:49.162
My mind is freed up
to think about more important things.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.956
What's it thinking about now?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.250
Hamburgers and lemonade.

04:55.169 --> 04:58.046
Um, Raj, there's someone
I want you to meet.

04:58.214 --> 05:01.466
This is my friend, Emily.
I know her from spin class.

05:02.677 --> 05:06.305
No. Raj, relax.
She can't hear you. She's deaf.

05:08.266 --> 05:11.393
Emily, this is our friend Raj.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.854
-Heh.
-Aw.

05:15.648 --> 05:19.318
Look at you guys, just hitting it off.
I am so good.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.408
Hi.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.370
She says, 'It's nice to meet you.''

05:30.580 --> 05:33.874
Did she really mean that
or was she signing it sarcastically?

05:35.209 --> 05:38.003
Raj says, ''It's nice to meet you too.'' Heh.

05:39.088 --> 05:41.506
Uh, she says she has to go back
to her family.

05:41.674 --> 05:45.469
But Penny has her number
if you wanna text her and get together.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.804
Okay, I'm gonna play it cool.

05:47.972 --> 05:51.433
Tell her, ''Maybe. Whatever, babe.''

05:54.729 --> 05:56.521
He'll text you, heh.

05:58.107 --> 06:01.360
Huh. Look at that. I have a date.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.736
I love America again.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.075
And now for dessert.

06:08.242 --> 06:11.703
Come on, hot fudge sundae.
Come on, hot fudge sundae.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.414
Bam! That's what I'm talking about.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.337
Okay. As soon as she gets here,
so she knows I'm cool with it...

06:20.505 --> 06:22.464

about her being deaf.

''Hey, did you hear the one about--?

06:29.222 --> 06:30.931
Oh, no, I bet you didn't.''

06:33.309 --> 06:37.354
Maybe we should revisit
your lonely, fat guy plan, heh.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.231
Oh, she's here.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.235
No joke.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.950
-She's sorry she's late.
-Oh, tell her it doesn't matter.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.994
Tell her her eyes shimmer
like opalescent lilies...

06:53.162 --> 06:57.040
...in the lake of the palace
of the celestial maidens.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.920
Really?
That's the first thing you wanna say?

07:02.088 --> 07:05.715
-I worked on it all night. Use it.
-I don't know the sign for ''opalescent.''

07:05.883 --> 07:08.218
-Then spell it.
-I don't know how to spell it.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.803
You're blowing this for me.

He likes your eyes, heh.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.976
You're making me sound
like a caveman.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.438
''Thank you, you have nice eyes too.''

07:19.605 --> 07:22.232
Really?
Ask her how many children she wants...

07:22.400 --> 07:25.193
...and whatever number she says,
say, ''Me too.''

07:28.364 --> 07:29.781
No.

07:30.575 --> 07:34.703
Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice
like James Earl Jones.

07:34.871 --> 07:38.540
She doesn't know
what James Earl Jones sounds like.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.626
Great. Then she won't know I'm lying.

07:44.130 --> 07:48.675

about me that would make you like me?

07:48.843 --> 07:50.302

08:00.229 --> 08:02.647
Oh. You're right.
Heh, everyone loves music.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.402
She says,
''Do you play an instrument?''

08:07.778 --> 08:10.113
No, but when I was 6 years old...

08:10.281 --> 08:14.993
...I tried to start a boy band
called Frankie Goes to Bollywood.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.540
But I couldn't get any other boys
to join...

08:20.750 --> 08:24.419
...so my parents asked the servants
to be my backup dancers.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.589
Wait, when you sign servants,
don't sign it like I'm bragging.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.634
Sign it in a way that I sound humble,
with just a hint of:

08:30.801 --> 08:33.303
''That's right, I had servants.''

-Do you hear yourself?
-Yes, but she doesn't.

every day.

on a doll head. Sad face, sad face.

-Think she's taking advantage of him?
-Oh, of course not.

if he's showering her with gifts...

...because the Koothrappalis
are vastly wealthy.

-What do you mean ''vastly wealthy''?
-Well, ''wealthy'' means a lot of money.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.611
''Vastly'' means even more.

I know they have money.
I don't think it's that much.

they're Richie Rich rich.

and Scrooge McDuck.

to pay off all her credit cards.
