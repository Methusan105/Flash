WEBVTT

00:03.253 --> 00:05.587
So, what kind of cruise is this
you're going on?

00:05.755 --> 00:08.424
It's called
the Born Again Boat Ride.

00:08.633 --> 00:13.721
Christian Quarterly gave it
their highest rating: five thorny crowns.

00:14.597 --> 00:16.598
I do wish you'd come with me,
Sheldon.

00:16.766 --> 00:20.227
Oh, well, Mom, if I did,
it would be conclusive proof...

00:20.395 --> 00:22.396
...that your God can work miracles.

00:23.273 --> 00:26.900
You're missing out. It's gonna be
wall-to-wall fun. It's all themed.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.944
There's Jonah-and-the-Whale
watching.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.614
All you can eat
Last Supper Buffet.

00:32.782 --> 00:36.118
And my personal favorite,
Gunning with God.

00:36.911 --> 00:39.621
What's Gunning with God?
I'm afraid to ask, heh.

00:39.789 --> 00:41.874
Oh, it is a hoot and a half.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.543
You write your sins
on a clay pigeon...

00:44.711 --> 00:49.089
...they fire them up in the air, and you
pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun...

00:49.257 --> 00:52.217
...full of our Lord's forgiveness.

00:53.219 --> 00:56.722
Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see
how advanced your group has become...

00:56.890 --> 01:01.310
...willing to sail out into the ocean
without fear of falling off the edge.

01:02.062 --> 01:07.316
For example, if Shelly was aboard,
he'd write ''smart mouth'' on his pigeon.

01:07.484 --> 01:10.194
And then: Bam!

01:10.904 --> 01:13.447
The Lord giveth
and the Lord bloweth away.

01:13.990 --> 01:17.785
Well, Mom, according to my itinerary
for our weekend together...

01:17.952 --> 01:20.913
-...the fun begins with fried chicken.
-Sounds delicious.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.707
Good, because I got you everything
you need to make it.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.501
You are in for a treat.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.337
My mother's fried chicken
is why we had to buy my dad...

01:28.505 --> 01:30.756
...the extra large coffin.

01:31.466 --> 01:34.176
Sheldon, she just got off the plane.
She doesn't wanna cook.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.594
Of course she does.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.347
Making me food is her way of saying
''I love you.''

01:38.515 --> 01:40.140
Making me food when too tired...

01:40.308 --> 01:42.684
...is her way of saying
''I really love you.''

01:42.852 --> 01:45.270
I wouldn't mind going out
for a bite, Sheldon.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.649
Won't that spoil our appetites
for the chicken you're gonna make?

01:48.817 --> 01:50.567
All right.
We're going out. You like sushi?

01:50.735 --> 01:52.277
There's a great place down the street.

01:52.445 --> 01:56.990
I've never had it, but there's no harm
in trying something new.

01:57.158 --> 01:59.535
There's a lot of harm
in trying something new.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.704
That's why we test out drugs
and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.125
Sheldon, you're talking
like a crazy person.

02:06.292 --> 02:09.837
Actually, I had him tested as a child.

02:10.004 --> 02:11.130
Doctor says he's fine.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.550
-Told you.
-I do regret not following up...

02:14.717 --> 02:17.219
...with that specialist in Houston.

02:43.746 --> 02:44.913
[ALL GREETING IN JAPANESE]

02:45.081 --> 02:47.291
Stop yelling.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.585
I'm not happy about this.

02:49.752 --> 02:52.588
What's the last thing
you were ever happy about?

02:52.797 --> 02:54.506
The prospect of fried chicken.

02:56.092 --> 02:58.093
This is exciting.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.679
Back home, the diner
on Route 4 serves sushi...

03:00.847 --> 03:04.016
...but it's just cut up fish sticks
and a side of Uncle Ben's.

03:05.310 --> 03:10.189
They put it on the menu in those kung fu
letters, but that don't make it sushi.

03:10.773 --> 03:14.943
Uh, ''Kung fu letters''
might not be politically correct.

03:15.361 --> 03:18.405
Oh, I thought the one
we couldn't say was ''ching chong.''

03:19.866 --> 03:21.867
Yeah, yeah, that too.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.454
So, Shelly, what's up with you
and your friend Amy...

03:25.622 --> 03:27.789
...if you don't mind
a mother prying a bit?

03:27.957 --> 03:30.792
Well, there's actually big news
on the Amy front.

03:30.960 --> 03:35.088
She's been studying the neurobiology
of addiction in lower animals.

03:35.256 --> 03:38.926
She's this close to getting a starfish
hooked on cocaine.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.471
You have any idea
what's going on with those two?

03:42.639 --> 03:44.473
Hmm. It's kind of like
the Loch Ness monster.

03:44.641 --> 03:48.227
Maybe there's something there,
maybe there isn't. We'll never know.

03:49.145 --> 03:53.065
But sometimes it's fun to creep
yourself out thinking about it.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.654
How are you doing
on the young lady front?

03:58.821 --> 04:02.074
I hear you're in some sort
of a long-distance situation?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.326
Uh. Yeah, it's Raj's sister.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.286
It's kind of tough. She's in India.

04:06.454 --> 04:09.122
Her parents aren't happy
she's dating someone white.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.999
Oh, that's a funny turn, isn't it?

04:11.167 --> 04:15.295
Because you-- You never think about it
going the other way.

04:18.174 --> 04:20.175
Well, you can't force things.

04:20.343 --> 04:25.013
Figure out if you're in a relationship or if
you're just calling it one. Like they say:

04:25.181 --> 04:28.850
''A cat can have kittens in the oven,
but that don't make them biscuits.''

04:30.103 --> 04:31.770
That reminds me of another saying:

04:31.938 --> 04:36.358
''You can lead a chicken to Crisco,
but you can't make your mother fry it.''

04:38.903 --> 04:41.029
You pester me one more time
about chicken...

04:41.197 --> 04:44.116
...I will put you over my knee
right here in this restaurant.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.995
Please pester her. Please, for me.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.209
Mrs. Cooper,
what did you think of the sushi?

04:54.377 --> 04:58.547
Good. The only thing that would have
made it better, if it was cooked.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.217
And if it was beef.

05:03.344 --> 05:06.305
Sheldon, when is your landlord
gonna fix the elevator?

05:06.472 --> 05:07.806
SHELDON:
I don't know.

05:07.974 --> 05:13.186
Lately, we've been talking
about converting it into a missile silo.

05:13.938 --> 05:18.650
Your son seems to think we need to
launch a preemptive strike on Burbank.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.070
SHELDON:
Get them before they get us.

05:27.994 --> 05:31.455
Hey, look who decided to show up.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.582
Raj, what are you doing?

05:33.750 --> 05:37.586
Well, I couldn't find you guys
so I bought six new friends.

05:39.547 --> 05:42.341
Three, sadly, are dead.

05:42.508 --> 05:45.761
Mom, you remember Rajesh?
Rajesh, my mother.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.930
Of course. Mrs. Cooper.
So nice to see you again.

05:49.098 --> 05:51.600
Well, it's so nice to see you too. Heh.

05:53.978 --> 05:58.398
I thought it was our Indians
that had the occasional alcohol problem.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.861
We don't say that, either.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.114
I'll make you a list.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.867
Oh, that would be
mighty white of you.

06:11.704 --> 06:15.415
So, Raj, what pain
are you trying to cover up...

06:15.583 --> 06:17.125
...with alcohol?

06:17.293 --> 06:18.794
-Nothing, I'm fine.
-Are you?

06:18.961 --> 06:20.962
[WHIMPERING]
No.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.465
That's better.
Now, tell me what's bothering you.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.884
I'm so lonely.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.304
Oh, yes, born alone, die alone.
It's a tragic human condition.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.641
Now, Raj,
if you'll excuse my mother...

06:32.809 --> 06:35.602
...she's about to make a pecan pie
that'll be so good...

06:35.770 --> 06:38.980
...I'll almost forget how she blew it
with the fried chicken.

06:39.148 --> 06:41.233
Sheldon, your friend is hurting.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.568
What do we do
when someone's hurting?

06:43.736 --> 06:46.071
Offer them a hot beverage.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.949
When they're drunk as a skunk,
what beverage do we offer?

06:49.117 --> 06:51.076
Coffee.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.078
And what do we do it with?

07:00.837 --> 07:02.421
Now, you listen to me.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.590
I know you feel
like you can't find someone...

07:05.758 --> 07:07.634
...but there's a lock for every key.

07:07.802 --> 07:12.139
Back home, there's a girl works
at the Walmart. Tall, tall girl.

07:12.306 --> 07:15.142
Woman could hunt geese with a rake.

07:16.352 --> 07:19.646
Thought she'd never find a man,
then one day, wouldn't you know...

07:19.814 --> 07:22.566
...Harlem Globetrotters come to town.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.028
Long story short,
today that woman travels the world...

07:27.196 --> 07:29.489
...with a semiprofessional
basketball player...

07:29.657 --> 07:32.868
...and two beautiful
mixed-race babies.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.372
I didn't get a lot of that
because of your accent...

07:37.540 --> 07:40.709
...but the general tone was soothing
and somehow I feel better. Ha, ha.

07:43.171 --> 07:46.214
I'm not gonna get my pecan pie,
am I?

07:46.716 --> 07:47.716
You want some Oreos?

07:47.884 --> 07:49.718
-Double Stuf?
-No, it's regular.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.220
Nice. Kick a man when he's down.

07:54.098 --> 07:57.726
I'm glad we're finally getting to do
something together, just the two of us.

07:57.894 --> 08:01.480
Sure. One thing you really miss
when you're on vacation is laundry.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.899
Careful,
you're using too much Downy.

08:04.108 --> 08:07.402
You know if my clothes
get too soft it makes me sleepy.

08:07.612 --> 08:12.199
Well, this takes me back. Me doing
your laundry, you next to me criticizing.

08:12.366 --> 08:14.326
It is nice, isn't it?

08:14.827 --> 08:15.869
[GASPS]

08:16.037 --> 08:17.078
Mrs. Cooper.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.748
-Hi.
-Oh, hello, darling.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.501
Sheldon, you didn't tell me
your mom was coming.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.086
It was in my weekly e-mail blast.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.547
Right between
''Beet season is finally here''...

08:27.715 --> 08:31.927
...and ''Uh-oh, red stool from beets
leads to cancer scare.''

08:35.389 --> 08:38.266
-So how have you been?
-Good, good.

08:38.434 --> 08:41.436
Leonard has a new girlfriend.
How are you doing with all that?

08:41.604 --> 08:44.940
Oh, fine. You know, it's, been a while.
I'm getting back out there.

08:45.149 --> 08:50.278
Let me ask you, when you get back
out there, are you wearing this?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.281
Well, it's super cute on.

08:53.449 --> 08:57.452
That top has paid for itself in free drinks,
like, 1 0 times what it cost.

08:57.662 --> 09:01.790
Yes, Penny has a lot of money
tied up in promiscuity futures.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.461
Hon, you think maybe the reason
why you're having trouble...

09:06.629 --> 09:10.465
...finding a guy is because you're letting
them ride the roller coaster...

09:10.675 --> 09:13.218
...without buying a ticket?

09:13.970 --> 09:16.555
Oh, they don't always get to ride
the roller coaster.

09:16.722 --> 09:20.892
Sometimes they only get to spin
the teacups.

09:24.105 --> 09:27.941
I'm going out. Would it be crazy to ask
you to look at the outfit I'm gonna wear?

09:28.109 --> 09:30.652
Oh, not crazy at all.
And don't beat yourself up.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.488
When I was your age,
you could have me for a car ride...

09:33.656 --> 09:35.490
-...and a bottle of strawberry wine.
-Ha, ha.

09:40.121 --> 09:43.790
Yeah, that will not be
in this week's e-mail blast.

09:45.585 --> 09:49.796
So this spring, I get to go
to the International Space Station.

09:49.964 --> 09:53.508
Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens.

09:55.011 --> 09:59.347
If you ever wanna live there eternally,
I've got a good book you could read.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.101
I watch the Charlie Brown
Christmas Special every year...

10:03.269 --> 10:04.311
...so I get the gist.

10:04.478 --> 10:06.646
I bet your mom is really proud of you.

10:06.814 --> 10:11.151
Nope. She says if I don't back out,
she's gonna go on a hunger strike.

10:11.319 --> 10:15.614
Um, it would take years before she'd be
in any kind of danger, but still.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.491
I've got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom.

10:18.659 --> 10:21.870
I'm taking you to see
Saul Perlmutter give a lecture...

10:22.038 --> 10:24.539
...about his Nobel Prize-winning
work in cosmology.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.375
And the best part is,
at the Q and A afterward...

10:27.543 --> 10:31.963
...I've worked up a couple of
Q's that will stump his sorry A.

10:33.758 --> 10:37.010
I don't know, Shelly. I thought we could
do a little sightseeing.

10:37.178 --> 10:41.848
What sight is better than your little boy
embarrassing a Nobel laureate?

10:42.558 --> 10:45.310
Come on, we'll take your mom
to see the Hollywood sign...

10:45.478 --> 10:47.687
...the Wax Museum,
the Walk of Fame.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.230
Ooh. Maybe a little Rodeo Drive.

10:49.398 --> 10:52.359
Well, I can't spend $12,000
on a handbag...

10:52.526 --> 10:57.072
...but it's free to look upon those
who do with righteous condemnation.

10:59.533 --> 11:02.160
-What do you say?
-What do I say?

11:02.328 --> 11:06.748
I say you people need to stop ruining
my mom's visit with your sushi...

11:06.916 --> 11:09.042
...and your sadness
and your slutty shirts.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.835
Stop it.

11:14.507 --> 11:18.343
He's not talking about your shirt.
Your shirt is fine.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.765
These are delicious.

11:23.933 --> 11:28.269
The trick to pancakes is bacon grease.
I cook everything in it.

11:28.437 --> 11:31.106
Everything?
Aren't you worried about your health?

11:31.315 --> 11:33.191
Doctors are always changing
their mind.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.110
One week bacon grease
is bad for you.

11:35.277 --> 11:37.821
Next week
we're not getting enough of it.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.199
Good morning, Shelly.

11:41.367 --> 11:45.286
Mom, I want to apologize
for my behavior last night.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.579
Apology accepted.

11:46.747 --> 11:49.624
Great. Now, you're gonna love
the Perlmutter lecture.

11:49.792 --> 11:53.420
Look, he will be stating that the universe
is older than 6000 years...

11:53.587 --> 11:56.047
...but you could stick
your fingers in your ears...

11:56.215 --> 11:58.758
...and hum ''Amazing Grace''
during those parts.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.469
I am still going out with your friends.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.722
But I apologized.

12:03.889 --> 12:07.809
And that was hard for me
because I didn't do anything wrong.

12:09.437 --> 12:13.148
Shelly, I hung out with you
in enough dusty lecture halls...

12:13.357 --> 12:15.984
...while you were growing up.
I wanna go sightseeing.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.821
So why don't you have some pancakes,
get dressed and come with us.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.574
I'm not going, and you can't make me.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.244
You're right, I can't. Have a nice day.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.164
Well, I'm going to stand here
until you change your mind.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.166
Then you are gonna stand there
all day.

12:33.502 --> 12:37.756
I'm just gonna take my bacon grease
and slide over there.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.426
I can't believe my own mother
is abandoning me.

in a basket on a church doorstep.

We appear to be at a crossroads
in our relationship, Mother.

-Well, I guess we are.
-Sorry. Syrup.

All right, Mom. When you're at
the Ripley's Believe lt Or Not Museum...

...if they have an exhibit about a mother
who threw away a chance...

13:11.373 --> 13:15.210
...to spend a day with the world's
most wonderful son, believe it, it's true.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.215

13:22.426 --> 13:24.302
That lecture was a waste of time.

of the expansion of the early universe...

Nobel Prizes for no good reason.

Sheldon, is it possible
that your foul mood or...

13:43.072 --> 13:45.448
...to use the clinical term, bitchiness...

13:47.243 --> 13:49.911

isn't making you a priority?

13:50.079 --> 13:54.165
No. Or to use the clinical term: Nuh-uh.

Are you sure?
The infant-mother pair-bond...

of primate psychology.

Oh, there it is. It always comes back
to monkeys with you.

Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.

There are aspects of you

...but when it comes to relationships,
you're like everybody else.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.729
Are you trying to suggest
that my emotional problems...

14:16.897 --> 14:19.983
...are no different
than those of a stupid person?

14:20.943 --> 14:23.862

that by not overthinking...

why don't we all do some praying?
