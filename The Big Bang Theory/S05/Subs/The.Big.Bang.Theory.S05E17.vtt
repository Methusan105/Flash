Well, what choice
did the university have? He snapped.

Rothman tried to have intercourse...

not a playground.

Take this up with your
department chairman.

he was on sabbatical.

his office window open and shut.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.613

a urine stream...

03:59.822 --> 04:02.407

of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.912
Those singing hooligans
really got my motor running.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.081
Sure, sure. Enjoy.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.708
You get it back to me
when you can or--

13:55.918 --> 13:58.127
You keep it.
It's just gonna be my gift to you.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.798
Thank you. Wait--
Where'd the painting go?

14:02.466 --> 14:05.510
-It's right over there.
-Why?

14:07.096 --> 14:10.139
I have no idea. That is weird.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.726
You hate it.

14:13.936 --> 14:17.814
-No, no, no. It's just-- It's a little big.
-I feel like an idiot.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.358
You're not an idiot.
Just help me put it back up.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.527
So you can just take it down
when I leave?

14:22.736 --> 14:24.946
-I don't need your pity.
-Oh, Amy, come on.

14:25.155 --> 14:28.283
I'm just glad
I didn't go for the sculpture.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.789
Ahh. The spoils.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.499
I see why victors love them.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.503
I'm happy for you, Sheldon,
but I have to admit...

14:40.713 --> 14:42.672
...I'm going to miss
sharing an office with you.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.173
Oh, of course you are.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.092
Well, feel free to drop by any time.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.303
-Thank you.
-Yeah. Call first.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.227
Oh, hello.

14:58.606 --> 14:59.647
Professor Rothman.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.859
This isn't your office anymore.
You're retired.

15:03.777 --> 15:08.072
I think the word you're looking for
is ''invisible.''

15:13.329 --> 15:14.662
I came to say I'm sorry.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.998
-Don't bother.
-Oh, Amy, please.

15:17.207 --> 15:20.627
I'm so humiliated. I sat there the whole
time we were watching Grease...

15:20.836 --> 15:23.171
-...thinking you liked the painting.
-I know.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.089
I was a fool from ''summer loving''...

15:25.299 --> 15:28.092
...to the last ''rama lama lama
ke ding a de dinga a dong.''

15:29.261 --> 15:30.595
You're absolutely right.

15:30.804 --> 15:33.973
I should have been honest
and told you the gift was too much.

15:34.433 --> 15:38.102
Yes, too much. Because our friendship
is fundamentaly asymmetrical.

15:38.312 --> 15:41.230
I clearly like you
more than you like me.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.567
I don't think you put a number
on how much one person likes another.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.320
I bought you a painting
that's 12 square feet in area.

15:47.529 --> 15:48.613
There's a number.

15:49.573 --> 15:50.657
Amy, come--

15:50.866 --> 15:54.827
If you don't like feet, you can try dollars.
The painting set me back 3 grand.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.996
Three gr--? Oh, my God.

15:58.832 --> 16:02.418
Look, Amy, all you need to know
is you are my friend.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.545
I don't wanna lose you out of my life.

16:05.005 --> 16:08.091
I'm sorry, I'm just having trouble
believing you right now.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.513
-Grab your hammer.
-No, damage is done.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.434
Okay, look, I didn't wanna say this...

16:18.644 --> 16:22.063
...but the real reason
I took the painting down...

16:22.272 --> 16:25.483
...was because it made Bernadette
very jealous.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.027
Oh, my goodness.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.405
How could I have not seen that?

16:30.614 --> 16:33.574
The painting is a constant reminder
that of the three of us...

16:33.784 --> 16:36.035
...she is the least cool.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.248
Yeah, that's what it is, so....

16:40.457 --> 16:44.377
-You have such a good heart.
-Oh. I try.

16:44.586 --> 16:47.797
-Come on.
-Well, where are we going?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.549
We're gonna put this back up.

16:49.758 --> 16:50.883
What about Bernadette?

16:51.093 --> 16:54.178
Oh, screw her. She's just lucky
we let her hang out with us.

I'm trying to raise the temperature
in here...

17:20.622 --> 17:23.374
...before my nipples
tear through my shirt.

17:24.168 --> 17:26.836
Why don't you
just turn up the thermostat?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.463
Aha. Good question.

17:28.672 --> 17:32.175
It turns out that the thermostat
for my new office isn't in my new office.

17:32.384 --> 17:35.094
No, it's next door
in Professor Davenport's office...

17:35.304 --> 17:38.890
...who is currently enjoying the hot
flashes associated with menopause.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.768
Why is there a hole here?

17:41.977 --> 17:44.062
Why is there a hole in my new office?

17:44.271 --> 17:46.481
I've narrowed it down
to two possibilities.

17:46.690 --> 17:50.401
There was something in the wall
that someone outside the wall wanted.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.903
Or the more disturbing...

17:52.112 --> 17:54.947
...there was something in the wall
that wanted out.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.160
At least you got a window that opens.
That's nice.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.590
-There it is.
-The bird?

18:12.800 --> 18:16.219
Yeah, it's completely out of tune
with the wind chimes.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.429
-So?
-You don't get it, do you?

18:18.639 --> 18:21.557
That's a mockingbird.
Mockingbirds can change their song...

18:21.767 --> 18:23.810
...which means
he's out of tune on purpose.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.854
He's mocking me.

Oh, dear, there it is again.
Do you feel it?

18:30.484 --> 18:34.320
The growing realization
that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.405
No. The vibration.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.741
We are directly
underneath the geology lab...

18:38.951 --> 18:41.244
...and they're running
their sieve shakers again.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.579
Hey, gravel monkeys,
you need to shake rocks?

18:43.789 --> 18:45.873

18:46.333 --> 18:48.876
-Sheldon, relax.
-How can I relax?

18:49.086 --> 18:52.380
My nervous system is being
stretched out like the strings of a harp...

18:52.589 --> 18:55.049
...and plucked by holes
and birds and wind...

just let Kripke have the office.

-Little higher on the right.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.542
-Now?
-Little more.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.919
No. That's got it.

19:33.922 --> 19:36.382
Yeah, okay. That's good.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.094
-I'll let you in on a little secret.
-Mm.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.139
Originally, we were painted nude.

19:49.563 --> 19:53.149
But I had him add clothes because
it was an unnecessary challenge...

19:53.358 --> 19:55.735
...to our heterosexuality.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.280
Yeah, good call.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.700
If you change your mind, all it
would take is some warm soapy water...
