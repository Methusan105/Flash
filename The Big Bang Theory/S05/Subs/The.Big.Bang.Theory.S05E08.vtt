00:03.461 --> 00:06.380
So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt
for bridesmaid dresses?

00:06.548 --> 00:09.758
Well, if you don't mind looking
like an orange traffic cone, great.

00:10.719 --> 00:13.762
Girlfriends, I have the answer
to our dress problems.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.639
BERNADETTE: Really?
AMY: Twelve years ago...

00:15.807 --> 00:17.933
...my cousin Irene
and her entire family died...

00:18.101 --> 00:21.770
...in a horrific carbon-monoxide accident
the night before her wedding.

00:23.273 --> 00:26.150
-That's horrible.
-Yes and no.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.236
All those bridesmaids dresses
remain unused...

00:29.404 --> 00:31.613
...and available to us for free.

00:32.949 --> 00:35.284
So it seems that cloud
of odorless, deadly gas...

00:35.452 --> 00:37.161
...had a silver lining after all.

00:37.954 --> 00:41.498
Check it out, still in the bags.
The gowns, not the bridesmaids.

00:44.502 --> 00:47.087
I don't know. Dead people's dresses?

00:47.255 --> 00:50.632
Yeah, and cap sleeves? Ehh....

00:51.801 --> 00:53.469
Hmm. I was hoping
you wouldn't notice.

00:53.636 --> 00:56.638
Irene was a slave to a good bargain
when it came to clothes...

00:56.806 --> 01:00.184
...and, sadly, as it turned out,
space heaters.

01:00.393 --> 01:01.852
Ladies, please.

01:02.020 --> 01:06.440
These four walls
once housed an intellectual salon...

01:06.608 --> 01:09.818

nourishment as well as the stomach.

01:09.986 --> 01:12.988
But through no one's fault, Penny...

01:14.491 --> 01:18.160
...the quality of dinner conversation
in this apartment has declined.

01:18.328 --> 01:21.955
And again, I'm looking at no one
in particular, Penny.

01:23.541 --> 01:26.210
Fine. What would you like
to talk about, Sheldon?

01:26.419 --> 01:28.545

Sheldon?''

Why do you hate us?

01:31.299 --> 01:33.842
I've prepared a number of topics
that should appeal...

01:34.010 --> 01:37.554
...to both the advanced
and novice conversationalists.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.431
Okay, that time, you looked at me.

as full of holes as their cheese?''

02:00.078 --> 02:02.621
-Who wants to look at bridal magazines?
-Oh, me.

I'm a lady.

comes an estrogen-fueled need...

02:16.261 --> 02:20.013
...to page through glossy magazines
that make me hate my body.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.060
-Well.
-New topic:

02:25.228 --> 02:29.565
''Women: Delightfully mysterious
or bat-crap crazy?''

Hey, Amy, what brings you
to our neck of the woods?

03:05.768 --> 03:08.562

loaned me a culture of prions...

mother who's been biting you all week.

off the table and change the subject?

03:41.846 --> 03:44.473
Can we? Stand back...

into a ''conver-sensation.''

-Yeah, we feel awful.

he proposed answering it with ''ahoy''?
