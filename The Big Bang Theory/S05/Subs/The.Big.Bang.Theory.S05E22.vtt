00:09.801 --> 00:11.093
[LAUGHS]

00:13.054 --> 00:15.431
I wish you could all be inside my head.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.642
The conversation is sparkling.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.771
Fine, I'll tell you.

00:22.939 --> 00:27.276
A lichen is an organism made up
of two separate species, fungi and algae.

00:27.485 --> 00:31.905
If you could merge with another species,
what species would you pick and why?

00:32.157 --> 00:34.324
Hint, there is a right answer.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.327
None of you will get it.

00:39.164 --> 00:42.624
Okay. Um, I'd pick swan
because, uh, the resulting hybrid...

00:42.792 --> 00:45.878
...would have the advanced
industrial civilization of a human...

00:46.046 --> 00:49.298
...and the long, graceful neck
I've always dreamed of having.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.510
Wrong. Leonard?

00:53.720 --> 00:57.056
Horse. But mostly just for the height.

00:57.599 --> 01:00.059
A little bit for the genital girth.

01:01.478 --> 01:04.772
Wrong. And let's keep it clean, shall we?

01:05.190 --> 01:08.150
Kangaroo. Uh, I'd be a kangajew...

01:10.070 --> 01:12.780
...the first of my people
to dunk a basketball.

01:13.281 --> 01:17.910
Also, instead of just living in your mother's
house, you could live inside her body.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.661
[LAUGHING]

01:21.498 --> 01:23.290
Clever, but also wrong.

01:23.541 --> 01:27.544
No. The best organism for human beings
to merge with is the lichen itself.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.839
That way you'd be
human, fungus and algae.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.549
Triple threat.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.343
Like three-bean salad.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.930
Give me one circumstance
that would be useful.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.141
All right, picture this.
A beautiful outdoor concert.

01:41.309 --> 01:43.936
Now, as a human,
I appreciate Beethoven.

01:44.104 --> 01:48.649
As a fungus, I have a terrific view
growing out of a towering maple tree.

01:48.858 --> 01:52.027
And no thank you expensive concessions
because as an algae...

01:52.195 --> 01:54.321
...I'll just snack on this sunlight.

01:55.406 --> 01:57.950
-He got us again.
-No, he didn't.

01:58.368 --> 02:02.830
Anyway, if it's okay with you,
we should talk about Howard's bachelor party.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.417
Seems like a bit of a letdown
after our lichen conversation, but....

02:07.585 --> 02:09.336
What do you know? You're half-swan.

02:11.005 --> 02:12.631
I did some research on strippers.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.092
One agency said
they can get us a great price...

02:15.260 --> 02:18.679
...if we're flexible on age range
and number of limbs.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.725
Sounds like loads of fun,
but I promised Bernadette no strippers.

02:23.893 --> 02:26.854
Heh, you don't want strippers?
You're the king of strippers.

02:27.021 --> 02:30.232
That one club in North Hollywood
named a pole after you.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.401
What can I tell you?

02:32.569 --> 02:35.612
-I'm not into that stuff anymore.
-Good. I'm proud of you.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.199
You're the first of us to get married.
We have to do something special.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.035
Germans have an interesting
pre-wedding custom--

02:42.245 --> 02:44.413
It's probably not for me.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.128
Maybe we can go up to, uh, Napa Valley.
They've got that wine train....

02:51.379 --> 02:54.965
Boo, wine. But, yay, trains. I'm in.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.010
Anyway, it's a beautiful time of year.

02:58.178 --> 03:02.514
You travel through the vineyards, there's
a tasting on board, and all the wildflowers...

03:02.682 --> 03:05.100
...are in bloom. It's magic.

03:06.477 --> 03:10.647
Look at that. In 30 seconds,
we went from hiring women to being them.

03:37.967 --> 03:42.221
So I hear you and the lost boys
are having a bachelor party tonight.

03:42.639 --> 03:46.808
Yeah. Just going to a restaurant, get some
steaks, Scotch. Nothing to worry about.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.227
Why should I worry?

03:48.394 --> 03:51.939
It's a bachelor party. There could be
strippers. Wouldn't that make you jealous?

03:52.106 --> 03:55.108
Uh, come on, Leonard, it's you.
What's gonna happen?

03:55.276 --> 03:57.236
If there was a stripper, all you'd do...

03:57.403 --> 04:01.740
...is avoid eye contact and maybe offer
to help her kid with his homework.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.660
Hey, I'm a young man
in his sexual prime.

04:04.869 --> 04:10.749
Under the right conditions,
I am capable of just really crazy stuff.

04:10.917 --> 04:14.002
Really? What is the craziest thing
you've ever done with a woman?

04:14.170 --> 04:16.505
The time we had sex in the ocean
does not count.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.132
Oh, come on, that's gotta count.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.511
There was a really strong undertow.
We could've died.

04:23.346 --> 04:24.680
Well, have fun tonight.

04:24.847 --> 04:29.810
Oh, I will. There is no telling
what might happen.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.521
Yeah, there is, heh.

04:33.773 --> 04:38.360
You know, there's nothing wrong helping
some woman's kid get through their SATs.

04:41.698 --> 04:45.492
I gotta hand it to Raj. He found
a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.

04:45.910 --> 04:50.205
It's not bad. Unless you compare it
to a train. And then it stinks.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.668
-Are you drinking whiskey?
-Indeed.

04:55.128 --> 04:59.006
If I'm to participate in the social convention
that is the stag night...

04:59.173 --> 05:01.466
...then I must embrace
all its components...

05:01.634 --> 05:06.430
...including tobacco, swear words
and, yes, alcohol.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.559
Jeepers, that's yucky.

05:12.645 --> 05:16.523
Whoa, it's a little early to start dropping
J-bombs, don't you think?

05:17.942 --> 05:21.320
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey. Nice of you to make it out for Howard.

05:21.487 --> 05:25.365
It was either this or another
hot tub party at George Takei's house.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.535
I'm confused.
I thought since our reconciliation...

05:28.703 --> 05:30.412
...I was your friend in this group.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.664
-Oh, I'm friends with Howard too.
-Oh.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.042
I guess you're just friends with anybody.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.713
Agh!

05:40.423 --> 05:45.177
Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight
at the comic book store.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.347
I might need some help
covering my share of the check.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.015
Oh, yeah. No worries.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.934
-And maybe a few bucks for the valet.
-Oh, all right.

05:53.102 --> 05:56.021
-And gas money to get home.
-Yeah, sure.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.941

this is my grandfather's watch...

06:00.109 --> 06:01.360
-Oh.
-...1 8-karat gold.

-Got it in Europe during the war.
-Wow, it's very nice.

out of knowing how it happened?

''Are you gonna take Howard's name?''

your cousin, the prostitute or Raj.
