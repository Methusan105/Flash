But they do move more sluggishly
when it's cold.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.386
That is so sweet.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.013
Heh.

13:30.226 --> 13:34.145
In 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna show you
how much this means to me.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.493
-Leonard?
-Yeah, hi.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.496
How's it going?

13:52.581 --> 13:54.999
Can't complain, thanks for asking.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.462
What were you doing out
at 3:00 in the morning?

14:00.047 --> 14:03.258
Well-- What are you doing up?

14:04.260 --> 14:05.844
I was using the bathroom.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.681
Yeah, well, so was I.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.769
Really? I didn't see you in there.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.065
Obviously.

14:19.275 --> 14:23.695
When I saw that you were in ours,
I went and used another one.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.615
Where?

14:28.158 --> 14:30.326
Uh, the gas station across the street.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.999
-In your pajamas?
-Yes.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.084
Without shoes?

14:40.087 --> 14:41.504
Yes.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.174
On a cold winter's night?

14:47.678 --> 14:49.554
Yes.

14:52.808 --> 14:56.644
That seems unlikely.
Did you bring your asthma inhaler?

14:56.854 --> 14:59.981
Uh, uh, yes, I did.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.361
Well, then l guess it's plausible.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.949
-Hang on a second, mister.
-What?

15:11.327 --> 15:15.997
After you used the facilities at the gas
station, did you make a purchase?

15:16.206 --> 15:17.749
What?

15:17.958 --> 15:21.753
It's customary when using the restroom
at a retail establishment...

15:21.921 --> 15:24.839
...to make a small purchase. Did you?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.634
No.

15:27.843 --> 15:30.219
Here's $2.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.725
Go buy some beefjerky.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.859
I don't want beefjerky.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.238
It's not about you.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.824
It's about a poor immigrant
from Pakistan...

15:51.992 --> 15:55.328
...trying to make his way in America
by working the graveyard shift...

15:55.496 --> 15:57.997
...at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.752
Fine.

16:04.171 --> 16:07.548
Needy baby, greedy baby, indeed.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.718
Leonard will be here in a moment.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.971
He's looking for
a different parking space.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.890
-Why?
-We were next to a car with an...

16:16.058 --> 16:18.893
...''ask me about my grandchildren''
bumper sticker...

16:19.061 --> 16:23.106
...and I was afraid if we ran into them
on the way out, I'd be obligated to do so.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.986
I'm so disappointed
it didn't work with him and Penny.

16:28.195 --> 16:34.325
Me too. Out of deference to them,
let's not flaunt our happy relationship.

16:34.576 --> 16:38.955
You have a keen insight into
the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.

16:41.041 --> 16:44.460
We are next to a Subaru
with a Gore-Lieberman bumper sticker.

16:44.670 --> 16:48.089
Well, I doubt they'd wanna
talk about that, so we're fine.

16:49.591 --> 16:52.677
I'm surprised to see you here
after it went so badly with Penny.

16:52.928 --> 16:55.847
Well, hey, we're grown-ups.
We can still be friends.

16:56.056 --> 16:59.434
Boy, I don't know if I could be friends
with Howie if we broke up.

16:59.643 --> 17:03.104
-Why not?
-I'm a very vengeful person.

17:04.982 --> 17:08.526
-Really?
-With access to weaponized smallpox.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.365
Let me get you some water. You need
menus, or you know what you want?

17:14.575 --> 17:18.327
Leonard knows what he wants, but it
looks like he's not gonna get it from you.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.622
-Howard.
-No, that's okay, Bernadette.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.833
Sometimes these things
just don't work out.

17:24.043 --> 17:28.129
Yeah. It's all good. We'll always
have feelings for each other.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.842
Oh. That's nice.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.970
See? She knew what ''always'' meant.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.723
Wow, you're like a dog with a bone,
aren't you?

17:39.600 --> 17:42.310
-I'm just making a point.
-Is the point you don't know...

17:42.478 --> 17:45.188
-...when to let something go?
-People, people, please.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.398
Before you say something
you both regret...

17:47.566 --> 17:49.025
...I'd like to place my order.

17:50.652 --> 17:53.529
Yeah, hang on, Sheldon.
You know why we can't be together?

17:53.739 --> 17:56.491
-Because you always have to be right.
-That is not true.

17:56.700 --> 18:01.120
I gotta go with Leonard on this.
He is wrong more than anyone I know.

18:01.663 --> 18:05.333
You know what, I just realized
I'm on a break. I'll get someone else.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.628
Promise me
when our new waitress comes over...

18:08.796 --> 18:12.632
...you will not start a complicated,
on-again, off-again relationship with her.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.300
Because I'm very, very hungry.

[PHONE BEEPS]

18:26.730 --> 18:28.022
Unbelievable.

18:32.528 --> 18:35.404
Mind explaining why you were being
a jerk at the restaurant?

18:35.614 --> 18:38.741
I was trying to act like we weren't
seeing each other. That was the plan.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.536
The plan was to tell people
we decided to stay friends.

18:41.703 --> 18:45.790
But that's a little hard to do when
you're always being such a toolbag.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.668
I don't have to stand here
and take this crap.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.378
Where do you think you're going?

18:50.587 --> 18:53.548
Isn't sex after fighting
kind of what we do now?

18:55.217 --> 18:57.593
Yeah, kind of, yeah.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.186
-What are we doing?
-What do you mean?

19:07.646 --> 19:11.107
Every scenario l play out
for you and me ends badly.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.568
Because you over-think everything.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.736
SHELDON:
Leonard, are you listening to me?

19:16.280 --> 19:18.990
-What? Yeah.
-This is a disaster.

19:19.158 --> 19:23.744
I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy
Mr. Spock cardboard standee.

19:23.912 --> 19:28.082
Why would I feel safer with
Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?

19:29.293 --> 19:32.670
I don't know.
He was pretty badass on Heroes.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.632
You're right. I'll give him a shot.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.802
Hang on.

19:40.095 --> 19:43.014
-Penny, you have plans for dinner?
-You guys going somewhere?

19:43.223 --> 19:45.308
No, I mean just you and me.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.810
AMY & BERNADETTE:
Ooh.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.271
Have you thought this through?

19:51.523 --> 19:54.609
Yes. And I think we should go anyway.

19:56.653 --> 19:59.113
No, can't do it.
Sorry, Quinto, you're going back.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.999
If you and Leonard get back together,
Sheldon and I will finally have...

20:10.167 --> 20:13.502
-...someone to go on double dates with.
-What about me and Howard?

20:13.670 --> 20:15.880
Fine, we can double with you too.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.132
So insecure.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.220
Where are you guys going to eat?

20:22.846 --> 20:24.889
Penny?

20:25.557 --> 20:31.062
Do you, Penny, take Leonard
to be your lawful wedded husband?

20:38.445 --> 20:42.406
Well, it's a little late for me
to start saying ''no,' isn't it?

20:44.034 --> 20:45.117
AMY:
Penny?

20:45.535 --> 20:49.497
Sorry. I just remembered
I've got to stop by the drugstore.
