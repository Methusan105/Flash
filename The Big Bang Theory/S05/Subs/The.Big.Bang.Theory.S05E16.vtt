with a fun way...

00:13.680 --> 00:15.681
Now, give me a number.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.641
-Five.
-Uh-huh.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.102
And an irrational constant.

00:20.687 --> 00:21.729
E.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.313
And a funny Greek letter.

00:23.523 --> 00:26.316
-Gamma.
-I said funny.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.445
-Upsilon?
-Heh, good one.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.406
And an electrical charge.

00:32.615 --> 00:35.034
-Positive.
-Ha, ha! Perfect.

00:35.952 --> 00:37.911
Okay, get this. Ahem.

I haven't seen him laugh that hard...

01:02.520 --> 01:04.772

made that multiplication error.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.399
Oh, Lord, that multiplication error.

He thought he carried the one,
but he didn't.

Guys. Guys, President Seibert

01:20.955 --> 01:23.248
HOWARD: I wonder what he wants.
-He doesn't look happy.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.750
I'm guessing he wants Sheldon.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.627
-Dr. Cooper.
-Told you.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.295
SHELDON:
Ah, President Seibert.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.214
I assume you'd like to respond...

01:30.423 --> 01:33.258
...to one of the suggestions
I put in the box by your office.

01:33.468 --> 01:36.678
No, and stop installing
suggestion boxes everywhere.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.931
You don't like written suggestions.

01:39.140 --> 01:42.101
You don't like when I give them
to you while in the men's room.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.437
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you're one of those people...

01:45.647 --> 01:47.981
...who are not open to suggestions.

01:48.191 --> 01:51.860
Dr. Cooper, the Physics Department
tells me you're refusing to take vacation.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.738
-I don't need a vacation.
-You're obligated to take one.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.866
And I'd like you to know
the most often received suggestion...

01:58.076 --> 02:00.869
...in my suggestion box you installed
without asking me is:

02:01.079 --> 02:03.038
''Can Dr. Cooper take a vacation?''

02:04.165 --> 02:07.167
Okay, it's settled, then. I'll see you all
on Monday. Except for you.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.087
But if I don't come into work,
what am I supposed to do?

02:10.296 --> 02:12.548
Read, rest, travel.

about us breaking up.

Once in a while, I think about how I didn't
leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged...

her financial interests.

Mr. Roper on Three's Company.

Here you go.

This is now the only lab with glassware
washed by a man with two doctorates...

...and a restraining order
signed by Carl Sagan.

You're being ridiculous.
Those are perfectly clean.

cerebrospinal fluid...

that died of syphilis.

will be a little bit more up your alley.

on these petri dishes.

There was something wrong
with that detergent.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.268
-That was way too bubbly.
-I'm sure it was.

Yeah, good for you.
Now start counting.

This is preposterous.

You're giving me these tasks
because you're afraid...

14:19.525 --> 14:22.986
...if you give me anything meaningful
to do, I'll show you up.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.029
Really? Is that what you think?

14:25.239 --> 14:26.447
Yes, that's what I think.

14:26.657 --> 14:29.659
And I'm super smart,
so it's probably true.

Hey, I've been training in the field
of neurobiology for 1 2 years.

you spent one of them in the bathroom.

Well, I'm sorry, it takes me a while to get
things going on an unfamiliar toilet.

I've given you the simplest things to do
and you haven't done one of them right.

That's because
I'm not being challenged.

It's the same reason
Einstein failed math.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.058
Maybe the math
was too bubbly for him.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.228
You think you're doing science
by cutting up that brain?

14:57.438 --> 14:59.105
They could do the same at Quiznos.

14:59.315 --> 15:02.567
And they'd offer to toast it for me too.

Okay, smart guy.

15:05.195 --> 15:09.157
I'm about to remove the locus coeruleus,
which is incredibly delicate work.

It is indeed in the brain.

Hope your hands are steady.
It's the width of a single hair.

But this is just biology,
so it's no problem for a genius like you.

15:40.272 --> 15:43.358
It's not. I will have you know
in the field of physics we work...

15:43.567 --> 15:47.236
...with particles so small they make
fat jokes about the locus coeruleus...

15:49.114 --> 15:51.783

sits around the house...

my hair down at a local watering hole.
