00:02.377 --> 00:04.586
Okay, Raj...

00:04.754 --> 00:07.214
...hand me the number six
Torx screwdriver.

00:08.883 --> 00:10.092
Stop.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.886
We can't do this. It's not right.

00:13.054 --> 00:14.680
Sheldon, you have got two choices.

00:14.848 --> 00:18.434
Put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo
or delete stuff before we go out of town.

00:18.601 --> 00:21.478
But once you open the box,
you've voided the warranty.

00:22.188 --> 00:26.108
The warranty is a sacred covenant
we've entered into with the manufacturer.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.943
He offers to stand by his equipment.

00:28.111 --> 00:31.655
We in return agree not to violate
the integrity of the internal hardware.

00:31.823 --> 00:36.785
This little orange sticker is all that stands
between us and anarchy.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.955
Okay,
then we won't touch the hard drive.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.875
We'll just erase the first season
of Battlestar.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.628
There. We're outlaws.

00:48.506 --> 00:52.051
-Here you go, Leonard. Is this big enough?
-It's perfect.

00:54.387 --> 00:58.515
For taking daffodils to your unicorn.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.101
It's just for my notebooks.
Thanks, Penny.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.854
I love San Francisco.
I wish I was going with you.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.230
I understand your envy.

01:05.398 --> 01:07.441
This is a can't-miss symposium.

01:07.609 --> 01:11.236
There are going to be discussions
on bioorganic cellular computer devices...

01:11.404 --> 01:13.822
...advancements
in multi-threaded task completion...

01:13.990 --> 01:17.659
...plus a round table on the non-equilibrium
Green's Function approach...

01:17.827 --> 01:20.037
...to the photoionization process
in atoms.

01:21.164 --> 01:24.792
When I go, I usually just get hammered
and ride the cable cars.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.835
This conference is a big thing.

01:27.003 --> 01:29.379
The keynote address
is delivered by George Smoot.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.715
Oh, my God. The George Smoot?

01:31.883 --> 01:34.718
-You've heard of him?
-Of course I haven't.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.597
George Smoot
is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist...

01:38.765 --> 01:40.641
...one of the great minds of our time.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.351
His work in black body form...

01:42.519 --> 01:45.521
...and anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background radiation...

01:45.688 --> 01:48.982
...cemented our understanding
of the origin of the universe.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.859
It's kind of a funny name though.

01:51.027 --> 01:53.028
Smoot.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.491
It's like talking to a chimp.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.246
Okay, now that I've been completely
insulted, have a good flight.

02:02.413 --> 02:05.541
-Yeah, I wish.
-We're not flying. We're taking the train.

02:05.708 --> 02:06.792
Oh, cool.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.672
Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying
and costs almost twice as much.

02:13.049 --> 02:15.509
-Well then why are you doing it?
-Well, we had a vote.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.095
Three voted for airplane,
Sheldon voted for train.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.722
So we're taking the train.

02:21.558 --> 02:25.936
Don't say it like that, Leonard.
Say it like, "We're taking the train!"

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

02:53.047 --> 02:55.799
We're going to the Apple store
to make fun of the Genius Bar.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.467
You wanna come?

02:57.844 --> 03:01.180
Oh, I always enjoy that,
but I'm a little busy.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.431
What are you doing?

03:02.599 --> 03:04.892
I'm simplifying the task of packing
for our trip.

03:05.059 --> 03:07.102
See, by attaching RFID tags
to my clothing...

03:07.270 --> 03:11.231
...it will enable my laptop to read
and identify the items with this wand.

03:11.399 --> 03:15.068
Then cross-reference them against
destination, anticipated activity spectrum...

03:15.236 --> 03:18.113
...weather conditions,
duration of trip, etc.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.619
Well, that does sound much simpler.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.705
How long is this gonna take?

03:26.873 --> 03:29.541
Assuming I can keep up this pace,
three hours 11 minutes.

03:29.709 --> 03:33.587
Plus however long it takes to conclude
this fairly pointless conversation.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.631
Wow.

03:35.965 --> 03:39.218
Teasing the guys at the Apple store
seems a little redundant now.

03:39.385 --> 03:42.679
-I don't follow.
-I wouldn't expect you to. I'll see you later.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.332
Whatever it is,
I'm guessing we're doing it wrong.

04:10.500 --> 04:14.253
Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight...

04:14.420 --> 04:19.174
...one of the great American trains operating
on one of the classic American routes.

04:19.342 --> 04:22.177
On this side,
you'll see panoramic ocean vistas...

04:22.345 --> 04:25.138
...inaccessible
to any other form of transportation.

04:25.306 --> 04:28.600
While on your side
you'll be treated to 350 miles...

04:28.768 --> 04:32.521
...of Costcos, Jiffy Lubes and cinder block
homes with above-ground pools.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.276
-Come on, Raj.
-What's wrong with Jiffy Lubes?

04:39.028 --> 04:40.445
No.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.699
-Why not?
-That's over the wheelbase.

04:43.866 --> 04:47.035
Are you completely unfamiliar
with the suspension characteristics...

04:47.203 --> 04:51.081
...of a pre-1980 Pullman-built
Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?

04:51.249 --> 04:53.375
Sheldon,
we've been on this train 90 seconds...

04:53.543 --> 04:55.794
...and you've already said
a thousand words.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.797
Just tell us where to sit and shut up.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.217

05:02.385 --> 05:05.053
I'm hoping once you reap
the endorphic rewards...

05:05.221 --> 05:08.390
...of the steady clickety-clack
of steel wheels on polished rails...

05:08.558 --> 05:11.560
-...your sour disposition will abate.
-Yeah, maybe.

05:11.728 --> 05:17.065
Back in the 21st century, people are raising
tray tables and putting seat-backs upright...

05:17.233 --> 05:20.235
...because it's time to land
in San Francisco.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.739
It's not so bad really.
At least these trains have modern plumbing.

05:23.906 --> 05:27.576
In India, you squat over a hole in the train
and expose your naked buttocks...

05:27.744 --> 05:29.578
...to the chilly air of Rajasthan.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.331

What would Summer Glau
be doing riding the train?

Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's
protecting him from an evil Terminator.

That's a television show, Leonard.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.111

If Skynet did exist in the future, a perfect
way to infiltrate and destroy mankind...

06:08.451 --> 06:10.702
...would be to send Terminators back
as actors...

06:10.870 --> 06:13.538
...who have played Terminators
in films and television...

06:13.706 --> 06:16.041
...lulling us into a false sense
of security, i.e.:

06:16.209 --> 06:18.627
"That's Summer Glau
from The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

Sheldon, I owe you an apology.

06:33.726 --> 06:37.979
Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance.
I've actually got a shot at a Terminator.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.981
Please. When it comes to Terminators...

06:40.149 --> 06:43.360
...you've got a better shot of scoring
with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.154
You're overlooking something.

06:46.322 --> 06:50.784
I have 11 hours with her
in a confined space.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.662
Unless she's willing to jump off
a moving train...

06:53.830 --> 06:57.457
...tuck and roll down the side of a hill,
she will eventually succumb...

06:57.625 --> 07:02.087
...to the acquired taste
that is Howard Wolowitz.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.800

07:08.928 --> 07:13.640
I thought you were involved in some sort of
socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.

07:13.808 --> 07:17.477
-Let me explain to you how this works.
-All right.

07:17.645 --> 07:20.147
-That's Summer Glau.
-Yes?

-Why do you get first crack at her?
-Uh, well, let's see. Couple reasons.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.781
One, I saw her first.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.032
No, you didn't. I did.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.536
Fair enough. But then let me move on
to number two.

Unlike you, I can actually talk to women
when I'm sober.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.544
You fail to take into account
that even mute, I am foreign and exotic...

07:42.712 --> 07:46.548
...while you, on the other hand,
are frail and pasty.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.817
Your dresser? Who is this?

12:16.485 --> 12:17.485
It's Sheldon.

12:17.653 --> 12:20.113
PENNY: Oh, hey, Sheldon.
How's San Francisco?

12:20.489 --> 12:24.576
I'm not in San Francisco. I'm on a tra--
Were you even listening to me?

12:24.744 --> 12:28.496
-No, I was talking to my friend. What's up?
-What's up? I'll tell you what's up.

12:28.664 --> 12:29.956
I'm in a crisis situation...

12:30.124 --> 12:33.710
... I need you to marshal your powers
of concentration, limited as they may be--

12:33.878 --> 12:35.670
Give me the phone.

12:37.339 --> 12:38.423
Hi, Penny, it's Leonard.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.843
Hey, Leonard, what's going on
with Dr. Wackadoodle?

12:42.803 --> 12:45.513
He's calling to ask you a favor.
You might be confused...

12:45.681 --> 12:49.517
...because he didn't use the words "Penny,"
"Sheldon," "please" or "favor."

12:49.685 --> 12:51.978
Okay. Enough chitchat.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.774
Okay, step one: Locate your emergency key
to our apartment.

12:55.941 --> 13:00.528
Step two: Enter our apartment.
Step three....

13:01.322 --> 13:02.822
Enter my bedroom.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.700
SHELDON: Step four--
-Yeah, hang on, getting another call.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.368
No!

13:07.536 --> 13:10.830
Let me tell you something. Personal
robots cannot get here soon enough.

13:14.418 --> 13:18.213
And that bright little star
peeking her head out early today...

13:18.380 --> 13:20.381
...that's Venus.

13:20.549 --> 13:21.925
That is so cool.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.052
You know a lot about space.

13:24.512 --> 13:30.391
Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly,
you were actually in space.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.144
You're not one of those guys
who believe that?

13:33.771 --> 13:37.065
You mean one of the hopeless geeks?
No.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.691
Those are crazy people.

[BOTH CHUCKLING]

13:41.904 --> 13:45.156
Howard, be a dear
and get me another one of these.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.914
Now him, he's one of those geeks.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.085
All right, now before you enter
my bedroom unescorted...

13:57.253 --> 14:00.380
... I need you to understand
that this one time grant of access...

14:00.548 --> 14:03.675
...does not create a permanent easement.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.510
Easement.

14:07.054 --> 14:10.181
It's a legal right of access. Good grief.

14:12.101 --> 14:15.478
What? No, don't put me on hold. I--
Oh....

14:17.273 --> 14:18.731
HOWARD:
Do you believe him?

14:18.899 --> 14:23.194
Normally around women,
he has the personality of a boiled potato.

14:23.362 --> 14:26.614
Put one beer in him,
and he's M. Knight Charmalarmalon.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.662
Is that what he's drinking?
It's not even real beer.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.038
-What?
-Look at it.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.125
Non-alcoholic beer.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.545
-Then what's going on?
-I don't know.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.298
Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.925
Placebo, you say.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.136
Interesting.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.889
Yes, I'm still here.
Where am I going? I'm on a train.

14:51.056 --> 14:54.601
Now, what you'll be looking for
is a small wooden box...

14:54.768 --> 15:00.023
...located between a Hoberman Sphere
and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.816
Hoberman Sphere.

15:01.984 --> 15:05.486
It's a collapsible icosidodecahedron.

15:06.196 --> 15:10.825
No, the thing with the time on it
is my alarm clock. My God.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.580
Actually, in India,
the names of constellations are different.

15:15.748 --> 15:20.501
Where you have the Big Dipper,
we have the Big Curry Pot.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.462
You're making that up.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.714
You got me.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.216
Now, what are you going to do with me?

15:31.388 --> 15:33.431
-Raj. Look.
-Yes?

15:33.599 --> 15:35.475
-What am I looking at?
-You tell me.

Non-alcoholic beer.

15:46.445 --> 15:50.365
Hi. I'm the small package
good things come in.

15:53.202 --> 15:56.871
Okay, I got a box, but there's no key
in here. Just letters.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.665
That's the wrong box. Put it back.

15:58.832 --> 16:01.584
Oh, Sheldon, are these letters
from your grandmother?

16:01.752 --> 16:03.169
Don't read those letters.

16:03.337 --> 16:06.464
Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie.
That is so cute.

[SHRIEKING]
Put down the letters!

16:11.845 --> 16:13.179
Hey, Penny. It's Leonard.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.973
Hey, Leonard. How's the train ride?

16:15.140 --> 16:18.601
Delightful. I don't know
what you're doing right now...

16:18.769 --> 16:22.188
...but there are little bubbles forming
in the corner of Sheldon's mouth.

16:22.356 --> 16:25.233
Okay. Yeah, I kind of crossed a line.
Put him back on.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.651
Thank you.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.738
-I'm back.
-What up, Moon Pie?

16:31.323 --> 16:34.701
No one calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.663
Hey, Penny. Leonard again.

16:40.290 --> 16:43.751
So anyway, in the dream, you and I
were ice skating, just the two of us.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.129
And then I picked you up
by your ankles...

16:46.296 --> 16:50.758
...and twirled you round and round
until your legs tore off.

16:52.720 --> 16:56.347
I mean, I tried to stick them back on,
but before I could...

16:56.515 --> 17:01.227
...you turned into a giant loaf
of pumpernickel bread.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.854
What do you think that means?

17:04.273 --> 17:06.524
I really don't know.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.110
I'll give you a little clue.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.697
My favorite sandwich?
Salami on pumpernickel.

17:13.615 --> 17:14.741
Is that so?

17:15.743 --> 17:19.537
Did you know the word pumpernickel comes
from the German words pumper and knickel.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.040
Which loosely translates to fart goblin?

17:23.917 --> 17:26.836
No. I didn't.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.632
Okay, I found the box. Now what?

17:31.800 --> 17:37.305
You're holding a Japanese puzzle box,
which takes 10 precise moves to open.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.725
Okay, first locate the
panel with the diamond pattern...

17:40.893 --> 17:44.604
...and slide the center portion
1 millimeter to the left.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.856
Then, on the opposite end of the box...

17:47.024 --> 17:50.151
...slide the entire panel
down 2 millimeters.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.153
You'll hear a slight click.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.990
Hang on. Sheldon, do you have
any emotional attachment to this box?

17:56.158 --> 17:59.577
No. It's a novelty I ordered off the Internet.
Did you hear the click?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.370
Not yet.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.459
There it is.

Johnny Winter...

-Yep.

would take us from where we are now...

18:35.364 --> 18:38.116
...to a place where I could ask you out
and you'd say yes?

18:39.868 --> 18:41.327
No.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.498
Fair enough. I'll leave you in peace.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.291
Thank you.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.754
But before I go...

18:52.631 --> 18:57.218
...would you mind if I just take one picture
of us together for my Facebook page?

18:57.386 --> 18:58.845
Sure.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.564
Okay. Great.

where it looks like we're making out?

19:54.109 --> 19:55.484
Okay, I'll be honest with you.

to say to you...

So I'm thinking you won the Nobel Prize,

of "What has Smoot done lately?"
