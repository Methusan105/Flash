[CONTINUES GROANING]

00:16.599 --> 00:18.308
Problem?

00:18.560 --> 00:20.519
-This is Thai food.
-Here we go.

00:22.147 --> 00:25.065
We don't have Thai food on Thursday.
We have pizza on Thursday.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.943
Yes, but we all agreed
the third Thursday of every month.. .

00:28.111 --> 00:30.112
...would be
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.449
The news didn't reach
my digestive system which, when startled...

00:33.616 --> 00:36.785
...has its own version
of Anything Can Happen Thursday.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.706
The whole idea behind
Anything Can Happen Thursday...

00:40.874 --> 00:42.833
...is to get out of this rut
we've been in.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.627
Rut? I think you mean consistency.

00:45.795 --> 00:48.672
And if we're going to abandon that,
why even call it Thursday?

00:48.840 --> 00:53.343
Let's call it "Quonko Day" and divide it
into 29 hours of 1 7 minutes a piece...

00:53.511 --> 00:57.181
...and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat
to the mighty god Ra.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.976
I could go for some goat.

01:02.937 --> 01:06.315
Sheldon, we agreed we'd do something
different tonight.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.068
All right. Let's go
to the comic book store.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.195
We went to the comic book store
last night.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.947
Last night was Wednesday.
Wednesday is comic-book night.

01:14.115 --> 01:19.536
We'll be going on Thursday because
it's Anything Can Happen Thursday.

01:20.038 --> 01:24.208
Way to think outside but pressed right up
against the box, Sheldon.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.834
What are we gonna do tonight?

01:26.002 --> 01:28.170
If I may proffer a suggestion. . .

01:28.338 --> 01:33.342
...in bars all across this great nation
of ours, Thursday night is Ladies' Night.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.428
As the evening progresses,
we will get better-looking.. .

01:36.596 --> 01:39.515
...courtesy of 99-cent margaritas
and two-for-one Jell-O shots.

01:42.852 --> 01:46.939
Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking
up girls in a bar are practically zero.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.399
Oh. Really?
Are you familiar with the Drake equation?

01:49.567 --> 01:52.236
The one that estimates the odds
of contact with extraterrestrials...

01:52.403 --> 01:55.155
...by calculating the product
of series of fractional values. . .

01:55.323 --> 01:57.741
...such as stars
with planets likely to develop life?

01:57.909 --> 02:02.663
N equals R times FP times NE times FL
times Fl times FC times L?

02:06.084 --> 02:07.626
Yeah, that one.

02:13.049 --> 02:16.385
You can modify it
to calculate our chances of having sex...

02:16.553 --> 02:19.471
...by changing the formula
to use single women in Los Angeles...

02:19.639 --> 02:21.515
...those who might find us attractive...

02:21.683 --> 02:25.352
...and what I call
The Wolowitz Coefficient.

02:25.812 --> 02:30.149
-The Wolowitz Coefficient?
-Neediness times dress-size squared.

02:31.693 --> 02:35.946
In crunching the numbers, I come up with a
conservative 581 2 potential sex partners. . .

02:36.114 --> 02:37.614
...within a 40-mile radius.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.283
You're joking.

02:40.368 --> 02:43.078
I'm a horny engineer, Leonard.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.706
I never joke about math or sex.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.460
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's bounce, bitches.

02:52.255 --> 02:55.257
Oh, you're right.
It's Anything Can Happen Thursday.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.217
Let's hit the clubs
and meet hot women.

02:57.385 --> 03:01.430
Here we go. Lock up your daughters.
We're gonna hit it and quit it.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.772
Or we could finish eating
and go to the comic book store.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.317
Also a good plan.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.653
But next Anything Can Happen Thursday,
we're going to a bar.

03:16.821 --> 03:19.364
-Oh, absolutely.
-You heard that, Ladies' Night ladies?

03:19.532 --> 03:22.034
We're eventually coming for you.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.497
Fascinating.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.568
-Oh, hey, guys. Where you headed?
-To the comic book store.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.738
You're thinking,
"The comic book store on a Thursday?

03:59.906 --> 04:02.991
Why, I've fallen down the rabbit hole
and into a land of madness."

04:03.159 --> 04:08.497
What you have failed to take into account is
that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.166
You got me.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.461
Oh, hey, could you pick me up
a few comics for my nephew's birthday?

04:14.629 --> 04:16.630
No, I think you mean comic books.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.674
Comics are feeble attempts at humor.. .

04:18.841 --> 04:21.635
...featuring talking babies
and anthropomorphized pets...

04:21.803 --> 04:26.056
...found traditionally
in the optimistically named "funny pages."

04:26.724 --> 04:29.184
Leonard, pick me up comics
for my nephew's birthday?

04:29.644 --> 04:32.729
-Sure. What does he like?
-I don't know, just pick out anything.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.357
Just pick out anything?

04:35.984 --> 04:39.403
Maybe we can pick out a new suit for him
without knowing his size...

04:39.570 --> 04:42.197
...or pick out his career
without knowing his aptitude.. .

04:42.365 --> 04:46.285
...or pick out a new breakfast cereal
without knowing his fiber requirements...

04:46.869 --> 04:50.163
...or his feelings
about little marshmallows.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.250
Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.378
Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man,
Spectacular Spider-Man...

04:56.546 --> 05:00.090
...The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man,
Spider-Man 2099?

05:00.758 --> 05:02.884
-Leonard?
LEONARD: This can go on all night.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.220
Why don't you just come with us?

05:05.471 --> 05:08.390
Ugh. That's what I was trying to avoid.

05:09.225 --> 05:12.185
Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.

05:15.523 --> 05:18.233
Oh, what a cute little store.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.239
Everybody's staring at me.

05:25.491 --> 05:28.785
LEONARD: Don't worry. They're more
scared of you than you are of them.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.079
Unlikely.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.043
Here. What about this one
for my nephew?

05:36.210 --> 05:38.462
-A superb choice.
-Oh, great.

05:38.629 --> 05:41.757
Yeah, provided he has already read
Infinite Crisis and 52...

05:41.924 --> 05:45.385
...and is familiar with the reestablishment
of the DC Multiverse.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.430
Uh, what's a Multiverse?

05:48.931 --> 05:50.849
Get her out of here.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.311
Come on, I'll help you pick something.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.440
That's right. She's with us.

06:00.109 --> 06:03.403
Guys like that are so pathetic.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.946
Tell me about it.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.742
Ooh, look, a new Batman belt buckle.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.454
Oh, hey, Leonard.
I help you find something?

06:12.622 --> 06:15.582
Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny.
She's just looking for some comic books.

06:15.750 --> 06:19.836
Oh, really? Wow. Blink twice
if you're here against your will.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.089
I think we're fine, Stuart.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.801
-Okay. Let me know if you need anything.
-Thanks.

06:26.969 --> 06:28.970
Oh, he seems like a nice guy.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.099
You mean for someone
who's into comic books?

06:32.266 --> 06:35.936
No, no, no. I just meant for-- Yeah.

06:36.771 --> 06:39.981
Just because people appreciate comic
books doesn't make them weirdoes.

06:40.149 --> 06:43.944
Stuart's a terrific artist. He went
to the Rhode Island School of Design.

06:44.112 --> 06:48.156
Okay, what about the guy in the superhero
T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?

06:50.118 --> 06:52.119
Oh, yeah, that's Captain Sweatpants.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.916
He doesn't really help the point
I'm trying to make.

06:58.960 --> 07:13.056
-Got it, got it, got it.
-Got it, got it, got it.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.766
-Need it.
-Need it.

07:17.186 --> 07:20.021
-Let it go, Sheldon.
-Why should I let it go? I saw it first.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.525
-Yes, but I saw it from the front.
-A far less impressive feat.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.361
Oh, come on, I need this
for my Batman collection.

07:26.529 --> 07:29.698
-I need it for my Robin collection.
-Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock?

07:29.866 --> 07:31.700
Why would I gamble? It's mine. Let go.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.368
-You let go.
-No, you.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.163
-Problem?
-Yes. He won't let go of my comic book.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.665
-It's my comic book.
-Leonard, we need a ruling.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.333
Uh, cut it in half?

07:42.211 --> 07:44.337
-Excuse me.
-Oh, hello again.

07:44.505 --> 07:47.716
Hi. What would you recommend
as a present for a 1 3-year-old boy?

07:47.884 --> 07:50.385

on a comic book, try this.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.019
Oh. "Hellblazer. " What's this about?

07:59.187 --> 08:02.481
A morally ambiguous confidence man
who smokes, has lung cancer. . .

08:02.648 --> 08:06.109
...and is tormented
by the spirits of the undead.

08:06.277 --> 08:09.696
Well, if that doesn't make me
the favorite aunt, I don't know what will.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.576
Is this me?

08:15.703 --> 08:16.912
Depends. Do you like it?

08:17.497 --> 08:20.457
-Wow, it's really good.
-Yes, that's you.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.961
That's so sweet.
But what if I didn't like it?

08:25.129 --> 08:28.089
It'd still be you, but I'd feel like an idiot.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.928
I don't believe it.
Stuart's putting the moves on Penny.

08:33.095 --> 08:35.889

08:36.849 --> 08:38.266
Hey.

08:38.434 --> 08:42.395
Once again, defeated
by your own prurient interests.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.774
Guys, have you seen Stuart all up
in Penny's business over there?

08:45.942 --> 08:50.028
Nobody's up in anybody's business.
Let's just buy our stuff and go.

08:50.196 --> 08:53.365
Okay, you've got my number.
Now give me the picture.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.283
All right. You drive a hard bargain. . .

08:55.826 --> 09:00.580
-. . .but here.
-All right. So, um, just give me a call.

09:03.334 --> 09:07.462
So Leonard, how are you enjoying
Anything Can Happen Thursday?

in the middle of the Deep Space Nine...

...Star Trek: The Original Series
"Trouble With Tribbles" crossover episode?

09:31.487 --> 09:33.488
Apparently so.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.491
Are you ill?

09:36.659 --> 09:38.118
No.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.828
All right.

09:39.996 --> 09:43.373
Then is it fair to say that you're
experiencing some emotional turmoil...

09:43.541 --> 09:46.167
...over the events involving Penny
earlier this evening?

09:46.669 --> 09:49.004
When did you pick up on that?

09:49.922 --> 09:53.425
A moment ago, you turned off the TV
in the middle of the Deep Space Nine...

09:53.593 --> 09:57.470
...Star Trek: The Original Series
"Trouble With Tribbles" crossover episode.

10:00.349 --> 10:02.517

10:03.561 --> 10:04.644

10:13.821 --> 10:15.864
Would you rather I offer
my personal insight?

10:16.032 --> 10:17.907
No, I don't need any insights.

10:18.075 --> 10:21.411
I just wanna know why Penny's
more interested in Stuart than me.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.371
We're practically the same guy.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.373
Oh, I disagree.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.668
You know, Stuart is taller,
artistic, self-employed. . .

10:28.836 --> 10:33.715
...and, most significantly,
he gets 45 percent off comic books.

10:37.803 --> 10:41.056
You're right. I really should be asking
strangers on the Internet.

-So, what are you kids up to?

Stuart has a piece in an art show
that's opening tonight.

11:13.881 --> 11:17.092

It is great. Really great.

-What are you doing?
-Friday night.

That means Chinese food
and vintage video games?

what we have planned.

-Yes?

-Yeah.

Okay.

be caught in my Aquaman briefs.

with a little umbrella, please?

-No, he may not.
-Why?

I'm not sitting here with a guy drinking
a grasshopper with a little umbrella.

Fine.

I'll have a chocolate martini.

You know I can't talk to women unless
I'm lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali.

There are plenty of bars where you can
order grasshoppers or chocolate martinis. . .

12:49.018 --> 12:53.021
...but you wouldn't have to
because there are no women in them.

I think it's nice that Captain Sweatpants
showed up to your art opening.

13:34.563 --> 13:37.899
Yeah. It would've been nicer
if he hadn't touched all the cheese.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.529
Um, you know, it's kind of early.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.697
Wanna maybe come in for coffee
or something?

13:44.865 --> 13:48.034
Oh, gee, it's a little late for coffee,
isn't it?

13:48.953 --> 13:52.580
Oh, you think "coffee" means coffee.
That is so sweet.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.750
Come on, I think I have decaf.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.878
Oh, good, Stuart.
I thought I heard your voice.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.548
-Do you have a moment?
-Uh, yeah, I guess.

14:01.715 --> 14:03.174
We're a little busy here, so. . . .

14:03.342 --> 14:06.094
-What are you doing?
-We're having coffee.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.596
Isn't it a little late for coffee?

14:09.265 --> 14:11.349
It's okay. She thinks she has decaf.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.690
I'll just go look for it.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.401
-What's up?
-Well, I've spent the last three hours...

14:21.569 --> 14:24.946
...in a debate in the DC Comics Batman
chat room, and I need your help.

14:25.114 --> 14:28.449
Oh, yeah. Those guys can be
very stubborn. What's the topic?

14:28.617 --> 14:31.786
I am asserting in the event
that Batman's death proves permanent. . .

14:31.954 --> 14:36.082
...the original Robin, Dick Grayson,
is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.627
Ooh, Sheldon, I'm afraid
you couldn't be more wrong.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.759
"More wrong"?

14:48.387 --> 14:53.057
Wrong is an absolute state
and not subject to gradation.

14:53.225 --> 14:56.561
Of course it is. It's a little wrong
to say a tomato is a vegetable.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.814
It's very wrong to say
it's a suspension bridge.

15:01.191 --> 15:04.652
But returning to the original issue,
Dick Grayson became Nightwing.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.237
A superhero in his own right.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.115
"Batman Two" has to be the second Robin,
Jason Todd.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.577
"Has to be"? "Has to be"?

15:12.828 --> 15:15.663
I hope you're being
deliberately provocative.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.499
PENNY: I found the decaf.
-Oh, great.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.669
Yeah, herbal tea for me, please.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.967
Barkeep, Alexander me.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.386
How about those two?

15:30.554 --> 15:32.430
No, they're eating peanuts.

15:32.598 --> 15:36.643
With my allergies, one kiss
would put me in Cedars-Sinai for a week.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.105
What about the ones in the corner?

15:41.273 --> 15:44.233
Possible. Very possible.

15:44.401 --> 15:47.695
You want the one in the whiplash collar
or the one who keeps blinking?

15:48.697 --> 15:51.783
-I think Blinky's cute.
-Done, sir.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.910
Wait. So we just go over there?

15:54.078 --> 15:56.704
No. We have a little prep work to do.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.916
Put this in your mouth, we walk past them,
you stumble a bit.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.377
I say, "Sorry,
my friend's had a little too much."

16:02.544 --> 16:05.880
And then I start to pull it
out of your mouth and say:

16:06.048 --> 16:08.633
"A little too much fun."

16:08.801 --> 16:10.051
[LAUGHS]

16:10.219 --> 16:13.638
Get it? I mean, they're laughing,
we're laughing. Then we get them up...

16:13.806 --> 16:17.475
...to about a 0. 1 5 blood alcohol level
and tell them we're millionaires.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.229
What else you got?

16:21.397 --> 16:25.525
Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap
and pretend to be a ventriloquist's dummy?

16:25.693 --> 16:26.943
No.

16:27.111 --> 16:30.571
I can't sit on your lap.
You don't know the routine.

16:32.741 --> 16:36.995
I'm sorry, but you're obviously stuck
in a pre-Zero Hour DC Universe.

16:37.162 --> 16:40.623
Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill
as the killer of Batman's parents. . .

16:40.791 --> 16:43.084
...effectively deprived him
of his raison d'être.

16:44.169 --> 16:47.505
You can throw all the French around
you want, it doesn't make you right.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.924
Au contraire.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.928
Plus, you're forgetting
that the Infinite Crisis story line. . .

16:54.096 --> 16:56.347
...restored Joe Chill
to the Batman mythology.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.850
I am forgetting nothing,
and I resent your tone.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.518
[SIGHS]

17:00.894 --> 17:04.272
Okay. Look, Sheldon, it's late.
I've gotta get some sleep.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.733
-So I win.
-No, I'm tired.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.861
So I win.

17:10.487 --> 17:13.406
-Fine, you win.
-Darn tooting, I win.

17:14.324 --> 17:17.452
Penny, I really had a terrific time.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.454
Penny?

17:19.872 --> 17:21.372
No, no, no. Don't wake her.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.876
She'll maul you like a rabid wolverine.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.339
You know, I don't think that was decaf.

17:33.677 --> 17:37.138
HOWARD:
Wait, is this your card or isn't it?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.060
Trust me, this was their card.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.895
I thought you were good at this.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.148
You're always talking about
how you go to bars and meet women.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.816
I do. All the time.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.652
Well, what happened?
Been sitting here all night...

17:51.820 --> 17:55.907
...and the longest conversation you've had
with a woman was when your mom called.

18:00.996 --> 18:03.664
Wow, you're just gonna make me
come out and say it, aren't you?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.249
Say what?

18:05.417 --> 18:07.752
You're weighing me down.

18:09.797 --> 18:13.257
I'm a falcon who hunts better solo.

18:13.425 --> 18:18.262
Fine, I'll sit here.
You take flight and hunt.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.974
Don't be ridiculous.
You can't just tell a falcon when to hunt.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.852
Actually, you can.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.773
There's a whole sport built around it.

18:30.025 --> 18:32.068
Falconry.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.447
Shut up.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.534
Let's just get Koothrappali and go.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.458
Lucky bastard.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.796
It's gotta be that stupid accent of his.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.802
[IN INDIAN ACCENT]
Hello, I'm Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.515
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Okay, I'm stumped.
