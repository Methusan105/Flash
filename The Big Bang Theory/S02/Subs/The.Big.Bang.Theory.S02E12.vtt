-Sheldon, we have to call it off.
-We don't have that option.

13:19.757 --> 13:22.842
We've accepted the challenge.
We can't run away from a fight.

Oh, please. We've spent our whole lives
running away from fights.

a hole in a fence half my size.

Well, impressive as that may be,
Monte is not us.

Monte has no fear.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.399
Sheldon, did we all
not just watch the same video?

13:38.567 --> 13:42.695
Kripke's robot just had angry sex
with a mid-sized automobile.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.074
You are overlooking the fact
we know what we're up against.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.535
And we can modify Monte
so that he's prepared.

13:48.702 --> 13:49.744
You wanna prepare him?

13:49.912 --> 13:53.289
Install a bladder and a pair of shorts
so he can wet himself.

13:54.416 --> 13:57.168
How are we gonna make
any modifications without Wolowitz?

13:57.711 --> 13:59.379
-Have you heard from Penny?
-Not yet.

13:59.547 --> 14:00.839
Have faith, gentlemen.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.090
We don't need Wolowitz.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.903
... I met Marcy Grossman.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.114
She was so beautiful.

14:26.282 --> 14:29.534
She just got her braces off...

14:29.702 --> 14:32.787
...but they left a little of the overbite.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.248
It was so hot.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.294
Like a sexy little chipmunk.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.634
I didn't have the courage
to ask her out...

14:46.802 --> 14:51.973
...but I dedicated a song to her
at the ninth-grade talent show.

That's great.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.883
Grossman

15:27.176 --> 15:29.135
Ha, it's fun.

15:29.303 --> 15:33.723
And then she came up
with that sexy little chipmunk mouth...

15:33.891 --> 15:36.142
...and spit in my hair.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.649
Which brings us to 10th grade.

15:43.525 --> 15:46.277
Howard, do you think
maybe sometimes...

-I guess.

I feel like I'm talking to a real person.

Yep. At 3400 rpm.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.438
No, Leonard.

For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have
made my life a series of painful noogies...

17:16.910 --> 17:18.995
The only improvement
you were able to make...

17:19.163 --> 17:21.414
...was to put fresh batteries
in the remote.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.126
What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers
from a fatal flaw:

17:25.294 --> 17:29.672
Overconfidence from his robot's
massive size and its overwhelming power.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.717
That's not overconfidence.
That's observation.

17:32.885 --> 17:37.221
Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey
to my psychological warfare. Observe.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.933
Kripke.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.520
I would ask if your robot
is prepared to meet its maker...

clearly the two of you have met.

He's right, Leonard.
The paradigm is to the death.

I will, however, give you the opportunity
to concede my superiority now...

18:17.012 --> 18:20.431
...and offer me your robot
as the spoils of war.

Never. I'd rather see Monte dead

for the emotional wounds of childhood.
