00:02.127 --> 00:04.420
So, what you're eating
is not technically yogurt.

00:04.587 --> 00:06.839
It doesn't have enough
live acidophilus cultures.

00:07.007 --> 00:10.259
It's really just ice milk
with carrageenan added for thickness.

00:10.427 --> 00:15.264
-Well, that's very interesting.
-It's also not pink and has no berries.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.934
Yeah, but it doesn't really
answer my question.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.729
-What was your question again?
-Do you want some?

00:21.896 --> 00:23.397
Ah.

00:23.773 --> 00:25.983
-Right. No. I'm lactose intolerant.
-Right.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.277
-So gas.
-Yeah, got it.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.947
Well, good night.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.631
-What are you doing?
-There was a draft.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.592
PENNY:
I didn't feel a draft.

00:52.886 --> 00:56.680
-Why don't we just go into your--?
-Oh, yeah.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.766
Maybe we should
slow things down a little.

00:58.933 --> 01:01.477
No, I didn't mean
to go into your apartment to go fast.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.270
No, I know.

01:03.563 --> 01:06.607
I know what you meant.
It's just this is only our first date.

01:06.775 --> 01:07.816
Okay. Sure. No problem.

01:07.984 --> 01:10.277
Why don't we just figure out
where we're going...

01:10.445 --> 01:12.571
...and when we want to get there?

01:12.739 --> 01:16.617
And then rate of speed
equals distance over time.

01:18.536 --> 01:20.454
Solve for R.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.123
Or we could just wing it.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.126
That might work too.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.837
-Good night, Leonard.
-Good night.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.761
He's coming. Screen saver.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.392
Oh, hey, Leonard.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.187
-How was your date?
-Bite me.

01:47.357 --> 01:50.859
Sheldon, how could you just sit there
and let them spy on me?

01:51.027 --> 01:52.069
They were clever.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.614
They exploited my complete lack of interest
in what you were doing.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.910
You should thank us.
When future generations try to determine...

02:00.078 --> 02:02.704
...why your relationship with Penny
crashed and burned...

02:02.872 --> 02:05.833
...this right here is the black box.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.794
What are you talking about?
The date went fine.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.796
She said she wants to slow things down.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.715
Okay, so she said
she wants to slow things down.

02:13.883 --> 02:17.719
It's like saying,
"I'm really enjoying this meal.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.722
I'm going to slow down and savor it."

02:20.890 --> 02:24.393
No, it's like, "This fish tastes bad...

02:25.145 --> 02:28.063
...so I'm gonna slow down
and spit it out."

02:29.732 --> 02:32.067
-You being the fish.
-I'm not the fish.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.027
Oh, really?
Did you make a second date?

02:34.195 --> 02:39.324
-Well, no. We sort of decided to wing it.
-Oh, even I know that's lame.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.327
Okay. All right.
Let's assume your hypothesis.

02:42.495 --> 02:46.039
We went to dinner, we talked,
we laughed, we kissed.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.583
Where could I have gone wrong?

02:47.750 --> 02:50.919
Think back, Leonard.
The littlest things can set women off.

02:51.087 --> 02:55.174
Like, "Hey, the waitress is hot. I bet
we could get her to come home with us."

02:56.050 --> 03:00.095
Or, "How much does your mom weigh?
I wanna know what I'm getting into."

03:00.263 --> 03:03.682
-I didn't say anything like that.
-Good, because they don't work.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.311
They don't care for it
if you stare at them and hyperventilate.

03:07.478 --> 03:09.855
Sadly, that's my home-run swing.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.524
Look, everything went fine.

03:12.692 --> 03:16.737
I didn't even have to refer
to my impromptu conversation starters.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.239
That woman across the hall is into me.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.450
Let's go to the tape.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.537
Look at her reaction
to the good-night kiss.

03:25.705 --> 03:30.083
No change in respiration, pupils undilated,
no flushing of the chest.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.294
Nice close-up, by the way.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.756
Interesting. Her jaws are clenched.
No tongue access.

03:35.924 --> 03:39.259
Clearly a bad sign
amongst mating humans.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.470
That's not a bad sign.

03:41.638 --> 03:45.224
Please. You might as well have been
two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.644
And the worst sign of all
is you're here and not there.

03:48.811 --> 03:52.314
I'm not there,
because I'm taking things slow.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.943
Which, by the way, compared to you guys,
approaches warp speed.

03:57.153 --> 04:00.155
And take down that camera.

04:01.699 --> 04:04.660
He was a lot more fun
when he had no hope.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.289
Give him time.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.491
-Hi.
-Oh, hi, Penny.

04:44.659 --> 04:48.537
Yeah, FYI, the hot water is inadequate
on Machine 2, so colors only.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.748
Four is still releasing the fabric softener
too early in the cycle.

04:51.916 --> 04:55.252
-So I'd avoid using that for your delicates.
-Thanks.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.214
Well, good Lord.

04:59.382 --> 05:03.135
Why don't you just take your clothes down
to the river and beat them with a rock?

05:07.890 --> 05:10.475
Sheldon, may I ask you a question?

05:10.977 --> 05:14.604
I would prefer that you not,
but I won't go so far as to forbid it.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.441
All right, I heard "yes," so....

05:18.609 --> 05:19.901
Okay, here's my question:

05:20.320 --> 05:25.073
Has Leonard ever dated,
you know, a regular girl?

05:26.242 --> 05:29.619
Well, I assume you're not referring
to digestive regularity.

05:30.872 --> 05:34.166
Because I've come to learn
that such inquiries are inappropriate.

05:34.917 --> 05:39.880
No, I meant has he ever been involved
with someone who wasn't a brainiac?

05:40.048 --> 05:42.257
Oh! Well, a few years ago...

05:42.425 --> 05:46.470
...he did go out with a woman
who had a Ph.D. in French literature.

05:47.263 --> 05:51.975
-How is that not a brainiac?
-Well, for one thing, she was French.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.605
For another, it was literature.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.029
So....

06:05.323 --> 06:07.616
Do you think that if Leonard
and I keep dating...

06:07.784 --> 06:10.202
...he'll eventually get bored with me?

06:16.167 --> 06:18.168
-That depends.
-On what?

06:18.795 --> 06:21.254
Do you have a working knowledge
of quantum physics?

06:21.422 --> 06:22.672
No.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.841
Do you speak Klingon?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.426
No.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.304
-You know any card tricks?
-Okay.

06:31.682 --> 06:35.685
I get it. Leonard has no business
being involved with a waitress/actress...

06:35.853 --> 06:40.399
...who felt so insecure, that she lied to him
about finishing community college.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.109
Why would you lie about that?

06:42.276 --> 06:45.028
He was going on about this college
and that grad school...

06:45.196 --> 06:48.698
...and I didn't want him to think
I was some kind of stupid loser.

06:48.866 --> 06:53.036
You thought the opposite of "stupid loser"
was "community-college graduate"?

06:57.917 --> 07:00.460
There are a lot of successful people
in this country...

07:00.628 --> 07:02.462
...who are community-college graduates.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.840
Yeah, but you are neither.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.052
Right. Okay, look,
this is between you and me.

07:09.220 --> 07:12.347
You cannot tell Leonard any of this.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.393
-You're asking me to keep a secret?
-Yeah.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.727
Well, I'm sorry.

07:17.895 --> 07:21.148
You would've had to express that desire
before revealing the secret...

07:21.315 --> 07:25.277
...so that I could choose whether I wanted
to accept the covenant of secret-keeping.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.531
You can't impose a secret
on an ex post facto basis.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.325
What?

07:32.493 --> 07:35.787
Secret-keeping is a complicated endeavor.
One has to be concerned...

07:35.955 --> 07:40.125
...not only about what one says, but about
facial expressions, autonomic reflexes.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.877
When I try to deceive...

07:42.044 --> 07:46.715
... I myself have more nervous tics
than a Lyme disease research facility.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.054
It's a joke.

07:53.222 --> 07:57.017
It relies on the homonymic relationship
between tick, the bloodsucking arachnid...

07:57.185 --> 07:59.644
...and tic, the involuntary
muscular contraction.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.229
[CHUCKLES]

08:04.275 --> 08:05.442
I made it up myself.

08:08.279 --> 08:13.283
Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied,
I will absolutely die of embarrassment.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.453
-Physiologically impossible.
-Oh, Sheldon, please.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.622
Look, I'm asking you as a friend.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.334
You're saying that friendship
contains within it...

08:22.502 --> 08:25.086
...an inherent obligation
to maintain confidences?

08:25.254 --> 08:28.673
-Well, yeah.
-Interesting.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.635
One more question.
Perhaps I should've led with this:

08:31.802 --> 08:33.887
When did we become friends?

08:36.390 --> 08:38.099
I.e., I couldn't become Green Lantern...

08:38.267 --> 08:40.268
...unless I was chosen
by the Guardians of Oa.

08:40.436 --> 08:43.438
Given enough startup capital
and an adequate research facility...

08:43.606 --> 08:45.607
... I could be Batman.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.321
-You could be Batman?
-Sure.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.572
[IN DEEP VOICE]
I'm Batman.

08:52.740 --> 08:53.782
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
See?

08:56.202 --> 08:57.244
-Hi, guys.
-Hey.

08:57.411 --> 08:58.995
-Hi, Penny.
-Hey.

09:00.081 --> 09:03.750
If you're not doing anything Friday night,
I thought we could go see a movie.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.586
You know, I think I have the dinner shift
on Friday.

09:06.754 --> 09:09.464
-Okay. What about Saturday?
-You know, I'm not sure.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.634
The manager hasn't posted the schedule.
How about I let you know?

09:12.802 --> 09:13.802
-Great.
-Okay.

09:13.970 --> 09:19.599
So you just let me know when you know.
Okay, so-- Oh, God, I am the bad fish.

09:21.352 --> 09:24.437
-What did I do wrong?
-Why are you asking me?

09:24.981 --> 09:28.191
I have no information
about your interactions with Penny...

09:28.359 --> 09:31.319
...nor do I have any method
of learning such things.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.574
LEONARD: What does that mean?
-Nothing.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.952
You seem to be implying a back channel
between me and Penny...

09:39.120 --> 09:41.830
-...where, obviously, none exists.
-No, I didn't.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.250
I just think you need to be careful
how you phrase things, sir.

09:47.795 --> 09:51.131
-What's going on with you?
-Well, I might ask you the same question.

09:51.299 --> 09:55.176
Why do you drag me into matters
which have nothing to do with me...

09:55.344 --> 09:59.180
...but exist between you and Penny,
a person to whom I barely speak?

10:07.023 --> 10:09.232
What's wrong with your face?

10:09.609 --> 10:12.569
There's no reason
to bring my looks into this.

10:14.196 --> 10:16.364
-Good day, Leonard.
-What?

10:16.532 --> 10:18.825
I said, good day.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.496
Good day?

10:25.207 --> 10:27.542
Also today we have
a fresh-caught Alaska salmon...

10:27.710 --> 10:29.919
...served with a teriyaki glaze
and sticky rice.

10:30.087 --> 10:32.922
-Our soup of the day--
-You must release me from my oath.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.595
Sheldon, I'm working.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.764
Why don't you take a minute to decide?

10:42.933 --> 10:44.392
I can't keep your secret, Penny.

10:44.560 --> 10:49.105
I'm going to fold like an energy-based
de novo protein in conformational space.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.483
Like a Renaissance triptych.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.361
Like a cheap suit.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.697
Look, why is it so hard
for you to keep one little secret?

10:57.865 --> 10:59.407
I'm constitutionally incapable.

10:59.575 --> 11:03.203
That's why I was refused clearance
for a government research fellowship...

11:03.371 --> 11:06.873
...at a secret military supercollider
beneath a fake agricultural station...

11:07.041 --> 11:10.335
...12.5 miles southeast
of Traverse City, Michigan.

11:15.132 --> 11:18.093
Which you did not hear about from me.

11:18.594 --> 11:21.471
Look, just forget I told you about me...

11:21.639 --> 11:23.765
...not graduating
from community college, okay?

11:23.933 --> 11:27.936
Forget? You want me to forget?
This mind does not forget.

11:28.104 --> 11:31.856
I haven't forgotten a thing since the day
my mother stopped breastfeeding me.

11:33.275 --> 11:34.776
-It was a drizzly Tuesday.
-Okay.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.238
You promised me
you would keep my secret...

11:38.406 --> 11:41.116
...so you are just gonna have to
figure out a way to do it.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.661
Leonard, I'm moving out.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.999
What do you mean
you're moving out? Why?

11:50.167 --> 11:52.627
There doesn't have to be a reason.

11:53.921 --> 11:56.840
-Yeah, there kind of does.
-Not necessarily.

11:57.007 --> 11:59.884
This is a classic example
of Münchausen's trilemma.

12:00.052 --> 12:04.013
Either the reason is predicated on a series
of sub-reasons leading to regression...

12:04.181 --> 12:07.809
...or it tracks back to axiomatic statements,
or it's ultimately circular...

12:07.977 --> 12:11.146
...i.e., I'm moving out
because I'm moving out.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.441
I'm still confused.

12:14.608 --> 12:17.694
Leonard, I don't see
how I could've made it any simpler.

12:18.696 --> 12:21.364
Hey, qu'est-ce que c'up?

12:22.408 --> 12:25.410
We just got back from that exhibit
of those plasticized cadavers.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.705
Some of those skinless chicks were hot.

12:29.707 --> 12:32.751
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to pack.

12:33.461 --> 12:37.839
That's kind of an overreaction
to a little harmless necrophilia.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.177
It's not you, Howard.
He says he's moving out.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.304
What did you do?

12:44.472 --> 12:47.849
Did you change the contrast
or brightness settings on the television?

12:48.017 --> 12:49.642
-No.
-Did you take a Band-Aid off...

12:49.810 --> 12:51.603
...in front of him?

12:51.771 --> 12:53.688
-No.
-Did you buy generic ketchup?

12:53.856 --> 12:57.317
Forget to rinse the sink?
Talk to him through the bathroom door?

12:58.736 --> 13:02.405
Adjust the thermostat? Cook with cilantro?
Pronounce the T in "often"?

13:04.033 --> 13:05.074
No.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.703
Did you make fun of trains?

13:10.664 --> 13:13.917
I didn't do anything.
He's just gone insane.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.002
Well, we all knew this day was coming.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.631
That was fast.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.801
It's my pre-packed
disaster evacuation bag.

13:24.094 --> 13:27.055
It's recommended by
the Department of Homeland Security.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.224
And Sarah Connor.

13:30.392 --> 13:31.726
Where are you gonna live?

13:31.894 --> 13:35.063
Until I find a permanent place,
I will stay with friends.
