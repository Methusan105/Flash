-Did you notice the sign on his counter?

13:47.493 --> 13:49.828
He's not a full-time dry cleaner.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.372
He also makes keys.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.415
Oh, for God's sake, Sheldon.

13:54.583 --> 13:55.875
Focus is important.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.504
Was Michael DeBakey a wedding
planner in between heart transplants?

13:59.672 --> 14:02.048
Did Alexander Fleming
moonlight as a hair dresser?

14:02.216 --> 14:06.302
Thanks for discovering penicillin.
Now how about we try a bouffant?

14:26.991 --> 14:29.409
Sure. I'll pick you up in 10 minutes.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.411
Gentlemen, adieu.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.746
I thought we were gonna play
"Halo" tonight.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.123
What am I supposed to do?

14:35.291 --> 14:38.001
There's a woman out there
anxious to have sex with me.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.420
You understand, right?

14:44.174 --> 14:46.009
No, not at all.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.052
Nevertheless, I must depart.

14:48.220 --> 14:52.348
By the way, did I tell you Leslie pulled
strings and got me on the trip to Geneva...

14:52.516 --> 14:54.475
...to check out the CERN super collider?

14:54.643 --> 14:56.936
That's not fair.
You're not even a physicist.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.980
There are two ways
of looking at this--

14:59.148 --> 15:01.190
-Get out.
-Bye.

15:04.653 --> 15:06.571
You're improving.

15:07.656 --> 15:08.990
Thank you.

It helps when I get to practice
with a real woman.

Hey, listen.
Saturday, my sister's getting married.

15:16.957 --> 15:19.959
I want you to come with me.
It's black tie.

15:20.127 --> 15:24.005
Yeah, gee, I'd really rather not.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.214
Why not?

15:25.382 --> 15:29.594
When I go to weddings
it's to scam on chunky bridesmaids.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.305
I don't know
what I would do with a date.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.432
Oh, all right.

Hey, I'm really sorry
about that Geneva trip.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.609
-What about it?
-Oh, didn't you hear?

15:44.777 --> 15:48.446
I had to reduce the number of people going
and you didn't make the cut.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.490
When did that happen?

15:50.658 --> 15:52.951
About 12 seconds ago.

15:54.662 --> 15:59.874
Hold on. Are you saying if I don't go
to the wedding, I can't go to Geneva?

16:00.292 --> 16:02.710
Well, actually, I'm trying not to say it.

16:02.878 --> 16:06.589
Okay, I'm sorry,
but that makes me a little uncomfortable.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.175
-How so?
-Because it's like you're controlling me...

16:09.343 --> 16:12.053
...with new equipment
and research trips.

16:12.221 --> 16:16.099
If I weren't controlling you with equipment
and trips, I'd be uncomfortable.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.851
-How so?
-Because we'd be in a real relationship...

16:19.019 --> 16:21.312
...with feelings and all that crap.

16:23.607 --> 16:29.570
So bottom line,
I'm just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.490
No.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.659
No, no, not at all.

You're also arm candy.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.457
So, what do you think?

16:41.709 --> 16:44.585
Hey, Ma, you gotta rent me a tux!

16:47.256 --> 16:51.050
What kind of sex
are you having up there?

16:59.268 --> 17:01.269
Why are you crouching there?

17:01.437 --> 17:03.938
This is my spot.

There. Nice and comfy-cozy.
Zero, zero, zero.

17:34.970 --> 17:37.305
There's one more zero.

You forgot the time parameter.

Nope.

What do you mean "nope"?
What's wrong with it?

18:11.340 --> 18:14.133
Nothing, it's what's wrong with him.

You know the cashew chicken
I get you on Monday nights?

18:28.190 --> 18:29.857
Yes, from Szechwan Palace.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.736
Szechwan Palace closed two years ago.

-Where did my cashew chicken come from?
-Golden Dragon.

No.

No, this isn't right.

No, our food always comes
in Szechwan Palace containers.

18:56.343 --> 19:01.180
Yeah, well, before they went out of
business, I bought 4000 containers.

I keep them in the trunk of my car.

That was for my cushion.
