00:02.127 --> 00:04.503
Let's see, Raj was the kung pao chicken.

00:04.671 --> 00:07.548
-I'm the dumplings.
-Yes, you are.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.426
Creepy, Howard.

00:10.593 --> 00:12.094
Creepy good or creepy bad?

00:13.471 --> 00:16.181
-Who was the shrimp with lobster sauce?
-That would be me.

00:16.349 --> 00:19.893
Come to Papa, you un-kosher delight.

00:20.645 --> 00:23.105
I'm not necessarily talking to the food.

00:28.611 --> 00:30.237
Sit over there.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.744
Sit over there.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.422
-Baby wipe?
-Why do you have--?

00:48.590 --> 00:50.466
-No, don't ask.
-No, don't, don't.

00:51.634 --> 00:52.676
I'll tell you why.

00:52.844 --> 00:53.969
[BOTH SIGH]

00:54.137 --> 00:56.638
I had to sanitize my hands
because the university...

00:56.806 --> 00:59.933
...replaced the paper towels
in the restrooms with hot-air blowers.

01:00.101 --> 01:02.144
I thought the blowers were more sanitary.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.687
-Why?
-Really, don't.

01:04.064 --> 01:08.442
Hot-air blowers are incubators
and spewers of bacteria and pestilence.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.403
It'd be more hygienic
if they had a plague-infested gibbon...

01:11.571 --> 01:13.822
...sneeze my hands dry.

01:13.990 --> 01:17.242
Hey, guys.
I just got the most amazing new--

01:19.704 --> 01:23.373
Do you think you'll ever be able to talk
in front of me without being drunk?

01:26.211 --> 01:29.213
Okay, well, I'll just go eat by myself.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.298
-You don't have to do that.
-It's okay.

01:31.466 --> 01:34.676
Between him not talking,
him talking, and him...

01:36.888 --> 01:38.680
... I'm better off alone.

01:38.848 --> 01:41.266
So goodbye, you poor, strange little man.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.857
-She's so considerate.
-So, what's your news?

01:49.025 --> 01:51.860
Remember that little object
I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?

01:52.028 --> 01:54.071
Oh, yeah, 2008-NQ sub-17.

01:54.239 --> 01:57.199
Or as I call it, Planet Bollywood.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.201
Anyway, because of my discovery...

01:59.369 --> 02:02.830
...People magazine is naming me
one of their 30 Under 30 to Watch.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.958
-Raj, that's incredible.
-Congratulations.

02:06.126 --> 02:11.463
Excuse me, 30 what under 30 what
to watch what?

02:11.881 --> 02:14.299
Thirty visionaries
under 30 years of age to watch...

02:14.467 --> 02:17.678
...as they challenge
the preconceptions of the fields.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.848
If I had a million guesses,
I never would have gotten that.

02:21.933 --> 02:25.310
They've got me in with a guy doing
something about hunger in Indonesia...

02:25.478 --> 02:28.564
...a psychotherapist using dolphins
to rehabilitate prisoners...

02:28.731 --> 02:33.360
...and Ellen Page,
star of the charming independent film Juno.

02:33.778 --> 02:36.572
Oh, I'd so do her.

02:38.032 --> 02:40.450
You'd do the dolphins.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.202
Do I get a mention...

02:42.370 --> 02:45.247
...for designing the telescope camera
mounting bracket?

02:45.415 --> 02:48.458
Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming
and personal narrative...

02:48.626 --> 02:50.794
...in which a humble boy
from New Delhi...

02:50.962 --> 02:55.382
...overcame poverty and prejudice and
journeyed to America to reach for the stars.

02:55.550 --> 02:59.136
Poverty? Your father's a gynecologist.
He drives a Bentley.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.471
It's a lease.

03:04.642 --> 03:08.604
I'm confused. Was there
some sort of peer-review committee...

03:08.771 --> 03:11.106
...to determine which scientists
would be included?

03:11.274 --> 03:14.985
Peer review? It's People magazine.
People picked me.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.238
-What people?
-The people from People.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.824
What? Yeah, but exactly
who are these people?

03:20.992 --> 03:23.660
What are their credentials?
How are they qualified?

03:23.828 --> 03:26.246
What makes accidentally noticing
a hunk of rock...

03:26.414 --> 03:29.291
...that's been traipsing around
the solar system for billions of years...

03:29.459 --> 03:34.213
...more noteworthy than any other scientific
accomplishment by someone under 30?

03:34.672 --> 03:38.133
Boy, I bet Ellen Page's friends
aren't giving her this kind of crap.

03:43.556 --> 03:44.681
You proud of yourself?

03:45.850 --> 03:48.018
In general, yes.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.508
Oh, there's my missing neutrino.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.135
You were hiding from me
as an unbalanced charge...

04:22.303 --> 04:25.138
...weren't you,
you little subatomic dickens?

04:26.057 --> 04:28.892
-Hi, Sheldon.
-Hey, look, I found my missing neutrino.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.687
Oh, good,
we can take it off the milk carton.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.732
We're gonna apologize to Raj
and invite him out to dinner.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.734
Apologize? For what?

04:37.902 --> 04:42.114
He came over last night with some pretty
good news and we weren't very supportive.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.701
I sense you're trying
to tell me something.

04:46.244 --> 04:49.371
You were a colossal asshat.

04:49.914 --> 04:53.125
Oh, no, I beg to differ.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.752
Of the three of us,
I was by far the most supportive.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.587
Really? Do tell.

04:57.755 --> 05:01.425
How will Raj ever reach true greatness
if his friends lower the bar for him?

05:01.884 --> 05:06.054
When I was 11, my sister bought our father
a "world's greatest dad" coffee mug.

05:06.222 --> 05:09.391
And frankly, the man coasted
until the day he died.

05:10.893 --> 05:12.394
Okay, let's try it this way.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.814
What if this People magazine thing
is the best Raj is going to achieve?

05:17.567 --> 05:20.527
-I had not considered that.
-Mm-hm. Come on.

05:20.903 --> 05:23.655
I often forget
other people have limitations.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.866
It's so sad.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.952
-He can feel sadness?
-Not really.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.163
It's what you and I call condescension.

05:32.957 --> 05:36.084
Now, when we go in there,
let's show Raj that we're happy for him.

05:36.252 --> 05:37.961
But I'm not.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.423
Well, then fake it. Look at me.

05:41.591 --> 05:45.218
I could be grinding on the fact that
without my stabilizing telescope mount...

05:45.386 --> 05:49.473
...he never would have found
that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.143
But I'm bigger than that.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.312
Fine. What do you want me to do?

05:55.938 --> 05:57.189
Smile.

06:04.822 --> 06:08.450
Oh, crap, that's terrifying.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.496
We're here to see Koothrappali,
not kill Batman.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.792
Try less teeth.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.924
Close enough. Come on.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.053
-Hey, Raj.
-Hey, guys. What's up?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.347
We wanted to invite you
out to dinner tonight.

06:30.515 --> 06:34.643

Right, Sheldon?

06:38.189 --> 06:40.899
-It's very nice of you. I would like that.
-Hello, boys.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.734
-Dr. Gablehauser.
-Dr. Koothrappali.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.444
-Dr. Gablehauser.
-Dr. Hofstadter.

06:44.612 --> 06:45.946
-Dr. Gablehauser.
-Dr. Cooper.

06:46.114 --> 06:49.241
-Dr. Gablehauser.
-Mr. Wolowitz.

06:50.034 --> 06:54.246
Boys, I got a question for you.
Who in this room discovered a star?

06:54.414 --> 06:57.290
Actually, 2008-NQ sub-17
is a planetary body.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.668
I'm not talking about you,
I'm talking about me.

06:59.836 --> 07:04.506
You, my exotic young friend, are my star.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.509
But you didn't discover him.
You merely noticed he was here...

07:07.677 --> 07:10.345
...much like he did with 2008-NQ sub-17.

07:10.513 --> 07:13.306
-Sheldon.
-Ugh. Sorry.

07:16.018 --> 07:20.230
Boy, we gotta get you into a better office.
Something more suited to your status.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.650
-You don't have to go to trouble.
-How about von Gerlach's old office?

07:23.818 --> 07:26.903
-I'd rather have Fishbein's. It's bigger.
GABLEHAUSER: Done.

07:27.071 --> 07:29.072
Wait, I called dibs on Fishbein's office...

07:29.240 --> 07:32.659
...the day he started showing up at work
in his bathrobe.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.829
He gets a new office, I can't get
paper towels in the men's room?

07:35.997 --> 07:38.707
-Sheldon.
-Damn, this is hard.

the business of this place is?

-Science?
-Money.

in People magazine...

-I have a master's degree.
-Who doesn't?

08:12.700 --> 08:16.077
Dr. Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch
in the president's dining room?

08:16.245 --> 08:18.747
I didn't even know
there was a president's dining room.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.500
It's the same food as the cafeteria,
only fresh.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.752
-Come on, little buddy.
-Okay, big buddy.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.837
See you tonight, guys.

-You can stop smiling now.
-Ah.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.139
So anyway, after a fantastic lunch...

08:36.307 --> 08:38.767
... I was whisked off
to the People magazine photo shoot--

08:38.935 --> 08:40.936
-Have any of you been to a photo shoot?
HOWARD: No.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.896
It's fantastic.

08:43.272 --> 08:46.816
Apparently, the camera loves me,
and I it.

08:47.568 --> 08:52.656
They shot me in front of a starry
background where I posed like this:

08:57.537 --> 08:59.496
They're going to digitally add
a supernova.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.666
They say it's the perfect metaphor
for my incandescent talent.

Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas
that collapses upon itself.

Excuse me. Oh, it's my assistant, Trevor.

Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.512
They gave him an assistant?

09:15.680 --> 09:19.599

I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.

Not yet.

09:23.980 --> 09:27.399
Okay, put it on my calendar, but start
thinking of a reason why I can't go.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.068
Alrighty? Koothrappali out.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.361
God bless that boy.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.781
-Don't know what I'd do without him.
-You just got him this afternoon.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.951
Yes, but I'm finding
that having a lackey suits me.

-A lackey?
-I'm sorry, is that politically incorrect?

09:41.497 --> 09:44.165
In India, we just call them untouchables.

-Almost.

Speaking of untouchables,

Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.

-Oh, gee, thanks.
-Oh, you're welcome.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.683
Of course, I couldn't get you
into the VIP section...

10:01.851 --> 10:06.855
...because, you know, that's for VIPs,
and you guys are just, you know, P's.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.317
There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea...

10:10.484 --> 10:13.945
...where when a hunter flaunts his success
to the rest of the village...

10:14.113 --> 10:18.241
...they kill him and drive away evil spirits
with a drum made of his skin.

10:18.409 --> 10:22.912
Superstitious nonsense, of course,
but one can see their point.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.505
Here you go, Raj.
You might wanna drink this one slowly.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.925
Okay. So Saturday night,
can I count on my posse?

10:36.093 --> 10:39.304
Gee, I'd love to, Raj, but I can't make it.

Oh, okay. Leonard?

10:41.599 --> 10:43.141
Well, uh....

-The reception for my article on Saturday.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.909
I can't believe you. Raj is celebrating
a tremendous accomplishment.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.577
You're not gonna be there?

11:02.745 --> 11:06.206
A tremendous accomplishment would be
if the planetary body he discovered...

11:06.374 --> 11:09.668
...were plummeting toward Earth
and he exploded it with his mind.

11:11.295 --> 11:14.130
That would be cool.
I'd go to that reception.

11:14.590 --> 11:17.467
Come on, this is huge.
Raj is gonna be in People magazine...

11:17.635 --> 11:20.970
...and he didn't even have to knock up
one of the Spears sisters.

Would you like to go with me?

11:24.100 --> 11:26.184
Of course I would. I would be honored.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.727
Really? Cool.

-Now?
-Now.

Yeah, call me when you're on the cover.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.433
Oh, Raj, look at you.

12:06.600 --> 12:11.146
I know. I'm resplendent
like the noonday sun, am I not?

12:12.148 --> 12:15.567
Um, yeah. Starting with the champagne
a little early, aren't you?

12:15.735 --> 12:18.570
It was in the limo.
They sent a limo. I have a limo.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.281

-Oh, I'm ready.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.832
Um, yeah. Why? What's wrong with it?

12:31.208 --> 12:36.713
Nothing. I was just hoping for something
a little more, you know, ridonkulous.

-Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs?
-Yeah.

13:22.885 --> 13:26.888
I'm coming up
So you better get this party started

13:27.056 --> 13:28.431
-Hey.
-Hey, good news.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.642
You don't have to sulk
about Penny anymore.

13:30.810 --> 13:35.063
There are hundreds of Croatian women
just waiting for you to contact them.

13:35.439 --> 13:38.942
"Anything-for-a-Green-Card.com"?

13:40.569 --> 13:44.322
I'll lend you my username.
It's Wealthy Big Penis.

13:45.741 --> 13:48.243
-You're joking.
-You gotta make it easy for them.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.578
They're just learning English.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.497
Pass.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.833
You're just gonna
sit around here and mope...

13:55.000 --> 13:58.753
...while Penny is out with Dr. Apu
from the Kwik-E-Mart?

13:59.171 --> 14:01.923
It's not a date and that's racist.

14:02.091 --> 14:06.427
It can't be racist.
He's a beloved character on The Simpsons.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.138
Let's just eat so I can get to bed.

14:09.306 --> 14:13.184
With any luck, tonight will be the night
my sleep apnea kills me.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.440
Did you ask for the chicken to be diced,
not shredded?

14:19.608 --> 14:21.776
-Yes.
-Even though the menu specifies shredded?

14:21.944 --> 14:23.361
-Yes.
-Brown rice, not white?

14:23.529 --> 14:25.864
-Yes.
-Did you stop and get the hot mustard?

14:26.031 --> 14:28.157
-Yes.
-Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce?

14:28.325 --> 14:29.742
-Yes.
-Thank you.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.452
You're welcome.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.413
What took you so long?

14:35.291 --> 14:38.293
-Just sit down and eat.
-Fine.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.965
All right, it's shredded.
What do you want me to do?

14:44.133 --> 14:46.301
I want you to check
before you accept the order.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.094
Sorry.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.722
Were you distracted
by the possibility...

14:50.890 --> 14:53.725
...that Koothrappali might have intercourse
with Penny tonight?

14:56.312 --> 14:58.396
He's not going to have intercourse
with Penny.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.481
Then there's no excuse for this chicken.

15:02.568 --> 15:07.572
You know, this situation with Koothrappali
brings to mind a story from my childhood.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.658
Oh, goody,
more tales from the panhandle.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.953
That's Northwest Texas.
I'm from East Texas, the Gulf region...

15:14.121 --> 15:16.915
...home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.584
Do the shrimpers feature in your story?

15:20.669 --> 15:22.086
No.

15:22.838 --> 15:25.214
Anyway, when I was 8...

15:25.382 --> 15:30.094
...a Montgomery Ward delivery van
ran over our family cat, Lucky.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.431
-"Lucky"?
-Yes, "Lucky."

15:33.599 --> 15:36.267
He's irony impaired. Just move on.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.854
Okay, dead cat named Lucky. Continue.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.689
While others mourned Lucky...

15:41.857 --> 15:46.152
... I realized his untimely demise provided
me with the opportunity to replace him...

15:46.320 --> 15:48.613
...with something
more suited to my pet needs.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.449
A faithful companion
that I could snuggle with at night...

15:51.617 --> 15:55.536
...yet would be capable of killing
upon telepathic command.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.666
So not a puppy?

15:59.875 --> 16:01.668
Please. No, nothing so pedestrian.

16:01.835 --> 16:04.462
I wanted a griffin.

16:05.381 --> 16:09.133
-A griffin?
-Yes, half eagle, half lion.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.303
And mythological.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.472
Irrelevant.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.558
Yeah, I was studying
recombinant DNA technology...

16:17.726 --> 16:19.811
...and I was confidant
I could create one...

16:19.979 --> 16:24.732
...but my parents were unwilling to secure
the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen.

16:26.735 --> 16:29.988
Of course, my sister got swimming lessons
when she wanted them.

16:32.408 --> 16:37.745
Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy
a good lion-semen story...

16:38.330 --> 16:39.414
...but what's your point?

16:39.581 --> 16:45.044
My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on
to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame...

16:45.212 --> 16:48.840
...then perhaps this is an opportunity
to create a better cohort.

16:49.299 --> 16:52.010
You wanna breed a new friend?

16:52.928 --> 16:55.096
That's one option, but who has the time?

16:55.764 --> 16:57.056
But consider this.

16:57.224 --> 17:00.768
The Japanese, they're doing some
wonderful work with artificial intelligence.

17:00.936 --> 17:05.148
Now, combine that with some animatronics
from the imagineers over at Disney.

17:05.315 --> 17:09.944
Next thing you know, we're playing "Halo"
with a multilingual Abraham Lincoln.

17:10.612 --> 17:14.198
Sheldon, don't take this the wrong way,
but you're insane.

17:15.117 --> 17:19.203
That may well be, but the fact is it
wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.290
For the record,
it could kill us to meet new people.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.920
They could be murderers
or the carriers of unusual pathogens.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.883
And I'm not insane.
My mother had me tested.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.139
If we do get a new friend,
he should be a guy you can trust.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.141
You know, a guy who has your back.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.978
He should have money and live in a cool
place by the beach where we throw parties.

17:44.146 --> 17:48.316
-He should share our love of technology.
-And he should know a lot of women.

17:48.650 --> 17:51.694
Okay, let's see, money, women, technology.
Okay, we're agreed.

17:51.862 --> 17:55.490
Our new friend is going to be Iron Man.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.536
RAJESH [SINGING]:
I can go all night

18:00.704 --> 18:03.164
If you know what I mean

18:03.332 --> 18:06.084
Welcome to the Raj Mahal.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.336
Yes, it's very nice. Good night, Raj.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.505
-Wait, the evening's not over.
-Yes, it is.

18:10.672 --> 18:14.342
No, it's time to put on some R. Kelly
and suck face.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.178
Oh, wow, is the evening over.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.471
[COMPUTER BEEPS]

18:18.639 --> 18:21.182
Wait, wait, wait. That's my mommy
and daddy calling from India.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.850
I want you to meet my parents.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.477
Wait, meet them?

18:27.481 --> 18:31.984
Hello, Mommy, Daddy. Good to see you.
How are you? I'm not drunk.

18:32.528 --> 18:35.488
-Why would you say that?
-Just making conversation.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.783
Mommy, Daddy, I want you to meet
my new squeeze, Penny.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.869
I am not your squeeze.
There is no squeezing.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.539
I can't see her. Center her in the frame.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.958
Here you go. Cute, huh?

18:47.709 --> 18:49.627
She's not Indian.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.255
So she's not Indian.
The boy's sowing some wild oats.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.842
No, no, no, there's no sowing,
no squeezing and no sucking face.

18:57.052 --> 18:58.469
What if he gets her pregnant?

18:58.637 --> 19:02.181
Is this hotsy-totsy who you want
as the mother of your grandchildren?

19:02.724 --> 19:05.393
What right do you have
to pick whom I can have children with?

19:05.561 --> 19:07.812
Look, Rajesh, I understand,
you're in America...

19:07.980 --> 19:10.356
...you want to try the "local cuisine."

19:10.524 --> 19:14.485
But trust me,
you don't want it for a steady diet.

19:15.070 --> 19:19.407
Now, you listen to me. I am no longer
a child and I will not be spoken to like one.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.577
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go throw up.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.081
-What's wrong with him?
PENNY: I don't know.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.834
Maybe it's the local cuisine.

19:33.755 --> 19:37.758
Okay, well, it's nice to meet you.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.428
Just gonna set you on down over here.

19:40.929 --> 19:44.348
And I'm gonna leave, so namaste.

19:47.436 --> 19:50.771
And FYI, you'd be lucky
to have me as a daughter-in-law.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.775
She's feisty.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.777
I like that.

[SHUFFLING]

20:07.539 --> 20:09.749
Raj, what are you doing?

20:13.045 --> 20:15.838
No, no notes.
If you have something to say to me, say it.
