With sex.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.695
I think she knows what I meant.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.739
How can she
when you beat around the bush?

13:44.907 --> 13:48.409
She's from the mean streets, where
they shoot from the hip and keep it real.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.413
Don't worry,
I can take good care of your friend.

13:52.581 --> 13:55.375
Okay, terrific. Um. . . .

13:55.543 --> 14:01.172
Listen, is there a way that we can do this
where he doesn't know that you're a....

14:01.340 --> 14:03.800
-You know. . . .
-A prostitute.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.302
You want the girlfriend experience.

14:06.762 --> 14:09.764
Yes, yes. Exactly.
The girlfriend experience.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.766
Actually, if it's not too much to ask...

14:11.934 --> 14:15.353
...could we have
the Jewish girlfriend experience?

14:17.273 --> 14:19.983
Okay, that's question 20.
You have to guess.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.945
I don't know, Sheldon.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.531
Are you Star Wars?

14:27.783 --> 14:31.244
How can one person be a whole movie?

14:31.704 --> 14:34.330
Okay, I give up.
Can we just do something else?

14:34.498 --> 14:35.832
Fine.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.084
I was Spock.

14:42.631 --> 14:45.216
Are you and Leonard
friends with benefits?

14:45.968 --> 14:47.176
What?

14:47.344 --> 14:49.429
Are you and Leonard
friends with benefits?

14:49.597 --> 14:50.972
Where did that even come from?

14:51.140 --> 14:53.308
-Did he say we were?
-No, Leonard said nothing.

14:53.475 --> 14:57.604
But who knows what goes on over here when
he pretends your mail was misdelivered?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.773
Just mail, no benefits.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.775
I see.

15:02.943 --> 15:04.569
Why are you asking?

15:04.737 --> 15:07.572
I'm curious about
the whole social construct.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.701
On its face, the idea of satisfying
one's sexual appetite--

15:11.869 --> 15:13.703
Assuming one is afflicted with such.

15:13.871 --> 15:18.249
--without emotional entanglement,
that seems imminently practical.

15:18.417 --> 15:23.880
What I've observed, however,
is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.

15:25.174 --> 15:28.051
Well, some people just can't handle
that kind of relationship.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.720
Can you?

15:32.723 --> 15:34.182
Excuse me?

15:34.600 --> 15:38.978
Are you able to have sex with men without
developing an emotional attachment?

15:39.146 --> 15:43.650
Sheldon, I really don't wanna
talk about this with you.

15:43.817 --> 15:45.860
Is this conversation
making you uncomfortable?

15:46.028 --> 15:48.446
Of course it's making me uncomfortable.
Can't you tell?

15:48.614 --> 15:50.031
I really have no idea.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.951
I don't particularly excel
at reading facial expressions--

15:53.118 --> 15:55.453
I'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!

15:57.039 --> 15:59.290
Thank you, that's very helpful.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.629
All right,
where are these amazing shrimp?

16:05.381 --> 16:06.839
Behold.

16:08.926 --> 16:12.762
Seriously?
You think this is the size of a baby's arm?

16:13.722 --> 16:15.598
A little baby.

16:16.684 --> 16:17.934
I'm going back to the room.

16:18.477 --> 16:22.021
Boy, would it maybe kill them
to put out a nice brisket?

16:32.950 --> 16:36.202
Hi, there. Howard Wolowitz.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.371
Ester Rosenblatt.

16:44.628 --> 16:48.464
I don't think the manager's coming tonight,
so here.

16:48.632 --> 16:51.634
Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch?

16:51.802 --> 16:54.429
Well, it wasn't the first suggestion
that came to mind...

16:54.596 --> 16:56.431
...but it's the one I'm going with.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.934
I can't sleep on your couch.
I sleep in a bed.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.770
Given its dimensions,
I have no intention of living out...

17:02.938 --> 17:06.649
...E.M. Snickering's beloved children's book,
The Tall Man From Cornwall.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.610
What?

17:09.987 --> 17:13.614
There was a tall man from Cornwall
Whose length exceeded his bed

17:13.782 --> 17:18.661
My body fits on it, but barely upon it
There's no room for my big Cornish head

17:24.293 --> 17:25.293
[SIGHS]

17:25.461 --> 17:28.546
All right, I will give you my bed
on one condition.

17:28.714 --> 17:32.300
That you promise to zip your hole
for the next eight hours.

17:33.343 --> 17:36.512
-May I say one last thing?
-Only if it doesn't rhyme.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.349
All right.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.147
Good night.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.694
Turn-ons, let me see.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.197
Reading a good book in front of the fire. . .

17:54.364 --> 17:56.532
...long walks on the beach.. .

17:56.700 --> 18:00.870
...and getting freaky on the Sabbath
with a bacon cheeseburger.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.043
Really? Me too.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.339
Oy gevalt, you're hot.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.342
Yeah.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.803
Excuse me for a moment.

18:20.682 --> 18:24.060
-Hey. How's it going?
-Cut the crap. You set this up, didn't you?

18:25.437 --> 18:27.647
-Yes.
-She's a hooker, isn't she?

18:28.482 --> 18:30.691
A prostitute, yes.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.779
-And you already gave her the money?
-Yes.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.573
Thank you.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.207
Penny?

18:48.210 --> 18:49.836
What?

18:50.170 --> 18:52.213
I can't sleep.

18:52.923 --> 18:56.551
Maybe that's because
your hole is still open.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.804
I'm homesick.

19:01.265 --> 19:04.058
Your home is 20 feet from here.

19:04.226 --> 19:07.228
Twenty feet, 20 light years.
It doesn't matter.

19:07.729 --> 19:10.606
It's in a galaxy far, far away.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.568
Damn it.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.073
What do you want me to do?

19:19.741 --> 19:22.243
Sing "Soft Kitty."

19:24.079 --> 19:26.330
That's only for when you're sick.

19:27.875 --> 19:31.043
Homesick is a type of being sick.

19:33.797 --> 19:36.799
Come on, do I really have to?

19:36.967 --> 19:39.135
I suppose we can stay up and talk.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.890
[SINGING]
Soft kitty

19:44.057 --> 19:45.474
Warm kitty

19:45.642 --> 19:48.477
Little ball of fur

19:48.645 --> 19:50.646
Happy kitty

19:51.899 --> 19:53.232
Um....

19:53.567 --> 19:54.609
Sleepy kitty.

19:54.776 --> 19:55.776
Sleepy kitty --

19:55.944 --> 19:57.403
No.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.531
Start over.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.787
Soft kitty

20:06.955 --> 20:08.372
Warm kitty

20:08.540 --> 20:11.000
Little ball of fur

20:11.752 --> 20:13.044
Happy kitty

20:13.212 --> 20:14.795
Sleepy kitty

20:14.963 --> 20:17.465
Purr, purr, purr

20:19.343 --> 20:21.636
-Penny?
-Yeah?

20:23.096 --> 20:25.097
Thank you for letting me stay here.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.768
Oh. You're welcome, sweetie.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.107
Okay, I'm sleepy now. Get out.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.537
Oh, good, you're finally home.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.414
What were you doing at Penny's?

20:50.582 --> 20:54.502
Well, we had dinner, played some games,
and then I spent the night.

20:54.670 --> 20:55.920
Oh.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.340
You'll be happy to know that I now
have a much better understanding...

20:59.508 --> 21:00.925
...of "friends with benefits."
