WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:05.087
Mm.

00:07.507 --> 00:08.799
Gentlemen, I put it to you:

00:08.967 --> 00:10.259
The worst tapioca pudding...

00:10.427 --> 00:14.263
...is better than the best pudding
of any other flavor.

00:15.056 --> 00:18.934
First off, that is axiomatically wrong
because the best pudding is chocolate.

00:20.020 --> 00:24.356
Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca
makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death.

00:24.524 --> 00:28.986
-It is extracted from the plant--
-Hey, I'm thinking of growing a mustache.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.238
Oh, no kidding.

00:31.406 --> 00:34.033
-A Fu Manchu, a handlebar, pencil?
-It's extracted from--

00:34.200 --> 00:37.077
I'm not sure yet.
You know, George Clooney has one now.

00:37.245 --> 00:39.413
Really? I once saw him
shopping at Ralphs.

00:39.581 --> 00:40.914
He was buying tequila.

00:41.499 --> 00:45.627
Wow, you'd think a guy like that
would have some kind of booze lackey.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.716
All right, this is cruel.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.510
We better let him finish
before his head explodes.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.512
All right. Sheldon, why is tapioca--?

00:55.680 --> 00:58.265
Tapioca is extracted
from the root of Manihot esculenta.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.309
Due to a high concentration of cyanide...

01:00.477 --> 01:03.687
...it is poisonous in its raw form
and lethal if prepared improperly.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.775
Feel better now?

01:07.942 --> 01:11.487
It's indigenous to Brazil, as is the cocoa
bean from which we get chocolate.

01:11.654 --> 01:14.073
You promised
you wouldn't do that anymore.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.577
- Hey, Hofstadter.
- Hey, Kripke.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.871
Heard about your anti-proton
decay experiment.

01:21.039 --> 01:24.208
Twenty thousand data runs
and no statistically significant results.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.543
Very impressive.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.713
What a jerk.

01:29.881 --> 01:33.175
Don't feel bad, Leonard.
Negative results are still results.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.220
- Even 20,000 of them.
- All right.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.431
Please don't cheer me up anymore.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.892
Come on, don't let him get to you.
It's Kripke.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.561
Yeah, he's a ginormous knob.

01:44.729 --> 01:48.857
That's why he eats by himself
instead of sitting here at the cool table.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.443
For shizzle.

01:54.614 --> 01:58.617
Hey, it's true, Kripke lacks the basic
social skills that we take for granted.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.204
But he controls
the new Open Science Grid computer...

02:02.372 --> 02:06.208
...that I need to run simulations
of structure formation in the early universe.

02:06.376 --> 02:10.087
Good luck getting time on it. The only
people he lets use it are his friends.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.381
Well, then, the solution is simple.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.508
I shall befriend him.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.260
Kripke.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.387
Yeah?

02:18.555 --> 02:21.765
What would you say to the idea
of you and I becoming friends?

02:21.933 --> 02:23.308
I would say...

02:23.476 --> 02:26.395
... I have no interest
in becoming your friend.

02:26.855 --> 02:30.065
Really?
Oh, that seems rather shortsighted...

02:30.233 --> 02:33.360
...coming from someone
who is considered altogether unlikable.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.989
Take some time to reconsider.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.198
Yeah, I'll do that.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.162
Well, I think we're off to a terrific start.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.773
There you go.
Now any e-mail from Wolowitz...

03:11.941 --> 03:14.234
...will go right into your spam folder.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.778
Thanks. The e-mail doesn't bother me...

03:16.946 --> 03:20.115
...as much as the vacation pictures
of him in a bathing suit.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.492
Yeah, I got the same one.

03:22.660 --> 03:26.163
And that's not a bathing suit,
it's a tan line.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.629
Hello, this is Sheldon Cooper.

03:33.796 --> 03:37.132
I am leaving a message for Barry Kripke.

03:37.300 --> 03:41.720
Barry, it was pleasant seeing you today
in the cafeteria.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.848
I saw that you purchased
the chef's salad.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.476
Apparently, you did not know
that the chef's salad...

03:47.644 --> 03:50.938
...is kitchen trickery
to utilize scrap meat.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.983
Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.486
I'm following up
on our pending friendship.

03:57.654 --> 04:01.949
And I look forward
to hearing from you regarding its status.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.534
Sheldon Cooper.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.872
What's up with Ichabod?

04:09.666 --> 04:11.375
Oh, he's trying to make a new friend.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.335
Oh, really? Well, good for him.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.712
Unless he makes one out of wood
like Geppetto...

04:15.880 --> 04:17.589
... I don't think it's gonna happen.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.051
Well, how did you guys become friends?

04:21.219 --> 04:24.221
There was a flyer on the bulletin board
at the university:

04:24.389 --> 04:28.183
"Roommate wanted.
Whistlers need not apply."

04:28.685 --> 04:29.851
And you moved in anyway?

04:30.019 --> 04:31.687
I assumed he was joking.

04:31.854 --> 04:36.233
You'd be surprised how many
particle physicists have a whimsical side.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.444
What about Howard and Raj?
How did he become friends with them?

04:39.612 --> 04:42.447
I don't know. How do carbon atoms
form a benzene ring?

04:42.615 --> 04:44.866
Proximity and valence electrons.

04:46.327 --> 04:49.037
Well, yeah, sure,
when you put it that way.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.581
But it all worked out, right?

04:51.749 --> 04:52.874
I suppose.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.085
I do miss whistling though.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.545
Oh, come on. Really?

04:58.006 --> 04:59.589
First warning.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.428
Penny.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.305
Penny. Penny.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.516
This is for you.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.518
Hello, Sheldon.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.645
Hi.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.734
-What is this?
-It's a questionnaire I devised.

05:18.901 --> 05:21.778
I'm having some difficulty bonding
with a colleague at work...

05:21.946 --> 05:26.366
...so I'm doing a little research to better
understand why my current friends like me.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.454
Yes, well, that is a good question.

05:30.621 --> 05:33.165
But is this really the best way
to figure it out?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.541
I agree.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.501
The social sciences are largely hokum.

05:36.669 --> 05:40.339
But short of putting electrodes in your brain
and monitoring your response...

05:40.506 --> 05:43.592
...to my companionship,
this is the best I can do.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.427
Okay, question one:

05:45.595 --> 05:49.348
"Rank the following aspects
of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal:

05:49.515 --> 05:52.267
Intelligence,
ruthless attention to hygiene...

05:52.435 --> 05:55.937
...playfulness, Java-applet writing"?

05:57.523 --> 06:00.233
I know. I may have started off
with a fairly obvious one.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.652
An aspect
of my most appealing trait:

06:02.820 --> 06:04.821
playfulness.

06:04.989 --> 06:08.283
Why don't you rank that number one?
You're on your own for the rest.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.452
It should take you
no more than three hours.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.497
Well, wait, how many questions
are on this thing?

06:13.664 --> 06:14.748
Only 21 1 .

06:16.334 --> 06:20.587
Don't worry. I've kept them all
at a high-school graduate reading level.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.465
Thanks, pal.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.801
You got it, buddy.

06:27.303 --> 06:30.347
Sheldon, honey, did you ever consider
making friends by being...

06:30.515 --> 06:32.641
... I don't know, pleasant?

06:33.309 --> 06:35.894
Well, that's certainly
a thought-provoking hypothesis.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.398
May I suggest it
as the topic for your essay?

06:44.028 --> 06:48.323
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Your questionnaire, very disappointing.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.036
I answered every question, Sheldon.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.789
You answered the multiple choice
questions in a pattern.

06:55.957 --> 07:01.002
A-B-B-A-C, A-B-B-A-C.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.507
-Oh, you picked up on that, huh?
-Yeah, wait--

07:05.675 --> 07:06.716
How could I not?

07:06.884 --> 07:09.511
Well, uh, come on.
There's over 200 questions.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.304
And look at some of these things.

07:11.472 --> 07:16.393
"Sheldon is to camaraderie
as the space shuttle is to blank."

07:16.561 --> 07:20.689
There are a number of acceptable answers.
For example, C, near-Earth transport.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.984
But certainly not B, avocado rancher.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.113
Your essay: I'd have better luck
making friends...

07:28.281 --> 07:31.116
...if I wait till the Cylons take over?

07:32.034 --> 07:33.702
Please.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.745
Hold on. I put some real work into that.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.206
Yes, well,
it's better than what Wolowitz did.

07:38.374 --> 07:43.044
He drew a raccoon with what appears
to be a distended scrotum.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.173
It's kind of cute.

07:47.383 --> 07:50.135
-Uh, till you get to the scrotum.
-Yeah.

07:50.303 --> 07:54.389
What hope do I have for establishing
new relationships, given that my friends...

07:54.557 --> 07:57.434
...could not take a few hours
out of their lives to help me?

07:57.602 --> 08:01.229
Well, Sheldon, I'm not going
to defend a big-balled raccoon.

08:01.731 --> 08:02.939
Oh, I don't see how you could.

08:03.107 --> 08:06.776
Ugh. What I'm trying to say
is that you can't approach this...

08:06.944 --> 08:08.904
...as a purely intellectual exercise.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.073
What do you mean?

08:12.575 --> 08:17.204
Well, ah, remember when you tried to learn
how to swim using the Internet?

08:18.289 --> 08:20.290
I did learn how to swim.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.751
On the floor.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.587
The skills are transferable.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.423
I just have no interest
in going in the water.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.966
Then why learn how to swim?

08:30.134 --> 08:31.760
The ice caps are melting, Leonard.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.763
In the future,
swimming isn't going to be optional.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.434
But you do bring up an interesting point.
I don't have to break new ground here.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.436
I'm sure the research already exists.

08:42.021 --> 08:45.857
No. No, my point is
if you wanna learn how to make friends...

08:46.025 --> 08:48.944
...then just go out to a coffee shop
or a museum.

08:49.111 --> 08:52.113
Meet people. Talk to them.
Take an interest in their lives.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.450
That's insane on the face of it.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.036
-Come on.
-Where are we going?

08:58.204 --> 09:00.455
You're driving me to the mall
to acquire a book...

09:00.623 --> 09:04.167
...that summarizes the current theories
in the field of friend making.

09:05.461 --> 09:08.713
Why don't you just lie down on the floor
and swim there?

09:13.094 --> 09:16.221
"Coping With the Death of a Loved One."

09:16.973 --> 09:19.641
-My condolences.
-Thank you.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.601
Family or friend?

09:21.769 --> 09:23.186
-Family.
-Too bad.

09:24.021 --> 09:27.399
If it had been a friend,
I'm available to fill the void.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.782
It's just as well.
She smelled like mothballs.

09:36.200 --> 09:40.161
Okay, if you're gonna start sniffing people,
I'm gonna go get a hot pretzel.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.622
Excuse me.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.667
Do you have any books
about making friends?

09:45.835 --> 09:48.044
Um, yeah, but they're all for kids.

09:48.212 --> 09:51.089
Oh, I assume the skills
can be extrapolated and transferred.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.593
Uh, I guess. They're right over there
by the wooden train set.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.263
Oh! I love trains.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.391
I bet you do.

10:03.936 --> 10:07.147
Oh, my, that's awfully sticky.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.067
All right.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.194
Let's see.

10:15.364 --> 10:19.159
"Bernie Bunny Has Two Daddies Now."

10:19.327 --> 10:22.287
That's probably
about homosexual rabbits.

10:23.372 --> 10:26.666
"Gerry the Gerbil
and the Bullies on the Bus."

10:26.834 --> 10:29.210
Read it, not helpful.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.672
Ooh. Well, here we go.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.426
"Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo."

10:37.470 --> 10:39.095
"Author Sarah Carpenter...

10:39.263 --> 10:41.890
...lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana...

10:42.058 --> 10:45.018
...with her husband
and best friend, Mark...

10:45.186 --> 10:47.103
...and their cockatoo, Stu."

10:48.356 --> 10:51.650
Hardly makes her an expert
in making friends, wouldn't you agree?

10:51.817 --> 10:53.902
I don't like birds. They scare me.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.821
Me too.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.408
Most people don't see it.

11:02.578 --> 11:03.703
What are you reading?

11:03.871 --> 11:05.038
Curious George.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.831
Oh, I do like monkeys.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.416
Curious George is a monkey.

11:08.959 --> 11:12.629
Somewhat anthropomorphized, but yes.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.090
Say...

11:15.257 --> 11:17.926
...maybe sometime you and I
could go see monkeys together.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.095
-Would you like that?
-Okay.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.263
Sheldon, what are you doing?

11:22.932 --> 11:25.100
I'm making friends with this little girl.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.935
-What's your name?
-Rebecca.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.437
Hi, Rebecca.
I'm your new friend, Sheldon.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.147
-No, you're not. Let's go.
-I--

11:31.982 --> 11:33.400
We were really hitting it off.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.610
Don't look up, there's cameras.

11:40.449 --> 11:43.326
I'm curious, in the "How Well Do
You Know Sheldon?" section...

11:43.494 --> 11:46.079
...what did you put
for his favorite amino acid?

11:47.373 --> 11:48.498
Lysine.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.500
Damn it, I had lysine and changed it.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.211
Oh, good. You're just in time.

11:53.379 --> 11:57.549
I believe I've isolated the algorithm
for making friends.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.635
Sheldon, there is no algorithm
for making friends.

12:00.803 --> 12:04.305
Hear him out. If he's onto something,
we could open a booth at Comic-Con...

12:04.473 --> 12:06.141
...make a fortune.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.853
You see, my initial approach to Kripke
had the same deficiencies...

12:10.020 --> 12:13.815
...as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo
when he was new at the zoo.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.651
Stu the Cockatoo?

12:16.819 --> 12:18.987
Yes. He's new at the zoo.

12:19.488 --> 12:22.991
It's a terrific book. I've distilled its essence
into a simple flow chart...

12:23.159 --> 12:24.826
...that will guide me through the process.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.079
Have you thought about putting him
in a crate...

12:28.247 --> 12:30.206
...while you're out of the apartment?

12:30.833 --> 12:33.585
Hello, Kripke.
Yeah, Sheldon Cooper here.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.504
It occurred to me you hadn't returned
any of my calls...

12:36.672 --> 12:40.341
...because I hadn't offered any suggestions
for pursuing our friendship.

12:40.509 --> 12:45.263
Yeah, perhaps the two of us
might share a meal together.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.056
Yeah, I see.

12:47.224 --> 12:51.186
Well, then perhaps you'd have time
for a hot beverage?

12:51.353 --> 12:55.064
Popular choices include tea,
coffee, cocoa.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.400
I see. No, no, no, wait.
Don't hang up yet.

12:57.568 --> 13:00.361
But what about a recreational activity?

13:00.529 --> 13:02.697
I bet we share some common interests.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.700
Tell me an interest of yours.

13:05.868 --> 13:09.162
Really? On actual horses?

13:10.706 --> 13:13.541
Tell me another interest of yours.

13:13.709 --> 13:17.879
Oh, I'm sorry. I have no desire to get
in the water till I absolutely have to.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.256
Tell me another interest of yours.

13:20.424 --> 13:23.051
-Uh-oh, he's stuck in an infinite loop.
-I can fix it.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.719
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

13:24.887 --> 13:29.432
It's interesting but isn't ventriloquism
by definition a solo activity?

13:29.600 --> 13:32.936
Yeah. Tell me another interest of yours.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.395
Hmm.

13:34.563 --> 13:37.315
Is there any chance you like monkeys?

13:37.733 --> 13:39.067
Yeah, what is wrong with you?

13:39.235 --> 13:41.611
Everybody likes monkeys.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.279
Hang on, Kripke.

13:45.741 --> 13:50.411
A loop counter and an escape
to the least objectionable activity.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.247
Howard, that's brilliant.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.749
I'm surprised you saw that.

13:55.918 --> 13:59.254
Gee, why can't Sheldon make friends?

13:59.797 --> 14:03.383
All right. That last interest strikes me
as the least objectionable.

14:03.551 --> 14:07.095
And I would like to propose
that we do that together.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.930
Tomorrow.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.432
Yes, I'll pay.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.434
All right, goodbye.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.603
All right.

14:15.771 --> 14:18.398
Time to learn rock climbing.

14:26.198 --> 14:29.492
You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism.

14:29.660 --> 14:33.288
Maybe you, me and your dummy
could go get a hot beverage.

14:33.455 --> 14:35.957
He could talk while you drink.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.960
Nope. I wanna climb some rocks.

14:44.008 --> 14:49.596
This appears significantly more monolithic
than it did on my laptop.

14:50.139 --> 14:54.642
You know, one expects to see hominids
learning to use bones as weapons.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.978
-Hey, you afraid of heights, Cooper?
-Hardly.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.480
A fear of heights is illogical.

14:59.648 --> 15:03.026
Fear of falling, on the other hand,
is prudent and evolutionary.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.737
What would you say
is the minimum altitude...

15:05.905 --> 15:08.489
... I need to achieve to cement
our newfound friendship?

15:09.074 --> 15:13.036
Come on, they have birthday parties here.
Little kids climb this.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.998
Little kid hominids, perhaps.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.670
So is this your entire job?

15:23.088 --> 15:25.381
Your parents must be so proud.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.592
Let's go, Cooper.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.594
Coming, Kripke.

15:29.762 --> 15:33.431
Okay, harness seems to be secure.

15:33.933 --> 15:38.186
A small amount of incontinence just now,
but the website said that's to be expected.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.356
Hey.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.192
This isn't so bad.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.111
It's a bit like vertical swimming.

15:48.238 --> 15:50.365
Look at you.
You're almost halfway to the top.

15:50.532 --> 15:51.866
I am? I--

15:54.411 --> 15:55.703
I was wrong.

15:55.871 --> 15:58.373
It is a fear of heights.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.708
-You all right there, Cooper?
-Not really.

16:00.876 --> 16:04.879
I feel like an inverse tangent function
that's approaching an asymptote.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.298
-Stuck?
-What part of "inverse tangent function...

16:07.466 --> 16:09.634
...approaching an asymptote"
did you not understand?

16:09.802 --> 16:12.428
I understood all of it, I'm not a moron.

16:12.596 --> 16:13.638
Just keep going.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.890
Yeah, I don't think I can.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.558
Well, then climb back down.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.562
No, that doesn't seem any more likely.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.231
So, what's the plan, Cooper?

16:23.732 --> 16:28.403
Well, it's not exactly a plan
but I think I'm going to pass out.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.415
I'm sorry,
can we just do it one more time?

16:40.582 --> 16:41.708
Okay.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.252
One, two. One, two, three and....

16:58.517 --> 17:01.769
It's a little thing but you really do miss it.

17:02.396 --> 17:03.479
Hello, everyone.

17:03.647 --> 17:07.025
I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke,
home for dinner.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.112
Hello to you too.

17:11.613 --> 17:12.947
How was rock climbing?

17:13.115 --> 17:14.490
He passed out.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.993
Just hung there like a big salami.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.371
Eh, eh, eh. That's where I sit.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.624
Ooh, you have a special spot.
What kind of wacko are you?

17:24.585 --> 17:26.836
How much time you got?

17:28.005 --> 17:29.630
You want some Chinese food?

17:29.798 --> 17:31.966
Terrific. Got any dental floss?

17:32.593 --> 17:33.801
In the bathroom.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.303
Be right back.

17:35.471 --> 17:39.849
I gotta floss the lndian food out of my teeth
if I'm gonna eat Chinese.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.643
Sheldon, are you okay?

17:42.811 --> 17:46.022
Oh, yes. I pass out all the time.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.984
But it was worth it. I've made substantial
progress in bonding with Kripke...

17:50.152 --> 17:52.653
...which brings me
to an awkward moment.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.656
-What's that?
-Maintaining five friendships...

17:55.824 --> 17:59.160
...promises to be a Herculean task.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.704
So I'm going to have
to let one of you go.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.793
Me, me, let it be me.

18:08.295 --> 18:12.173
Leonard, you are my roommate,
my source of transportation...

18:12.341 --> 18:16.344
...and you help me fold my sheets
when they come out of the dryer.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.346
You are safe.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.849
-Can I whistle?
-Don't be silly.

18:22.601 --> 18:23.643
Howard...

18:23.811 --> 18:25.561
...you do not have a Ph.D.

18:26.021 --> 18:29.023
Your cologne is an assault on the senses.

18:29.191 --> 18:32.860
And you're not available for video games
during the Jewish High Holidays.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.531
-Guilty as charged. I'm out.
-No.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.241
You, too, are safe.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.495
Come on. What do I have to do?

18:42.704 --> 18:44.872
Okay, you know what?
I see where this is going.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.249
I'm not one of you guys.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.209
- I'm not a scientist, so--
Penny...

18:48.377 --> 18:51.379
...everything you're saying is true,
but please allow me to continue.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.714
Raj, you're out.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.055
It's a good question.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.599
While you do provide
a certain cultural diversity...

19:03.767 --> 19:08.229
...to a homogenous group, your responses
to the questionnaire were truly disturbing.

19:08.397 --> 19:12.567
How could you for a moment think
that my favorite amino acid is glutamine?

19:14.570 --> 19:16.571
- He had lysine but changed it.
- Yeah.

19:16.738 --> 19:19.073
Should have, would have,
could have, Raj.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.661
I like to floss before I eat...

19:23.829 --> 19:26.914
...so my gum pockets
are open for new food.

19:27.875 --> 19:28.916
Ew.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.670
Hello.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.465
How did I walk past you?

19:36.633 --> 19:37.758
I'm Barry.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.761
-Penny.
-Eh, that's not a very hot name.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.098
I'm gonna call you "Roxanne."

19:45.684 --> 19:46.934
Ooh, pot stickers.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.022
Suddenly, I'm looking pretty good, huh?

19:54.443 --> 19:57.570
So, uh, Kripke,
I was wondering if there's any chance...

19:57.738 --> 20:00.907
...you could get me some time
on the Open Science Grid computer?

20:01.074 --> 20:02.533
No.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.784
No?

20:03.952 --> 20:05.286
But we're friends.

20:05.996 --> 20:10.124
I'm sorry. No, my friend.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.210
I'm confused.

20:12.377 --> 20:16.130
I was given to understand that you allow
your friends time on the machine.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.591
No, that's wrong.
There's an official schedule.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.801
I have no control over it.

20:23.055 --> 20:28.392
Oh. This entire endeavor seems
to have been an exercise in futility.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.229
Raj, you're back in.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.483
He likes monkeys.

20:41.657 --> 20:45.117
You gotta give him credit
for sticking with it.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.912
I didn't think he had it in him.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.623
And he almost made it to the top
this time.
