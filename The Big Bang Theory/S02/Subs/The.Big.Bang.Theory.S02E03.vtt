14:07.429 --> 14:08.763
PENNY:
I said, not now.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.849
LEONARD:
Okay, maybe later.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.769
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.939
-Hey, what's with him?
-Penny's been keeping him up at night.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.317
Me too.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.657
But probably in a different way.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.286
She's really hooked on "Age of Conan."
She's playing non-stop.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.454
Oh, yes, online gaming addiction.

14:33.622 --> 14:37.792
There's nothing worse than having
that multiplayer monkey on your back.

14:39.128 --> 14:42.130
-Sheldon, wake up.
-Danger, danger.

14:43.173 --> 14:46.134
Afternoon, men. Sheldon.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.804
Oh, yeah, well, your attempt
at juvenilizing me...

14:49.972 --> 14:55.143
...by excluding me from the set of adult
males just-- Oh, I'm too tired to do this.

14:55.311 --> 14:59.647
Right. I heard you've been pulling
all-nighters with Middle-Earth Barbie.

15:00.441 --> 15:04.402
She comes into my room.
No one's supposed to be in my room.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.238
I would postulate
she's escaping into the online world...

15:07.406 --> 15:09.490
...to compensate
for her sexual frustration.

15:09.658 --> 15:10.909
I do that too.

15:12.995 --> 15:16.164
But probably in a different way.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.917
That's not what she's doing, Leslie.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.670
She's trying to shore up her self-esteem.
It has nothing to do with sex.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.255
Everything has to do with sex.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.175
Mm. Testify.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.011
I'm not touching that.

15:32.681 --> 15:35.391
-Leslie, you are way off base here.
-Now, hang on, Leonard.

15:35.559 --> 15:39.604
While I have no respect for Leslie as a
scientist or a human being for that matter...

15:40.856 --> 15:43.191
...we have to concede
her undeniable expertise...

15:43.359 --> 15:47.862
...in the interrelated fields of promiscuity
and general sluttiness.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.989
Thank you.

15:50.157 --> 15:53.201
My point is that Tinkerbell
just needs to get her some.

15:53.577 --> 15:57.872
Some what?
Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.583
I'll take the bullet.

16:02.378 --> 16:06.547
-Excuse me, this whole idea's insane.
-Enough debate. I'm going to take action.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.342
Excuse me.

16:09.510 --> 16:13.054
Are you currently involved
in a sexual relationship?

16:14.473 --> 16:16.557
-No.
-Would you like to be?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.269
Uh....

16:20.437 --> 16:22.397
Sure, why not?

16:22.815 --> 16:24.399
-Sheldon--
-Yip, yip, yip.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.403
Can I have your phone number?

16:29.780 --> 16:31.155
Uh....

16:31.740 --> 16:33.282
Yeah.

16:33.575 --> 16:35.076
Yeah.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.920
There, problem solved.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.841
Dumb-ass.

16:57.641 --> 17:00.768
Okay, I'm at the gate to the Treasury
of the Ancients. I'm going in.

17:00.936 --> 17:03.521
-Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.
-Got it.

17:04.273 --> 17:08.276
I must say, you're playing very well
for a woman of 23?

17:08.444 --> 17:10.278
-Twenty-two.
-Right, 22.

17:13.866 --> 17:17.785
Here come the mummies. Which spell do I
use? The hateful strike or the frenzy stance?

17:17.953 --> 17:21.748
-What happened to your group?
-Dumped them. They're a bunch of wussies.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.125
Frenzy stance.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.711
Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.799
So listen,
would you describe your ideal vacation...

17:31.967 --> 17:36.804
...as a wild adventure to unknown lands
or staying at home with a good book?

17:36.972 --> 17:39.682
-Wait, what?
-These are market-research questions.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.643
I'm filling out the online registration
for your game.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.479
Oh, okay, wild adventure.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.522
Oh, frenzy stance isn't working.

17:46.690 --> 17:49.650
-Die, you undead mummy, die!
-Drink a healing potion.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.736
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.615
Anyhow, on a scale of one to five...

17:55.783 --> 18:00.787
...with one being, "always initiated by him"
and five being, "always initiated by you"...

18:00.954 --> 18:04.415
...how do you prefer
your sexual encounters to begin?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.375
That's on the registration?

18:06.543 --> 18:08.753
Oh, yes, it's quite extensive.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.172
If we complete it,
you get a free expansion pack.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.174
Seventy-five additional quests.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.594
Oh, awesome. Okay, I totally like to initiate.
I'm a big old five.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.846
Good to know.

18:19.014 --> 18:21.265
Big old five.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.527
-Hello.
-Hi.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.028
Leonard, this is Tom.

18:37.825 --> 18:38.866
Hi, Tom. Sheldon.

18:43.330 --> 18:47.708
Didn't I explain to you
about your little mistake in the cafeteria?

18:47.876 --> 18:51.212
Yes, you were very clear,
as was everyone else at the table.

18:53.090 --> 18:57.552
Tom, however, has been chosen by science
as a suitable mate for Penny.

18:57.719 --> 18:59.053
Chosen by science.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.639
Well, what passes for science
on dating sites.

19:02.975 --> 19:06.811
They may claim to use heuristic algorithms,
but it may well be hokum.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.939
You got Penny to sign up
for online dating?

19:10.107 --> 19:14.402
No, no, of course not.
No, see, I used trickery and deceit.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.655
This is bad.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.824
Tom is a paramedic
with the fire department.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.284
He's going to med school.

19:21.451 --> 19:26.247
Uh, he likes the outdoors
and, uh, strong women who initiate sex.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.333
Really, really bad.

19:30.419 --> 19:34.755
I'm surprised you struck out with Penny.
Apparently, she's a big old five.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.594
-Sheldon, what do you want?
-Oh, good, you got my note.

19:39.761 --> 19:42.805
Penny, I'd like you to meet Tom.
Uh, Penny, this is Tom.

19:42.973 --> 19:45.433
-Tom, may I present Penny.
-Hi, Penny.

19:45.601 --> 19:49.854
Hi, as long as I'm here, I'm on a quest with
newbs, don't know what they're doing.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.273
Got one assassin, three spell casters,
no tank.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.275
-Can we talk later?
-No, I need you now.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.485
Wouldn't you prefer
to socialize with Tom...

19:56.653 --> 19:59.488
...who is a sexually passive
outdoorsman?

20:01.658 --> 20:05.286
-Whatever, I'll figure it out myself.
-Bye, Penny.

20:07.122 --> 20:10.458
I'm sorry, dude,
she didn't look anything like her picture.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.295
They never do.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.553
HOWARD:
Hello, fair Penny.

20:22.721 --> 20:26.140
PENNY: Who are you?
HOWARD: It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz.

20:27.517 --> 20:30.436
Can I interest you
in an afternoon of spirited questing...

20:30.604 --> 20:33.147
...followed by a flagon of ale
at yon virtual tavern?

20:33.941 --> 20:35.316
PENNY:
Yeah, sure, why not?

20:38.862 --> 20:40.947
Oh, my God, I need help.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.396
