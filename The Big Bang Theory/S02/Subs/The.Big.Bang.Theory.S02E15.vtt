Penny, come on.
We were just finding our sound.

00:35.910 --> 00:40.372
You found it. It's the sound of a cat
being run over by a lawn mower.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.751
Well, I'm really very busy.

00:43.918 --> 00:47.212
Is there any way we can put this off
until I have more time to prepare?

00:47.964 --> 00:51.050
Of course,
but, uh, you understand my trepidation.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.801
-What's that about?
-Not a clue.

00:52.969 --> 00:55.429
Can't we just postpone it till the spring?

00:55.597 --> 00:57.139
Maybe next summer?

00:57.307 --> 00:59.058
This should be fairly easy to deduce.

00:59.225 --> 01:02.478
He's holding the phone to his left ear.
Ears do not cross hemispheres.

01:02.645 --> 01:05.856
He's using the analytical,
rather than emotional side of the brain...

01:06.024 --> 01:09.318
...suggesting that he has
no personal relationship with the caller.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.654
No, I didn't realize it had been so long.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.908
Sure. I guess there's no other choice
but to go ahead and do it.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.327
He's referring to an activity
he has done before.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.579
It's unpleasant and needs to be repeated.

01:20.747 --> 01:26.168
This suggests some sort of invasive
medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.004
Aren't there any other options?
There's not a lot of room.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.590
-It's gonna be uncomfortable.
SHELDON: Yes, yes.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.718

It's out of order.

02:19.848 --> 02:24.184
Yes, I can read the sign.
I'm just pondering the implications.

02:25.228 --> 02:29.189
I think it implies
that the elevator doesn't work.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.192
Again, I can read the sign.

02:32.735 --> 02:36.071
But the sign and tape are covered
with a layer of dust which indicates...

02:36.239 --> 02:39.449
...the elevator has been nonfunctional
for an amount of time...

02:39.617 --> 02:42.744

-Five.
-Oh, well, at that age...

03:45.266 --> 03:49.311
...he was in what Freud would call the
phallic stage of psychosexual development.

An outmoded theory, of course.

04:23.846 --> 04:27.266
Yeah, I don't know what that means.

Well, it means you value yourself
only as others value you...

04:31.187 --> 04:35.065

of unmet childhood emotional needs.
