WEBVTT

00:05.463 --> 00:08.173
-I don't see anything at all, Sheldon.
-Ugh.

00:08.883 --> 00:12.302
You're the doctor, but I'm constantly
hearing this annoying sound.

00:13.471 --> 00:15.180
Me too.

00:16.266 --> 00:17.808
Is it a high-frequency whistle?

00:17.976 --> 00:22.479
No, it's more of a relentless,
narcissistic drone.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.441
Yeah, there's no inflammation at all,
Sheldon.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.860
Then it must be a tumor.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.779
I seriously doubt it.

00:30.947 --> 00:35.492
Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection
from all those childhood toilet swirlies.

00:36.995 --> 00:40.372
Is that possible?
I used to get those all the time.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.791
Even in church.

00:43.168 --> 00:47.838
Well, you know, if it is from a swirly,
there's something I can do, okay. Ahem.

00:48.006 --> 00:52.760
Circle, circle, dot, dot,
now you have a cootie shot.

00:54.637 --> 00:55.721
-I'm going to bed.
-Okay.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.182
-I'll be right in.
-Okay.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.975
It's not enough she mocks me...

01:00.143 --> 01:03.353
...but that isn't even the correct procedure
for a cootie shot.

01:03.772 --> 01:08.192
Do you understand that Stephanie's
not here to treat your imaginary ailments?

01:08.359 --> 01:11.487
How is it imaginary that
I keep hearing an octave above middle C?

01:11.654 --> 01:13.113
[HUMS]

01:14.032 --> 01:15.074
Is that imaginary?

01:15.241 --> 01:16.450
[HUMS]

01:16.701 --> 01:18.660
I don't think so.

01:18.828 --> 01:20.412
[HUMS]

01:22.457 --> 01:24.541
-Good night.
-Leonard, there's one more thing.

01:24.709 --> 01:27.169
Article One, Section Three
of our roommate agreement.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.755
-I'm calling an emergency meeting.
-No, you're not.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.550
Leonard moves the meeting not occur.
Second? None heard, the motion fails.

01:34.844 --> 01:38.055
I'd like to begin the meeting
by congratulating you on the progress...

01:38.223 --> 01:40.224
...in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.559
-Thank you.
-And that being said...

01:42.727 --> 01:46.146
...we have to discuss the implementation
of the cohabitation rider...

01:46.314 --> 01:49.066
...which has been activated
now that you're living together.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.820
-We're not living together.
-I beg to disagree. Ahem.

01:52.987 --> 01:56.240
"A girlfriend shall be deemed, quote,
living with, unquote, Leonard...

01:56.407 --> 01:58.992
...when she has stayed over,
A, 10 consecutive nights...

01:59.160 --> 02:02.079
...or B, more than nine nights
in a three-week period, or C...

02:02.247 --> 02:05.666
...all the weekends of a given month
plus three weeknights."

02:08.545 --> 02:10.546
-That's absurd.
-No.

02:10.713 --> 02:13.924
You initialed it. See? "L.H., L.H., L.H."

02:14.092 --> 02:17.803
Okay, wait. I only initialed it
because I never thought it would happen.

02:19.097 --> 02:24.101
I initialed another clause naming you
my sidekick in case I get superpowers.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.770
Hm. Yes, you did.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.858
Now to review, the following provisions
are hereby activated.

02:31.025 --> 02:34.862
In the refrigerator, as opposed to two
separate shelves and one communal shelf...

02:35.029 --> 02:38.657
...the three of us now get individual shelves
and the door becomes communal.

02:38.825 --> 02:42.452
Next, apartment vacuuming shall be
increased from two to three times a week...

02:42.620 --> 02:45.581
...to accommodate the increased
accumulation of dead skin cells.

02:45.748 --> 02:48.083
The bathroom schedule.
I'm given to understand...

02:48.251 --> 02:52.045
...women have different needs,
so we'll have to discuss that.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.134
-I'm going to bed.
-But, yeah, but--

02:57.302 --> 02:58.594
At least take this with you.

02:58.761 --> 03:02.890
Look, and have Stephanie
initial here, here, here, here...

03:03.266 --> 03:06.143
...and here.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.978
This states that she does not now...

03:08.146 --> 03:11.315
...nor does she intend to play a percussive
or brass instrument.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.486
[SIGHS]

03:20.783 --> 03:22.492
[HUMMING]

03:26.956 --> 03:28.957
[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
Sure sounds like a tumor...

03:29.125 --> 03:31.335
...pressing on the auditory nerve.

03:55.693 --> 03:59.238
-No, absolutely not.
-It's not a big deal.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.949
We have latex gloves.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.742
I don't care what the symptoms are.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.120
My girlfriend is not gonna give you
a prostate exam.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.042
-Hi, Sheldon.
-Good morning, Dr. Stephanie.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.503
I trust Leonard satisfied you
sexually last night?

04:14.671 --> 04:16.964
Oh, good God.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.050
Sheldon, we don't ask questions like that.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.512
I heard you ask it over and over.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.348
How is it inappropriate for me
to ask it once?

04:26.808 --> 04:29.893
-He did very nicely.
-But see? She's not offended.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.853
And now you finally have an answer.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.483
-Out of coffee. Need coffee.
-Uh--

04:36.651 --> 04:39.903
-Hello.
-Hi. Stephanie, right?

04:40.071 --> 04:42.406
Mm-hm. And--? And you are?

04:42.573 --> 04:44.533
I'm Penny. I live across the hall.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.828
-Heard a lot about you.
-Really?

04:47.996 --> 04:51.123
-Mm-hm. Ha, ha.
-I haven't heard a thing about you.

04:58.881 --> 05:03.635
Leonard? Why haven't I heard a thing about
this woman who lives across the hall...

05:03.803 --> 05:08.432
...and comes into your apartment
in the morning in her underwear?

05:12.812 --> 05:14.396
Um. Uh--

05:14.564 --> 05:18.191
She's heard about you
because we're, you know, involved...

05:18.359 --> 05:22.029
...and you haven't heard about her
because....

05:22.864 --> 05:24.823
I never slept with her, I swear.

05:25.783 --> 05:29.077
In Leonard's defense,
it wasn't for lack of trying.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.290
-Thank you, Sheldon.
-You're welcome, Leonard.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.710
Look, I'm just saying, um...

05:36.878 --> 05:40.213
...Penny is one of our many neighbors,
you know.

05:40.381 --> 05:43.050
And in our building,
neighbors come and go.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.802
Well, it's very casual. No dress code or....

05:46.387 --> 05:49.431
Some mornings, I'll mosey down
to the third floor in my pajamas...

05:49.599 --> 05:52.100
...and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

05:52.268 --> 05:56.688
Really? I've never once been invited
to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.315
She doesn't like you.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.735
-Well, you have a gall bladder to remove.
-Yeah.

06:01.903 --> 06:05.364
And I have to get in the shower
and Penny has clothes to put on, so....

06:06.699 --> 06:10.077
-Well, it was very nice meeting you.
-Nice to finally meet you too.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.954
-I'll see you tonight? Bye.
-Yeah. Bye-bye.

06:22.298 --> 06:25.801
What could I possibly have done to offend
Mrs. Vartabedian?

06:26.844 --> 06:29.846
So that's Stephanie, huh?

06:31.557 --> 06:34.851
Why do I feel like I'm the one
that just got the prostate exam?

06:40.525 --> 06:43.860
-You know, she seems very nice.
-Oh, she is. She's terrific.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.238
And she's proving to be
a valuable roommate.

06:46.697 --> 06:50.742
-Roommate? You guys are living together?
-Like hippies.

06:51.285 --> 06:52.786
We're not living together.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.414
Do I have to pull out
the paperwork again?

06:55.581 --> 06:57.040
We're not living together.

06:57.208 --> 07:00.127
-Are you sure?
-How could I not be sure?

07:00.294 --> 07:02.587
Well, let's find out.

07:02.755 --> 07:06.341
Don't you think if a woman was living
with me, I'd be the first one to know?

07:06.509 --> 07:09.803
Oh, sweetie, you'd be the last one
to know about it.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.266
Hmm.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.977
Cute dresses.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.938
I bet this looks great on you.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.315
We're not living together.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.025
Okay. Hmm.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.736
Scented candles, fuzzy slippers. Ooh.

07:26.904 --> 07:29.239
Floral bed sheets.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.199
We're not living together.

07:31.367 --> 07:32.492
Okay, moving on.

07:32.660 --> 07:35.412
Uh, who are these guys at Disney World?

07:35.580 --> 07:36.621
Uh....

07:36.789 --> 07:39.082
The big dog is Goofy.

07:39.375 --> 07:44.087
And the older couple with the mouse ears,
I have no idea.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.215
We're not living together.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.843
You're gonna go down swinging, huh?

07:50.887 --> 07:55.307
All right. Well, we got your body lotion,
your In Style magazine, your jewelry box.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.519
We're not-- Where's my Bat-Signal?

08:00.146 --> 08:03.857
-You have a Bat-Signal?
-I did.

08:04.108 --> 08:06.401
It was right here.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.570
She must have--

08:09.238 --> 08:11.823
Oh, my God, we're living together.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.452
Really? What was your first clue?

08:30.134 --> 08:31.801
New pants?

08:31.969 --> 08:34.471
Yeah. Stephanie got them for me.

08:35.556 --> 08:36.848
Nice. Cotton?

08:37.016 --> 08:40.810
Actually, I think
it's more of a wool-fire ant blend.

08:41.729 --> 08:44.606
The girlfriend's buying clothes for you, huh?
Sounds serious.

08:44.774 --> 08:48.568
It is, actually.
In fact, I gave it a lot of thought...

08:48.736 --> 08:51.571
...and I decided it was time
for us to live together.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.742
Oh, Leonard, huge mistake.

08:55.910 --> 08:59.788
There's a whole buffet of women out there
and you're just standing in the corner...

08:59.956 --> 09:03.208
...eating the same deviled egg,
over and over again.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.504
At least I have an egg.
What do you have?

09:07.672 --> 09:11.967
A veritable smorgasbord
of potential sexual partners.

09:12.134 --> 09:14.344
See the blond over there?

09:15.638 --> 09:18.223
I can hit on her and you can't.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.518
So go hit on her.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.440
She's not my type.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.318
Too bad.
She was checking you out before.

09:30.486 --> 09:33.154
-She was?
-Of course not. Look at her.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.367
You know, I don't care
what you guys think.

09:37.535 --> 09:40.036
Stephanie and I are very happy
living together.

09:40.204 --> 09:43.540
I will give either of you $20 right now
to trade pants with me.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.009
-Sheldon? What are you doing here?
-Hang on.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.388
130/80. That's a little high.

09:58.806 --> 10:02.642
We can attribute that to the stress
of sneaking past the security desk.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.604
Where did you get the stethoscope
and pressure cuff?

10:05.771 --> 10:08.523
My Aunt Marion gave them to me
for my 12th birthday.

10:10.109 --> 10:14.404
She thought if I failed at theoretical physics
that I should have a trade to fall back on.

10:15.865 --> 10:19.200
And by the way, the blood pressure cuff
is called a sphygmomanometer.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.787
-Thank you.
-Didn't teach you that in medical school?

10:24.373 --> 10:26.166
-I'm kind of busy here.
-I understand.

10:26.334 --> 10:29.127
All I need is for you to authorize
these tests.

10:29.295 --> 10:33.590
Ha. A cardiac stress test,
a full-body MRI, an electromyogram...

10:33.758 --> 10:35.884
...a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?

10:36.052 --> 10:39.220
Oh, and exploratory laparoscopy.
The last time I had hiccups...

10:39.388 --> 10:42.307
...it felt like my diaphragm
was just going through the motions.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.976
Go home, Sheldon.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.936
Can I at least have the upper GI?

10:47.730 --> 10:50.106
I already drank the barium.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.568
Oh, hey.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.695
Oh, good.
Do you have any fabric softener?

10:55.863 --> 10:57.572
Yeah, sure.

11:06.415 --> 11:09.459
What, are you washing a crocodile?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.462
No. The pants that Stephanie got me.

11:12.630 --> 11:16.132
Oh, sweetie, you can't machine wash these.
They'll be ruined.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.967
-You sure?
-Absolutely.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.599
Oh, no. I wish you'd told me that sooner.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.979
-Are you guys having problems?
-No. Everything's fine.

11:30.439 --> 11:33.233
-Really?
-Yeah, it's wonderful.

11:34.819 --> 11:38.488
Okay, maybe this whole
living together happened...

11:38.656 --> 11:40.782
...kind of suddenly,
but it's fine, it's great.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.244
Okay, Leonard, if you're uncomfortable
with the way things are going...

11:44.412 --> 11:46.413
...you're allowed to say something.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.957
Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.335
Believe me, your feelings
are just as important as hers.

11:53.212 --> 11:56.464
No, that doesn't sound right either.

11:57.133 --> 12:01.636
Tell her you need the relationship to move
at a pace you both are comfortable with.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.849
Yeah, I could say something
like that to her.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.143
I'll go do that.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.687
-Thank you.
-Sure.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.236
You have a really good grasp on this.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.405
Maybe you could talk to her?

12:21.657 --> 12:23.158
You're kidding, right?

12:24.118 --> 12:26.035
No, but that's okay.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.540
I'll go talk to her.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.668
Wanna come with?

12:35.421 --> 12:37.422
Go.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.717
Wow.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.226
Oh, no.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.437
What?

12:52.605 --> 12:55.565
You were right.
Your larynx is terribly inflamed.

12:55.733 --> 12:59.611
-I mean, I've never seen anything like it.
-I knew it.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.406
What do I do?

13:03.908 --> 13:07.452
You're gonna need to stop talking,
immediately.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.371
-For how long should--?
-Eh, eh, eh!

13:11.665 --> 13:13.249
Immediately.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.920
-Hey.
-Oh, hi, honey.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.755
Sheldon.

13:26.430 --> 13:27.472
What's going on?

13:28.182 --> 13:31.226
I just performed a Sheldon-ectomy.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.021
Careful. If you don't get it all,
it'll only come back worse.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.397
[LAUGHS]

13:36.565 --> 13:38.942
-Gotcha.
-Listen, we need to talk.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.027
Uh-oh.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.905
Do we need to talk,
or do we need to talk.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.574
I don't know what that means.

13:46.742 --> 13:50.203
Okay, why don't you just tell me
what it is you have to tell me?

13:50.371 --> 13:51.871
Okay. Um....

13:52.289 --> 13:54.624
Well, look, it's just that...

13:54.792 --> 13:58.670
...things between you and me
have been going pretty quick.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.298
-And?
-It's just a little scary.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.218
Well, yeah, but scary good, right?

14:05.636 --> 14:07.387
Sure.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.558
When is scary not good?

14:12.393 --> 14:17.105
-But-- Okay. Um, I have feelings, right?
-Uh-huh.

14:17.273 --> 14:20.316
Okay, and it's perfectly okay to express
those feelings, right?

14:20.484 --> 14:22.944
Of course. Why don't you tell me
what you're feeling?

14:23.112 --> 14:26.948
Okay, well, I ju-- I think it's important
to remember that we move...

14:27.116 --> 14:32.078
...at a pace that is our speed and....

14:32.955 --> 14:35.540
Oh, shoot, I had it.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.502
Okay, how about this?
How about I tell you what I'm feeling?

14:39.670 --> 14:41.588
What's that?

14:44.383 --> 14:45.925
Really? Right now?

14:46.969 --> 14:48.595
-Why not?
-I just ate.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.805
Aren't you supposed to wait an hour?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.518
I think that's for swimming.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.813
-Ah. Okay.
-Okay.

14:59.815 --> 15:02.150
-Hope I don't get cramps.
-Yeah.

15:04.653 --> 15:05.945
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:06.113 --> 15:08.364
-Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.
-Thank you.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.825
-Your pants are ruined.
-Good.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.871
So how did the talk with Stephanie go?

15:15.039 --> 15:20.209
Well, um, on one level, really, really well.

15:20.836 --> 15:23.379
So you told her you wanted
to slow things down?

15:23.547 --> 15:27.967
Not specifically.
But, um, I did tell her that I had feelings.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.303
Good. Good.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.930
And then what?

15:32.848 --> 15:37.435
And then the subject
got changed somehow.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.521
You had sex, didn't you?

15:41.106 --> 15:42.190
Um....

15:42.358 --> 15:43.900
Little bit.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.530
-What?
-Nothing.

15:53.535 --> 15:56.245
Okay, well, it sounds like
things are gonna work out.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.206
Yeah. Yeah, it's all good.

15:58.374 --> 16:01.334
Everything's gonna work out,
one way or another.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.503
God, come on, Leonard.

16:03.671 --> 16:07.090
You are entitled to try and make things
go the way you want them to.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.550
-Really?
-Yes.

16:09.718 --> 16:12.261
You don't always have to go along
with what the woman wants.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.180
Huh.

16:15.307 --> 16:20.144
-What?
-Nothing. Just rethinking my whole life.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.485
Okay, here's the thing.

16:27.653 --> 16:31.406
I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out,
she'll just dump me.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.825
Well, that's a chance you have to take.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.411
I mean, look, if it's meant to be, it'll be.

16:37.746 --> 16:39.664
Very comforting.

16:41.041 --> 16:44.127
Okay, so, what do I say to her?

16:44.753 --> 16:46.754
I don't know.
What have women said to you...

16:46.922 --> 16:49.590
...when they wanted
to slow a relationship down?

16:49.758 --> 16:53.219
I really like you,
but I wanna see how things go with Mark?

16:56.098 --> 16:58.266
Yeah, that'll slow it down.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.729
[BOTH PANTING]

17:05.399 --> 17:08.776
I'm sorry, I totally interrupted you.
What were you saying?

17:09.695 --> 17:11.112
Oh.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.281
Right, yeah. Um....

17:13.449 --> 17:17.702
So, Stephanie, here's the thing.

17:18.078 --> 17:23.207
-I really like you--
-Oh, God, here comes the speech.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.837
What speech?

17:28.547 --> 17:33.259
I really like you but maybe we should spend
a little less time together...

17:33.427 --> 17:36.846
...because I need my space,
but I'll call you on Tuesday.

17:37.014 --> 17:40.475
And then you never call me, so I call you,
but you don't call me back.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.935
And then when I run into you
at the coffee shop...

17:43.103 --> 17:45.480
...you pretend you have problems
with voice mail...

17:45.647 --> 17:49.108
...and I know that you're lying
but I pretend like I don't care...

17:49.276 --> 17:52.070
...even though I'm dying inside.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.159
No.

17:59.620 --> 18:03.122
No, no. Uh,
I wasn't gonna say any of that.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.374
I was just gonna say...

18:06.960 --> 18:09.837
-... I really like you.
-Oh!

18:10.589 --> 18:15.259
Oh, good, because I really like you too.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.265
Terrific.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.564
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.525
Hey.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.402
Nice sweater.

18:34.488 --> 18:37.240
Yeah. Stephanie got it for me.
It's kind of fun.

18:37.574 --> 18:40.118
It's got a big bird on it, dude.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.955
Yeah, yeah. That's the fun part.

18:44.456 --> 18:48.668
We're also getting new curtains for my
bedroom and a dust ruffle and a duvet.

18:48.836 --> 18:52.839
And I don't even know what a duvet is,
but I'm sure if I did I wouldn't want one.

18:53.006 --> 18:57.301
But every time I talk to her about
moving out, she cries and we have sex.

18:58.053 --> 19:01.472
You're lucky.
With me, it's usually the other way around.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.726
You know, if you can't talk to her,
why don't you just text her?

19:06.061 --> 19:09.939
-Isn’t that kind of cowardly?
-Oh, yeah. It's beyond contemptible.

19:10.399 --> 19:14.193
That's true. But, on the other hand,
you are wearing a bird sweater.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.074
Sold.

19:22.327 --> 19:25.621
"I think it would be better
for our relationship...

19:25.789 --> 19:29.250
...if you moved back to your place."

19:30.169 --> 19:31.711
There.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.423
-It's done.
-Good for you.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.134
Yeah, good for me.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.094
I'll never have sex again.
