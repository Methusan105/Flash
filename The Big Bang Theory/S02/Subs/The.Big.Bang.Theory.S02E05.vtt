00:11.803 --> 00:12.970
-Good morning, Leonard.
-Aah!

00:13.847 --> 00:16.598
-Uh-huh.
-We have to stop by Pottery Barn...

00:16.766 --> 00:20.102
...on the way to work.
I bought these Star Wars sheets.

00:20.270 --> 00:24.898
They turned out to be much too stimulating
to be compatible with a good night's sleep.

00:26.651 --> 00:29.319
I don't like the way
Darth Vader stares at me.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.031
I'm not going to work.

00:32.198 --> 00:36.660
Just because your career's been stagnant
for a few years, that's no reason to give up.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.456
Sheldon, I was up all night
using the new free-electron laser...

00:40.623 --> 00:42.708
...for my x-ray-diffraction experiment.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.711
Did the laser accidentally
burn out your retinas?

00:46.129 --> 00:48.630
-No.
-Then you can drive. Let's go.

[LEONARD SIGHS]

00:51.051 --> 00:55.179
Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights and
you'd have to make other arrangements?

00:55.346 --> 00:56.597
-You did.
-And?

00:56.765 --> 00:58.557
I didn't.

00:59.476 --> 01:00.768
Let's go.

01:01.811 --> 01:02.853
Good night, Sheldon.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.773
-But how am I going to get to work?
-Take the bus.

01:05.940 --> 01:08.358
But I can't take the bus.
They don't have seat belts.

01:08.526 --> 01:11.862
And they won't let you lash yourself
to the seat with bungee cords.

01:12.322 --> 01:15.157
You tried to lash yourself
to the seat with bungee cords?

01:15.325 --> 01:17.910
I didn't try, I succeeded.

01:18.661 --> 01:22.706
But for some reason, it alarmed the other
passengers and I was asked to de-bus.

01:22.874 --> 01:25.542
Oh, you're a big boy. You'll figure it out.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.544
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

01:27.712 --> 01:31.006
Now take me
to return my Star Wars sheets.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.011
Penny? Penny?

01:36.846 --> 01:39.389
Sheldon, what is it?

01:39.557 --> 01:41.642
Leonard's asleep.

01:43.603 --> 01:44.937
Thanks for the update.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.022
No, wait.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.816
You have to drive me to work.

01:49.359 --> 01:52.027
Yeah, I really don't think I do.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.988
But I don't drive
and I can't take the bus.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.866
You'll be fine as long as
you don't do that bungee thing.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.326
Penny.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.413
Didn't you recently state
that you and I are friends?

02:04.666 --> 02:07.543
Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.

02:07.710 --> 02:10.337
Then I hereby invoke
what I'm given to understand...

02:10.505 --> 02:13.882
...is an integral part
of the implied covenant of friendship.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.555
The favor.

02:20.723 --> 02:22.266
Oh, dear God.

02:23.059 --> 02:26.687
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
I was interrupting your morning prayers.

02:28.022 --> 02:30.149
When you're done, we'll go.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.011
Thank you for driving me to work.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.971
You know this is my day off, Sheldon?

03:01.139 --> 03:03.599
Oh, good,
I'm not keeping you from anything.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.771
-Your check-engine light is on.
-Mm-hm.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.526
Typically that's an indicator to,
you know, check your engine.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.487
It's fine. It's been on for like a month.

03:18.406 --> 03:22.659
Well, actually, that would be all the more
reason to, you know, check your engine.

03:23.494 --> 03:26.955
-Sheldon, it's fine.
-If it were fine, the light wouldn't be on.

03:27.123 --> 03:31.001
That's why the manufacturer installed
that light, to let you know it's not fine.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.878
Maybe the light's broken.

03:34.130 --> 03:37.132
Is there
a check-the-check-engine-light light?

03:38.635 --> 03:39.801
Oh.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.511
What?

03:41.679 --> 03:45.307
Studies have shown that performing tasks
such as eating, talking on a phone...

03:45.475 --> 03:48.393
...or drinking coffee while driving
reduces one's reaction time...

03:48.561 --> 03:50.646
...by the same factor
as an ounce of alcohol.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.357
-Do you have any alcohol?
-Of course not.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.484
Too bad.

03:57.987 --> 04:01.156
-You're going up Euclid Avenue?
-Mm-hm.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.991
Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.

04:03.159 --> 04:04.785
Well, good for Leonard.

04:04.953 --> 04:08.497
Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies,
but it has speed bumps...

04:08.665 --> 04:12.709
...which increase point-to-point drive time,
making it the less efficient choice.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.213
But you have the con.

04:17.715 --> 04:19.174
Oh!

04:20.260 --> 04:24.680
If you're not going to slow down for
the speed bumps, I withdraw my objection.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.016
Here's a fun question.

04:28.184 --> 04:30.727
Do you know
what the most common street name is?

04:30.895 --> 04:33.438
-No.
-The answer's tricky.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.691
It's Second Street.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.567
You'd think it would be First Street.

04:37.735 --> 04:41.071
In most towns, First Street eventually
gets renamed to something else.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.781
Like Main Street...

04:42.949 --> 04:44.283
...Broad Street...

04:44.450 --> 04:46.535
...Michigan Avenue.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.453
Leonard and I
often use our commute time...

04:48.621 --> 04:51.248
...to exercise our minds
with brain teasers like that.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.042
We also play games.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.545
Would you like to play one?

04:56.963 --> 04:59.089
-No.
-Oh, come on, it's fun.

04:59.882 --> 05:02.092
Whoo! Another bump.

05:03.553 --> 05:07.055
Okay. Uh, I'll say an element
and, uh, you say an element...

05:07.223 --> 05:10.726
...whose name starts
with the last letter of the one I said, okay?

05:11.894 --> 05:12.936
I'll start.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.231
"Helium."

05:19.569 --> 05:21.737
Now, you could say, "Mercury."

05:21.904 --> 05:23.447
That would give me a Y.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.241
Ooh, very clever. That's a tough one.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.076
So I go with "ytterbium"...

05:28.244 --> 05:29.786
...which gets you back to M.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.580
So you go, "Molybdenum."

05:31.748 --> 05:33.749
And I say, "Magnesium."

05:33.916 --> 05:35.208
And you say, "Manganese."

05:35.376 --> 05:37.169
And I say, "Europium."

05:37.337 --> 05:38.962
And you're left with "mendelevium."

05:39.130 --> 05:42.090
And there are no more M's,
because I believe that meitnerium...

05:42.258 --> 05:46.178
...should still be called eka-iridium.
So congratulations, you win.

I'm finding your reckless nonchalance...

06:05.531 --> 06:08.200

-No.

never had a driver's license.

10:57.907 --> 11:02.535
Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn't make me
wet myself at 40 miles an hour.

Yeah, and I never wanted
to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts.

get a license at 16 like everybody else?

Excuse me, but I have some concerns
about these questions.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.815
Look at that sign up there.

12:13.983 --> 12:17.610
-Yes?
-Does it say, "I give a damn"?

12:19.697 --> 12:22.240
-No.
-That's because I don't.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.452
Just look.
See, this first question makes no sense.

12:25.619 --> 12:29.247
Look, "How many car lengths should you
leave in front of you when driving?"

12:29.415 --> 12:31.624
There's no possible way to answer that.

12:31.792 --> 12:35.378
A car length is not
a standardized unit of measure.

12:36.213 --> 12:38.047
Look at the sign.

-Sheldon, it's C. Just put down C.
-I don't need your help, Penny.

-Listen to that little girl, honey. Put C. Next.

Take a look at this next question.

Sheldon,
why are you arguing with the DMV?

12:51.061 --> 12:53.396
How else are they going to learn?

12:55.065 --> 12:57.025
Look, question two:

12:57.193 --> 12:59.444
"When are roadways most slippery?"

12:59.612 --> 13:01.988
There are three answers,
none of which are correct.

13:02.156 --> 13:06.201
The correct answer is, "When covered by
liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient...

13:06.368 --> 13:09.120
...to static friction between the tire
and the road to zero.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.540
But not so deep as to introduce
a new source of friction."

Here's your learner's permit. Go away.

13:20.591 --> 13:24.093
But I'm not done. I have many
additional concerns about these questions.

13:24.261 --> 13:27.597
-Don't make me climb over this counter.
-All right, come on. Let's go.
