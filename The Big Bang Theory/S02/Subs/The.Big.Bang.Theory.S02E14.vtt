12:36.922 --> 12:40.633
...of people who get drunk
and urinate on police vehicles?

12:40.801 --> 12:44.012
Leonard, I'm not gonna call up Kurt
and ask him for money.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.346
Oh?

12:45.806 --> 12:47.015
What are you gonna do?

12:47.183 --> 12:50.351
I don't know but I might have to find
a cheaper place to live.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.312
Oh, no.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.815
No, you don't wanna do that.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.025
Why not?

12:57.193 --> 12:59.694
Uh, moving is a big deal.

12:59.862 --> 13:04.157
Uh, you-- You have to go
to the supermarket and get boxes...

13:04.325 --> 13:07.952
...and if they're not clean
then your books smell like melons and it's--

13:09.538 --> 13:11.873
Why don't you just get a roommate
and stay here?

13:12.041 --> 13:13.333
Well, do you know anybody?

13:13.501 --> 13:17.921
Well, I'm sure the guy living with Sheldon
wouldn't mind moving in with you.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.051
Oh, Leonard, honey,
if we started living together...

13:23.219 --> 13:26.221
... I wouldn't be able
to keep my hands off you.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.974
Really?

13:31.560 --> 13:34.562
And you thought my acting lessons
were a waste of money.

13:39.735 --> 13:43.738
Ugh. This moo shu pork's burning a hole
through my duodenum.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.534
Tsk, tsk. Leviticus 11:3.

13:47.701 --> 13:52.705
That which parteth the hoof and cheweth
the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.

13:54.750 --> 13:59.379
Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad Gita
every time you scarf down a Whopper?

14:04.134 --> 14:08.012
-Hey, what's going on?
-We're on a quest to the Valley of Fire.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.932
You want the Valley of Fire?
It's right here.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.853
Hey, you guys wanna go
on a real live quest?

14:15.020 --> 14:17.397
Outside? I just made cocoa.

14:18.607 --> 14:19.899
Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.442
What is it?

14:21.610 --> 14:23.862
Do you guys remember
Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt?

14:27.283 --> 14:28.283
Yeah, that's him.

14:28.450 --> 14:32.954
Uh, it turns out he owes Penny a lot
of money and I'm gonna go get it from him.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.789
Who's with me?

14:38.544 --> 14:40.378
Ooh, double sixes.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.047
Really?
You're just gonna let me go by myself?

14:43.215 --> 14:45.633
Oh, cool, I got a sword.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.552
I could use some help.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.137
Here.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.348
You guys are unbelievable.

14:52.516 --> 14:55.685
You play a game to simulate adventure,
but when there's adventure...

14:55.853 --> 14:57.979
...in the real world you just wimp out.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.232
Leonard, do you not recall the last time
we visited this gentleman?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.943
We returned home without pants.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.488
-I do.
-Are you sure?

15:07.656 --> 15:09.908
Because your proposal suggests
that you don't.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.409
I'm not afraid of him.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.995
All right.
Leonard fairly calls the question:

15:14.163 --> 15:16.331
Who is in favor
of abandoning our game...

15:16.498 --> 15:19.334
...and confronting
Penny's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend...

15:19.501 --> 15:22.921
...in a suicidal mission
to extract money from him?

15:25.090 --> 15:27.508
Say hi to Kurt for us.

15:28.844 --> 15:29.928
Excuse me.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.805
When Frodo left the Shire
to take the one ring to Mordor...

15:32.973 --> 15:34.933
...didn't Samwise, Pippin and Merry go?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.309
-They did.
-Well?

15:36.477 --> 15:38.937
They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.024
Plus, no one stole their pants.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.151
Fine.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.696
Enjoy your little game.
I'll make this quest on my own.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.031
Leonard, wait.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.992
Take a jacket, it's shpritzing a little.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.954
You guys suck.

15:58.874 --> 16:01.042
Come on, please. He's so big.

16:03.879 --> 16:07.674
-Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?
-Yes. Koothrappali's going to wet himself...

16:07.841 --> 16:11.636
... I'm gonna throw up, Sheldon's
gonna run away, and you're going to die.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.515
Shall we synchronize our watches?

16:15.683 --> 16:18.142
Guys, there are four of us
and one of him.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.187
Which means his triumph
will be even larger.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.857
Minstrels will write songs about him.

16:25.025 --> 16:28.736
Okay, how about this? I'll do the talking,
you stand behind me and try to look...

16:28.904 --> 16:30.071
...formidable.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.121
I should've peed before we left.

16:39.957 --> 16:40.999
Yeah?

16:44.753 --> 16:46.921
-Hi, Kurt.
-Lenny, right?

16:47.464 --> 16:50.675
I don't really go by Lenny,
but that's okay. Um....

16:50.843 --> 16:53.594
You remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.763
No.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.182
-What do you want?
-You don't remember me?

16:58.350 --> 17:00.518
-How could he not remember?
-Sheldon, not now.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.520
I remember him.

17:03.105 --> 17:05.898
Okay, here it is.
Penny's in kind of a financial jam...

17:06.066 --> 17:09.444
...and the money you owe her would
go a long way to solving her problems.

17:09.611 --> 17:13.948
-And she sent you to get it from me?
-No, she's too proud to ask for the money.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.951
I, on the other hand,
feel you should honor your debt.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.578
You do?

17:22.124 --> 17:24.709
"Feel" is kind of a--
It's a strong word. Uh....

17:24.877 --> 17:27.545
But I just-- I think it'd be a nice gesture
on your part.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.797
She'll get it when she gets it.

17:33.886 --> 17:37.096
Well, there you go. Problem solved.

17:37.598 --> 17:41.559
A successful quest. Now let's find
a gas station with a clean bathroom.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.145
No, the problem isn't solved.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.396
He just blew us off.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.482
I've got it.

17:47.649 --> 17:51.819
He didn't remember me, because the last
time we met I was in a Halloween costume.

17:53.614 --> 17:56.491
-Come on, Leonard, let's go.
-No. You can leave if you want to.

17:56.658 --> 17:59.827
-I'm gonna see this through.
-Okay.

18:05.375 --> 18:08.127
I guess technically that was my fault.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.135
I'm not leaving here
without Penny's money.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.889
What happened to your backup?

18:20.641 --> 18:22.558
I don't need backup.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.185
I have right on my side.

18:29.191 --> 18:32.276
And I'm wearing cargo shorts
under my pants.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.364
Congratulations.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.616
You may not have succeeded
in getting cash...

18:38.784 --> 18:41.702
...but you did secure
a formal acknowledgment of the debt.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.461
Maybe we should have your head
notarized.

18:53.006 --> 18:55.967
If anybody cares, I still have to pee.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.975
Hey.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.186
-Is Sheldon here?
-Yeah, hang on.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.396
Sheldon.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.314
-Nice hat.
-You know?

19:10.482 --> 19:13.568
It's kind of a fashionable look
these days.

19:13.735 --> 19:16.737
Maybe if you're working on a tuna boat.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.574
-Hello, Penny.
-Sheldon, here is your money.

19:19.741 --> 19:21.701
Thank you very much, it helped a lot.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.162
Sarcasm?

19:24.913 --> 19:26.122
-No.
-Darn.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.624
I can't seem to get the hang of that.

19:29.626 --> 19:33.212
Hey, I know it's none of my business,
but where did the money come from?

19:33.380 --> 19:35.464
Well, I cut back my expenses
like you said...

19:35.632 --> 19:37.758
...and picked up more hours
at the restaurant.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.595
The biggest thing was, out of the blue,
Kurt shows up...

19:40.762 --> 19:42.430
...and gives me the money he owes me.

19:43.807 --> 19:44.891
Really?

19:45.058 --> 19:47.310
Did he say why?

19:47.477 --> 19:51.564
Yes. He said he was feeling guilty

Did he give any reason
as to why he came to this moral epiphany?

20:03.160 --> 20:06.329
Nope. I just think he's really changed.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.959
We're having dinner tomorrow night.
And I get to wear my new beret. Ha, ha.

20:12.794 --> 20:14.587

on my forehead.
