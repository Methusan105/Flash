00:02.127 --> 00:04.962
So if you are considering
going into experimental physics...

00:05.130 --> 00:06.922
...my door is always open.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.925
Again, I'm sorry that the demonstration
didn't quite work out.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.385
Now we know what happens...

00:11.553 --> 00:15.889
...when you accidentally spill peach
Snapple into a helium-neon laser.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.768
The short answer is don't.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.859
Now to tell you about
the Theoretical Physics Department...

00:27.027 --> 00:28.527
...is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.284
-Dr. Cooper?
SHELDON: Forget it.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.704
Excuse me.

00:39.497 --> 00:42.207
-Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.
SHELDON: It's a waste of time.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.753
I might as well explain thermodynamics
to a bunch of Labradoodles.

00:48.048 --> 00:52.259
If you don't do this,
I won't take you to the comic-book store.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.221
Hello.

01:00.685 --> 01:03.812
Nice work with the laser, by the way.

01:05.815 --> 01:08.150
Looking out at your fresh young faces...

01:08.318 --> 01:11.612
... I remember when I too
was deciding my academic future...

01:11.780 --> 01:14.573
...as a lowly graduate student.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.034
Of course, I was 14...

01:17.494 --> 01:19.995
...and had achieved more
than you could ever hope to...

01:20.163 --> 01:22.414
...despite my 9:00 bedtime.

01:23.625 --> 01:27.753
Now, there may be one or two of you
in this room who has what it takes...

01:27.921 --> 01:30.047
...to succeed in theoretical physics.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.675
It's more likely that you will spend
your careers teaching fifth graders...

01:33.843 --> 01:37.304
...how to make papier-mâché volcanoes
with baking-soda lava.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.349
Oh, good God.

01:40.517 --> 01:43.644
In short, anyone who told you
that you would someday be able...

01:43.812 --> 01:47.189
...to make any significant contribution
to physics played a trick on you.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.108
A cruel trick indeed.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.028
Any questions?

01:56.157 --> 01:58.242
Of course not.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.161
I weep for the future of science.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.331
Now, if you'll excuse me,
the latest issue of Batman is out.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.875
Come, Leonard.

02:10.213 --> 02:13.215
Laser demonstration's looking
pretty good now, huh?

02:38.867 --> 02:40.200
I love this time of the year.

02:40.368 --> 02:43.287
The leaves are turning.
There's a bracing chill in the air.

02:43.454 --> 02:46.081
Plus, there's a whole new crop
of female grad students...

02:46.249 --> 02:50.169
...about to put on just enough winter
weight to make them needy and vulnerable.

02:52.589 --> 02:56.133
That's right, honey, have another calzone.
Daddy can wait.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.513
Isn’t there a policy
against dating graduate students?

03:01.681 --> 03:04.016
No. If you can talk to them,
you can ask them out.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.684
Damn. There's always a catch.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.979
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Leslie.

03:09.147 --> 03:12.441
So, dumb-ass, I heard you made
a grad student throw up last night.

03:13.443 --> 03:18.113
The truth can indeed be a finger down
the throat of those unprepared to hear it.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.991
But why should I cater
to second-rate minds?

03:21.367 --> 03:24.703
Because first-rate minds
call you "dumb-ass."

03:26.623 --> 03:28.457
Oh, yeah? Well--

03:28.625 --> 03:30.542
You're a mean person.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.086
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper?

03:33.463 --> 03:35.923
I'm Ramona Nowitzki.
I was at your talk last night.

03:36.341 --> 03:40.427
-I think you're just brilliant.
-Well, that is the prevailing opinion.

03:40.803 --> 03:43.180
God, now I'm gonna throw up.

03:43.848 --> 03:46.266
Howard Wolowitz,
Department of Engineering...

03:46.434 --> 03:50.979
...co-designer of the International Space
Station's liquid-waste-disposal system.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.067
Ew.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.322
Dr. Cooper, I've read everything
you've published.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.909
I liked your paper on grand unification
using string-network condensates...

04:04.077 --> 04:07.162
...and was wondering how you determined
that three-dimensional string nets...

04:07.330 --> 04:09.623
...provided a unified picture of fermions
and gauge bosons.

04:09.999 --> 04:13.710
Amazing. An intelligent Labradoodle.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.004
Woof.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.175
The fact is,
I'm quite close to a breakthrough...

04:20.343 --> 04:23.303
...in showing how neutrinos emerge
from a string-net condensate.

04:23.471 --> 04:26.932
Oh, my God. That would change the way
we view the entire physical universe.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.976
It's what I do.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.729
You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz
liquid-waste-disposal system...

04:32.897 --> 04:35.524
...is turning a few heads as well.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.530
Again, ew.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.576
You know, I'd love to hear more
about how you intend to add neutrinos.

04:46.744 --> 04:50.289
-Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?
-I don't drink coffee.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.416
I do. I love me a cup of Joe.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.210
It doesn't have to be coffee.
How about dinner?

04:55.378 --> 04:58.463
-I do eat dinner.
-Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.

04:58.631 --> 05:02.718
I never eat in strange restaurants.
One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.

05:04.053 --> 05:08.765
-Excuse me?
-Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.

05:08.933 --> 05:12.102
Three tines is not a fork.
Three tines is a trident.

05:12.270 --> 05:16.440
Forks are for eating,
tridents are for ruling the seven seas.

05:17.734 --> 05:21.236
-What if I brought food to your place?
-That would be acceptable.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.863
On Mondays, I eat Thai food.

05:23.031 --> 05:26.658
Mee Krob and chicken satay
with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.828
You got it. I already have your address.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.250
What a nice girl.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.712
Sheldon, do you have any idea
what just happened?

05:39.088 --> 05:42.257
Yes. Apparently, I'm getting a free dinner.

05:47.096 --> 05:50.307
Oh, yeah, no,
this thing's majorly out of order.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.935
-See? I'm sorry.
-Okay. Guess I'm taking the stairs.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.604
-Where you going?
-Four-A.

05:55.772 --> 05:59.107
-Oh, are you here to see Leonard?
-No, Dr. Cooper.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.943
Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

06:02.612 --> 06:04.446
We're having dinner.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.032
Sheldon Cooper?

06:08.201 --> 06:12.788
Tall, thin, looks a little like
a giant praying mantis?

06:14.624 --> 06:16.750
He is cute, isn't he?

06:18.920 --> 06:21.463
PENNY:
Sheldon Cooper?

06:24.634 --> 06:26.426
-Hi, Leonard.
-Hey, Ramona. Come on in.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.053
Thanks. Where should I put this?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.846
-The kitchen's fine.
-Okay.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.265
-Hey. What are you doing?
-I need to see this.

06:32.433 --> 06:33.767
Uh-huh.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.562
The viewing area's right over there.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.151
Sheldon, your girl-- Date-- Person--
Ramona's here.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.780
-Oh, hello.
-Oh, sorry I'm late.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.491
I got caught up reading the draft
of your latest paper.

06:49.659 --> 06:53.328
Did you enjoy the footnote where
I illustrate mirror symmetry by likening it...

06:53.496 --> 06:55.831
-...to The Flash playing tennis with himself?
-So funny.

06:55.998 --> 06:57.332
[LAUGHS]

06:57.959 --> 07:00.585
The idea that you might be able
to incorporate gravity...

07:00.753 --> 07:04.714
... I have to tell you,
I found it physically exhilarating.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.760
My hypotheses tend to have that effect.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.140
I'm sorry I didn't bring enough
for your friends.

07:13.307 --> 07:15.684
I assumed we were going to be alone.

07:18.020 --> 07:21.022
Oh. Yeah. No, we were just going.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.649
To watch, right?

07:24.444 --> 07:28.864
-No. Come on now. We're going out.
-Oh, come on. We'll be quiet.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.407
Come on, let's go.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.243
Okay, you two.

07:33.786 --> 07:38.248
You just have a nice whatever this is.

07:41.544 --> 07:45.964
Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none
of my business, but I just-- I have to ask.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.883
What's Sheldon's deal?

07:51.429 --> 07:54.556
-What do you mean, "deal"?
-You know, like, what's his deal?

07:54.724 --> 07:57.893
Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?

07:58.561 --> 08:03.106
Honestly, we've been operating
under the assumption that he has no deal.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.942
-Oh, come on, everybody has a deal.
-Not Sheldon.

08:06.110 --> 08:10.655
Over the years, we've formulated many
theories about how he might reproduce.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.743
I'm an advocate of mitosis.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.037
I'm sorry?

08:17.205 --> 08:20.457
I believe, one day, Sheldon will eat
an enormous amount of Thai food...

08:20.625 --> 08:23.668
...and split into two Sheldons.

08:25.004 --> 08:28.548
On the other hand, I think Sheldon
might be the larval form of his species.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.967
He'll spin a cocoon
and emerge two months later...

08:31.135 --> 08:33.595
...with moth wings and an exoskeleton.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.766
Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.

08:39.018 --> 08:43.104
-Hey, do you wanna hang out with us?
-Well, what are you guys gonna do?

08:44.482 --> 08:45.565
Uh....

08:45.733 --> 08:48.401
My mom's making a brisket tonight.

08:49.403 --> 08:52.322
-The one with the little onions?
-Yeah.

08:55.243 --> 08:59.621
Yeah, I'm busy. So good night.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.041
Her loss. Let's go.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.795
Brisket party. B to the R to the I-S-K.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.215
To the E to the T to the....

09:11.384 --> 09:13.677
-Ooh--
-Don't.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.768
-Hey. Aren't you having breakfast?
-Yes.

09:23.104 --> 09:26.398
Are you experimenting
with nutritional suppositories again?

09:28.109 --> 09:29.985
Not in these pants.

09:31.195 --> 09:35.323
-So how'd it go with Ramona last night?
-Oh, great.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.492
She's smart, insightful.

09:37.660 --> 09:41.663
She has a very unique way of,
you know, revering me.

09:43.624 --> 09:48.420
-Here's your spinach-mushroom omelet.
-Thank you.

09:49.213 --> 09:52.007
-Did anyone touch it?
-Gloves were worn by everyone involved.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.383
I was vigilant.

09:54.343 --> 09:57.178
Ramona pointed out
that I've been wasting 20 minutes a day...

09:57.346 --> 09:58.805
...standing on cafeteria lines.

09:58.973 --> 10:02.726
Time which would be better spent tackling
the great physics problems of our day.

10:02.893 --> 10:07.397
You don't tackle the big issues, Ramona.
You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.857
[LAUGH ING]

10:12.278 --> 10:13.903
Touché.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.698
-Morning.
-Oh, hey, Leslie.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.867
So I see you're organizing your papers...

10:19.035 --> 10:22.329
...for the Smithsonian Museum
of Dumb-Assery.

10:23.372 --> 10:27.709
There won't be any room until they get rid
of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.754
Oh, good one.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.965
I see you got a grad student
to fight your battles.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.843
I'll let you keep your lunch money today.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.763
Okay, Dr. Cooper
is on the verge of a breakthrough.

10:39.930 --> 10:43.516
If you're going to stay,
you'll have to be respectful and quiet.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.526
Wait for me.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.948
So have you worked out
the neutrino issue?

10:59.450 --> 11:02.911
Well, to paraphrase Mozart,
all the subatomic particles are there.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.122
-I just have to put them in the right order.
-You're so witty.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.041
Aren't I?

11:11.837 --> 11:13.088
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

11:13.255 --> 11:15.090
Hey, guys, this package came for....

11:19.345 --> 11:22.430
-Dr. Cooper is working.
-Yes, I'm close to a breakthrough.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.599
Oh! Tickles.

11:26.310 --> 11:28.019
Sorry.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.984
Holy crap on a cracker.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.447
-Hey, Penny.
-Hi. You probably don't wanna go in there.

11:39.615 --> 11:40.824
Why? What are they doing?

11:42.076 --> 11:46.871
You know, the only way I could explain it
would be in a therapist's office with dolls.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.298
Ooh, boy.

11:58.551 --> 12:02.470
-Dr. Cooper's working.
-Yeah, I can see that.

12:02.638 --> 12:05.473
Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali's.
You coming?

12:05.641 --> 12:09.644
Oh, yes, it's Halo night.
Let me just dry my tootsies.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.690
-You're not going to Halo night.
-Yes, I am. It's Wednesday.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.192
Wednesday's Halo night.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.612
Didn't a great man once say,
"Science demands nothing less...

12:19.780 --> 12:23.324
...than the fervent and unconditional
dedication of our entire lives"?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.703
-He did.
-And who was that great man?

12:27.496 --> 12:29.330
Me.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.626
-Sorry, Leonard.
-Seriously? You're not coming?

12:33.794 --> 12:36.838
You heard her. How can I argue with me?

12:37.923 --> 12:41.801
Okay. Well, once again,
you guys have a good...

12:41.969 --> 12:43.928
...whatever this is.

12:46.348 --> 12:49.893
Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you,
your friends are holding you back.

12:50.060 --> 12:53.313
I prefer to think of it as
I'm pulling them forward.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.648
Halo night?

12:55.816 --> 12:58.693
A man with your intellectual gifts
doesn't waste an evening...

12:58.861 --> 12:59.986
...playing video games.

13:00.404 --> 13:02.489
He does on Wednesdays.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.866
Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.702
He does want that.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.416
Does a man with my intellectual gifts
play paintball on weekends?

13:13.584 --> 13:16.503
-What do you think?
-Drat.

13:18.088 --> 13:21.925
-Now, shall we get back to work?
-I suppose.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.805
Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.849
I guess I can wait for the DVD.

13:31.727 --> 13:34.187
And then never, ever watch it.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.416

it's a small apartment.

-You only have to knock one--
-I don't have a lot of time.

Look, Ramona finally dozed off,
and I need you to help me get rid of her.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.763
Get rid of her how?

14:50.931 --> 14:54.601
I don't know, but, apparently,
I'm in some kind of relationship...

14:54.768 --> 14:58.021
...and, well, you seem to be an expert
at ending them.

SHELDON: It's Morse code.

16:37.246 --> 16:41.582
-Why?
-So we can communicate through the wall.

16:42.167 --> 16:45.086
We are communicating through the wall.

Yes, but the communication
is not encrypted.
