[SNIFFS]

00:08.341 --> 00:10.134
Smell that?

00:10.802 --> 00:13.429
That's the smell of new comic books.

00:14.764 --> 00:16.890
Oh, yes.

00:18.309 --> 00:19.977
They're on me today, boys.

00:20.437 --> 00:24.148
You're paying?
Have you been selling your sperm again?

00:24.941 --> 00:26.525
No, I'm celebrating.

00:26.693 --> 00:30.362
As we speak, the space shuttle is docking
at the Internationale Space Station...

00:30.530 --> 00:35.075
...where it will deploy the Wolowitz
Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.

00:35.243 --> 00:38.120
Oh, get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.415
Just think, thanks to your hard work...

00:41.583 --> 00:46.879
...an international crew of astronauts will
boldly go where no man has gone before.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.590
-ls that supposed to be funny?
-I believe it is.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.134
The Star Trek reference
and the play on words...

00:52.302 --> 00:54.428
...involving the double meaning
of "to go"...

00:54.596 --> 00:58.724
...suggest that Leonard is humorously
mocking your efforts in space plumbing.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.894
Okay, make your little jokes.
But of the four of us. . .

01:02.062 --> 01:06.190
... I'm the only one making any real-world
contribution to science and technology.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.151
He's right. This is an important
achievement for two reasons:

01:09.319 --> 01:11.528
Number one, and of course, number two.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.864
[LAUGHING]

01:14.365 --> 01:16.158
Oh, clever.

01:16.326 --> 01:20.162
Playing on the use of cardinal numbers
as euphemisms for bodily functions.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.663
[LAUGHS]

01:25.001 --> 01:27.377
Here, Sheldon.
I pulled the new Hellboy for you.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.046
It's mind-blowing.

01:29.214 --> 01:32.257
Excuse me, spoiler alert.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.593
But I didn't spoil anything.

01:34.761 --> 01:38.388
You told me it's mind-blowing,
so my mind is going into it pre-blown.

01:39.140 --> 01:42.059
And once a mind is pre-blown,
it cannot be re-blown.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.771
-I'm sorry.
-Said the Grinch to Christmas.

01:49.150 --> 01:52.069
-Hey, can I talk to you about something?
-Sure. What's up?

01:52.237 --> 01:54.780
Remember I went out with Penny
a couple weeks ago?

01:54.948 --> 01:57.616
-Yeah, vaguely.
-Sure, you remember. That was the night. . .

01:57.784 --> 02:01.912
...you went to the bar and made a fool of
yourself trying to pick up strange women.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.250
What about it?

02:06.751 --> 02:09.920
Well, the thing is,
the date didn't go that well.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.173
Oh. Too bad. You know--

02:13.383 --> 02:16.051
I guess the thing to do now is,
you know, pick yourself up.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.053
Dust yourself off, forget it. Move on.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.056
-I can't do that.
-Why the hell not?

02:21.558 --> 02:23.851
Because we're going out again tomorrow.

02:24.018 --> 02:25.227
Excuse me, Stuart?

02:25.395 --> 02:26.979
-Have you read the new Flash?
-No.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.649
Well, I have,
and it will knock your socks off.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.193
Good luck getting them back on.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.825
Anyway, I figure this is probably
my last shot with Penny. . .

02:39.993 --> 02:42.953
-. . .and I don't wanna screw it up.
-Oh, nobody wants that.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.246
So here's my question:

02:44.414 --> 02:50.085
It's the second date. You think
she'll be expecting things to get physical?

02:52.672 --> 02:54.298
Oh, gee.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.718
Yeah, my initial reaction is no.

02:57.886 --> 03:01.096
But, you know, let me think about it
and get back to you, okay?

03:01.264 --> 03:02.890
Okay. So you'll give me a call?

03:03.057 --> 03:05.142
-Yeah, or you call me.
-Great.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.978
Or nobody calls anyone.

03:09.147 --> 03:13.734
Interesting, Penny's current suitor
asking advice from her former suitor.

03:13.902 --> 03:17.112
Yeah, thanks for closed-captioning
my pain, Raj.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.781
You wanna make sure he gets nowhere
with Penny...

03:19.949 --> 03:23.035
...without jeopardizing your friendship
with either of them?

03:23.203 --> 03:24.912
-I'm listening.
-Just tell him...

03:25.079 --> 03:28.248
...to do everything you've done with her
for the last two years.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.864
-Hey, Leonard.
-Oh, hi.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.449
-How's it going?
-Good, good.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.493
-You?
-Fine.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.579
-Oh, yeah, hey, can I ask you something?
-Sure.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.331
You know your friend Stuart?

04:10.041 --> 04:11.708
Yes.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.211
Well, he asked me out again
and I said yes.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.339
And then I started thinking
maybe I should talk to you first.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.800
-About what?
-Well, does it bother you?

04:19.968 --> 04:21.718
Me going out with one of your friends?

04:21.886 --> 04:26.306
-Because, you know, you and me--
-No. No, that's the past.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.433
I'm really more of a right now
kind of guy.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.852
You know, living in the moment.

04:31.396 --> 04:35.065
Although I do have to live a little
in the future because, well, that's my job.

04:35.566 --> 04:39.569
Of course, my fondness for classic science
fiction does draw my attention backwards...

04:39.737 --> 04:42.572
...but those stories often take place
in the future, so--

04:45.159 --> 04:47.035
In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.

04:49.163 --> 04:51.039
Okay, well, that's really cool of you.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.333
LEONARD:
Yeah? Well, I wouldn't say cool.

04:53.501 --> 04:56.378
I'd just say, "That's Leonard."

04:57.046 --> 04:59.756
Well, in that case,
do you mind giving me some advice?

04:59.924 --> 05:01.216
About Stuart?

05:01.384 --> 05:02.801
Love to.

05:02.969 --> 05:06.430
He's very shy. How do I make him
feel more comfortable around me?

05:06.597 --> 05:10.892
Well, first of all, don't underestimate
the value of discomfort.

05:11.561 --> 05:14.187
-Really?
-Well, yeah. Stuart thrives under pressure.

05:14.355 --> 05:17.107
That's why he works
in a comic-book store.

He wants to talk about Penny.
I don't wanna talk about Penny.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.878
You're making an assumption.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.590
Perhaps the comic book store is on fire.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.259
And he needs your assistance.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.054
Why would he call me?

05:47.221 --> 05:49.306
We don't know.

05:49.474 --> 05:52.434
And if you don't answer the phone,
we can't know.

05:53.936 --> 05:56.229
I'm not answering the phone, Sheldon.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.823
There. It went to voicemail.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.457
Aren't you going
to check your messages?

06:17.960 --> 06:20.545
-No.
-You have to check your messages.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.465
The leaving of a message
is one half of a social contract. . .

06:23.633 --> 06:26.343
...which is completed
by the checking of the message.

06:27.678 --> 06:30.764
If that contract breaks down,
then all social contracts break down.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.183
And we descend into anarchy.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.687
It must be hell inside your head.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.691

06:42.944 --> 06:44.403
Guys, we have a code red.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.322
Code red, the hospital emergency alert?
The computer worm?

06:47.490 --> 06:50.742
Or the cherry-flavored soft drink
from the makers of Mountain Dew?

06:51.536 --> 06:54.037
I was going over the schematics
on my Zero-G Toilet...

06:54.205 --> 06:58.166
...and I made a teeny-tiny mistake
on the specifications for the diverter valve.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.501
How teeny-tiny?

06:59.669 --> 07:01.545
It's gonna fail after about 1 0 flushes.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.507
-But the mission is for six months.
-That's the code red.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.511
It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.
No one knows exactly when. . .

07:09.679 --> 07:13.890
...but at some point, something way worse
than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.935
Have you notified NASA?

07:17.103 --> 07:19.855
You crazy? What am I gonna say?
I screwed up your toilet. . .

07:20.022 --> 07:24.151
...and pretty soon there's gonna be crap
floating all over your nice space station?

07:24.318 --> 07:25.360
What are you gonna do?

07:25.528 --> 07:28.071
I'm gonna figure out how to fix it,
then I'll tell them.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.739
So, what do you need us for?

07:29.907 --> 07:32.367
He can't figure out how to fix it.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.578
You said you were gonna be supportive.

07:34.745 --> 07:38.331
I'm trying. But you have to admit,
this is pretty damn funny.

07:39.709 --> 07:40.709
I agree.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.545
It's a juxtaposition of the nature
of space exploration. . .

07:43.713 --> 07:47.382
...against the banality of a malfunctioning
toilet that provides the comic fodder here.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.050

of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity...

08:01.439 --> 08:04.566
...Human Waste Disposal System
as deployed on the Space Station.

08:04.734 --> 08:09.029
Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity
Human Waste Distribution System?

It's hilarious. Now.

08:17.747 --> 08:22.250
Here's an approximation of the spare parts
available on the space station.

08:22.418 --> 08:25.420
We gotta find a way, using nothing but this,
to reinforce this.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.506
So the waste material avoids the turbine.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.258
You mean, so it doesn't hit the fan?

08:34.597 --> 08:39.142
You know, I have to say I thought the toilet
humor would get less funny with repetition.

08:39.310 --> 08:43.522
Apparently, there is no law of diminishing
comedic returns with space poop.

-Uh--

08:51.739 --> 08:53.532
Classified, Leonard.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.493
Yeah, it's a regular Manhattan Project.

08:57.828 --> 09:00.539
-What's up?
-Well, tonight's my date with Penny.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.791
And we haven't been able to connect
by phone--

09:02.959 --> 09:05.126
-Yeah, I'm sorry. It's been broken.
-Or e-mail.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.796
Yeah, that's broken too.
Everything's broken.

09:08.589 --> 09:12.342
Anyway, I was just wondering
if you had any last-minute advice.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.929
All right. Well, off the top of my head. . .

09:16.097 --> 09:20.141
...you know, I think the most important
thing with Penny is to go really slow.

09:20.309 --> 09:23.019
I mean, glacial.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.480
-Okay.
-You know, guys come on to her. . .

09:25.648 --> 09:29.150
...all the time, so you need to, like,
set yourself apart, you know?

09:29.318 --> 09:30.902
Be a little shy.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.864
And don't make too much eye contact.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.450
And you know, treat her with, like,
cool detachment.

09:37.618 --> 09:40.996
And, you know, fear.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.497
-Fear?
LEONARD: Yeah.

09:42.665 --> 09:47.711
Like you're afraid
that if you touch her, she'll break.

09:47.878 --> 09:51.047
Well,
that plays right into my wheelhouse.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.509
Good, good.
Well, you kids have fun tonight.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.177
Thanks, Leonard.

09:56.345 --> 09:57.929
What is that thing anyway?

09:59.056 --> 10:00.515
You don't know what this is?

10:00.683 --> 10:02.642
-No.
-Good, get out.

10:06.230 --> 10:09.858
Be afraid of Penny. Nice, very crafty.

10:10.026 --> 10:14.779
It wasn't bad advice.
It just wasn't particularly helpful.

10:15.281 --> 10:19.200
For what it's worth, my mother says
that when we deceive for personal gain...

10:19.368 --> 10:21.620
...we make Jesus cry.

10:29.337 --> 10:35.300
All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC
to reinforce the center cross-support?

10:35.468 --> 10:38.845
No good. I mean, it might work
for the Japanese and the Americans.. .

10:39.013 --> 10:42.057
...but have you seen the size
of the Russians they got up there?

10:44.602 --> 10:49.606
This thing has to hold up
against a hearty potato-based diet.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.858
I feel terrible.

10:52.026 --> 10:55.278
Maybe if you were helping,
you'd feel better about yourself.

10:55.821 --> 10:59.199
I deliberately tried to sabotage
Stuart's date with Penny.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.827
Of course you feel terrible. You completely
screwed up your karma, dude.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.455
You don't really believe in that superstition,
do you?

11:05.623 --> 11:08.458
It's not superstition,
it's practically Newtonian.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.461
For every action,
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

11:11.629 --> 11:15.465
Leonard pretends to be a friend,
and acts like a two-faced bitch.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.512
Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug.

11:22.973 --> 11:26.810
It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.

11:26.977 --> 11:29.938
Speaking of what goes around
comes around....

11:30.606 --> 11:31.690
Okay, look.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.609
Instead of trying to reinforce
this structure here. . .

11:34.777 --> 11:37.237
...what if we ran another line,
bypassed it entirely?

11:37.405 --> 11:39.989
Won't work.
The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.158
What if we reposition
the collection tank?

11:42.326 --> 11:43.952
It won't work. No way to mount it.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.204
Here's an idea.
What if I change my name. . .

11:46.372 --> 11:49.249
...and go live with my cousin
and her husband, Avi, in Israel?

11:51.460 --> 11:52.961
That could work.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.635
-Morning.
-Morning. What's up?

12:00.803 --> 12:05.807
Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter
trying to fix a Zero-Gravity pasta maker.

12:08.144 --> 12:11.020
-I'm gonna make a coffee run. Want any?
-No. I have coffee.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.565
Great,
so how'd it go with Stuart last night?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.277
I really don't wanna talk about it.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.987
Yeah. Right. Sure.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.740
But, you know, the thing is,
before you guys went out...

12:21.907 --> 12:24.701
-. . . I spoke to him and I--
-I said I don't wanna talk about it.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.953
-Okay, I kind of feel res--
-Look, Leonard.

12:27.121 --> 12:30.415
What goes on is none of your business.
So just leave it alone, okay?

12:35.254 --> 12:39.716
If you really want to clean up your karma,
go get my freaking latte.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.851
Hang on, I think I've got this.

12:50.019 --> 12:53.229
Help me see if we can wedge
this piece of PVC behind the support rod.

12:53.397 --> 12:57.066
You're overestimating the strength
of the substructure you're building.

12:57.234 --> 13:00.361
-Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.
-If you knew what you were doing.. .

13:00.529 --> 13:03.698
...there wouldn't be a space toilet
where my coffee table should be.

13:05.075 --> 13:06.659
Howard, wait.

13:06.827 --> 13:10.830
Why don't you use this instead of the PVC
to keep the filter assembly in place?

13:11.081 --> 13:13.833
Because this is not a spare part
from the space station.

13:14.001 --> 13:18.296
This is the thing from the pizza box
that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.

13:18.881 --> 13:22.300
Is that what that's for?
In India, the lid just touches the cheese.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.512
We also have rampant poverty
and periodic outbreaks of cholera.. .

13:25.679 --> 13:28.223
...so a little cardboard in our cheese
is no biggie.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.227
-Where you going?
-Comic-book store.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.938
Oh, an excellent idea.
I could certainly use a break.

13:35.105 --> 13:37.273
-Me too.
-You can go to the comic book store. . .

13:37.441 --> 13:39.734
...when man can once again
safely poop in space.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.070
Why does Leonard get to go?

13:42.238 --> 13:44.489
Because he's upset
over his situation with Penny.

13:44.657 --> 13:48.409
And if I have to hear about it again,
I'm gonna kick him in his ovaries.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.955
-Thanks for understanding, Howard.
HOWARD: I got your back, sister.

13:53.249 --> 13:57.502
All right, I think we've got a prototype
ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.672
-That's heavy.
-Damn right, it's heavy.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.131
It's my mother's meatloaf.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.594
It's been testing toilets for generations.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.388
I must say, Howard. . .

14:08.556 --> 14:12.058
... I think a detailed letter to MIT
describing your current circumstances. . .

14:12.226 --> 14:15.395
...might entitle you to a refund
on your Master's degree.

14:16.522 --> 14:21.484
Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste
disposal test with meatloaf analog.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.697
In three, two, one.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.289
Fascinating.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.375
What do you think the problem is?

14:37.543 --> 14:40.253
Not enough bread crumbs.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.721
-Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
-Sure, what's up?

14:49.889 --> 14:53.182
I think I gave you some bad advice
about Penny and I want to apologize.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.601
No, your advice was great.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.186
-It was?
-Oh, yeah, going slow really worked.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.314
You're kidding.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.858
Never worked for me.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.360
Yeah, last night at dinner
I did what you told me.

15:04.528 --> 15:07.322
I went really slow, I kept my distance...

15:07.489 --> 15:09.490
...and two bottles of wine later,
we were making out.

15:10.492 --> 15:14.037
Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.998
It doesn't matter.
That's where it all went to hell.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.416
During the kissing?

15:18.584 --> 15:22.503
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.674
No, everything was good and really hot.

15:26.842 --> 15:29.802
And I said, "Oh, Penny". . .

15:29.970 --> 15:33.431
...and right where she was supposed
to say, "Oh, Stuart" she said...

15:34.725 --> 15:36.434
...your name.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.982
-Leonard?
-That is your name, right?

15:43.150 --> 15:45.526
Yeah. No, yeah, it is.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.278
Wow, I'm sorry.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.864
That must've been the last thing
you wanted to hear.

15:50.032 --> 15:54.369
Well, it beats,
"You know I'm a dude, right?"

15:56.538 --> 15:58.414
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.042
No doubt, no doubt.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.129
Okay, well...

16:05.297 --> 16:08.216
-. . . I'm sorry it didn't work out.
-Not your fault.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.343
Yeah, how about that?

16:12.972 --> 16:15.765
-See you soon.
-Yep, sure.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.157
Yes, I understand. Classified.
We'll keep it all classified.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.785
No one has to know anything about this
but you and me.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.078
What's classified?

16:37.413 --> 16:40.331
Howard's space toilet. I'll tell you later.

16:41.542 --> 16:46.212
Well, they've deployed our solution.
Let's just all hope it works.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.172
I don't see why I have to worry.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.634
My career's not hanging in the balance.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.267
That was a joke.

16:59.435 --> 17:03.187
It's funny because it's true.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.277
Leonard,
could you pass the soy sauce, please?

17:09.445 --> 17:12.613
-I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
-Yeah, I said Leonard.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.783
Yes, you did, didn't you?

17:22.583 --> 17:24.083
What the hell is that?

17:24.793 --> 17:26.377
Meatloaf.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.213
What was it doing on the ceiling?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.966
That's classified.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.349
ASTRONAUT [OVER RADIO]:
Houston, Internationale Space Station.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.977
We have a little situation up here.

17:43.479 --> 17:46.022
We'd like to make an unscheduled
space walk.

17:47.649 --> 17:48.900
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
ISS, Houston...

17:49.068 --> 17:51.402
...which crew members
would be involved in this EVA?

17:51.570 --> 17:55.573
ASTRONAUT: Houston, we'd all like
to step outside for a few minutes.

17:56.992 --> 18:00.661
MAN:
ISS, I'm afraid we can't authorize that.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.873
ASTRONAUT:
Houston, this is more of an FYI call.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.501
We are basically out the door.

18:34.029 --> 18:36.030
