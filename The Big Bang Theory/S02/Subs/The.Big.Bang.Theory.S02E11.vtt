00:02.127 --> 00:04.753
Your argument is lacking
in all scientific merit.

00:04.921 --> 00:06.505
And it is well-established...

00:06.673 --> 00:10.009
...Superman cleans his uniform
by flying into Earth's yellow sun...

00:10.176 --> 00:12.261
...which incinerates
any contaminant matter...

00:12.429 --> 00:16.765
...and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian
fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.

00:18.059 --> 00:20.060
What if he gets something
Kryptonian on it?

00:20.228 --> 00:24.148
-Like what?
-I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.

00:24.315 --> 00:27.401
I think we can assume all Kryptonian
condiments were destroyed...

00:27.569 --> 00:30.154
...when the planet Krypton exploded.

00:30.321 --> 00:32.281
Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite.

00:32.449 --> 00:36.618
The only way to destroy a rogue
Kryptonian hot dog threatening Earth.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.122
Raj, please, let's stay serious here.

00:40.290 --> 00:43.834
Superman's body is Kryptonian,
therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.503
Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?

00:46.963 --> 00:48.756
Superman doesn't sweat on Earth.

00:48.923 --> 00:51.633
Okay. He's invited for dinner
in the bottle city of Kandor.

00:51.801 --> 00:55.220
He miniaturizes himself, enters the city,
where he loses his super-powers.

00:55.388 --> 00:58.474
Before dinner, his host says,
"Who's up for Kryptonian tetherball?"

00:58.641 --> 01:01.852
Superman works up a sweat, comes back
to Earth, his uniform now stained...

01:02.020 --> 01:04.605
...with indestructible
Kryptonian perspiration.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.318
Booyah.

01:11.362 --> 01:14.448
Superman would have taken his uniform
to a Kandorian dry-cleaner...

01:14.616 --> 01:16.742
...before he left the bottle.

01:17.410 --> 01:21.663
Kandorian dry-cl--? I give up. You can't have
a rational argument with this man.

01:23.333 --> 01:26.543
Hey, isn't that the guy who won
the MacArthur genius grant last year?

01:27.337 --> 01:29.505
No, not all at once.

01:29.672 --> 01:32.800
-Then how?
-Leonard.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.969
Now Raj.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.389
Now Sheldon.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.894
-I didn't get a good look. Can I go again?
-No.

01:44.062 --> 01:47.064
-That's David Underhill. So what?
-So what?

01:47.232 --> 01:50.776
His observation of high-energy positrons
has provided the first evidence...

01:50.944 --> 01:53.028
...for the existence
of galactic dark matter.

01:53.196 --> 01:56.615
I have two words for you.
The first is "big," the other's "whoop."

01:57.075 --> 02:00.994
It is a big whoop. Made almost all the work
you've done completely useless.

02:01.162 --> 02:03.038
-Did not.
-Did too.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.582
Okay, maybe some of it. But....

02:05.750 --> 02:08.085
The guy was just in the right place
at the right time...

02:08.253 --> 02:10.963
...with the right paradigm-shifting
reinterpretation of the universe.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.006
He got lucky.

02:13.424 --> 02:14.591
In more ways than one.

02:15.218 --> 02:17.511
He's a very handsome man.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.430
Doesn't do anything for me.
If I was gonna go that way...

02:20.598 --> 02:23.600
... I'm more of a Zac Efron kind of guy.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.980
Oh, yeah.
Like you have a shot with Zac Efron.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.109

02:34.779 --> 02:37.948
Uh, yeah. Heh, heh.

02:38.116 --> 02:41.326
Dr. Gablehauser said
if I wanted to set up something in the lab...

02:41.494 --> 02:43.453
...that you'd be able to give me a hand?

02:43.621 --> 02:46.039
-You wanna work with me?
-If you have time, yeah.

here's my cell, here's my office...

That doesn't count. Do-over, do-over.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.329
There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.667

when my people play sports.

than Wii bowling night?

04:15.171 --> 04:17.005

-It's a rhetorical question.

-I was working with Dave Underhill.

04:31.187 --> 04:35.274
Ooh, "Dave."
Sounds like Leonard's got a new BFF.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.653
Actually, he is pretty cool.
I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist...

04:39.821 --> 04:42.281
...but it turns out
he's a black-diamond skier...

04:42.448 --> 04:45.534
...he collects vintage motorcycles,
he plays in a rock band.

-No.

from our lead guitarist.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.171

of Stephen Hawking having phone sex.

Hey, Sheldon. Are you and Leonard
putting up a Christmas tree?

05:25.742 --> 05:29.786
No, because we don't celebrate
the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.

05:31.247 --> 05:32.414
Saturnalia?

05:32.582 --> 05:37.627
Gather around, kids. It's time for Sheldon's
beloved Christmas special.

05:39.255 --> 05:43.050
In the pre-Christian era, as the winter
solstice approached and the plants died...

05:43.217 --> 05:47.095
...pagans brought evergreen boughs in their
homes as an act of sympathetic magic...

05:47.263 --> 05:50.474
...intended to guard the life essences
of the plants until spring.

05:50.641 --> 05:53.101
This custom was appropriated
by northern Europeans...

05:53.269 --> 05:56.271
...and, eventually, it becomes
the so-called Christmas tree.

05:57.982 --> 06:01.985

06:18.628 --> 06:20.212
I know you think you're being generous...

06:20.380 --> 06:22.964

is reciprocity.

you've given me an obligation.

It's okay.
You don't have to get me anything.

06:39.315 --> 06:43.318
Of course I do. The essence of the custom
is that I now have to go and purchase...

...a gift of commensurate value and
representing the same level of friendship...

06:47.365 --> 06:50.367

12:40.009 --> 12:43.678
This is an amazing woman, Leonard.
She has a curious and agile mind.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.765
Not to mention being curious and agile
in other respects.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.767
Shut up.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.269
Yes, please, shut up.

12:52.646 --> 12:56.357
So, um, Dave, don't you think
you and I should get back to the lab?

12:56.525 --> 12:59.861
You know, that dark matter
isn't gonna detect itself.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.868
I was thinking about taking the afternoon
off so I could experiment with Penny.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.704
-Really? We're gonna do an experiment?
DAVID: Uh-huh.

13:09.872 --> 13:14.209
We're gonna explore the effects of tequila
shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.545
That's not an experiment.
You saw what happened last night.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.548
DAVID: You ready to go?
-Yeah.

13:20.716 --> 13:23.092
-Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?
-Yeah, why not?

13:23.260 --> 13:25.053
You can't do any worse than Leonard.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.931
-Oh, my God.
-No, that's good. That's funny.

13:30.559 --> 13:33.937
By the way, my leg is killing me.
Thanks for asking.

13:56.377 --> 14:00.922
Mm. Great news, Leonard.
I've solved my Penny gift dilemma.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.757
Yippee.

14:02.967 --> 14:06.219
You see, the danger was that
I might under- or over-reciprocate...

14:06.387 --> 14:08.304
...but I have devised a foolproof plan.

14:08.889 --> 14:14.185
I will open her gift to me first and then
excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.438
Then I'll look up the price
of her gift online...

14:17.606 --> 14:21.192
...choose the basket closest to that value,
give it to her...

14:21.360 --> 14:24.487
...and then I'll return the others
for a full refund.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.448
Brilliant.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.576
It is, isn't it?

-Thank you. That's very gracious.

just done what Leonard did...

14:48.679 --> 14:51.180
...and get Penny a new boyfriend?

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

15:08.198 --> 15:11.367
Okay, I have just one question for you.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.995
While I am perfectly happy
with the way things are...

15:14.163 --> 15:17.874
...you said that you didn't wanna go out
with me because I was too smart for you.

15:18.042 --> 15:22.211
Well, news flash, lady:
David Underhill is 10 times smarter than me.

15:22.379 --> 15:26.841
You'd have to drive a railroad spike into
his brain for me to beat him at checkers.

15:27.551 --> 15:32.513
Next to him, I'm one of those sign-language
gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.850
So my question is...

15:36.018 --> 15:38.144
...what's up with that?

15:40.022 --> 15:42.023
Why are you yelling at me?

15:42.441 --> 15:46.361
Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Never mind, we're cool.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.530
Dave is not smarter than you.
He's an idiot.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.034
Really? Why would you say that?

15:53.202 --> 15:57.080
Because a smart guy takes the nude photos
of his wife off his cell phone...

15:57.247 --> 16:00.833
...before he tries to take nude photos
of his girlfriend.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.128
He tried to take nude photos of you?

16:05.089 --> 16:08.049
That's what you took from that?

16:10.010 --> 16:12.053
The guy is married.

And you. If you are so okay with the way
things are between us, why are you jealous?

16:21.689 --> 16:22.730
Well, that--

16:24.274 --> 16:28.069
The important thing is
he's married and that's terrible.
