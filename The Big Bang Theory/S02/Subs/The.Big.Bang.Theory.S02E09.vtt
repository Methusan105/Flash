00:02.502 --> 00:05.504
-Penny, hello.
-Hey, Sheldon.

00:06.297 --> 00:08.298
What is shaking?

00:10.510 --> 00:11.552
I'm sorry?

00:11.720 --> 00:14.013
It's colloquial. A conversation opener.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.975
So do you find the weather satisfying?

00:18.143 --> 00:22.021
Are you currently sharing in the triumph
of some local sports team?

00:22.731 --> 00:25.524
PENNY: What's wrong with you?
You're freaking me out.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.694
I'm striking up a casual conversation
with you.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.696
What's up?

00:35.285 --> 00:37.202
Please don't do that.

00:37.454 --> 00:41.206
But I'm given to understand that when
you have something awkward to discuss...

00:41.374 --> 00:44.126
...it's more palatable
to preface it with banal chitchat.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.547
So this wasn't the awkward part?

00:50.508 --> 00:52.134
No.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.138
Oh. All right.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.307
What's up?

00:59.601 --> 01:02.061
SHELDON:
Oh, good, I used that right.

01:02.562 --> 01:06.648
Anyway, you're aware that Leonard has
entered into a new romantic relationship...

01:06.816 --> 01:09.610
...which includes a sexual component.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.240
-Okay, feeling the awkward now.
-Wait.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.493
Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett.

01:17.660 --> 01:20.996
And she's a highly distinguished
surgical resident at Fremont Memorial.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.331
-Yeah, Leonard told me.
-Good.

01:22.499 --> 01:27.336
What he may have left out
is how important this relationship is to me.

01:28.880 --> 01:29.922
-To you?
-Yes.

01:30.090 --> 01:33.008
See, of the handful of women
Leonard's been involved with...

01:33.176 --> 01:36.178
...she's the only one
I have ever found tolerable.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.518
Well, what about me?

01:43.311 --> 01:45.562
The statement stands for itself.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.149
Well, aren't you sweet?

01:49.317 --> 01:51.652
Anyway, should you have
any interaction with her...

01:51.820 --> 01:56.198
...it would be most helpful
that she not see you as a sexual rival.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.785
PENNY:
Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.913
You say that now,
but consider the following scenario.

02:03.081 --> 02:06.041
You're sitting in your apartment.
It's late. You're alone.

02:06.209 --> 02:09.753
Your hypothalamus is swimming in
a soup of estrogen and progesterone...

02:09.921 --> 02:15.217
...and, suddenly, even Leonard
seems like a viable sexual candidate.

02:17.053 --> 02:21.390
Or a hookup,
as it's referred to by today's urban youth.

02:21.558 --> 02:22.850
-Really?
-Yes.

02:23.017 --> 02:27.855
Now, should that happen, I would ask you
to find some way to suppress your libido.

02:30.733 --> 02:33.443
I could think about you.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.823
Fine. Whatever works.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.743
Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.662
Peace out.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.107
SHELDON:
Mm.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.866
Well, this is very pleasant.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.702
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.706
And you said there would never
be enough pasta for the three of us.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.541
I stand corrected.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.336
You know,
Italian housewives have a rule of thumb:

03:32.503 --> 03:35.088
A handful of dry pasta
about an inch in diameter...

03:35.256 --> 03:39.968
...is sufficient for each person,
as it doubles in volume when cooked.

03:40.511 --> 03:41.637
That's very interesting.

03:41.804 --> 03:45.307
-Thank you.
-She doesn't mean it. She's just being nice.

03:47.310 --> 03:50.938
Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems
to be dropping the conversational ball...

03:51.105 --> 03:53.565
... I guess I'll just have to pick it up.
Ahem.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.659
Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?

04:06.204 --> 04:07.829
-No.
-Good.

04:07.997 --> 04:10.499
-What's your favorite fruit?
-It, uh--

04:11.167 --> 04:12.209
Strawberries.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.461
Mm, technically not a fruit, but all right.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.674
Where did you do
your medical internship?

04:18.841 --> 04:21.009
Uh, Lawrence Memorial
in Galveston, Texas.

04:21.177 --> 04:23.178
Really? That's where I was born.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.182
-You're kidding.
SHELDON: No.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.143
I spent so much of my childhood
at that hospital. It--

04:30.311 --> 04:33.355
When I was 12,
I got to ride there in a helicopter.

04:34.023 --> 04:37.234
-What? What happened?
-Radiation burns.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.362
A little mishap
while I was building my own CAT scanner.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.782
I'm sorry, you tried to build
your own CAT scanner?

04:43.950 --> 04:45.909
No, I didn't try, I succeeded.

04:46.077 --> 04:49.705
I was briefly able to see the inside
of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball...

04:49.872 --> 04:51.873
...before he caught fire.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.876
It led to an interesting expression
in our house:

04:55.044 --> 04:57.796
Not a Snowball's chance
in a CAT scanner.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.633
Uh, Sheldon.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.385
Excuse me.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.723
When I come back, just for fun,
the subject will be alternative history.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.600
Specifically, how would the Civil War
have gone differently...

05:10.768 --> 05:13.353
...if Lincoln had been
a robot sent from the future?

05:18.526 --> 05:21.737
Look at that, there's even pasta left over.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.823
Do you understand
that this was supposed to be a date?

05:24.991 --> 05:26.533
I do. Do you?

05:26.701 --> 05:29.828
Because, frankly, you've been
in a foul mood since I sat down.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.250
Okay, here's my question:

05:35.418 --> 05:37.586
Why did you sit down?

05:38.254 --> 05:41.423
To help.
Look, if you fail at this relationship...

05:41.591 --> 05:43.383
...and history suggests you will...

05:44.927 --> 05:49.514
...then we risk losing the medical officer
that our landing party has always needed.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.686
What landing party?

05:55.271 --> 05:57.731
You're Kirk. I'm Spock.
Wolowitz is Scotty.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.817
Koothrappali is the guy
who always gets killed.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.447
And now we've got McCoy.

06:12.789 --> 06:16.083
So we're all standing around
looking at the post-op X-ray...

06:16.250 --> 06:19.461
...and there it is, clear as day,
right in the guy's chest cavity:

06:19.629 --> 06:21.797
One of my earrings.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.342
Oh, my God, what did you do?

06:25.510 --> 06:26.802
Ha, ha. What do you think I did?

06:26.969 --> 06:28.845
I discreetly slipped off the other earring...

06:29.013 --> 06:31.264
...put it in my pocket,
and then got the hell out of there.

06:31.432 --> 06:32.891

-Hi, Sheldon.
-Hi, Stephanie.

06:39.148 --> 06:43.777
I'm sorry I'm late, but your companion
left the most indecipherable invitation.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.904
What invitation?

06:47.115 --> 06:48.990
"We're going to the movies."

06:49.158 --> 06:51.827
What movie? What theater? What time?

06:53.579 --> 06:57.582
If you were trying to make it impossible to
locate you, you couldn't have done better.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.502
Oh, clearly, I could have.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.754
It took 20 minutes to go through...

07:02.922 --> 07:06.675
...the browser history on your computer
to see what movie times you looked up.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.261
Wait here, I'll find us seats.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.889

-Not the right seats.

"in a relationship," what does it say?

-"Stephanie Barnett is single."
-Yeah, furthermore...

08:44.565 --> 08:48.485
...earlier this evening, she threw
a digital sheep at some guy named Mike.

08:51.030 --> 08:54.741
Who's Mike? Why does he
get a digital sheep and not you?

08:54.909 --> 08:58.954
It's just her Facebook page, and we've
only been going out a couple of weeks.

You are not in this relationship.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.718

that an unsolicited gift of food...

Twenty-seven days with Joyce Kim.

12:07.685 --> 12:10.228
During which she defected
to North Korea.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.106
Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.

12:13.274 --> 12:16.151
For which she awarded him the nickname

And a three-hour dinner with Penny.

ordered the soufflé when they sat down.

You know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you.

14:02.466 --> 14:05.802
--they find their mate more desirable
when he's courted by another female.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.721
Now, this effect is intensified
when the rival female...

14:08.889 --> 14:11.516

associated with ovulation.
