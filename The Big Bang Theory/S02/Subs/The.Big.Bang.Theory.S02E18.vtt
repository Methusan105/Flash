13:03.032 --> 13:04.616
We should get to work.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.785
Wait, wait, why does it say
"one-day rush"?

13:06.952 --> 13:09.037
Since when do we offer a one-day rush?

13:09.205 --> 13:10.872
Amazon offers one-day rush.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.125
Yeah, but they don't have to glue
the books together.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.046
How are we gonna make
1 000 Penny Blossoms in one day?

13:18.214 --> 13:22.133
Don't yell at me. I'm not manufacturing.
I'm just web design.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.302
I have to call them and cancel that order.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.514
Excuse me, but was this not your goal?

13:27.681 --> 13:31.267
Financial independence through
entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation?

13:31.435 --> 13:35.230
Yeah, my brilliance and innovation,
of course, but still.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.816
I just don't see how we can pull this off.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.402
Okay, that, right there,
that equivocation and self-doubt...

13:41.570 --> 13:43.655
...that is not the American spirit.

13:44.406 --> 13:47.909
Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo?
Did Jim Bowie?

13:48.577 --> 13:51.871
They didn't quit. They were massacred...

13:52.623 --> 13:57.001
...by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.

13:58.003 --> 14:01.756
All right, let me put it this way.
Your gross receipts on this one order...

14:01.924 --> 14:04.717
...will be over $3000
for one night's work.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.096

Oh, stop with the fake third-world crap.

14:34.331 --> 14:37.542
Your father's a gynecologist
and you had a house full of servants.

14:37.710 --> 14:41.254
We only had four servants.
And two of them were children.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.425
How are we doing?

14:45.593 --> 14:48.761
We have 1 28 assorted Penny Blossoms
ready to ship.

RAJESH: Who made Sheldon the boss?

14:53.934 --> 14:57.520
I believe I'm hearing some negativity
on the factory floor.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.901
-So?
-The labor force is a living organism. . .

15:03.068 --> 15:04.235
...that must be nurtured.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.363
Any counterproductive grumbling
must be skillfully headed off. . .

15:07.531 --> 15:10.825
...by management. Observe. Hey!

15:10.993 --> 15:13.077
Less talk, more work.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.665
-Nicely done.
-Thank you.

Good night.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.882
-Leonard.
-Yeah-- No.

16:08.050 --> 16:13.888
But, Sheldon, without your insight and
leadership, this enterprise will surely fail.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.267
You're right, of course.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.396
Here, this will help.

Very well.

But if this leads to opiates

16:27.403 --> 16:30.071
...you're gonna have to answer
to my mother.

16:32.199 --> 16:35.410
Look at Planck's constant.
People say that's arbitrary.

16:35.577 --> 16:38.496
That could not be less arbitrary.
If it varied even slightly.. .

16:38.664 --> 16:41.416
...life as we know it would not exist. Bam!

16:45.337 --> 16:49.382
Now, now, let's reconsider the entire
argument but with entropy reversed. . .

16:49.550 --> 16:51.092
...and effect preceding cause.

16:51.260 --> 16:55.263
So you are thinking of a universe.
It's not expanding from the center, no.

16:55.431 --> 16:59.517
It is retreating
from a possibility space. Bam!

17:01.895 --> 17:07.358
This is a space where we are all essentially
Alice standing in front of the Red Queen...
