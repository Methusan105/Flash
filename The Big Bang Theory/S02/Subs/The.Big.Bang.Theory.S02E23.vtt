I can't comment without violating our
agreement that I not criticize your work.

There's nothing wrong
with the science here.

than I do when you say "science."

The president of the university wants me
to meet him at his office at 8 a.m.

-Doesn't say. Must be an emergency.

to the National Science Foundation. . .

Yes.
In fact, he was quite enthusiastic.

if I could send you tonight, I would."

Of course not.

because it's indoors.

magnetic monopoles there. . .

Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper,
at the North Pole?

04:19.759 --> 04:24.721
Odd. President Seibert posed
the exact same question.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.307
How was it resolved?

04:27.475 --> 04:31.937
It wasn't. His wife set their dogs on me
and rendered the question moot.

-Yes.

Is this just so we won't touch your stuff
while you're away?

05:35.043 --> 05:37.377
I'll admit that was a concern.

Hang on, let's talk about it. This is a
National Science Foundation expedition.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.375
I don't know
how we can turn it down.

06:16.542 --> 06:20.545
Easy. Instead of saying, "No, we don't
wanna go on an NSF expedition," say:

06:20.713 --> 06:24.341
"No, we don't wanna spend three months
stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle.. .

06:24.509 --> 06:26.593

I don't care
what the other guys are doing.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.265
If the other guys jumped
in the Bay of Bengal...

13:29.433 --> 13:31.726
...and tried to swim to Sri Lanka,
would you?

13:31.894 --> 13:35.063
If you were standing behind me nagging,
I might.

13:35.606 --> 13:38.900
Don't talk back to your mother.
This trip is much too dangerous.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.237
No, it's not. Howard, tell them.

13:42.571 --> 13:46.199
Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.952
I understand you're concerned.

13:49.119 --> 13:52.205
If it'll make you feel better,
my mother is fine with me going.

13:52.373 --> 13:56.960
And this is a woman who kept
a safety rail on my bed until I was 1 7.

13:57.127 --> 14:00.880
So she has no problem
with her son being eaten by a walrus?

14:01.048 --> 14:02.966
That's very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali.

14:03.133 --> 14:06.636
If Raj dies, it'll be from frostbite,
gangrene, acute sunburn. . .

14:06.846 --> 14:10.640
. ..or being ripped to shreds
by a 1 500-pound polar bear.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.102
Ma, I'm putting you on speakerphone
with Raj's parents.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.730
Can you tell them that you're okay
with me going to the Arctic?

14:17.898 --> 14:22.443
MRS. WOLOWITZ [ON SPEAKERPHONE]:
Arctic? I thought you said Arkansas.

14:23.779 --> 14:26.239
I didn't say that.
You never listen to me.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.949
He doesn't tell me anything.

14:28.117 --> 14:32.287
He lives a secret life
because he's ashamed.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.081
Hey, Leonard,
can I talk to you for a sec?

14:35.249 --> 14:39.919
Sure, but let's go out here where
there's a little less yelling and guilt.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.754
What's up?

14:41.922 --> 14:44.257
Well, I got you
a little going-away present.

14:44.425 --> 14:47.635
-Oh, a blanket.
-Oh, no, no. Not just a blanket.

14:47.803 --> 14:50.680
See, it has sleeves.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.309
Yeah.

14:57.146 --> 15:01.024
So you can, you know, be all snoodled
up while you do your science stuff.

15:01.191 --> 15:04.611
Oh, wow. Cool.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.405
I'm gonna miss you.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.123
-See you later.
-Bye.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.839
MRS. KOOTHRAPPALI : I told you no.
Why don't you believe me?

15:25.007 --> 15:27.383
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Because it doesn't make sense to me.

15:27.551 --> 15:30.511
How can it be
that in the entire country of India...

15:30.679 --> 15:34.349
...there isn't one Outback Steakhouse?

Sheldon.

15:43.025 --> 15:46.527
-Sheldon?
-I want a cookie, Meemaw.

15:48.822 --> 15:52.367
-Sheldon, it's me.
-But Meemaw just made cookies.

15:54.161 --> 15:57.205
Listen, I don't know if I can go
on the expedition.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.708
-What?
-I don't think I can go to the North Pole.

16:00.876 --> 16:05.254
Okay. Leonard, I know you're concerned
about disappointing me. . .

16:05.464 --> 16:08.091
. .. I want you to take comfort
from the knowledge...

16:08.258 --> 16:11.719
. ..that my expectations of you
are very low.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.722
Yeah, that's very comforting.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.599
Comforting is a part of leadership.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.852
It's not a part I care for
but such is my burden.

16:20.020 --> 16:23.731
Terrific. It's just that
I don't think Penny wants me to go.

16:24.233 --> 16:28.027
Assuming that's a valid reason not to go,
which it isn't.. .

16:28.570 --> 16:31.239
. ..how do you know this?
Did she say it?

16:31.573 --> 16:33.032
Not exactly.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.411
But she said she was gonna miss me
and she gave me this.

16:39.581 --> 16:42.208
-What is it?
-It's a blanket with sleeves.

16:42.376 --> 16:45.253
Oh, that's clever.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.048
Let me see if I understand this.

16:49.216 --> 16:53.386
Her missing you,
is an emotional state you find desirable.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.722
-Yes, obviously.
-All right.

16:55.889 --> 16:59.726
Well, given that missing you
is predicated on you leaving...

16:59.893 --> 17:03.229
. ..logic dictates you must leave.

17:04.148 --> 17:07.275
Yes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone
for three months.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.611
What if she doesn't miss me that long
and she meets someone else?

17:11.405 --> 17:14.657
She does have a short attention span.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.660
-So I can't go.
-Leonard, you may be right.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.455
It appears that Penny secretly
wants you in her life...

17:20.622 --> 17:23.249
. ..in a very intimate
and carnal fashion.

17:24.293 --> 17:27.128
-You really think so?
-Of course not.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.090
Even in my sleep-deprived state.. .

17:31.258 --> 17:34.844
. .. I've managed to pull off
another one of my classic pranks.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.180
Buzzinga.

17:44.772 --> 17:48.107
-Oh, Leonard, what time is it?
-Seven a.m. I'm sorry it's early.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.693
But we're leaving soon
and I needed to talk to you.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.278
Okay.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.948
What did you mean when you said
you were going to miss me?

17:57.868 --> 18:02.330
I don't know.
You'll be gone and I'll notice.

18:03.999 --> 18:08.086
Okay. Well, what about this?
What does this mean?

18:08.837 --> 18:13.591
Wine, a credit card and late-night
television are a bad combination?

18:15.094 --> 18:16.135
All right, fine.

18:16.303 --> 18:19.514
What about that really long hug?
What did that mean?

18:20.599 --> 18:22.016
That wasn't a long hug.

18:22.518 --> 18:26.145
It was at least five Mississippis.

18:26.814 --> 18:31.651
A standard hug
is two Mississippis, tops.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.114
Leonard, I don't know what to tell you.
It was just a hug.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.033
-Glad we cleared that up.
-Yeah.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.327
-I guess I'll see you.
-Okay.

18:41.495 --> 18:44.205
-Have a safe trip.
-Thank you.

We're out of ice.

19:09.606 --> 19:13.442
All right, we begin initial assembly and
deployment of the testing equipment. . .

19:13.610 --> 19:18.531
. ..starting tomorrow at 0700 hours,
but until then, you are all off duty.

19:19.074 --> 19:21.450
I suggest you keep the shenanigans
to a minimum...

19:21.618 --> 19:24.954

by dogsled.

-Crossbow.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.254
Hey, guys, can I just say something?

19:33.422 --> 19:36.257
How about we take a moment
to think about where we are?

19:36.425 --> 19:39.260
I mean, this is literally
the top of the world.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.929
Only a handful of people
in all of human history...

19:42.097 --> 19:44.140
. ..will ever see
what we are going to see.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.351
-He's right.
-Yeah, wow.

19:47.561 --> 19:50.062
It is remarkable.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.524
So who's up for a movie?

19:53.692 --> 19:55.109
Good idea. What do you think?

19:55.277 --> 19:58.529
Ice Station Zebra

-Reconstituted Thai food.

Did you bring the dehydrated
low-sodium soy sauce?

20:08.624 --> 20:10.333
-Check.
-Freeze-dried spicy mustard?

20:10.500 --> 20:13.920
-Check.
-And flash-frozen brown rice, not white?

-Uh, oh. Sorry.
