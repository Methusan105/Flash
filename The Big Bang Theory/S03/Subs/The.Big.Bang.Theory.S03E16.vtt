If he doesn't apologize by 5:00,
he's gonna spend the night in jail.

13:19.508 --> 13:23.637
Oh, no, that's terrible.
The line's moving. Gotta go. Bye.

13:34.398 --> 13:36.691
Excuse me. Excuse me, jailor?

13:38.193 --> 13:40.862
- What?
- I need to use the restroom.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.531
Knock yourself out.

13:46.618 --> 13:49.704
- That's the toilet?
- Well, it ain't a wishing well.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.126
Please tell the judge
I'm ready to apologize.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.505
Look at that.

13:58.672 --> 14:04.761
"To my friend Leonard.
From Stan Lee. Excelsior!"

14:04.928 --> 14:06.388
Awesome. Mine says:

14:06.555 --> 14:11.893
"To my friend Howard.
From Stan Lee. Excelsior!"

14:12.310 --> 14:16.440
Mine says, "To Raj. From Stan Lee."

14:20.068 --> 14:23.488
That's because you pissed him off
about his character names.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.449
I didn't even mention
Dum Dum Dugan...

14:25.615 --> 14:29.327
...or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock,
Pepper Potts, Victor von Doom.

14:29.494 --> 14:33.623
Oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model.

14:34.875 --> 14:35.917
We're home.

14:36.084 --> 14:39.754
- Oh, hey, buddy. How'd it go?
- You know very well how it went.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.757
Yeah. But we all wanna
hear it from you.

14:45.093 --> 14:50.098
- I was found guilty and fined $533.
- I'm gonna write you a check for that.

14:50.265 --> 14:54.311
As long as you promise to put it in your
drawer and never cash it like the others.

14:57.606 --> 15:02.110
I also now have three points on
a driver's license I do not yet possess...

15:02.277 --> 15:04.946
...and I was forced to issue
an undeserved apology...

15:05.113 --> 15:09.493
...because I refused to urinate in a
stainless-steel bowl in front of criminals.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.454
Plus, you didn't get to meet Stan Lee.

15:14.164 --> 15:17.167
Okay, that's enough, Howard.
The poor guy's had a tough time.

15:17.334 --> 15:21.129
He had to spend the entire afternoon
in jail wearing that suit.

15:23.924 --> 15:27.469
It would be cruel to mention that,
after he finished signing autographs...

15:27.636 --> 15:30.972
...Stan Lee took Stuart and us out
for gelato.

15:32.474 --> 15:35.143
You had gelato with Stan Lee?

15:35.477 --> 15:38.438
He said we could call him Stan.

15:39.356 --> 15:40.482
Except for Raj.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.614
Well, I hope you're satisfied, Penny.

15:47.781 --> 15:52.494

that has befallen me today.

SHELDON: Not finished.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.499
It is because of you
that I now have a criminal record.

15:57.666 --> 16:01.586
And it is because of you that I missed out
on having gelato with Stan Lee.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.588
- Maybe you'll have another chance--
- No.

16:03.755 --> 16:07.008
I will never have another chance
to have gelato with Stan Lee...

16:07.175 --> 16:09.844
...because opportunities
to have gelato with Stan Lee...

16:10.011 --> 16:11.555
...come but once in a lifetime.

and, having writ, moves on.

16:21.815 --> 16:24.985
Did he just somehow
give me the finger?

16:25.569 --> 16:29.114
Not just the finger, the moving finger.

Hi.

- What's going on?
- Nothing.

16:46.631 --> 16:51.428

- Oh, yeah. Big night tonight.

16:51.720 --> 16:56.057
Gonna share a can of tuna
with the cat.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.059
Oh, nice.

16:58.226 --> 17:04.524
Not even my cat. I just feed it.
Some nights, it doesn't even show up.

17:05.567 --> 17:09.321
Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um,
you could do me a favor.

17:09.487 --> 17:10.739
Sure, yeah. Name it.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.408

I was hoping...

17:16.077 --> 17:19.331
...you could give me his number
so I can arrange for them to meet.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.916
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't have his phone number.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.085

17:25.920 --> 17:27.422
Wait.

17:28.423 --> 17:29.841
I have his address.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.594
Really? Great.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.680
But I can't give it to you.

17:35.847 --> 17:40.268
- Then why did you tell me you had it?
- I don't know. Just chatting.

17:41.561 --> 17:45.774
You're looking at a guy who could very well
get stood up by a stray cat tonight.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.777
I'm sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.278

17:53.823 --> 17:56.284

- Maybe we can make a deal.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.370
What kind of deal?

17:59.120 --> 18:03.458
I will give you the address if you go
to my cousin's wedding with me.

18:03.625 --> 18:06.461
- You're extorting a date out of me?
- I kind of have to.

18:06.628 --> 18:10.382
The cousin who's getting married is
the cousin I usually go to weddings with.

18:11.466 --> 18:14.636
- Can I bring Leonard?
- Sure. What the hell?

18:15.220 --> 18:17.972
- Deal.
- We'll tell people he's your cousin.

18:20.642 --> 18:23.311

We're about to go in and
have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.

have cookies or what's gonna happen...

We're not friends at the moment.
Depends on how this goes.

Right, right. Anyway,
Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours.

19:01.808 --> 19:06.855
He was supposed to meet you the other
day, but he kind of ended up in jail.

19:07.397 --> 19:12.110
I see. And you thought you'd just
come over to my house uninvited?

19:12.444 --> 19:13.945
You said we were invited.

19:14.112 --> 19:18.408
Oh, no, no. I said I'm inviting you
to come with me to Stan Lee's house.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.619
You know, you fanboys are unbelievable.

my doorbell anytime you want?
