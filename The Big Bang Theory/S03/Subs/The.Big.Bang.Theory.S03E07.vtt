WEBVTT

00:03.963 --> 00:07.091
Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe
you made up your own game.

00:07.258 --> 00:10.970
Oh. Research Lab is more than a game.

00:11.137 --> 00:12.388
It's like the slogan says:

00:12.555 --> 00:16.642
"The physics is theoretical,
but the fun is real."

00:17.518 --> 00:19.812
We must not be playing it right.

00:21.230 --> 00:24.817
All right. Five.
One, two, three, four, five.

00:24.984 --> 00:26.235
Oh, wow, look at that.

00:26.402 --> 00:29.238
My Department of Defense
research grant is renewed.

00:29.405 --> 00:31.073
Oh. Great roll.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.993
Now you can demolish
your Soviet-style cyclotron...

00:34.160 --> 00:37.163
...and build the large hadron collider.

00:37.330 --> 00:39.206
YaY-

00:39.749 --> 00:41.334
You're a natural at this, Penny.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.128
And as the first beta testers,
you two have quite the edge...

00:44.295 --> 00:47.048
...when we play with Wolowitz
and Koothrappali on Sunday.

00:47.214 --> 00:51.177
Oh, gee, Sheldon,
I don't think we can play on Sunday.

00:51.344 --> 00:52.595
Why not?

00:52.762 --> 00:56.682
Because of the reasons
that Penny will now tell you. Penny?

00:56.849 --> 00:59.185
I have to pick up my friend Justin
from the airport.

00:59.352 --> 01:01.687
There you go.
She has to pick up her friend Justin.

01:01.854 --> 01:04.023
And I can't play
because I'm going with her. Right?

01:04.190 --> 01:06.525
Uh, yeah, if you want.
There may not be room.

01:06.692 --> 01:09.654
He's got a lot of stuff, like guitars
and amplifiers.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.573
Wait. What are you talking about?

01:12.740 --> 01:13.824
My friend Justin.

01:13.991 --> 01:16.786
Pay attention, Leonard.
That's why she can't play on Sunday.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.537
- Who is this Justin?
- Your turn.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.539
- I told you about him.
- Roll the dice.

01:20.706 --> 01:23.167
Yeah. My friend from Omaha,
plays the guitar.

01:23.334 --> 01:25.086
He's coming
looking for session work.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.380
So I told him
he could crash on my couch.

01:27.546 --> 01:31.717
Come on. Roll a six, Penny dies horribly
in a nuclear meltdown.

01:32.677 --> 01:35.388
See what I mean
when I say the fun is real?

01:36.222 --> 01:39.141
Hang on. Some guy
is gonna be sleeping on your couch?

01:39.308 --> 01:41.727
He's not some guy. He's my friend.

01:41.894 --> 01:45.022
So by friend, do you mean
"friend" friend...

01:45.189 --> 01:47.900
...gay friend, or "ex-boyfriend
you're now platonic with...

01:48.067 --> 01:50.486
...but still might have a thing for you"
friend?

01:50.945 --> 01:53.280
Well, he's definitely not gay.

01:53.447 --> 01:57.535
Oh. A definitely-not-gay musician
sleeping on my girlfriend's couch.

01:57.702 --> 01:59.453
Yippie.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.581
Okay, we went out a little bit
a long time ago.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.709
But we were never, like, going out.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.836
Okay. Not to be pedantic,
the last I checked...

02:07.002 --> 02:09.588
..."went out" was the past tense
of "going out"...

02:09.755 --> 02:11.924
...which I think we all know
is a popular euphemism...

02:12.091 --> 02:14.343
...for saw each other naked.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.471
I'll just roll for you.

02:18.264 --> 02:20.516
You have a problem
with Justin staying with me?

02:20.683 --> 02:22.101
What was your first clue?

02:22.268 --> 02:25.062
Uh-oh. Industrial accident.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.648
Know what?
Don't talk to me like an idiot.

02:27.815 --> 02:31.569
I'm not talking to you like an idiot.
I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic.

02:31.736 --> 02:36.615
"You accidentally stare at a helium-argon
laser. Lose one turn and a retina."

02:36.782 --> 02:38.784
How's that not talking to me
like I'm an idiot?

02:38.951 --> 02:41.662
It's my friend, it's my couch
and it's my freaking life.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.456
It's also your roll.

02:43.748 --> 02:45.499
You know what? It is your life.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.461
If you wanna have some stupid guitarist
stay on your couch, fine!

02:48.627 --> 02:51.756
Why don't you just rent bunk beds
and invite the Black Eyed Peas?

02:51.922 --> 02:56.343
Hey, if I wanna invite the line-up
of Lollapalooza to my apartment, I will.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.845
It's none of your business.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.431
Do you know how childish you sound
right now?

03:00.598 --> 03:04.810
- Oh, now I'm a child. Not an idiot anymore.
- Hey, the two aren't mutually exclusive.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.479
Oh, you are such a--

03:06.645 --> 03:07.730
[BLENDER WHIRRING]

03:07.897 --> 03:10.691
- What the hell is he doing?
- Drowning us out. He doesn't like fighting.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.402
Sheldon, just stop.
Look, the fight is over.

03:13.569 --> 03:16.697
Oh, and FYI. You never even heard
of the Black Eyed Peas...

03:16.864 --> 03:17.907
...until you met me.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.201
I heard of them.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.579
I didn't know they were a band.

03:24.789 --> 03:27.166
Sheldon, she's gone.
You can turn off the blender.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.084
[BLENDER STOPS]

03:33.422 --> 03:37.468
Has your relationship reached
its inevitable ugly end?

03:38.511 --> 03:41.263
No, we just had a little spat.

03:41.430 --> 03:44.517
Look on the bright side.
As a result of Penny's forfeit...

03:44.683 --> 03:49.063
...you have become
the world's first winner of Research Lab.

03:49.230 --> 03:52.024
Would you like a commemorative
snow cone?

04:19.969 --> 04:21.679
I don't get how she can just announce...

04:21.846 --> 04:24.139
...that an old boyfriend is gonna sleep
on her couch.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.725
Hey, I thought of a game
we can play in the car.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.292
I don't wanna play a game, Sheldon.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.564
It's called Scientists.
Now, I will name three scientists...

04:31.730 --> 04:35.609
...you'll put them in order of the size
of their contribution to their fields.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.528
To make this game
even more compelling...

04:37.695 --> 04:41.031
...you must consider only the
contribution of the man to the field...

04:41.198 --> 04:43.158
...not the validity of the field itself.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.536
For example,
Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan...

04:45.703 --> 04:49.039
...made a greater contribution
to the discredited field of alchemy...

04:49.206 --> 04:51.584
...than Halbert Vanderplatt
made to neurobiology.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.669
Okay. Ready to have some fun?

04:54.920 --> 04:57.006
An old boyfriend
who's "definitely not gay."

04:57.172 --> 05:00.009
You know, that's what a guy
likes to hear. "Definitely."

05:00.175 --> 05:01.760
All right, I'll start with an easy one.

05:01.927 --> 05:05.723
Um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie
and Niels Bohr.

05:05.890 --> 05:09.226
And then I say one little thing
and I end up being the bad guy.

05:09.393 --> 05:12.563
Hint. Madame Curie had her husband
to help her.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.023
What am I supposed to say?

05:14.189 --> 05:17.401
"Sure, Penny. I'm cool with your old
boyfriend sleeping in your apartment."

05:17.568 --> 05:20.195
[MOCKING PENNY]
"It doesn't matter if you're cool or not.

05:20.362 --> 05:23.490
Because I'm Penny, I'm pretty
and I can do whatever I want."

05:23.657 --> 05:27.328
[NORMAL VOICE] "You think you're doing a
favor by being in a relationship with me."

05:27.494 --> 05:30.706
[MOCKING PENNY] "No. I'm doing you
a favor by being in the same room as you."

05:30.873 --> 05:32.249
Leonard, stop the car.

05:33.709 --> 05:34.752
What?

05:34.919 --> 05:37.379
I can't listen to the two of you fight
anymore.

05:42.384 --> 05:45.137
- Come on. We're late.
- Calm down. We'll make the movie.

05:45.304 --> 05:49.099
I believe my alarm is appropriate.
The movie starts in 17 minutes.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.936
We'll need to make all the lights
on Colorado Boulevard.

05:52.102 --> 05:55.022
Plus, skip the concession stand
and pre-show urination.

05:55.940 --> 06:00.653
Oh, dude, I wish you had said something
before I pounded that last Red Bull.

06:00.819 --> 06:03.489

Go. Go, Power Rangers, go.

06:05.783 --> 06:07.868
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.913
- We're, uh, going to the movies.
- No, we're not.

06:12.164 --> 06:15.167
We're standing in the hallway,
suffering through an awkward encounter.

06:16.418 --> 06:17.795
Hang on.

06:18.337 --> 06:21.757
They're showing a digital <i>Time</i> Bandits.
You wouldn't wanna come, would you?

06:21.924 --> 06:23.384
Not really, no.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.261
All right. Invitation pointlessly offered,
declined as expected.

06:26.428 --> 06:29.598
Everyone's civil, nobody's fighting.
Have a nice evening.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.352
Just give us a minute?

06:33.519 --> 06:35.562
Take all the time you need.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.986
So are we gonna talk about last night?

06:42.152 --> 06:44.947
- Are you ready to apologize?
- No.

06:45.114 --> 06:47.950
Ehh! Wrong answer.
But thank you for playing.

06:48.117 --> 06:49.868
Come on. This is stupid.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.287
Oh, there it is again.
You think I'm stupid.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.165
No. There's a difference
between being and acting stupid.

06:55.332 --> 06:59.336
Oh, yeah? Well, there's a difference
between being a jerk and being an ass.

06:59.503 --> 07:02.798
No, there isn't. They're synonyms.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.885
Well, that was rather unpleasant.

07:07.219 --> 07:11.098
Yeah. I don't think I need
my pre-show urination anymore.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.643
Leonard, when that woman moved in
three years ago...

07:14.810 --> 07:18.731
...l told you not to talk to her.
Now look, we are late for the movies.

07:22.234 --> 07:25.362
<i>Hey, look Amazing Spider-Man 193.</i>

07:25.529 --> 07:26.864
Got it.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.992
Remember this one?
Spider-Man loses a big fight...

07:30.159 --> 07:32.494
...and then his girlfriend breaks up
with him.

07:35.664 --> 07:39.209
You want me to get it for you?
It will help take your mind off things.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.336
Hey, guys. What's going on?

07:41.503 --> 07:44.089
Ah, we need to kill a couple hours
until the next showing.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.799
Oh, well, no problem.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.135
I was thinking of closing early,
and going home...

07:48.302 --> 07:53.432
...but let's face it, that's just a smaller
lonely room filled with comic books.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.310
Thanks, Stuart.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.437
Let me ask you.

07:58.604 --> 08:01.857
Do you think it's okay to have
an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?

08:02.024 --> 08:03.984
- She's obviously way out of line.
- Thank you.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.237
But if she dumps you,
she'll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow...

08:07.404 --> 08:10.741
...and you'll have a new girlfriend
when you figure out how to build one.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.913
So the only question is,
how long until you fold?

08:16.080 --> 08:17.414
I am not gonna fold.

08:17.581 --> 08:21.710
Well, excuse me. I don't think
Penny's out of line. You don't own her.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.545
It's like my girl Beyoncé says:

08:23.712 --> 08:26.507
"If you like it,
you should've put a ring on it."

08:27.841 --> 08:31.053
At the very least, when she found out
Leonard was upset about it...

08:31.220 --> 08:33.931
- ...she should've backed off.
- Like when a guy's upset...

08:34.098 --> 08:36.725
...his friend agreed to take a class
with him and then doesn't...

08:36.892 --> 08:39.728
...because he's doing a juice fast
with his mother?

08:40.187 --> 08:42.231
I didn't know you were upset
about that.

08:42.397 --> 08:46.443
Really? Did you miss the subtle indicators?
Like me saying, "Howard, I am upset."

08:46.610 --> 08:49.154
HOWARD: Okay, sorry.
- Maybe it's different in this country.

08:49.321 --> 08:52.199
Back in India, it means you're upset
with a guy named Howard.

08:52.366 --> 08:55.077
- I said I'm sorry.
- Sorry doesn't make up for the fact...

08:55.244 --> 08:57.704
...l had to make chicken and rice
with this vegan guy.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.750
Do you know
what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice.

09:01.917 --> 09:05.295
You think I was having fun? Sitting
around listening to my mother say:

09:05.462 --> 09:07.881
[AS MRS. WOLOWITZ] "Have you ever
peed so much in your life?"

09:08.048 --> 09:11.677
Oh, my God.
You are such a mama's boy.

09:11.844 --> 09:15.597
HOWARD: Don't bring my mother into this!
- You brought your mother into this!

09:15.764 --> 09:17.182
Stop it! Both of you!

09:17.349 --> 09:20.102
This fighting, I might as well be back
with my parents.

09:20.269 --> 09:23.021
[AS MOTHER] "I told you if you didn't
quit drinking, I'd leave you."

09:23.188 --> 09:26.942
[AS FATHER] "I guess that makes you a liar.
I'm drunk as hell and you're still here."

09:27.401 --> 09:29.570
[AS MOTHER] "Stop yelling.
You're making Sheldon cry."

09:29.736 --> 09:31.822
[AS FATHER]
"I'll tell you what's making Sheldon cry.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.448
That I let you name him Sheldon."

09:40.455 --> 09:43.375
Boy, what got him so upset?

09:43.542 --> 09:46.128
Oh, sure. You can tell
when Sheldon's upset.

09:53.635 --> 09:56.180
Oh. Thank you very much.
Come back soon.

09:57.014 --> 09:59.600
With the other half of my tip.

10:00.559 --> 10:01.685
[SIGHS]

10:01.852 --> 10:04.396
Hey, Sheldon.
What're you doing here?

10:04.563 --> 10:06.481
This is a restaurant. It's lunchtime.

10:06.648 --> 10:09.526
I'd think as a waitress you'd be familiar
with the paradigm.

10:09.985 --> 10:11.737
- Is Leonard coming'?
- No.

10:11.904 --> 10:15.449
I believe Leonard is waiting for you
to come back to him and apologize.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.993
- Well, that's not gonna happen.
- I assumed that.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.537
- Hence my true purpose in coming here.
- Which is?

10:20.704 --> 10:23.248
I want you to crawl back to him
and apologize.

10:23.415 --> 10:28.712
- I'm busy.
- Excuse me, miss. I'd like to order lunch.

10:32.341 --> 10:35.010
- Fine. What do you want?
- I have a few questions.

10:35.177 --> 10:38.055
First, I notice that you offer
soup and a half sandwich.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.473
- Yes.
- Where exactly...

10:39.640 --> 10:41.683
...does the half-sandwich come from?

10:41.850 --> 10:44.228
Are you giving me half
of someone else's sandwich?

10:44.770 --> 10:48.357
Or do I have to wait for someone else
to order the other half?

10:48.523 --> 10:50.609
No. Sheldon, they just make
a half sandwich.

10:50.776 --> 10:52.486
You can't make a half sandwich.

10:52.653 --> 10:56.156
If it's not half of a whole sandwich,
it's just a small sandwich.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.951
Okay, fine.
It's soup and a small sandwich.

10:59.117 --> 11:02.496
- Is that what you want?
- Of course not. I'll have my usual.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.665
- Great.
- Aren't you gonna ask...

11:04.831 --> 11:07.209
- ...if I want a beverage?
- Usually lemonade?

11:07.376 --> 11:08.418
- Yes.
- Want lemonade?

11:08.585 --> 11:09.711
- Yes.
- Anything else?

11:09.878 --> 11:11.546
Yes. I want you to apologize to Leonard.

11:12.798 --> 11:16.385
I am not going to apologize.
I've done nothing. He's overreacting.

11:16.551 --> 11:20.889
