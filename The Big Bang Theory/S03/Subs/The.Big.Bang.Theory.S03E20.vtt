saying "coitus" with everyone or just you?

13:33.563 --> 13:35.190
I'm in bed.

13:36.108 --> 13:38.652
Point taken. You may wanna sit up.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.362
Sheldon!

13:42.572 --> 13:44.866
I've been seeing Penny
behind your back.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.126
OKEY-

13:55.752 --> 14:00.382
When you say "seeing Penny,"
what exactly does that mean?

14:00.924 --> 14:02.592
We had dinner last night.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.512
She made me spaghetti
with little hot dogs cut up in it.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.305
Well, little hot dog.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.642
I gave up the other five hot dogs
to a real dog.

14:10.809 --> 14:12.727
A real big dog.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.312
A hell hound.

14:14.479 --> 14:18.608
It's tangential to the primary story.
How about I circle back to it?

14:19.734 --> 14:22.696
Fine. Why did you
have dinner with Penny?

14:22.863 --> 14:24.781
She made spaghetti
with little hot dogs.

14:24.948 --> 14:27.159
I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.287
Well, then why did you
have Chinese food with us?

14:30.454 --> 14:32.205
I didn't wanna upset you.

14:32.372 --> 14:36.001
Howard made it very clear that my
allegiance should be to male comrades...

14:36.168 --> 14:38.879
...before women who sell their bodies
for money.

14:41.465 --> 14:44.968
Is it possible he said,
"Bros before ho's"?

14:46.052 --> 14:49.639
Yes, but I rephrased it
to avoid offending the ho's.

14:51.558 --> 14:55.187
Sheldon, I don't care
if you wanna be friends with Penny.

14:55.604 --> 14:56.938
Oh.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.733
So the turmoil
that has been keeping me...

14:59.900 --> 15:02.777
...from achieving REM sleep
was entirely unjustified?

15:03.778 --> 15:04.863
Yes.

15:05.030 --> 15:08.241
Well, then as my meemaw would say...

15:08.408 --> 15:12.370
...looks like we butchered a pig,
but nobody wanted bacon.

15:14.456 --> 15:15.665
I guess not.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.335
And now, as promised, the tangent.

15:20.337 --> 15:21.713
<i>Sheldon and the Hell Hound.</i>

15:21.880 --> 15:25.717
<i>Or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.</i>

15:29.721 --> 15:30.931
Oh, urn, ahem.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.975
- I can come back.
- Don't be silly.

15:34.184 --> 15:37.979
We're neighbors. We're gonna run into
each other. May as well get used to it.

15:38.188 --> 15:39.981
Yeah. I guess you're right.

15:46.530 --> 15:47.614
- Used to it yet?
- Nope.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.199
Me neither.

15:50.909 --> 15:54.412
Oh. Sheldon seemed to think
I'd be upset about you hanging out.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.331
But I want you to know it's fine.

15:56.498 --> 15:59.376
Oh, good.
Because his mother called me.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.963
- His mother?
- Yeah, she wants me...

16:03.129 --> 16:05.382
...to take him shopping
for sheets and towels.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.093
I was gonna do that.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.596
Oh, well, then you do it.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.640
I don't wanna do it. You can do it.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.850
Okay, then you can take him
for shoes.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.936
I just took him for shoes.

16:18.103 --> 16:21.565
Well, all I know is he says
they hurt his feet.

16:23.275 --> 16:26.778
Fine. I'll take him for shoes
next Saturday.

16:26.945 --> 16:30.365
No. A bunch of us from work
are going to Disneyland next Saturday...

16:30.532 --> 16:32.450
...and Sheldon wants to come.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.411
You're taking him to Disneyland?

16:34.578 --> 16:38.790
Well, he heard me making plans
on the phone. Was I gonna say no?

16:40.083 --> 16:43.503
All right, but let me know if you're
gonna stuff him with junk food.

16:43.670 --> 16:47.257
I don't wanna bring home a nice dinner
for him and see it go to waste.

16:49.092 --> 16:52.053
We're going to Disneyland.
He's gonna eat junk food.

16:52.762 --> 16:55.265
All I'm saying is give me a heads-up.

16:55.765 --> 16:56.850
Okay, whatever.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.229
And don't let him go on Space Mountain
after he eats.

17:01.396 --> 17:05.859
He'll say he can handle it, but you'll
end up with churro puke on your shoes.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.861
All right. Got it. Anything else?

17:08.028 --> 17:09.237
Don't let Goofy near him.

17:09.404 --> 17:12.073
He'll have nightmares,
and I'll have to deal with it.

17:12.282 --> 17:16.703
- What's the problem with Goofy?
- Wish I knew. He's fine with Pluto.

17:22.167 --> 17:24.669
<i>Do you think the elastic</i> woman
<i>in The Incredibles...</i>

17:24.836 --> 17:28.548
...needs to use birth control
or can she just be a diaphragm?

Well, that's it. We're officially
out of things to talk about.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.725
We're home.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.728
It's 10:00. Where have you been?

17:41.895 --> 17:44.731
We stayed
for the California Adventure water show.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.817
It was pure Disney magic.

17:48.318 --> 17:51.112
- I was gonna see that with him.
- How was I to know that?

17:51.321 --> 17:53.615
It's all right. I'll see it again with you.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.617
I have food here. You were gonna call.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.078
- I know, I know.
- I can still eat.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.706
No. You already threw up once.
Go put on your p.j.'s and brush your teeth.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.543
Okay, but just don't fight.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.462
- We're not fighting.
- Just go.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.884
Aren't you gonna thank Penny
for taking you?

18:13.051 --> 18:15.595
Thank you, Penny.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.515
You're welcome, sweetie.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.017
Want a cup of coffee?

18:21.184 --> 18:23.687
Oh, I should probably get going.

18:23.853 --> 18:27.857
- Come on, it's just a cup of coffee.
- Yeah. Okay.

Yeah, the whole thing
seems a little twisted to me too.

What am I smelling?

18:40.745 --> 18:42.997
Sheldon's churro on my shoes.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.890
Such an angel when he's asleep.

Yeah, shame he has to wake up.

I think we can do it.

Wouldn't that be wrong?

No, be friends. You and me.

Absolutely.
