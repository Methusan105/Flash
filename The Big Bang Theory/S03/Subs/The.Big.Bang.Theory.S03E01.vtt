Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

00:04.380 --> 00:07.883
I'm going to the Arctic Circle with
Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.969
- For three months?
- Yes.

00:10.303 --> 00:13.556
What did you mean when you said
you were going to miss me?

00:14.056 --> 00:15.266
[SIGHS]

00:15.433 --> 00:18.102
It means I wish you weren't going.

00:32.074 --> 00:33.659
Oh, thank God we're home.

00:33.826 --> 00:37.830
I can't believe we spent three months
in that frozen hell.

00:37.997 --> 00:41.500
It was like a snowy nightmare
from which there was no awakening.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.587
I don't know what Arctic expedition
you were on...

00:44.754 --> 00:46.756
...l thought it was a hoot and a half.

00:50.301 --> 00:51.969
Oh, hi, Morn.

00:52.303 --> 00:55.348
No. I told you I'd call you when
I got home. I'm not home yet.

00:56.891 --> 00:59.226
All right. I'm home.

00:59.685 --> 01:02.313
The Arctic expedition
was a remarkable success.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.149
I'm all but certain there's a Nobel Prize
in my future.

01:05.316 --> 01:08.235
Actually, I shouldn't say that.
I'm entirely certain.

01:10.071 --> 01:14.283
No, Mother, I could not feel
your church group praying for my safety.

01:14.450 --> 01:16.494
The fact that I'm home safe
doesn't prove it worked.

01:16.661 --> 01:19.538

01:20.665 --> 01:24.126

- I'm gonna let Penny know we're back.
- Mother, I have to go.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.716
Yeah, love you. Bye.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.817
Leonard, you're back.

01:47.983 --> 01:50.194
Yeah, I just stopped by to say--

01:55.241 --> 01:57.159
- Yeah, so hi.
- Hi.

02:05.584 --> 02:09.213
Damn it, I should've gone over
and told her we were back.

02:13.884 --> 02:17.221
Yeah, it was first come, first serve.

02:43.789 --> 02:46.667
I just want you both to know,
when I publish my findings...

02:46.834 --> 02:50.546
- ...l won't forget your contributions.
- Great.

02:50.713 --> 02:52.882
I can't mention you
in my Nobel acceptance speech.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.633
When I write my memoirs...

02:54.800 --> 02:58.846
...you can expect a very effusive footnote
and perhaps a signed copy.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.808
- We have to tell him.
- Tell me what?

03:03.934 --> 03:06.687
Damn his Vulcan hearing.

03:07.146 --> 03:09.440
You are planning a party for me,
aren't you?

03:10.274 --> 03:12.067
Okay, Sheldon, sit down.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.571
If there's going to be a theme,
I should let you know...

03:15.738 --> 03:18.032
...l don't care for luau, toga
or under the sea.

03:20.367 --> 03:23.662
Yeah. We'll keep that in mind.
Look, we need to talk to you...

03:23.829 --> 03:26.665
...about something that happened
at the North Pole.

03:26.832 --> 03:29.126
If this is about the night
the heat went out...

03:29.293 --> 03:31.879
...there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.592
- It's not about that.
- We agreed to never speak of it again.

03:36.759 --> 03:38.385
So we slept together naked.

03:41.430 --> 03:45.309
It was only to keep our core
body temperatures from plummeting.

03:45.726 --> 03:49.396
- He's speaking about it.
- For me it was a bonding moment.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.112
Sheldon, you remember
the first few weeks...

03:57.279 --> 04:00.866
...we were looking for magnetic monopoles
and not finding anything...

04:01.033 --> 04:04.286
...and you were acting
like an obnoxious giant dictator?

04:04.453 --> 04:06.497
I thought we were gonna be gentle
with him.

04:06.664 --> 04:09.792
That's why I added the "tator."

04:13.629 --> 04:16.006
And when we finally got
our first positive data...

04:16.173 --> 04:17.466
...you were so happy.

04:17.633 --> 04:22.680
Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons,
I was colon, capital D.

04:28.185 --> 04:31.063
Well, ahem, in actuality,
what your equipment detected...

04:31.230 --> 04:35.067
...wasn't so much evidence
of paradigm-shifting monopoles...

04:35.234 --> 04:40.573
...as it was static from the electric
can opener we were turning on and off.

04:43.075 --> 04:45.661
He just went colon, capital O.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.916
- You tampered with my experiment?
- We had to.

04:51.083 --> 04:55.087
It was the only way to keep you
from being such a huge Dickensian.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.799
You see that? I added the "ensian."

04:59.925 --> 05:01.677
Did Leonard know about this?

05:01.844 --> 05:04.638
Leonard's my best friend.
Surely Leonard didn't know.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.473
- It was his idea.
- Of course it was.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.767
The whole plan reeks of Leonard.

05:10.269 --> 05:12.229
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

05:12.396 --> 05:15.983
- I couldn't think of anyone else.
- Me neither.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.528
Except for one night
when the heat went out.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.407
Long story. It's-- Don't ask.

05:52.645 --> 05:54.271
- What?
- Hello, Penny.

05:54.438 --> 05:57.900
I realize you're currently at the mercy
of your biological urges...

05:58.067 --> 06:02.529
...but as you have a lifetime of poor
decisions ahead, may I interrupt this one?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.491
Great to see you too. Come on in.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.620
Wolowitz has informed me
of your grand deception.

06:09.787 --> 06:11.538
Do you have anything to say?

06:11.705 --> 06:15.209
Yes, I feel terrible about it.
I will never forgive myself.

06:15.376 --> 06:18.963
I don't expect you to. I'd appreciate it
if you'd leave me with Penny...

06:19.129 --> 06:22.424
...for a session of self-criticism
and repentance.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.972
Can someone tell me
what's going on here?

06:28.138 --> 06:32.685
What's going on is I was led to believe
I was making strides in science...

06:32.851 --> 06:35.020
...when in fact
I was being fed false data...

06:35.187 --> 06:39.525
...at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali
and your furry little boy toy.

06:40.985 --> 06:42.277
Is that true?

06:42.444 --> 06:45.990
- It was the only way to make him happy.
- Why'd you have to make him happy?

06:46.156 --> 06:48.951
Because when he wasn't happy
we wanted to kill him.

06:50.536 --> 06:52.621
That was even a plan.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.833
We were going to throw
his Kindle outside.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.170
And when he went to get it, lock
the door and let him freeze to death.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.965
- That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
- No.

07:03.132 --> 07:06.677
The overreaction was to tie your limbs
to four different sled-dog teams...

07:06.844 --> 07:08.887
...and yell, "Mush!"

07:10.806 --> 07:14.810
Look, we kept the original data.
You can still publish the actual results.

07:14.977 --> 07:17.730
Yes, but the actual results
are unsuccessful.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.607
I sent an e-mail
to everyone at the university...

07:20.774 --> 07:22.443
...explaining I confirmed
string theory...

07:22.609 --> 07:25.029
...and forever changed

Oh. See, yeah, you probably
shouldn't have done that.

So write another e-mail.

You're right, Leonard.
That's not a big deal.

07:37.666 --> 07:40.294
All you did was lie to me,
destroy my dream...

...and humiliate me
in front of the whole university.

07:45.382 --> 07:48.218

to a Nobel Prize?
