Yes, if we were lived in a tea kettle.

agreed to in the roommate agreement.

Apparently, the one fella
tried to adjust the thermostat...

went bat-crap crazy.

Not as nuts as the guy

- Because no one likes Babylon 5.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.733
- I like it.
- Me too.

- So do I.

They don't get a vote.
It's one against one.

13:41.613 --> 13:45.992
And according to the roommate agreement,
all ties will be settled by me.

13:47.035 --> 13:50.539
- But I said no to that.
- And I said yes.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.166
And I settle all ties.

13:56.962 --> 13:59.256
- Change seats with me.
- Why?

13:59.423 --> 14:01.174
There's a draft on my neck over here.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.884
So I get the draft?

14:03.051 --> 14:05.178
You're protected by your turtleneck.

14:07.305 --> 14:08.682
Fine.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.560
And it's a dickey.

14:19.568 --> 14:20.819
Hmm...

14:20.986 --> 14:23.738
I'm still not comfortable.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.158
Of course,
there's too many people here.

14:27.909 --> 14:30.662
We can fix that. Let's leave.

Yeah, we can go over to my place.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.088
- You're not going with us.
- Why not?

14:40.255 --> 14:43.091
You're the guy
we're trying to get away from.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.260
Oh.

14:45.427 --> 14:47.179
In that case, I don't need my jacket.

14:48.346 --> 14:50.348
And for the record,
the correct syntax is:

14:50.515 --> 14:53.560
"I'm the guy from whom
you're trying to get away."

15:02.444 --> 15:04.237
Oh, yes.

Okay. How do you know he said that?
You left the room.

working on your man-feet or not?

15:24.758 --> 15:27.928
I don't have playdates! I have colleagues!

No, but if you keep screaming,
maybe they'll hear you!

Oh, man. ls that a two-stage rocket?

15:51.409 --> 15:54.162
Three. I designed the engine myself.

15:54.329 --> 15:56.289
Cool. Can it break Mach 1?

my hands on that new fuel...

the Oreos I left on the counter?!

16:09.469 --> 16:12.889
I haven't seen your Oreos!

16:13.098 --> 16:16.184
Just take your bath without them!

16:20.021 --> 16:21.481
So why was it his lucky day?

16:21.648 --> 16:24.276
It turns out I had a little rocket fuel
in the apartment.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.987
What were you doing with
rocket fuel in your apartment?

16:27.153 --> 16:29.614
Joyce Kim was curious
about what I did for a living...

16:29.781 --> 16:32.492
...and I was gonna
kind of show it to her.

16:34.536 --> 16:37.664
The point is, the guys and I
went back to the apartment.

16:37.831 --> 16:41.543
- Are we ever gonna get to the elevator?
- We're close. We're at the apartment.

16:41.710 --> 16:45.255
The trick is to mix it into Tovex in
order to create a combustible gel...

16:45.422 --> 16:48.550
...that will generate over
8000 kilonewtons of thrust.

16:48.717 --> 16:49.884

- Nice.

Trust me, it'll work.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.310
You don't see your mistake, do you?

16:58.476 --> 16:59.894
There's no mistake.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.689
This is for a full scale rocket,
not a model.

17:02.856 --> 17:06.526
- Well, I've adjusted the formula.
- Not correctly.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.528
Okay, I've had it with you.

17:08.695 --> 17:12.490
You might be an expert on theoretical
physics and science fiction programs...

17:12.657 --> 17:16.161
...and where to sit on a freaking couch,
but this is applied physics.

17:16.328 --> 17:19.289
And when it comes to applied physics--
Uh-oh.

17:19.998 --> 17:22.792

- A bad thing. A very bad thing.

he didn't rat me out to the landlord.

18:08.797 --> 18:11.800
Or the police. Or Homeland Security.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.635

18:13.802 --> 18:16.721
...I have to walk up and down

18:16.888 --> 18:19.724

I'm sure you did stupid things.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.516
Anyway, I may owe you an apology.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.561
There's doubt?

19:05.019 --> 19:08.648
I did agree to the thermostat setting
and I shouldn't have tried to change it.

19:09.232 --> 19:10.775
That's not an apology.

19:10.942 --> 19:13.653
That's simply an acknowledgment
that I was right.
