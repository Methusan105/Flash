Excuse me.
You're misusing the word "ho."

00:12.972 --> 00:16.684
It's an interjection used to call attention
to a destination, not an object.

00:16.851 --> 00:20.479

[CHUCKLES]

00:31.490 --> 00:35.328
If you refer to the work of Benjamin
Franklin, he did not discover electricity.

00:35.494 --> 00:39.081
He merely used a kite to determine
that lightning consists of electricity.

00:39.248 --> 00:44.211
He also invented the Franklin stove,
bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter.

00:46.922 --> 00:51.010
- Kites ho.
- We're heading out for some kite fighting.

00:51.177 --> 00:52.803
- Kite fighting?
- Oh, yeah.

00:52.970 --> 00:56.223
It's an extremely competitive,
cutthroat sport.

00:56.766 --> 01:00.061
Well, actually,
the risk of throat-cutting is very low.

01:00.227 --> 01:04.607
On the other hand, severe string burn
is a real and ever-present danger.

01:05.608 --> 01:10.112

If she gave you any look at all,
it was a you-suck look.

So Penny doesn't want me around her

03:56.570 --> 04:00.616
Well, her actions could be
out of concern for your feelings.

04:00.783 --> 04:03.118
Perhaps she's excluded you
from these gatherings...

04:03.285 --> 04:07.039

and doesn't wanna do it in front of you.

04:07.832 --> 04:10.626
Oh, how kind of her.

04:11.085 --> 04:14.380
Agreed. Most primates don't show
that sort of discretion.

"How do you do?"

my prized Patang fighting kite.

you could give me my kite back?

12:52.189 --> 12:54.441
This is Hello Kitty.

12:56.902 --> 13:00.364
Yeah, but it comes
with a little coin purse.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.574
Does a Patang?

13:03.367 --> 13:05.202
Wow, you just don't get it, do you?

13:05.369 --> 13:09.498
Buying me something pretty isn't gonna
make our problem just go away.

13:10.957 --> 13:14.669
Look, I admit I haven't always been
the best friend I could be.

13:14.836 --> 13:17.923
You've been a sucky friend.
A sucky, sucky friend.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.801
- Stipulated.
- And you do it all the time.

13:20.967 --> 13:25.180
Last week, we were looking for a phone
with giant numbers for your mother...

13:25.347 --> 13:27.849
- ...and I realize you're not even there.
- I know.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.226
And where were you?

13:29.393 --> 13:32.604
Getting shot down by the girl
at Hot Dog on a Stick.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.440
But in my defense, she was gorgeous.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.943
And working that squeezer
to make the lemonade...

13:38.110 --> 13:41.238
...going up and down
and up and down...

13:41.655 --> 13:45.742
It was like a free pole dance
right in the middle of the food court.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.577
You're impossible.

13:48.286 --> 13:51.748
Hey, at least I can talk to women
without being drunk.

13:51.915 --> 13:55.836
Excuse me, I have selective mutism,
a recognized medical disorder.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.338
You're just a douche.

13:59.381 --> 14:00.465
No. You know what?

14:00.632 --> 14:02.717
Maybe that's what this whole thing
is about.

14:02.884 --> 14:05.095
You're not mad at me.
You're mad at yourself.

14:05.262 --> 14:08.932
No, I'm mad at you.
I hate myself, but I'm mad at you.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.144
Look, fine. You're mad at me. I get it.
Now--

14:12.894 --> 14:15.897
How about we go
spend the day together?

14:16.064 --> 14:19.109
Just the two of us.
We'll go anywhere you want.

14:20.402 --> 14:21.945
I don't know.

14:22.112 --> 14:24.072
Come on.

14:24.239 --> 14:27.242
Let me take you someplace nice.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.748
I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.

14:35.459 --> 14:38.253
Really? Now?
With the traffic and the parking? It--

14:39.129 --> 14:42.132
Okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let's go.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.222
Oh, why can't I stay mad at you?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.224
- Yeah.
- Ha-ha-ha.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.188
COMMENTATOR [ON TV]: <i>Breaks tackle.</i>
- Go, go.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.190
COMMENTATOR: He <i>breaks</i> another.
- Go! Yes!

14:58.356 --> 15:01.651
Are you people watching this?
ls this amazing or what?

15:02.027 --> 15:05.989
Sweetie, that's a highlight
from the '98 championship game.

15:06.156 --> 15:09.159
Oh. Did not know that. Ha.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.411
- How much beer have you had?
- None, why?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.872
Oh. Just kind of hoping you were drunk.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.292
- Now we're back live.
- Okay, yeah.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.628
No, I can see the difference.

15:20.212 --> 15:23.131
- That's intentional grounding.
- Totally.

15:23.298 --> 15:25.550
Yeah--
That completely was a forward pass...

15:25.717 --> 15:29.179
...which they threw intentionally
incomplete to avoid loss of yardage...

15:29.346 --> 15:31.097
...or to conserve time.

15:31.806 --> 15:35.060
I can't believe they're not penalized
with the loss of a down...

15:35.227 --> 15:39.481
...and by having to move the line of
scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.

15:42.317 --> 15:45.904
- Here. Have some pizza, sweetie.
- Penny, you know I'm lactose intolerant.

15:46.071 --> 15:48.198
I know.
I just need you to stop talking.

15:50.158 --> 15:53.495
Penny. Penny. Penny.

15:54.829 --> 15:56.915
- Sheldon, come in.
- Thank you.

15:57.082 --> 16:00.377
I'd like to make a sandwich,
but I'm out of bread.

16:01.670 --> 16:05.298
- There's some in the fridge.
- You shouldn't keep bread in the fridge.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.260
Staleness is caused
by crystallization of the starch...

16:08.426 --> 16:10.554
...which occurs faster
at cool temperatures.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.431
On Earth, we say, "Thank you."

16:14.307 --> 16:17.310
So, Leonard, how goes the mimesis?

16:17.477 --> 16:22.190
- Mimesis?
- You know, mimesis.

16:22.357 --> 16:25.151
An action in which the mimic
takes on the properties...

16:25.318 --> 16:28.113
...of a specific object or organism.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.323
Mimesis.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.202
What the hell are you talking about?

16:34.869 --> 16:36.830
I'm attempting
to communicate with you...

16:36.997 --> 16:40.667
...without my meaning becoming
apparent to those around you.

16:40.834 --> 16:41.918
Let me try again.

16:43.336 --> 16:49.092
Have the indigenous fauna
accepted you as one of their own?

16:49.884 --> 16:52.137
Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.

16:53.138 --> 16:54.472
Oh, I guess so.

16:54.639 --> 16:58.018
Good. Oh, FYI,
after I eat my sandwich...

16:58.184 --> 17:01.062
...I'm taking Koothrappali's Patang kite
out for a test run.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.815
Would you get your Delta Wing Raptor
and join me?

17:03.982 --> 17:07.485
I don't wanna fly kites, Sheldon.
Come on, we're watching football here.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.822
I can see that.
I was providing you with an alternative.

17:11.698 --> 17:16.286
A courtesy I was never offered
in similar circumstances.

17:18.246 --> 17:21.291
Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach
has thrown down a red flag...

17:21.458 --> 17:24.169
...indicating he's challenging
the ruling on the field.

17:24.336 --> 17:28.131
Hope he's right, because if he's not,
it'll cost him one of his three timeouts.

17:33.637 --> 17:35.347
You know, Leonard, honey...

17:35.513 --> 17:39.351
...l wouldn't mind if you wanted
to go fly kites with Sheldon.

17:39.517 --> 17:42.437
I'll watch the end of the game.
There's three minutes left.

17:42.604 --> 17:43.855
Until halftime.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.482
This is just half?

17:46.858 --> 17:48.485
We've been here for hours.

17:48.652 --> 17:51.279
- You're gonna be here for a couple more.
- Oh, you're kidding.

17:51.446 --> 17:53.782
- No.
- Nice meeting all of you.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.578
So, yeah, anyway,
that's my boyfriend.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.582
He is really smart.

18:11.883 --> 18:14.886
I really like my saber-toothed cat.
Thank you.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.513
My pleasure.

18:16.680 --> 18:20.475
Maybe after lunch we can go
to Marie Callender's and have some pie.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.894
- I'd like that.
- Heh.

18:23.728 --> 18:24.771

18:24.938 --> 18:27.065
This is turning out to be
a perfect Saturday.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.733
Good, I'm glad.

18:31.736 --> 18:34.864
Oh, man. Did you see the way
she smiled at me?

18:35.907 --> 18:37.659
Fine. Go ahead.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.494
No. This is our day.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.956
If you wanna chase after her,
chase after her.

18:43.415 --> 18:47.001
Oh, who am I kidding? I wouldn't
have a shot with a girl like that.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.462
Don't put yourself down.
You're very attractive.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.381
- You think so?
- Yeah.

18:51.548 --> 18:54.843
It wouldn't kill you to take a Pilates
class with me now and then...

18:55.009 --> 18:57.512
...but you have a certain wiry appeal.

18:57.679 --> 19:01.725
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter,
because she wasn't really smiling at me.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.351
In this case, I think she was.

19:03.810 --> 19:04.894
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.354
Bye.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.984
What a douche.
