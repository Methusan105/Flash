No, I'm good. If my P.E. teachers had
told me this is what I was training for...

02:03.958 --> 02:08.170
Hey, Leonard,
where do you come down on giant ants?

02:09.463 --> 02:12.466
Sheldon says impossible,
Howard and I say not only possible...

02:12.633 --> 02:16.095
...but as a mode of transportation,
way cooler than the Batmobile.

02:16.971 --> 02:19.014
You are ignoring the square-cube law.

02:19.181 --> 02:22.518
The giant ant would be crushed
under the weight of its exoskeleton.

02:22.685 --> 02:26.188
For the record, the appropriate ranking
of cool modes of transportation...

02:26.355 --> 02:31.318
...is jetpack, hover board, transporter,
Batmobile and then giant ant.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.406
Seriously, you have nothing better
to do than sit around...

02:35.614 --> 02:39.034
...and discuss the possibility
of giant ants?

02:39.869 --> 02:42.496
- What's with him?
- Perhaps he's at a sensitive point...

02:42.663 --> 02:44.206

02:46.500 --> 02:50.212
Are you saying he's man-struating?

02:51.213 --> 02:53.340
Not literally.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.551
But as far back as the 17th century...

02:55.718 --> 02:59.138
...scientists observed a 33-day
fluctuation in men's hormone levels.

02:59.555 --> 03:00.890
Interesting.

03:01.056 --> 03:04.477
That might explain my weepy days
in the middle of the month.

03:06.729 --> 03:08.230
You know what I'm talking about.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.488
Okay, forget giant ants.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.656
How about giant rabbits?

03:18.949 --> 03:20.743
Big or small, I don't like rabbits.

03:20.910 --> 03:24.580
They always look like they're about
to say something, but they never do.

03:25.039 --> 03:28.250
Rabbits do have a respiratory system
that would support great size.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.920
On a side note,
they are one of the few mammals...

03:31.086 --> 03:34.006

is in front of the penis.

03:36.759 --> 03:39.178

what they wanna talk about.

Leonard, where do you stand
on giant rabbits and scrotal position?

03:45.100 --> 03:46.727
I honestly don't care.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.980
Really? Every time we've talked
about unusual animal genitals...

03:50.189 --> 03:53.442
...you've always had some pretty strong
and controversial opinions.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.822
What do you want?
I just don't give a rat's ass.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.783
Would that be a giant rat's ass?

04:01.617 --> 04:04.495
For the record, giant rats are possible.

Can we please talk
about something else?

04:06.789 --> 04:10.125
Maybe something vaguely related
to life as we know it on this planet?

04:10.459 --> 04:16.090
Okay, how about this for a topic:
"Why is Leonard being a giant douche?"

04:17.258 --> 04:20.094

04:20.511 --> 04:23.472
Of course they are.
Leonard's being one.

- Maybe he's having a spat with Penny.
- No. There was no spat.

04:28.477 --> 04:31.939
- Oh, but something happened.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

I don't wanna hear about it. Excuse me.

all over your body...

...and ask her if she was in the mood
for a short stack'?

to put on her panties and jump around...

just creeping her out?

- Did you start waxing?
- No.

While making love,
did you accidentally spank your own ass...

- I think we should talk now.
- What? No, it's okay.

- Really?

...because I said something nice
to a bowl of chili fries?

12:40.969 --> 12:43.263
All right, maybe I overreacted.

So we're in two different places,
emotionally. So what?

And maybe I'm a little ahead of you,
and that's fine.

how much I care about you.

- So we're good?
- Yes, that's what I'm telling you.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.121
...was Wil Wheaton's character
on Star Trek.

13:49.287 --> 13:50.747
Still don't get it.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.999
It's a blindingly clever play on words.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.086
By appropriating his character's
name and adding the S...

13:56.253 --> 14:00.215
...we imply that we will be
the crushers of Wesley.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.593
I'm sorry, but the Wesley Crushers...

14:03.760 --> 14:06.054
...sounds like people
who like Wesley Crusher.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.306
No, again,
it's not the Wesley Crushers.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.642
It's the Wesley "Crushers."

14:12.561 --> 14:15.522
No, if you want it to mean
you're crushing Wesley...

14:15.689 --> 14:17.649
...it'd be the "Wesley" Crushers.

14:17.858 --> 14:20.944
Do you people even hear yourselves?
It's not the Wesley Crushers.

14:21.111 --> 14:25.157
It's not the "Wesley" Crushers,
it's Wesley "Crushers."

14:25.323 --> 14:27.868
Hey, look.
They named their team after me.

14:29.286 --> 14:32.080
No, it's not-- Never mind.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.878
So we're all clear on the bet
and the stakes?

14:38.044 --> 14:39.129
Oh, yes.

14:39.296 --> 14:43.467
The losers will be publicly humiliated
in a fashion to be chosen by the victor.

14:43.675 --> 14:47.387
FYI, I plan on having you
publish a scientific paper...

14:47.554 --> 14:50.765
...expounding the discredited
Belakovsky hypotheses.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.102
Ouch again.

14:56.313 --> 14:58.064
Hey, Sheldon.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.735
I wanted you to know I'm looking forward
to wiping the floor with you.

15:01.943 --> 15:05.947
Oh, yes? Well, before I respond,
let me ask you a question.

15:06.948 --> 15:10.076
Is your mother a good or poor bowler?

15:16.500 --> 15:19.211
- After you.
- No, after you.

15:19.377 --> 15:23.798
As we are currently crushing you,
Wesley.

15:25.926 --> 15:29.262
It's customary for the player
on the right-hand lane to bowl first.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.974
All right.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.692
It's a custom, not a rule.

15:43.944 --> 15:46.071
I so loathe you.

15:47.113 --> 15:50.283
That's right, Sheldon.
Embrace the dark side.

15:52.911 --> 15:56.122
That's not even from your franchise.

15:57.332 --> 16:01.962
I, um-- I want you to know that
even though we're on opposite sides...

16:02.128 --> 16:03.964
...l bear you no ill will.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.801
- Thank you, Stuart. It's nice to know.
- Mm-hm.

16:08.009 --> 16:10.971
People from opposite sides
often have good relationships.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.722
You know, Romeo and Juliet...

16:12.931 --> 16:16.268
...Tony and Maria from West <i>Side</i> Story.

16:16.851 --> 16:20.021
What's-his-name
and the big, blue chick in Avatar.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.526
I'm gonna bowl now.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.405
Be the ball, Howard.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.824
Leave me alone, Sheldon.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.875
You weren't the ball.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.589
Hey, thanks.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.507
- This is fun, huh?
- Yeah.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.554
It's good we got out
and did something physical.

16:49.718 --> 16:52.178
- Mm-hm.
- Gets us out of our heads.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.388
You get in your head...

16:53.555 --> 16:56.558
...you start to over-think, over-analyze,
obsess, you worry.

16:56.725 --> 17:00.145
That's not what we're doing tonight.
We're throwing a ball at some pins.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.563
- Yeah, that's right.
- Mm-hm.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.816
And someday, we don't know when,
maybe you'll love me back.

17:07.736 --> 17:09.529
Ooh. I'm up.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.784
ALL <i>[CHANTING]:
Sheldon. Sheldon. Sheldon.</i>

17:14.951 --> 17:16.077
Excuse me.

17:16.286 --> 17:20.206
I don't know who you're chanting for,
as I am currently the ball.

17:22.459 --> 17:28.465
ALL <i>[CHANTING]:
The ball. The ball. The ball.</i>

17:31.343 --> 17:32.385
Thank you, Jesus!

17:35.263 --> 17:36.514
As my mother would say.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.773
I'm glad you patched things up
with your boyfriend.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.816
Yeah, me too.

17:46.983 --> 17:50.028
It's tough when the L bomb
gets dropped and you're not ready.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.529
Tell me about it.

17:53.114 --> 17:56.201
I dated this one girl,
and I told her that I loved her...

17:56.660 --> 17:58.578
...and she said she wasn't sure.

17:59.204 --> 18:02.707
And she strung me along
for almost two years. It was brutal.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.960
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.880
I wish she had just broken up with me
right there.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.383
Put me out of my misery.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.677
- Really?
- Yeah. Would have been kinder.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.429
- Wil, you're up.
- Oh, that's me.

18:21.893 --> 18:23.853
Did you let Wil Wheaton
get in your head?

18:24.062 --> 18:26.231
- What are you talking about?
- He's evil.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.358
He plays evil mind games.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.860
- Did he tell you his grandmother died'?
- No.

18:31.069 --> 18:35.115
If he does, don't believe it. He's not
above playing the dead meemaw card.

18:38.827 --> 18:39.911
Yes!

18:41.079 --> 18:43.248
Enjoy the accolades now,
Wil Wheaton.

18:43.415 --> 18:45.875
<i>But like</i> your <i>time on
Star Trek: Next Generation...</i>

18:46.042 --> 18:48.628
...your smug self-satisfaction
will be short-lived.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.674
- Penny, you're up.
- All right, remember...

18:52.841 --> 18:56.428
- ...his meemaw's alive and be the ball.
- Yeah. I got it.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.139
- Oh, we really need a strike here.
- I know.

18:59.347 --> 19:02.392
- Take your time and concentrate.
- Leonard, stop pressuring me.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.853
- I'm not pressuring you.
- You are. Just back off.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.647
Okay. I'm sorry. I'll shut up.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.401
I didn't mean shut up.

19:11.735 --> 19:12.902
Fine.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.363
Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.

19:16.614 --> 19:17.657
[SIGHS]

19:17.824 --> 19:20.869
No. This isn't fair to you, Leonard.
I'm sorry.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.998
Wait, where are you going?
Penny, come back.

19:25.206 --> 19:26.374
I'll get you ice cream.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.086
- No, let her go.
- Are you insane?

19:30.253 --> 19:32.088
If she leaves, it's over.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.341
Pretty sure it's already over.

19:36.384 --> 19:37.969
WIL:
Tough luck, Sheldon.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.015
You did this, didn't you?

19:42.223 --> 19:45.518
Do you think I would break up a couple
just to win a bowling match?

19:46.603 --> 19:49.856
- No, I suppose not.
- Good. Keep thinking that.

19:53.777 --> 19:57.071
Wheaton...

20:00.450 --> 20:02.118
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Yep.

20:02.285 --> 20:06.748
I'm telling you, the Match.com chicks
are much looser than on eHarmony.

20:08.750 --> 20:14.172
Oh. You know, I gotta call you back.
I won a bet and it's time to collect.

20:28.102 --> 20:31.940
I don't know about you,
but I feel empowered.
