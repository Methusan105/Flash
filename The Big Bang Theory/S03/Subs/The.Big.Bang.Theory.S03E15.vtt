00:03.754 --> 00:06.132
Yeah, I miss you too, sweetie. Ha, ha.

00:06.299 --> 00:08.968
Okay, listen, I gotta go,
but I'll see you tonight.

00:09.135 --> 00:11.095
Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye.

00:11.262 --> 00:14.056
No, you hang up first.

00:14.807 --> 00:16.309
Hello?

00:17.935 --> 00:20.104
Dude, I'm glad
you finally got a girlfriend...

00:20.271 --> 00:23.566
...but do you have to do lovey-dovey
in front of us who don't?

00:23.733 --> 00:25.318
Actually, he might have to.

00:25.484 --> 00:28.613
There's an economic concept
known as a "positional good"...

00:28.779 --> 00:32.992
...in which an object is only valued
because it's not possessed by others.

00:33.159 --> 00:36.621
The term was coined in 1976
by economist Fred Hirsch...

00:36.787 --> 00:40.833
...to replace the more colloquial
but less precise "neener-neener."

00:41.000 --> 00:44.295
That's not true. My happiness
is not dependent on my best friend...

00:44.462 --> 00:46.672
- ...being miserable and alone.
- Thank you.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.841
I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a perk.

00:50.134 --> 00:51.969
- Who's miserable and alone?
- Me.

00:52.136 --> 00:55.514
Oh. I used to be like that.
Then I got a girlfriend.

00:56.724 --> 01:00.394
In pre-1976 terms, "neener-neener."

01:00.895 --> 01:03.481
What are you and Bernadette doing
for Valentine's Day?

01:03.648 --> 01:07.485
Yeah, I'm pulling out all the stops.
There's a 39.95 Lover's Special...

01:07.652 --> 01:09.028
...at P.F. Chang's.

01:10.154 --> 01:12.323
Yeah, egg rolls, dumplings,
bottomless wok.

01:12.490 --> 01:16.369
Yeah, and you get your picture taken
on the big marble horse out front.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.079
Given that Saint Valentine...

01:18.245 --> 01:21.832
...was a third century Roman priest
who was stoned and beheaded...

01:21.999 --> 01:24.251
...wouldn't a more appropriate
celebration...

01:24.418 --> 01:27.922
...be taking one's steady gal
to witness a brutal murder?

01:28.964 --> 01:31.342
I understand your point,
but given the choice...

01:31.509 --> 01:33.678
...Jews always go with Chinese food.

01:35.096 --> 01:38.182
If anyone's interested,
I'll be spending this Valentine's Day...

01:38.349 --> 01:40.393
...the same way
I spend every Valentine's.

01:40.559 --> 01:43.938
Buying rotisserie chicken,
taking it home, standing over the sink...

01:44.105 --> 01:47.983
...and eating it out of the package
with my bare hands like an animal.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.946
Okay, so to sum up,
one giant marble horse...

01:52.113 --> 01:56.075
...one asinine comment,
one lonely man and his chicken...

01:56.242 --> 01:57.910
...and let's see. Who's left?

01:58.077 --> 02:00.955
Oh, that's right, my plans.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.584
Isn't anyone gonna ask?

02:05.751 --> 02:09.088
- You're gonna have sex with Penny.
- That's not what I was gonna tell you.

02:09.255 --> 02:11.799
It's okay. I don't mind hearing
about your sex life.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.801
It's his that bugs me.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.556
Guess who the university
is sending to Switzerland...

02:18.723 --> 02:22.852
...to attend a conference and see the
CERN Super Collider on February 14th?

02:23.018 --> 02:24.729
Professor Norton. God knows why.

02:24.895 --> 02:28.441
He hasn't published anything of note
since he won that Nobel Prize.

02:28.607 --> 02:31.610
Professor Norton can't make it.
He threw his back out climbing.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.488
I heard he threw his back out
climbing on his girlfriend.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.949
- Weather girl on Channel Two?
- That's the one.

02:37.116 --> 02:40.578
In any case,
they're asking me to fill in for him.

02:40.745 --> 02:43.456
In Switzerland
or with the big-boobed weather girl?

02:44.039 --> 02:47.251

And I get to bring a guest.

- Oh, my God, this is incredible.

02:50.755 --> 02:53.799

their judgment in picking you.

02:54.717 --> 02:57.553
I'm just gonna run home
and start packing.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.224
Wait, why wouldn't you take Penny?

03:03.476 --> 03:05.895
I am taking Penny.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.897
Oh.

03:08.063 --> 03:11.317
Then I anticipate an awkward situation
when you get home.

Well, of course you are.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.449

- What? That's absurd.

04:00.616 --> 04:04.036
Penny has no interest
in subatomic particle research.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.914
Yes, but it'll be Valentine's Day.

04:07.081 --> 04:11.210
We can go sightseeing and skiing
and make love in front of a roaring fire...

04:11.377 --> 04:14.088
...in the shadow
of the snow-capped Alps.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.926
But Penny has no interest
in subatomic particle research.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.178
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

04:21.345 --> 04:25.224
Sorry? I've been dreaming about
going to the Large Hadron Collider...

04:25.391 --> 04:26.934
...since I was 9 years old.

04:27.101 --> 04:31.730
I've been dreaming about spending
Valentine's with a girl since I was 6.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.191
Shame on you.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.736
That's no dream for a scientist.

04:39.238 --> 04:42.616
- Okay, what's the big surprise?
- Just a minute.

Swiss cheese, fondue.

to visit the Large Hadron Collider...

the other friend to accompany him."

07:00.254 --> 07:01.672
Oh, for God's sakes.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.675
You actually put that
in an agreement?

07:04.842 --> 07:07.761
We put in what happens
if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant...

07:07.928 --> 07:12.516
...or if one of us gets superpowers,
or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.

He can't kill me. Even if I turn.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.565
Is there anything about
if one of you gets a girlfriend?

07:19.732 --> 07:22.026
No, that seemed a little far-fetched.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.823
Sheldon, do you really expect
to enforce this?

07:27.990 --> 07:30.576
I've lived up to my commitments
under the agreement.
