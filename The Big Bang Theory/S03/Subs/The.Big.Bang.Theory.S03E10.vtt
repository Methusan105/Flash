Hey, Leonard, check this out.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.346
Leonard, she's doing it again.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.975
I think it upsets Sheldon
when you play with the food.

00:16.142 --> 00:20.146
No, it upsets Sheldon when she
willy-nilly takes it from the containers...

00:20.313 --> 00:23.107
...without regard
for its equitable distribution.

00:23.274 --> 00:26.319
This is essentially
why you have famine in India.

00:28.487 --> 00:31.073
You want me to put it back?

00:31.991 --> 00:33.701
- Leonard?
- It upsets Sheldon...

00:33.868 --> 00:36.162
...when you play with the Sheldon.

00:38.122 --> 00:41.083
What's up, my nerdizzles?

00:41.542 --> 00:44.378
Raj, Sheldon, I want you
to meet my girlfriend, Bernadette.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.921
- Hello.
- Leonard, Penny.

00:46.088 --> 00:48.507
- You know my girlfriend, Bernadette.
- Yeah. Hey.

00:48.674 --> 00:51.302
Bernadette,
say "fo'shizzle" to my nerdizzles.

00:51.886 --> 00:53.929
I don't think I can.

00:54.305 --> 00:56.974
I don't have Howard's street cred.

00:58.309 --> 01:01.937
I hope it's all right, I told Bernadette
she could join us for dinner.

01:02.104 --> 01:05.107
- Sure. The more, the merrier.
- No, that's a false equivalency.

01:05.274 --> 01:06.651
More does not equal merry.

01:06.817 --> 01:09.945
If there were 2000 people in this
apartment, would we be celebrating?

01:10.112 --> 01:11.697
No, we'd be suffocating.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.449
- Sheldon.
- Don't "Sheldon" me.

01:13.616 --> 01:16.118
- We ordered for five people, not six.
- It's fine.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.371
We'll put it on the table, family-style.

01:18.537 --> 01:21.248
Oh, sure. Why don't we put our hands
behind our backs...

01:21.415 --> 01:23.793
...have an old-fashioned
eating contest?

01:24.377 --> 01:27.630
Relax. It'll be fine. Sit down, you guys.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.508
ALL EXCEPT BERNADETTE: No.
- What?

01:32.677 --> 01:34.428
Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.889
- Why not?
- That's where Sheldon sits.

01:37.056 --> 01:38.391
He can't sit somewhere else?

01:40.142 --> 01:42.937
In the winter, that seat's close enough
to the radiator...

01:43.104 --> 01:45.398
...so he's warm
yet not so close that he sweats.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.858
In the summer,
it's in the path of a breeze...

01:48.025 --> 01:49.902
...created by opening windows there.

01:50.069 --> 01:53.489
It faces the television at an angle
that isn't direct so he can talk...

01:53.656 --> 01:56.951
...yet not so wide
that the picture looks distorted.

02:00.246 --> 02:03.332
Perhaps there's hope for you after all.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.821
- I love your shoes.
- Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren't they?

02:33.988 --> 02:35.698
- Where'd you get them?
- Shoes for Less.

02:35.906 --> 02:40.202
- I've been meaning to go over there.
- Oh, great selection, great prices.

02:40.536 --> 02:43.456
My mother was right. Hell is real.

02:50.296 --> 02:51.338

02:54.008 --> 02:56.218
Utero-Americans?

02:57.678 --> 03:00.806
- Just eat your dinner.
- Don't take him too seriously.

03:00.973 --> 03:04.435
A lot of what he says
is intended as humor.

03:04.977 --> 03:07.062
Yeah, well,
I don't think it's very funny.

03:07.229 --> 03:10.691
Me neither,
but he just lights up when I laugh.

03:13.319 --> 03:15.654
Howard, never let her go.

03:17.490 --> 03:20.326
Leonard, Howard says you're working on
fundamental tests...

03:20.493 --> 03:23.829
- ...of quantum mechanics.
- I am. Are you interested in physics?

03:23.996 --> 03:25.164
I find it fascinating.

03:25.498 --> 03:27.333
If I hadn't gone into microbiology...

03:27.500 --> 03:31.670
...l probably would have gone
into physics or ice dancing.

03:32.463 --> 03:35.341
My tests of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum interference effect...

03:35.508 --> 03:37.259
...have reached an interesting point.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.845
We're testing phase shift
due to electric potential.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.223
- That's amazing.
SHELDON [CHUCKLES]: Yes.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.017
Leonard's work is nearly
as amazing as third graders...

your moist breath in my ear.

03:58.697 --> 04:01.909
Are you going to try to set up
the voltages using tunnel junctions?

04:02.993 --> 04:04.078
Yes, I am.

04:04.245 --> 04:07.540
- Wanna see a simulation on my laptop?
- Oh, yeah. Show me.

04:07.873 --> 04:12.127
In microbiology, the most exciting thing
I get to work with is yeast.

04:13.379 --> 04:14.964
SHELDON: Howard?
- Yeah?

It's not about shoes, is it?

05:08.767 --> 05:10.811
I don't think
I could go through that again.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.606
- It's not about shoes.
- Then speak.

05:13.772 --> 05:17.151
- Um, actually, can we do it in private?
- All right.

Go away.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.325
I agree, it's rude,
but she asked for privacy.

05:25.367 --> 05:29.121
Thanks, Raj.
Okay, so here's the thing.

05:29.288 --> 05:32.708
I was wondering if you could
maybe teach me a little physics.

05:33.459 --> 05:36.670
- A little physics?
- Yeah.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.840
There's no such thing.
Physics encompasses the entire universe.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.384
From quantum particles to supernovas.

05:42.593 --> 05:45.679
From spinning electrons
to spinning galaxies.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.973
Okay, cool,
I don't need the PBS special.

05:48.724 --> 05:51.560
I wanna know enough
so I can talk to Leonard about his job.

05:51.727 --> 05:52.895
Like Bernadette does.

05:53.103 --> 05:56.023
- Why can't Leonard teach you?
- Because I wanna surprise him.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.150
Can't you surprise him
in some other way?

05:58.317 --> 06:02.363
For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully
taken aback if you clean your apartment.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.491
Come on, Sheldon,
this is important to me.

06:05.658 --> 06:07.660
This would be
a massive undertaking...

What sort of foundation do you have?

06:19.004 --> 06:21.256
Did you take any science classes
in school?

06:21.423 --> 06:23.384
Sure. I did the one with the frogs.

06:26.512 --> 06:29.264
The one with the frogs.

06:29.431 --> 06:33.727
It was pretty cool. A lot of the girls
threw up. I gutted that thing like a deer.

No. I'm sorry, Penny. I don't think so.

Oh, come on, a smart guy like you?
It'll be a challenge.

06:39.858 --> 06:42.653
You could make it like an experiment.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.531
Interesting.

06:45.698 --> 06:50.244
I suppose if someone could teach
sign language to Koko the gorilla...

06:50.911 --> 06:53.288
...l could teach you
some rudimentary physics.

06:53.455 --> 06:57.543
Great. It's a little insulting, but great.
I'll be Koko.

06:57.710 --> 07:00.629
Mm. Not likely. Koko learned to understand
