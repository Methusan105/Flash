13:12.292 --> 13:15.962
Senior theoretical particle physicist
at CalTech, focusing on M Theory.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.423
Or in layman's terms, string theory.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.093
I see.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.469
Just give me a second.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.101
Security!

13:34.147 --> 13:37.526
Okay.
I'll get those drinks started for you.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.820
Behind you.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.156
Sheldon? What the hell are you doing?

13:43.323 --> 13:45.659
Trying to get these tables cleared.
We're slammed.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.163
No, wait. Wait. No, wait.
What are you doing here?

13:50.330 --> 13:51.998
A reasonable question.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.250
I asked myself:

13:53.417 --> 13:56.962
"What is the most mind-numbing,
pedestrian job conceivable?"

13:57.129 --> 13:58.505
Three answers came to mind.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.091
A toll booth attendant,
an Apple store genius...

14:03.593 --> 14:05.011
...and what Penny does.

14:05.178 --> 14:09.349
Now, since I don't like touching
other people's coins...

14:09.516 --> 14:14.354
...and I refuse to contribute
to the devaluation of the word "genius"...

14:14.563 --> 14:15.856
...here I am.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.025
You just walked in
and they hired you?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.153
- Just like that?
- Oh, heavens no.

14:21.319 --> 14:24.281
Since I don't need to be paid,
I didn't need to be hired.

14:24.448 --> 14:27.951
I simply came in, picked up a tray
and started working for the man.

14:28.994 --> 14:31.037
Let me get that plate out of your way.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.206
Sheldon, this is ridiculous.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.001
Is it? Just a moment ago,
I had a minor epiphany...

14:36.168 --> 14:38.336
...regarding polymer degradation
phenomenon...

14:38.503 --> 14:40.714
...while scraping congealed nachos
off a plate.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.551
- Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.
- Thanks.

14:44.718 --> 14:48.388
Sheldon, wait. This isn't even what I do.
I'm a waitress, not a busboy.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.057
You're right. That is more menial.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.811
Hello, I'm Sheldon.
I'll be your server today.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.522
I don't recommend the salmon.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.816
I saw it in the kitchen.

15:02.527 --> 15:06.072
All right. One bacon cheeseburger...

15:06.239 --> 15:09.993
...breaking two Jewish
dietary restrictions simultaneously.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.037
Kudos.

15:12.204 --> 15:14.206
And beer-battered fish and chips.

15:14.372 --> 15:17.250
Now, here's your tartar sauce.
I also brought you salsa.

15:17.417 --> 15:21.129
A little unconventional,
but I think you'll like it. It's zingy.

15:22.339 --> 15:26.927
And for you, Factory Burrito Grande,
no cheese, no sour cream...

15:27.093 --> 15:29.930
...no ugly consequences
from your lactose intolerance.

I heard about this professor
who melted down, bought a van...

15:55.956 --> 15:58.291
...spent the rest of his life
as a dog groomer.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.126
Never went back to the university?

Professor Shamburg's shih tzu.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.424
Sheesh.

16:08.218 --> 16:11.805
You know, I bet if we all chipped in,
we could buy Sheldon a van.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.473
But he's afraid of dogs.

16:13.682 --> 16:16.184
Yeah. That's the only thing wrong
with that plan.

16:17.769 --> 16:21.147
Hey, guys. Sony you had to wait,
but we are swamped.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.607

16:22.774 --> 16:24.317
Sheldon took our order.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.820
Sheldon doesn't work here.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.155
Well, honey, not to complain...

you didn't either.

Good Lord.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.753
The interference pattern
in the fracture.

16:44.588 --> 16:46.965
The motion of the wave
through the structure.

16:47.132 --> 16:49.009
I've been looking at it all wrong.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.636
I can't consider
the electrons as particles.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.972
They move through the graphene
as a wave.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.310
It's a wave!
