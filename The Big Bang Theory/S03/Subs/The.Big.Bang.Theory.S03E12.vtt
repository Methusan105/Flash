00:08.301 --> 00:11.637
...who publicly acknowledge
they're our girlfriends.

00:11.804 --> 00:15.308
Yes. I mean,
actual women are the best.

00:15.474 --> 00:18.894
I don't understand.
What other kind of women are there?

I should warn you...

00:30.823 --> 00:32.325
...I'm a passionate man...

00:32.491 --> 00:35.870
...and I tend towards
public displays of affection.

What are you trying to tell me, Howard?

00:39.915 --> 00:42.460
There might be making out
in the car or restaurant.

00:42.627 --> 00:44.920
I don't want Bernadette
to feel uncomfortable...

00:45.087 --> 00:48.215

if you and Penny made out too.

- Got it.

- Detailed analysis posted online.

Great. They get girlfriends
and they just abandon us?

on my hard drive for a LINUX partition.

01:54.907 --> 01:58.869
Well, I understand there are
several types of artificial women.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.331
Maybe you should look into that.

02:29.275 --> 02:32.611
Dude, there are so many cool things
we could be doing tonight. Look.

Huh? Huh?

02:42.788 --> 02:44.874
A salute to zoot.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.960
- Sounds like a hoot.
- I'm sorry, Raj.

02:48.127 --> 02:51.130
I have no desire to salute any
article of clothing tonight...

02:51.338 --> 02:54.967

to race riots in the 1940s.

I always thought that was
some sort of after-Christmas sale.

Why don't we go to the galleria
and walk around?

03:09.398 --> 03:12.902
I don't need anything at the galleria.
You need anything at the galleria?

03:13.068 --> 03:15.821
No, we would just walk around
and see what's what.

Let's go outside. Outside is good.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.649
If outside is so good...

03:51.816 --> 03:55.528
...why has mankind spent thousands
of years trying to perfect inside?

I don't know. It's a marketing scheme.

- Chat her up.
- What?

05:03.220 --> 05:07.182
Tell her you're a circle.

You'd be willing to die a horrible death on
the off chance you'd get to second base.

05:32.416 --> 05:35.419
We're way past second base.
Right, Howard?

05:36.003 --> 05:40.299
Well, we kind of disagree
about what the bases are.

How's your work going, Penny?
Any acting jobs?

05:44.136 --> 05:46.388

Well, promise you won't
make fun of me?

Of course.
I would never make fun of you.

- You're surprised?

06:27.304 --> 06:29.848

I was going to be a jerk?

with you?

and my power ring runs low?
