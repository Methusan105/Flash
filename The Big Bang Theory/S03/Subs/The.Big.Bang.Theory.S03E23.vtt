LEONARD:
Okay, we've got power to the laser.

00:06.799 --> 00:09.468
I should've brought an umbrella.

00:09.635 --> 00:11.470
- What for? It's not gonna rain.
- I know.

00:11.637 --> 00:16.475
But with skin as fair as mine,
moon burn is a real possibility.

00:16.809 --> 00:18.394
That's a buzzinga, right?

00:18.811 --> 00:21.022
One of my best, don't you think?

00:21.188 --> 00:23.524
[HOWARD FEIGNS LAUGH]

00:24.150 --> 00:26.652
Howard, double-check
the equatorial mount on the laser.

00:26.819 --> 00:29.822
- We need it locked on the Sea of Tranquility.
- You got it.

00:30.323 --> 00:32.033
Raj, no.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.994
Billions of dollars have gone
into inventing the Internet...

00:35.161 --> 00:39.665
...and filling it with pictures of naked women
so we don't have to peep through windows.

00:40.166 --> 00:42.251
It's not like that.
I'm watching someone's TV.

00:42.418 --> 00:43.544
<i>The Good Wife 'vs on.</i>

00:45.671 --> 00:49.175
I tell you,
this is my new Grey's Anatomy.

00:50.176 --> 00:51.844
Leonard, what is that? What is that?

00:53.512 --> 00:55.181
Relax, it's just a dirty sock.

00:56.140 --> 01:00.019
How on earth can you say "dirty sock"
and "relax" in the same sentence?

01:01.312 --> 01:04.440
Sheldon, the world is filled
with dirty, discarded socks.

01:05.775 --> 01:07.610
Not my world.

01:08.778 --> 01:11.530
You know who'd really dig
seeing this experiment? Penny.

01:11.989 --> 01:15.076
I wasn't aware that lunar ranging
was her thing.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.285
Although I suppose...

01:16.452 --> 01:19.163
...the retroreflector left on the moon
by Neil Armstrong...

01:19.330 --> 01:21.624
...does qualify as a shiny object.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.085
Ask her to come up.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.545
I don't know. It's still weird since,
you know...

01:26.712 --> 01:28.547
- She dumped you?
- She didn't dump me.

01:28.714 --> 01:31.133
We were just in different places
in the relationship.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.927
I fail to see how a relationship...

01:33.094 --> 01:35.763
...can have the qualities
of a geographic location.

01:35.930 --> 01:40.393
Well, it's very simple. Leonard was living
in a town called Please Don't Leave Me...

01:40.559 --> 01:44.438
...while Penny had just moved
to the island of Bye-bye.

01:47.525 --> 01:49.735
Screw you, guys.
I'm gonna go see if she's home.

01:50.736 --> 01:54.407
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to point this at the moon now.

01:54.573 --> 01:57.034
Wait a second.
The good wife is crying.

01:57.827 --> 01:58.911
Something's very wrong.

02:29.275 --> 02:30.568
Oh, hi. What's going on?

02:30.735 --> 02:33.237
We're up on the roof
bouncing laser beams off the moon.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.406
I'm sorry, what?

02:35.573 --> 02:38.701
It's cool. We've got a two-meter
parabolic reflector and everything.

02:38.868 --> 02:41.412
- I thought you might wanna see it.
- That makes no sense.

02:42.580 --> 02:46.417
How can you bounce stuff off the moon?
There's no gravity.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.129
Oh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.

02:50.296 --> 02:52.214
- Hey.
- Sorry, I didn't know you were busy.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.924
- Maybe another time.
- Yeah. Maybe.

02:54.091 --> 02:57.011
- Hey, I wanna see this laser thing.
- Oh, what about the party?

02:57.178 --> 03:00.431
It's a surprise party,
doesn't matter when we get there.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.184
Right.

03:03.601 --> 03:05.019
Okay, well, yeah, come on up.

03:11.484 --> 03:12.818
LEONARD:
So how'd you guys meet?

03:12.985 --> 03:16.280
ZACK: My company designs the menus
for The Cheesecake Factory.

03:16.447 --> 03:17.448
LEONARD:
Your company?

03:17.615 --> 03:20.451
ZACK:
My dad, but me and my sister are VPs.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.454
LEONARD:
So menus.

03:23.621 --> 03:27.124
It sounds easy, but there's a lot of
science that goes into designing them.

03:33.422 --> 03:36.342
Happy now? I'm moving the dirty sock.

03:38.344 --> 03:39.970
Thank you.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.807
Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.

03:43.808 --> 03:46.143
- Hey, guys. This is my friend Zack.
ZACK: Hey.

03:46.310 --> 03:50.314
- Hello.
- Whoa, is that the laser? It's bitchen.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.818
Yes. In 1917...

03:53.984 --> 03:57.571
...when Albert Einstein established
the theoretic foundation for the laser...

03:57.738 --> 04:00.074
...in <i>his</i> paper
<i>Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung...</i>

04:00.241 --> 04:04.787
...his fondest hope was that
the resultant device be "bitchen."

04:05.996 --> 04:07.373
Well, mission accomplished.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.127
Let me explain what we're doing here.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.672
<i>In 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11...</i>

04:14.839 --> 04:16.632
...positioned reflectors on the moon.

04:16.799 --> 04:18.843
We're gonna shoot a laser
off one of them...

04:19.009 --> 04:21.679
...and let the light bounce back
into this photomultiplier.

04:21.846 --> 04:23.430
Oh, that's very cool.

04:23.597 --> 04:27.518
One question: How can you be sure
it won't blow up?

04:28.143 --> 04:30.187
- The laser?
- The moon.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.359
See, now this is a man for Penny.

04:37.027 --> 04:40.030
- That's a great question, Zack.
- No, it's not.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.534
- Sheldon, play nice.
- It's not a great question.

04:43.701 --> 04:46.912
How could somebody possibly think
we're going to blow up the moon?

04:48.622 --> 04:51.125
That's a great question.

04:52.293 --> 04:55.713
Don't worry about the moon.
We set our laser to stun.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.882
Smart.

04:58.048 --> 05:01.927
We'll see the beam when it leaves. It won't
be strong enough when it comes back...

05:02.094 --> 05:04.805
- ...to be seen by the naked eye.
- Naked. Heh, heh, heh.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.729
Right, funny.

05:12.146 --> 05:15.566
So that device there
will measure the photons that return...

05:15.733 --> 05:18.903
...and show it to us on this computer.
Raj, get them some glasses.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.697
Cool, it's gonna be in 3-D?

05:30.247 --> 05:31.582
SHELDON:
Make it so.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.297
There it is. There's the spike.

05:38.464 --> 05:42.217
Two-point-five seconds for the light to
return. That's the moon. We hit the moon.

05:45.804 --> 05:49.433
That's your big experiment?
All that for a line on the screen?

05:50.059 --> 05:53.062
Yeah, but think
about what this represents.

05:53.228 --> 05:56.565
The fact that we can do this
is the only way of definitively proving...

05:56.732 --> 05:58.984
...that there are man-made objects
on the moon...

05:59.151 --> 06:01.612
...put there by a species
that only 60 years before...

06:01.779 --> 06:03.781
...had just invented the airplane.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.783
What species is that?

06:08.869 --> 06:11.163
I was wrong. Penny can do better.

06:11.330 --> 06:14.708
- Okay, guys, thank you. It's been fun.
- Yeah, thanks.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.753
- Should we invite them to the party?
- No, just keep walking.

06:23.968 --> 06:25.135

06:25.302 --> 06:28.847
...the only way to feel better
about Penny going outwith other guys...

06:29.014 --> 06:32.351
...is for you to get back on the whores.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.814
- Horse.
- What?

06:36.981 --> 06:41.151
The phrase is "get back on the horse."
Not whores.

06:41.694 --> 06:43.654
That's disgusting, dude.

06:44.989 --> 06:48.200
No, it's not... Never mind.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.077
He is right, though.

to this great new dating site I found.

06:53.664 --> 06:54.707
No, thanks.

You sure? They say
they can find a match for anybody.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.753
- Have they found a match for you?
- Tons.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.006

07:02.172 --> 07:05.175
Twelve, if you count the ones
who showed up and left.

07:05.843 --> 07:08.262
- I can't bring the nitrogen tank down.
- Why not?

07:08.429 --> 07:11.682
All right, let me restate that.
It's very heavy and I don't want to.

- Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
- Yeah, right.

No, think about it.
We make it an experiment.

was lonely and he found a wife.

He didn't find a wife.

and then you ruined him.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.402
How did I ruin him?

08:05.569 --> 08:09.948
Because in the olden days,
I never would've known he was so stupid.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.913
- Come on, he wasn't that stupid.
- Yes, he was.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.249
He thought you were
gonna blow up the moon.

08:19.750 --> 08:22.419
Okay, yeah, he's stupid. Heh, heh.

08:22.586 --> 08:23.921

Ugh. Not this again.

Not necessarily in that order.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.216
Wonder why she didn't say goodbye.

Are you expecting me to offer
an explanation of human behavior?

10:37.054 --> 10:38.680
I know. I thought as an outsider...

Leonard, last night was a mistake.

When you say "mistake,"
do you mean a fortunate mistake...
