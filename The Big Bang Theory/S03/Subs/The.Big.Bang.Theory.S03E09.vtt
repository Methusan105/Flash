So two years later,
there's a knock on the door.

00:06.090 --> 00:07.967
Guy opens it, and there is the snail...

00:08.134 --> 00:11.053

"What the heck was all that about?"

00:11.220 --> 00:13.180
[CHUCKLES]

00:13.514 --> 00:15.349
I don't really get it.

00:16.309 --> 00:20.146
Well, see, it took two years
for the snail to--

00:22.773 --> 00:25.026
Not important.

00:25.610 --> 00:27.737
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

00:27.903 --> 00:30.489
Where do you think this is going?

00:31.157 --> 00:33.826
To be honest,
I was hoping at least second base.

00:35.578 --> 00:36.829
You're so funny.

00:37.913 --> 00:40.499
You're like a standup comedian.

00:40.666 --> 00:44.337
A Jewish standup comedian,
that would be new.

00:45.171 --> 00:48.591
Actually, I think a lot of them
are Jewish.

00:49.342 --> 00:52.511
No, I was just-- Because-- Never mind.

00:53.137 --> 00:57.433
Look, Howard, this is our third date,
and we both know what that means.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.186
- We do?
- Sex.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.523
You're kidding.

01:05.232 --> 01:08.361
But I need to know whether
you're looking for a relationship...

01:08.527 --> 01:10.112
...or a one-night stand.

01:11.030 --> 01:14.075
Okay, just to be clear,
there's only one correct answer, right?

01:14.575 --> 01:17.745
I mean, it's not like "Chicken or fish?"
on an airplane?

01:17.912 --> 01:20.039
Maybe you need to think about it
a little.

01:20.206 --> 01:22.041
Well, you know, it's not unheard of...

01:22.208 --> 01:25.044
...for a one-night stand
to turn into a relationship.

01:28.047 --> 01:30.383
Call me when you figure it out.

01:33.552 --> 01:37.056
Three dates means sex?

[TV PLAYING]

01:45.314 --> 01:47.358
Greetings, homeys.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.276
Homette.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.821
Why are you back from your date
so early?

01:51.987 --> 01:57.660
Well, in romance, as in show business,
always leave them wanting more.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.081
- What exactly does that mean?
- He struck out.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.485
Hey, did you know
that three dates with the same woman...

02:31.652 --> 02:33.696
...is the threshold for sex?

02:34.488 --> 02:37.533
Actually, I've never had three dates
with the same woman.

02:37.742 --> 02:39.744
With Penny and me, it took two years.

02:39.952 --> 02:44.165
But now that I think about it,
that was three dates.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.001
Okay, well,
before you and Penny hooked up...

02:47.168 --> 02:49.420
...did she ask
for any kind of commitment?

02:49.587 --> 02:54.341
No, she was pretty clear
about wanting to keep her options open.

02:54.842 --> 02:58.220
I have something to announce,
but out of respect for convention...

02:58.387 --> 03:01.056
...l will wait for you
to finish your conversation.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.683
What are you talking about?

03:02.850 --> 03:06.103
The cultural paradigm in which
people have sex after three dates.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.354
I see.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.024
Now, are we talking "date"
the social interaction...

03:10.191 --> 03:12.902
...or "date" the dried fruit?

03:14.403 --> 03:16.197
Never mind.
What's your announcement?

03:16.363 --> 03:17.448
SHELDON:
Oh, good, my turn.

03:17.615 --> 03:21.368
Well, this is very exciting, and I wanted
you to be among the first to know--

03:21.535 --> 03:23.370
I hear you're gonna be on the radio...

03:23.537 --> 03:26.373

to share my news with my friends.

- But my pleasure is.

Let me ask you a question.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.431
At what point
did National Public Radio...

03:42.598 --> 03:46.310
...have to start scraping the bottom
of the barrel for its guests?

03:46.519 --> 03:49.104
Eeh-eeh. Don't answer. It's rhetorical.

03:49.647 --> 03:52.107
Well, why are you such a stupidhead?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.820
That is also rhetorical.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.573
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.617
Are you really gonna be on NPR?

04:01.784 --> 04:04.411
Yes, they're interviewing me by phone
from my office...

of magnetic monopoles in spin ices.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.852
I called into Fever 104 FM New Delhi...

"Fever 104:"

04:32.523 --> 04:34.108
[SPEAKS IN HINDI]

It's much catchier in Hindi.

All right, these are the talking points
for my NPR interview tomorrow.

and tell me what's unclear to you.

05:02.887 --> 05:07.016
I have a Master's in engineering from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

05:07.182 --> 05:11.520
It required the completion of 144 units
of grad work and an original thesis.

Yes.

Otherwise, the rest of us look bad.

- Hello.

Yo, Raj, talk to me.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.176
I'm sorry, just screwing with you.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.597
Hey, Howard,
why haven't you called Bernadette?

05:46.764 --> 05:48.098
Did she say something?

05:48.265 --> 05:50.935
Said she hasn't heard from you.
I thought you liked her.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.270
I do, you know,
but she wants a commitment...

05:53.437 --> 05:55.773
...and I'm not sure she's my type.

05:55.940 --> 05:59.068
She agreed to go out with you for free.
What more do you need?

05:59.234 --> 06:01.278
Look, Bernadette is really nice.

06:01.445 --> 06:04.907
I just always thought when I finally
settled down into a relationship...

06:05.074 --> 06:07.701
...it would be with someone,
you know, different.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.286
Different how?

06:09.453 --> 06:13.248

from Transformers...

three-breasted Martian from Total Recall.

for some fantasy?

doesn't mean I have to.

I am here, right? You see me?

Hey, I'm interested
in what's inside people too.

But, you know, why is it wrong
to want those insides wrapped up...

that is Halle Berry?

- What?

Oh, gee, you're too late.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.044
Scarlett Johansson
and Wonder Woman were here...

13:14.252 --> 13:16.797
...trolling around
for neurotic little weasels.

13:17.255 --> 13:20.300
I came to talk to Bernadette.
She's working today, right?

13:20.467 --> 13:23.220
- I don't think she wants to see you.
- Why not?

13:23.387 --> 13:26.306
Come on. You hurt her feelings
by not calling her all week.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.559
Plus, I've been kind of talking
some smack about you.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.855
- Hello, Howard.
- Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.650
- I can't. I'm working.
- This will only take a second.

13:36.817 --> 13:40.320
You asked me to think about
where our relationship was going...

13:40.487 --> 13:42.155
...and I did.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.825
Bernadette...

13:48.537 --> 13:50.163
...will you marry me?

13:52.207 --> 13:55.335
Is this more comedy
that I don't understand?

13:56.002 --> 13:58.088
No, I'm serious.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.841
I'm never gonna find another girl
like you...

14:01.007 --> 14:05.679
...who likes me and is, you know, real.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.850
- So this isn't a joke?
- No.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.185
Then you're insane.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.689
I prefer to think of myself as quirky.

14:15.856 --> 14:20.110
Howard, we've only been on three dates.
We haven't even had sex yet.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.363
Fair enough. When's your break?

14:24.030 --> 14:25.449
Wow.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.537
Don't you just hate
when this happens?

14:32.497 --> 14:33.707
Wow.

14:36.877 --> 14:40.630
All right, how's this for revenge?

14:40.839 --> 14:47.053
A solution of hydrogen peroxide
and one of saturated potassium iodide.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.056
- What's this?
- Mountain Dew.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.561
Ah. Refreshing.

14:54.728 --> 14:58.064
Now, we're going to combine these
chemicals with ordinary dish soap...

14:58.231 --> 15:02.277
...creating a little exothermic release
of oxygen.

in Kripke's office?

15:20.921 --> 15:24.758
Already taken care of. Observe.

15:25.133 --> 15:30.138
This is a live shot of Kripke's lab
via a mini webcam I was able to install...

15:30.305 --> 15:34.267
...thanks to a dollar bill discreetly
placed in the night janitor's shirt pocket.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.812
At the same time, I also secured
large quantities of these chemicals...

15:37.979 --> 15:40.857
...above the tiles in the drop ceiling.

15:41.024 --> 15:44.945
Sheldon, you remind me
of a young Lex Luthor.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.949
You flatter me, sir.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.117
- Let me guess, motion sensors?
- Yes.

15:51.284 --> 15:55.121
The reaction will be triggered when
Kripke reaches the center of the room.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.749
Mwa, ha, ha.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.629
I gotta say, I am really impressed.

Who's that with him?

16:21.231 --> 16:23.567
RAJESH: I believe that's the president
of the university.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.528
- The board of directors. Abort! Abort!
- There is no abort.

16:26.695 --> 16:30.490
- How could you not put in an abort?
- I made a boo-boo, all right?

- You want me to throw him out?
- No, that's okay.

Are you sure? He's small.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.440
Bet I could get a nice tight spiral
on him.
