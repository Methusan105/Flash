15:17.459 --> 15:20.128
Oh, if that were only true.

Unfortunately, as I'm earthbound
for the foreseeable future...

...l need to find a location
that's more hospitable...

15:26.384 --> 15:30.889
...than the mean streets of Pasadena.
Like Enid, Oklahoma.

15:31.723 --> 15:35.602

Oh, no. He's gonna telecommute.

All right. Boone, North Carolina.

Boone has hosted...

16:02.963 --> 16:06.841
...of its namesake: Danel Boone."

It will take me a few days to get settled.
After I do, I will e-mail you...

16:26.611 --> 16:29.281
...detailed PDFs containing diagrams
and instructions...

16:29.447 --> 16:32.617

16:35.495 --> 16:38.123
In the meantime,
please forward my mail.

16:38.290 --> 16:42.294
Anyplace specific, or just
the Bozeman, Montana loony bin?

16:43.628 --> 16:46.715
I sense you're making a joke,
but Bozeman does have...

16:46.881 --> 16:50.635
...a comedy club called the Loony Bin,
so do not forward my mail there.

of a crime. That's part of life.

When my great-grandfather
first came to this country...

16:58.643 --> 17:02.188
...he put all his hopes and dreams
into this little butcher shop...

17:02.355 --> 17:05.734
...he ran on the Lower East Side
of New York. You know what happened?

17:05.900 --> 17:08.153
Every customer who
walked into that butcher shop...

17:08.320 --> 17:09.760
...and asked for a pound of liver...

I'm going to be a Bozite.

They call themselves Bozites?

17:24.794 --> 17:28.673
They should. It's one of the first things
I plan to bring up upon arrival.

Sheldon, I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm gonna miss you.

Please, Penny. As you know, I'm not
comfortable with prolonged goodbyes...

17:37.015 --> 17:41.519
...and maudlin displays of emotion,
so I've prepared a short video.

You might wanna lock the door
