[SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ON TV]

00:07.216 --> 00:10.970
Aw, I always tear up when
the Grinch's heart grows three sizes.

00:11.137 --> 00:12.471
Tears seem appropriate.

00:12.638 --> 00:15.808
Enlargement of the heart muscle,
or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy...

00:15.975 --> 00:19.520
...is a serious disease, which could lead
to congestive heart failure.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.815
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.319
- You really didn't like it, Sheldon?
- No, on the contrary.

00:26.485 --> 00:31.157
I found the Grinch to be a relatable,
engaging character.

00:31.324 --> 00:35.161
I was really with him up to the point that
he succumbed to social convention...

00:35.328 --> 00:38.539
...and returned the presents
and saved Christmas.

00:38.956 --> 00:41.417
What a buzzkill that was.

00:42.793 --> 00:45.504
When we watch <i>Frosty the</i> Snowman,
he roots for the sun.

00:46.672 --> 00:49.925
Excuse me, but the sun is essential
for all life on Earth.

00:50.092 --> 00:54.513
Frosty is merely a bit of frozen
supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat.

00:55.848 --> 00:58.809
A crime, by the way, for which
he is never brought to account.

00:59.602 --> 01:02.605
Fa-la-la-Ia-la-la-la-la-la.

01:28.839 --> 01:33.135
I just love decorating the Christmas tree,
it makes me feel like a little girl again.

01:33.344 --> 01:35.471
We didn't have a tree
when I was growing up.

01:35.638 --> 01:38.391
- Really? Why not?
- Mm, in my family...

01:38.557 --> 01:42.395
...holidays weren't so much celebrated,
as studied for their anthropological...

01:42.561 --> 01:44.980
...and psychological implications
on human society.

01:45.481 --> 01:48.651
Oh, sounds festive.
Did you at least give presents?

01:48.818 --> 01:52.446
Hm, in a way. We presented papers.

01:54.115 --> 01:57.159
And then broke off into focus groups
and critiqued each other.

01:58.411 --> 02:00.579
Sheldon, what about you?
Did you have a tree?

02:00.746 --> 02:03.165
Oh, yes.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.418
We had a tree, we had a manger...

02:05.584 --> 02:09.672
...we had an inflatable Santa Claus
with plastic reindeer on the front lawn.

02:10.256 --> 02:13.968
To make things more jolly, there were
so many blinking lights on the house...

02:14.135 --> 02:16.303
â€œthey induced
neighborhood-wide seizures.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.181
I take it you don't wanna
help us trim the tree?

02:19.390 --> 02:25.354
I do not. But if you insist on decorating
a spider-infested fire hazard in my home...

02:25.521 --> 02:28.023
...l would request
that you that add this.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.191
What is it?

02:30.151 --> 02:34.822
You're kidding, right?
It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.

02:36.031 --> 02:38.367
Oh, sure, sure.
Yeah, very Christmassy.

02:38.534 --> 02:42.872
Excuse me, it's much more Christmassy
than anything you've put on the tree.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.957
LEONARD:
Here we go.

02:45.166 --> 02:49.962
December 25th, 1642, Julian calendar,
Sir Isaac Newton is born.

02:50.129 --> 02:52.882
Jesus, on the other hand,
was actually born in the summer.

02:53.048 --> 02:56.552
His birthday was moved to coincide
with the traditional pagan holiday...

02:56.719 --> 03:00.473
...that celebrated the winter solstice
with lit fires and slaughtered goats.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.516
Which, frankly, sounds like more fun...

03:02.683 --> 03:05.936
...than 12 hours of church
with my mother followed by a fruitcake.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.814
Merry Newtonmas, everyone.

03:08.981 --> 03:12.902
I sense that's not sincere,
although I have no idea why.

03:13.068 --> 03:16.071
No, it's fine. Sir Isaac can go
next to this candy cane.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.908
No, Isaac goes at the top of the tree.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.702
- No, he doesn't.
- I understand.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.663
You dispute Newton's claim
that he invented calculus...

03:24.830 --> 03:27.833
...and you want
to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.419
Yeah, you got me. I'm a Leibniz man.

03:30.586 --> 03:34.381
Perhaps when your mother gets here,
she'll talk some sense into you.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.343
- What? Your mother's coming? When?
- Tomorrow.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.345
When were you gonna tell me?

03:39.678 --> 03:41.514
Oh. Tomorrow?

03:42.264 --> 03:44.099
Why were you keeping this a secret?

03:44.266 --> 03:47.019
- Well, I just-- I thought--
- If I could interject here.

03:47.186 --> 03:51.398
Obviously, Leonard is concerned that his
mother won't approve of you as his mate.

03:51.565 --> 03:55.861
Wh--? Why wouldn't she approve of me?
I'm adorable.

03:56.028 --> 03:59.907
- Yeah, you are. It's just my moth--
- If I could interject again.

04:00.074 --> 04:03.452
Leonard comes from a remarkably
high-achieving family...

04:03.619 --> 04:05.913
...who have all chosen
high-achieving partners.

04:06.080 --> 04:10.084
He probably feels that it's doubtful that
his mother will be overly impressed...

04:10.251 --> 04:13.295
...with his dating a woman
whose most significant achievement...

04:13.504 --> 04:16.131
...is memorizing
the Cheesecake Factory menu.

04:16.549 --> 04:18.259
Hey, it's a big menu.

04:19.802 --> 04:21.804
There's two pages just for desserts.

04:21.971 --> 04:24.890
I know. And those specials,
they change every day.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.477
Okay, it's lame when I say it,
it's ridiculous when you pile on.

04:28.644 --> 04:30.729
Okay. Sorry.

04:30.896 --> 04:33.440
What did she say
when you told her we were going out?

04:33.607 --> 04:34.942
LEONARD:
Um...

04:35.484 --> 04:37.778
You didn't tell her we were going out,
did you?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.446
LEONARD:
Um...

04:39.613 --> 04:42.491
- Why not?
- Um...

04:42.658 --> 04:44.493
Leonard,
I'm no expert on meditation...

04:44.660 --> 04:48.247
...but if you're trying to calm yourself
down, I believe the word is "om."

04:51.834 --> 04:54.795
It was so nice of you
to come to the airport to pick me up.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.422
No trouble at all.

04:56.589 --> 04:59.008
I drove, Mother.

05:00.009 --> 05:01.635
I'm driving now.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.137
Yes, dear. Mommy's proud.

05:04.680 --> 05:08.851
Thank you for your notes on my paper
disproving quantum-brain-dynamic theory.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.102
My pleasure.

05:10.269 --> 05:13.355
You know, for a non-physicist,
you have a remarkable grasp...

05:13.564 --> 05:16.442
...of how electric dipoles
in the brain's water molecules...

05:16.609 --> 05:18.777
...could not possibly form
a Bose condensate.

05:19.194 --> 05:23.198
Wait, wait, wait. When did you
send my morn notes on a paper?

05:23.365 --> 05:27.202
August 16th.
Right after her carpal-tunnel surgery.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.289
- Did I thank you for the flowers?
- You did.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.708
- I don't really like flowers.
- Neither do I.

05:32.875 --> 05:36.128
- But it's the social convention.
- It is, isn't it'?

05:36.295 --> 05:38.130
Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?

05:38.297 --> 05:40.966
- Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.
- No, I heard that.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.969
Then what was all that
"wait, wait, wait" about?

05:44.470 --> 05:48.474
I just don't understand why
he knows more about your life than I do.

05:48.641 --> 05:52.394
Because Sheldon and I stay in touch
due to mutual interest and respect...

05:52.561 --> 05:56.231
...while you avoid me
due to unresolved childhood issues.

05:56.732 --> 06:00.319
It's what we think caused
your narcissistic-personality disorder.

06:01.487 --> 06:04.323
We discussed it at length
during our last video chat.

06:04.490 --> 06:07.368
Although how we got
onto the subject of you is baffling.

06:07.534 --> 06:11.372
Yes, but we are on the subject,
so I'm obliged to ask.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.916
Leonard, how are you?

06:14.917 --> 06:17.711
- Fine, Mom. How are you?
- Menopausal.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.923
Now I'm less fine.

06:21.507 --> 06:24.760
- Have you heard your brother's engaged?
- No.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.845
Sheldon, why didn't you tell me?

06:27.012 --> 06:31.183
My bad.
I did send a gift from both of us.

06:31.350 --> 06:34.895
She's a remarkable girl. The youngest
appeals-court judge in New Jersey...

06:35.062 --> 06:38.065
...and a two-time
Olympic bronze medalist.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.525
You must be very happy.

06:39.692 --> 06:41.276
Why? I'm not marrying her.

06:42.945 --> 06:45.864
So how about you?
Are you seeing anyone interesting?

06:46.031 --> 06:48.075
Well, I'm not sure
about interesting, but--

06:48.242 --> 06:51.036
- Not the time, Sheldon.
- Very well.

06:51.203 --> 06:55.791
Shall we switch topics
to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?

06:55.958 --> 06:57.292
It's all right, Sheldon.

06:57.459 --> 07:00.713
I will just pretend that Leonard's
not withholding information.

07:01.296 --> 07:04.800
Although, I will point out, Leonard,
that I am a trained psychiatrist...

07:04.967 --> 07:07.970
...and you are exhibiting
the same secretive behavioral tics...

07:08.178 --> 07:10.472
...that accompanied
your learning to masturbate.

07:13.726 --> 07:16.311
Isn't she brilliant, Leonard?

07:16.478 --> 07:19.148
How I envy you.

07:20.816 --> 07:23.819
So, Howard, have you and Rajesh
finally summoned the courage...

07:23.986 --> 07:28.073
...to express your latent
homosexual feelings towards one another?

07:31.827 --> 07:33.495
What? No.

07:33.704 --> 07:34.913
Why not?

07:36.957 --> 07:40.335
Because we don't have latent
homosexual feelings toward one another.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.337
I see.

07:43.338 --> 07:47.426
- No, really. I have a girlfriend now.
- And where is she this evening?

07:47.801 --> 07:50.596
She had to go out of town,
her grandmother died.

07:51.430 --> 07:52.723
I see.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.100
"Her grandmother died."

07:56.643 --> 08:00.355
Honest to God. Ahem.
Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.441
I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.819
What do you mean, you don't know
what I'm talking about?

08:05.986 --> 08:08.363
- Tell her I have a girlfriend.
- All right.

He "has" a "girlfriend."

08:12.451 --> 08:13.535
Her name is Bernadette.

She's a waitress, but going to school
to be a microbiologist.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.374
The more passionately
you stick to this construct...

08:19.541 --> 08:22.044
...the more you're hurting
your partner.

- Hi. Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, glad you're here.

08:35.474 --> 08:40.646
Oh, yes, the waitress/actress
with the unresolved father issues.

08:40.813 --> 08:44.900
Has he finally come to terms
with his little slugger growing breasts?

08:45.067 --> 08:48.237
Well, he sent me a football
and a catcher's mitt for Christmas...

08:48.403 --> 08:50.280
...so I'm gonna say no.

08:51.073 --> 08:54.326
If it helps,
we're all good with your breasts.

08:56.578 --> 08:58.330
Classic overcompensation.

08:59.832 --> 09:03.418
Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard,
that reminds me. I'm divorcing yours.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.005

- Yes. He was cheating on me.

- No.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.931
Oh, no offense, dear.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.351
No, it sounded like a compliment.

- Well, let's see.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.027
Oh, it's not a problem.

10:10.194 --> 10:14.072
I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but
he seemed a bit emotionally unstable...

10:14.239 --> 10:17.784

operating heavy machinery.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.703
No, you do not.

Come on, I mean, you're not upset
that your marriage is over?

10:42.768 --> 10:46.980
Well, initially I felt something akin
to grief and perhaps anger...

10:47.147 --> 10:50.359
...but that's the natural reaction
of the limbic system...

10:50.525 --> 10:53.278
...to being betrayed
by a loathsome son of a bitch.

10:53.946 --> 10:56.949
- Sure. Sure.
- Thankfully, my shock was mitigated...

10:57.115 --> 11:00.661

Leonard, what you're experiencing
is a classic Jungian crisis...

12:31.668 --> 12:34.713
...in which the aging individual
mourns the loss...

12:34.880 --> 12:38.008
...of the never-to-be-realized
ideal family unit.

12:38.300 --> 12:41.678
- Thank you, that's very comforting.
- That's not the comforting part.

- It's not?
- No. No, the comforting part...

12:45.724 --> 12:50.687
...is that the Germans have a term
for what you're feeling, "Weltschmerz."

12:51.271 --> 12:55.650
It means the depression that arises
from comparing the world as it is...

12:55.817 --> 12:59.237
...to a hypothetical idealized world.
