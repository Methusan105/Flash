[GREMLINS CHITTERING ON TV]

00:06.382 --> 00:08.843
This movie baffles me
every time we watch it.

00:09.010 --> 00:10.303
What do you mean?

00:10.469 --> 00:14.181
The instructions are very clear.
Don't feed the gremlins after midnight.

00:15.891 --> 00:18.561
Don't get the gremlins wet.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.440
How hard is that?

00:23.733 --> 00:24.900
Hi, guys.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.152
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

00:26.319 --> 00:28.738
Oh, we're "honey" now, are we?

00:28.904 --> 00:31.282
Yes. Since their relationship
became carnal...

00:31.449 --> 00:34.118
...Penny has upgraded
his designated term of endearment...

00:34.285 --> 00:36.829
...distinguishing him
from those she calls "sweetie"...

00:36.996 --> 00:40.249
...in an attempt to soften
a thinly veiled insult.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.628
You're boring people, sweetie.

00:44.211 --> 00:47.632
Although sometimes
she omits the veil entirely.

00:48.215 --> 00:51.177
- So, what are you guys doing?
- Celebrating Columbus Day.

00:51.344 --> 00:54.680
<i>We're watching Goonies, Gremlins
and Young Sherlock Holmes.</i>

00:54.847 --> 00:57.224
They're all written by Chris Columbus.

00:58.517 --> 01:01.228
Okay. What do you watch
on Thanksgiving?

01:01.395 --> 01:03.356
The parade.

01:04.857 --> 01:07.943
That reminds me. I usually go back
to Nebraska for Thanksgiving.

01:08.110 --> 01:11.197
This year, they're calling it off
on account of my brother's trial.

01:11.364 --> 01:15.034
- What's he on trial for?
- Oh, just a big misunderstanding.

01:15.201 --> 01:18.287
You know, you'd like my brother.
He's kind of a chemist.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.292
I was thinking
I'd have Thanksgiving here.

01:23.459 --> 01:25.628
- And you are all invited.
- Oh, I'll be there.

01:25.795 --> 01:29.799
Will you be serving cranberry jelly
or cranberry sauce?

01:30.257 --> 01:31.592
I guess I could serve both.

01:31.759 --> 01:35.721
You guess? You don't seem
to have much of a handle on this.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.266
Yeah, I really wish I could,
Penny, but every year...

01:39.433 --> 01:44.438
...my mother has all the relatives over
and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.607
Tur-briska-fil?

01:46.899 --> 01:50.069
A turkey stuffed with a brisket
stuffed with gefilte fish.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.657
It's not as good as it sounds.

01:55.408 --> 01:56.742
Raj, what about you?

01:56.909 --> 01:58.669
Oh, he usually comes
to my house. Right, pal?

[SOBS]

02:02.998 --> 02:07.002
Uh, all right. This year,
you don't have to eat the tur-briska-fil.

02:08.504 --> 02:10.965
I don't even chew it.
I swallow it like pills.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.536
So, what's going on with Raj?

02:40.745 --> 02:43.497
Well, the good news
is he has no problem...

02:43.664 --> 02:45.666
...with my mother's tur-briska-fil.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.669
Hard to believe, but go on.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.464
The bad news
is he says he's getting deported.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.466
What do you mean
he's getting deported?

02:53.632 --> 02:57.511
I believe it means the U.S. government
is going to expel him from the country.

02:57.678 --> 03:01.974
He could return to India, immigrate to
another country willing to accept him...

03:02.141 --> 03:04.852
...or wander the high seas
as a stateless pirate.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.316
Personally, I'd choose pirate.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.612
Penny, would you mind stepping outside
so we can speak to him?

03:14.779 --> 03:18.866
Ugh. Fine, but the man really needs to work
on his girl issues.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.160
Another reason
to consider a life of piracy.

03:21.327 --> 03:24.205
Even today, I understand
that's an all-male profession.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.876
Okay, she's gone.

03:32.922 --> 03:35.800
Sorry I lost my cool.

03:36.509 --> 03:38.427
So, what's going on?

03:38.594 --> 03:39.887
Okay, here's the deal.

03:40.054 --> 03:43.224
Six months ago, my research
testing the predicted composition...

03:43.390 --> 03:45.893
...of trans-Neptunian objects
ran into a dead end.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.228
So?

03:47.394 --> 03:50.397
My visa is only good as long
as I'm employed at the university.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.567
When they find out I've got squat,
they're gonna cut me off.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.904
By the way, when I say "squat,"
I mean "diddlysquat."

03:57.530 --> 04:00.074
I wish I had squat.

04:00.950 --> 04:03.744
Wait. What have you been doing
for the past six months?

04:03.911 --> 04:06.080
You know, checking e-mail...

04:06.247 --> 04:08.249
...updating my Facebook status...

04:08.415 --> 04:10.918
...messing up Wikipedia entries.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.423
Did you know Netflix lets you
stream movies on your computer now?

04:16.841 --> 04:20.302
You've continued to take the university's
money under false pretenses?

04:20.469 --> 04:22.930
Highly unethical for an astrophysicist.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.933
Although, practically mandatory
for a pirate.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.437
I don't wanna go back to India.
It's hot and loud.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.107
And there's so many people.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.986
You have no idea. They're everywhere.

Did you know at the Mumbai McDonald's,
you can't get a Big Mac?

05:11.854 --> 05:13.898
All you can get
is a Chicken Maharaja Mac.

05:14.773 --> 05:15.983
And the special sauce?

05:16.150 --> 05:19.778
Curry. Which in India,
believe you me, is really not that special.

05:20.988 --> 05:24.825
- Don't worry. You'll find another job.
- Yeah, let me start practicing for it.

and tomato sauce.

Oh, beefaroni.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.481
I think I'll miss you most of all.

05:56.774 --> 06:00.152
I've always been a little confused
about this. Why don't Hindus eat beef?

06:00.319 --> 06:02.863
- We believe cows are gods.
- Not technically.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.866
In Hinduism,
cattle are thought to be like God.

06:06.033 --> 06:10.537
Do not tell me about my culture.
I'll take you out, I swear to cow.

06:12.957 --> 06:14.041

I read your paper on Kuiper Belt
object-size distribution.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.755
I really enjoyed it.

07:46.592 --> 07:48.844
How did you correct
for the selection bias?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.805
Well, I ran a simulation.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.641
Allowed me to correct
for the observational efficiency.

- Oh. That's just fascinating.
- Thank you.

against you? We should file a complaint.
