WEBVTT

00:04.005 --> 00:07.967
All right, Raj has played
his Phantom Warlord card...

00:08.134 --> 00:12.972
...and I am going to back him up
with my Strangling Vines.

00:13.973 --> 00:16.183
Choke on that, sucker.

00:16.726 --> 00:21.480
Okay. Well, then I'll just cut your vines
with my Ruby Sword.

00:21.647 --> 00:25.359
That's right, I did it. I cut them.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.403
Um...

00:28.571 --> 00:30.239
I have a question.

00:31.198 --> 00:34.660
Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf,
elf beats water sprite...

00:34.827 --> 00:38.789
...and basically everything beats
Enchanted Bunny.

00:38.998 --> 00:40.875
Unless you have the Carrot of Power.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.003
Okay, I've got another question.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.047
When does this get fun?

00:46.964 --> 00:50.968
Are we gonna talk or are we gonna play
Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?

00:51.135 --> 00:53.262
Just play a potion card.

00:53.429 --> 00:54.680
Which one?

00:54.847 --> 00:57.892
It doesn't matter,
you can't possibly win.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.478
- Don't ruin the game.
- How could he ruin the game?

01:00.645 --> 01:04.482
Given the cards already played, Penny can
only be holding Necromancer Potions...

01:04.649 --> 01:07.568
...which are only effective against
wraiths and daywalkers...

01:07.735 --> 01:11.030
...and there are no more left.
The cards remaining in the stack are:

01:11.197 --> 01:14.700
Four fire weapons, a troll,
two ogres and the Jewel of Osiris.

01:15.034 --> 01:16.994
See? Ruined.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.872
Sheldon, that is incredible.

01:20.247 --> 01:23.084
From your vantage point,
it certainly must seem so.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.295
Sheldon has kind of
a photographic memory.

01:26.462 --> 01:28.130
"Photographic" is a misnomer.

01:28.297 --> 01:31.092
I have an eidetic memory,
as I've told you many times.

01:31.258 --> 01:35.221
Most recently last year during lunch
on the afternoon of May 7th.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.891
You had turkey
and complained it was dry.

01:39.058 --> 01:40.726
Well, I guess game's over.

01:40.893 --> 01:42.687
Really? Oh, great.

01:43.896 --> 01:46.148
I mean, aww...

01:47.191 --> 01:48.943
- Okay, I gotta go.
- Why?

01:49.110 --> 01:53.531
Because last time I didn't go,
I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.

01:53.698 --> 01:56.283
Not "Ka." Ka-ah.

01:56.951 --> 02:00.538
- Bye.
- See you.

02:02.248 --> 02:04.333
Still can't believe
she's going out with me.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.043
Nobody can.

02:07.586 --> 02:10.005
That reminds me,
I have a bone to pick with you.

02:10.172 --> 02:12.216
- What?
- You and I made a pact...

02:12.383 --> 02:14.885
...that if either of us
ever got a hot girlfriend...

02:15.052 --> 02:17.096
...that person
would have his girlfriend...

02:17.263 --> 02:19.807
...hook the other guy up
with one of her girlfriends.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.892
- Yeah, I don't remember that.
- Wha--?

02:22.059 --> 02:24.270
June 30th, 2004.

02:24.854 --> 02:27.606
Opening day of Spider-Man <i>2</i>
at the AMC Pasadena.

02:27.773 --> 02:31.485
They only had red ICEES, no blue.

02:31.694 --> 02:32.737
Oh, yeah.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.614
Yeah, you've been with Penny
for like a month and a half.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.992
Where's my shorty, Morty?

02:38.159 --> 02:40.619
Howard, you can't hold me to that.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.663
- Why not?
- When I made that agreement...

02:42.830 --> 02:47.126
...l didn't think I'd ever have a girlfriend,
and I was positive you never would.

02:47.793 --> 02:51.464
- How come I wasn't part of this deal?
- You had left the refreshment stand...

02:51.630 --> 02:56.051
...in order to indulge in your customary
preemptive pre-show urination.

02:56.469 --> 03:01.015
So that's how it works? I have a teeny
bladder and I don't get a hot girlfriend?

03:01.182 --> 03:04.143
Yeah, Raj, that's how it works.

03:04.727 --> 03:06.562
Damn.

03:32.338 --> 03:35.216
Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?

03:35.841 --> 03:37.968
I'm sorry, no.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.471
But you have a whole bunch of them.

03:40.638 --> 03:44.016
Yes, I've moved
to a four-napkin system.

03:44.183 --> 03:47.645
Lap, hands, face
and personal emergency.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.982
If you like, starting tomorrow
I'll add a guest napkin...

03:52.149 --> 03:55.444
...but I'm afraid
there's nothing I can do for you today.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.116
Good luck. That's the face napkin.

04:02.868 --> 04:06.080
- So have you talked to Penny yet?
- No, I haven't.

04:06.247 --> 04:08.290
- Why not?
- Because I've been busy.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.918
Because I haven't figured out a way
to bring it up.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.420
And mostly,
and I can't stress how key this is...

04:13.587 --> 04:15.881
...because I don't want to.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.884
A pact is a pact.
You have to get Penny to fix me up.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.345
It's not that simple.
What am I supposed to say?

04:21.512 --> 04:24.890
"Penny, you have any friends
you'd like to never hear from again?"

04:25.057 --> 04:31.021
Come on. I'm smart, I have a good job.
And I have only 3 percent body fat.

04:31.188 --> 04:35.150
It's true. I've seen him at the beach.
He's like a human chicken wing.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.653
Leonard, come on.

04:37.820 --> 04:40.990
- Fine, I'll ask if she has a friend for you.
- A hot friend.

04:41.574 --> 04:42.783
- Right.
- And tall.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.662
I want our kids to be able to ride
Space Mountain before they're 20.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.081
I'll see what I can do.

04:49.707 --> 04:51.208
Hey, guess what I heard today.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.836
I'd imagine you heard
any number of things today.

04:54.003 --> 04:56.297
When you arrived at work,
you undoubtedly heard:

04:56.463 --> 04:57.715
"Hello. How are you, Raj?"

04:57.882 --> 05:00.467
You're wearing a new sweater vest,
you may have heard:

05:00.634 --> 05:04.430
"New sweater vest?" And possibly,
though less likely, "Nice sweater vest."

05:05.180 --> 05:07.391
Why don't I just tell you
what I heard today?

05:07.558 --> 05:10.185
That would probably save us
some time.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.438
Saturday night
at the comic-book store...

05:12.605 --> 05:16.692
...they're having a Mystic Warlords
of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is $500.

05:16.859 --> 05:19.403
- If we team up, we'd be unstoppable.
- I'm sorry, Raj.

05:19.570 --> 05:22.865
I have no interest in playing a game
in which I find no challenge.

05:23.032 --> 05:25.242
- But what about the money?
- I have money.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.994
But this is other money.

05:27.453 --> 05:29.413
How does it differ
from the money I have?

05:30.247 --> 05:31.624
Half of it will be mine.

05:32.124 --> 05:35.044
Do you need it
to buy a less disturbing sweater vest?

05:38.130 --> 05:39.757
- Leonard, help.
- Are you kidding?

05:39.924 --> 05:43.677
I couldn't even talk him into giving me
one of his freaking napkins.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.639
[SIGHS]

05:47.556 --> 05:50.935
Wow, you really are a genius.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.940
Not really. I Googled how to do that.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.861
So listen...

06:01.779 --> 06:04.823
Have you ever made a pact
with someone?

06:04.990 --> 06:06.617
You mean like a pinky swear?

06:07.910 --> 06:10.788
Okay, fine. Like a pinky swear.

06:10.996 --> 06:16.126
In the first grade, my friend Rosie and I
made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie.

06:16.502 --> 06:19.630
- You know, from Sesame Street.
- I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.633
Then we found out
we both wanted Ernie.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.386
We didn't speak again
till middle school.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.179
Over puppets?

06:27.346 --> 06:30.516
The heart wants what the heart wants,
Leonard.

06:30.683 --> 06:32.267
OKEY-

06:32.768 --> 06:35.562
Speaking of what the heart wants, um...

06:35.729 --> 06:41.026
...a long time ago I made a pact
with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.871
Okay, I don't know
where you're going with this...

06:53.038 --> 06:58.293
...but tread carefully because it may be
the last conversation we ever have.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.005
No, no, nothing like that.

07:01.171 --> 07:04.508
No, the deal was that
if either of us ever got a girlfriend...

07:04.675 --> 07:07.678
...we'd have her fix the other one up
with one of her friends.

07:07.845 --> 07:11.140
You thought a good time to bring this up
would be right after sex?

07:11.306 --> 07:16.020
Well, I sure as hell wasn't gonna
bring it up before sex.

07:17.563 --> 07:21.108
And during I was trying to remember
what I read on Google, so...

07:24.278 --> 07:26.363
I'm not hooking Wolowitz up
with my friends.

07:26.530 --> 07:29.450
Come on,
it doesn't have to be a good friend.

07:30.576 --> 07:34.163
And you know that deep down inside,
Howard's a really nice guy.

07:34.329 --> 07:39.168
The problem isn't what's on the inside.
It's the creepy candy coating.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.380
Will you at least think about it?

07:43.547 --> 07:45.090
Just as a favor to me?

07:46.508 --> 07:47.551
[SIGHS]

07:47.718 --> 07:51.638
The great thing about Ernie
was he never asked me for anything.

07:52.056 --> 07:54.767
He just gave.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.353
Got it. Got it. Got it.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.690
Got it. Got it. Got it.

08:02.024 --> 08:04.943
<i>Betty and Veronica. Oh.</i>

08:06.153 --> 08:09.448
Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern
figurine's coming in tomorrow.

08:09.615 --> 08:11.867
- Want me to set one aside for you?
- Thank you.

08:12.034 --> 08:15.370
You just robbed me of the opportunity
to stumble upon the figurine...

08:15.537 --> 08:20.209
...and make the oh-so-satisfying journey
from discovery to desire to possession.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.669
- All right, I won't.
- But I must have it.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.214
- Okay, I'll set one aside for you.
- Thank you.

08:25.756 --> 08:29.551
I can buy all these things online.
I come here for the personal service.

08:32.638 --> 08:36.266
Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up
for the Mystic Warlords Tournament...

08:36.433 --> 08:38.227
...the Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?

08:38.393 --> 08:40.479
Yeah, he lives around here. Big garner.

08:40.646 --> 08:43.649
Excuse me,
are you saying that Wil Wheaton...

08:43.816 --> 08:47.444
<i>...a.k.a.</i> Ensign <i>Wesley Crusher
on Star Trek: The Next Generation...</i>

08:47.611 --> 08:49.571
...is participating in your tournament?

08:49.738 --> 08:53.867
I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity
to stumble onto that for yourself?

08:54.743 --> 08:58.664
No, wait, you don't understand.
Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton.

08:58.831 --> 09:02.042
You know, Wesley Crusher
had an eidetic memory just like me.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.878
Oh, what a coincidence.
You can discuss that with him...

09:05.045 --> 09:07.214
...while playing in the tournament.
Sign here.

09:07.381 --> 09:11.343
Yeah, I was such a fan that in 1995
I traveled 10 hours by bus...

09:11.510 --> 09:14.012
...to a sci-fi convention
in Jackson, Mississippi...

09:14.179 --> 09:16.598
...wearing my Starfleet Academy
cadet uniform...

09:16.765 --> 09:19.434
...in order to meet Wil Wheaton
and get him to autograph...

09:19.601 --> 09:22.271
...my mint-in-package
Wesley Crusher action figure.

09:23.272 --> 09:25.732
Oh, it'll be like a reunion then.
Sign here.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.819
Yeah, my arduous journey, however,
was for naught.

09:28.986 --> 09:31.613
Although advertised to appear,
he did not show up.

09:31.780 --> 09:35.492
It was at that moment
I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.

09:36.451 --> 09:39.246
Okay, great,
you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.833
It might interest you to know
that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth...

09:43.000 --> 09:46.587
...on my all-time enemies list, right
between director Joel Schumacher...

09:46.753 --> 09:49.423
...who nearly destroyed
the <i>Batman</i> movie franchise...

09:49.590 --> 09:52.301
...and Billy Sparks,
who lived down the street from me...

09:52.467 --> 09:54.803
...and put dog poop
on the handles of my bicycle.

09:54.970 --> 09:57.055
Okay, I get it. He's a bad guy.
Sign here.

09:57.222 --> 10:01.560
In the words of Khan Noonien Singh
in the immortal Wrath of Khan:

10:01.727 --> 10:06.523
"He tasks me.
He tasks me and I shall have him."

10:06.690 --> 10:11.320
- No doubt. Sign here.
- "From hell's heart, I stab at thee."

10:14.114 --> 10:17.034
All right, Raj.
Looks like you're teamed up with...

10:17.201 --> 10:19.286
..."Die, Wil Wheaton, die."

10:25.834 --> 10:28.503
So tell me more
about the future mother of my children.

10:29.838 --> 10:32.633
She's adorable, Howard.
I think you'll like her.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.176
Great.

10:34.468 --> 10:37.179
What did you tell her about me?
Did you mention body fat?

10:38.055 --> 10:40.891
No, I thought
that'd be a nice surprise for her.

10:41.058 --> 10:44.061
Good, good.

10:46.355 --> 10:49.816
I told her you're an aerospace engineer,
you speak five languages--

10:49.983 --> 10:51.526
Six, if you count Klingon.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.321
Girls don't count Klingon, Howard.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.156
- Right?
- Right.

10:57.991 --> 11:01.411
And I told her you have
an unhealthy attachment to your mother.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.580
- What?
- I'm kidding.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.501
Another delightful surprise for her.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.549
Sheldon, it's your play.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.386
Sheldon.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.847
My Enchanted Troll bludgeons
your Screaming Harpy...

11:21.014 --> 11:22.557
...with a Cursed Mace. Game.

11:24.226 --> 11:27.771
Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother
when she picks you up.

11:27.938 --> 11:30.732
Or I could just tell her later tonight.
Ha-ha-ha.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.903
We pawned them, dude. Up top.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.238
Look at him.

11:37.072 --> 11:40.242
Wil Wheaton, my old friend.

11:40.409 --> 11:42.911
I have chased you
around the moons of Nibia...

11:43.078 --> 11:47.541
...and around the Antares Maelstrom,
and around Perdition's flames.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.919
<i>You keep quoting Wrath of Khan,
but he was in Next Generation.</i>

11:51.086 --> 11:54.589
- It's a totally different set of characters.
- Silence.

11:55.590 --> 11:58.302
How much longer must I wait
for my revenge?

11:58.468 --> 12:00.595
If Wil Wheaton
and Stuart win their match...

12:00.762 --> 12:04.433
...and we beat Lonely Larry and
Captain Sweatpants in the next round...

12:04.725 --> 12:06.393
...we'll face off for championship.

12:06.560 --> 12:13.150
So my path to satisfaction is blocked
by Lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.946
Very well, they must be destroyed.

12:18.113 --> 12:20.949
Dude, you have to stop talking like that.
It's really lame.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.076
Silence.

12:29.124 --> 12:31.460
So Penny tells me
you're working as a waitress...

12:31.626 --> 12:34.129
...to put yourself through grad school.
That's great.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.465
- What are you studying?
Microbiology.

12:36.923 --> 12:41.303
Oh, cool. So you could study me.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.305

I know, I'm studying it.

12:52.189 --> 12:58.111
Yeah, and I said you could study me
because I'm a tiny living thing.

12:59.488 --> 13:02.824
- It's a joke.
- Are you sure?

13:07.621 --> 13:09.664
- Do you like science fiction?
- No.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.875

13:27.599 --> 13:28.683
You like magic?

[SPEAKING IN KLINGON]

14:05.554 --> 14:10.225
Did that guy just say, "Revenge is a dish
best served cold," in Klingon?

14:10.392 --> 14:12.394
I believe so.

14:12.561 --> 14:14.896
What is wrong with him?

14:16.064 --> 14:18.567
Everyone has a different theory.

14:23.572 --> 14:26.366
How about computers?
You like computers?

14:26.533 --> 14:29.202
I use them. I don't like them.

14:30.036 --> 14:35.083
Okay. Puppies.
Where do you stand on puppies?

14:35.584 --> 14:38.420
A puppy once bit my face.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.046
Of course it did.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.300
- How about that? Einstein was wrong.
- What?

14:43.508 --> 14:47.804

Oh, damn. It's my mother.

14:54.186 --> 14:56.313
- Are you going to answer it'?
- I'm torn.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.816
She might be dying and, you know,
wouldn't want to miss that.

15:01.568 --> 15:06.490

I could play it over and over.

Yeah, not as crazy
as my mother makes me.

Yeah? Does your mother call you
every day at work...

15:17.209 --> 15:19.461
...to see if you've had a healthy lunch?

15:19.628 --> 15:23.465
My mother calls me at work to see
if I had a healthy bowel movement.

Rough. Okay, check this out.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.734
My mother made me wear rubber gloves
to kindergarten...

15:42.901 --> 15:46.029
...so I wouldn't pick up a disease
from the other children.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.406
That's nothing.
I couldn't ride a bicycle...

15:48.615 --> 15:52.035

I'd hit a bump and lose my virginity.

16:11.388 --> 16:14.140
A Catholic girl like you
wearing a big cross like that...

16:14.307 --> 16:17.978
...might just give my mother the big
brain aneurysm I've been hoping for.

16:20.480 --> 16:25.318
Okay, but only if you come to Sunday
dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.

You're holding two moderate spell cards,
a Small Rock and a Potion of Zancor...

17:17.329 --> 17:21.207
...which will be as much help as an
air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.294
Your only move is to play the potion,
lose the skirmish...

...only to find that my idol,
Wil Wheaton...

17:55.408 --> 17:59.829
...decided he had better things to do
than show up and sign my action figure.

What?

18:07.003 --> 18:08.963
You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton.

by explaining that she calls me Moon Pie.
