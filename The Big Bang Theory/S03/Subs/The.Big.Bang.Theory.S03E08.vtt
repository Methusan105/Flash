No.

That's what he used
to eat his pudding, remember?

Right. That was so good.

Sweetie and meaty at the same time.

- Me too.

if we have any more pudding.

- Getting one.

- Are you currently pregnant?
- No.

- Oh, next question.

Okay, our objective
is the Boy Scout campsite to the east.

16:25.610 --> 16:29.864
Easy target. Big, doughy scoutmaster,
couple of Cubs, mostly Webelos.

Hot dogs, buns, s'mores.

- Okay.

- Don't need forks.
