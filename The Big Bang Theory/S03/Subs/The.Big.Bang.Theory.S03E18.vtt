13:10.499 --> 13:12.167
Um... I don't know, maybe.

13:12.334 --> 13:17.172
I recently had a dream
that I was a giant.

13:17.339 --> 13:22.302
But everything around me
was to scale so it all looked normal.

13:25.639 --> 13:29.017
Well, how did you know you were
a giant if everything was to scale?

13:29.184 --> 13:32.437
I was wearing size a million pants.

13:36.691 --> 13:39.611
- Why don't we just talk?
- Ah. The talking cure.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.363
Classical Freudian. Good choice.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.532
If it will help speed things along...

13:43.698 --> 13:46.868
...my answers to the standard
Rorschach inkblot test are:

13:47.035 --> 13:51.706
A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat...

13:51.873 --> 13:56.586
...and D, my father killing my mother
with a hypodermic needle.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.507
Why don't I just start?

14:01.842 --> 14:05.053
Sometimes people have trouble
accepting accolades...

14:05.220 --> 14:09.057
...if on a subconscious level,
they don't feel they deserve them.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.685
Do you think maybe
that's what's happening here?

14:11.852 --> 14:13.728
Really, Leonard?

14:15.355 --> 14:19.151
You just going to try to recycle Adler's
doctrine of the inferiority complex?

14:19.317 --> 14:22.070
I could probably get that
from the woman at Ralph's.

14:22.237 --> 14:25.740
And she'd let me taste some pieces
of cheese for free.

14:25.907 --> 14:29.077
But it could be part of your problem.
Let me give you an example.

14:29.244 --> 14:33.874
When I was 8, I won a ribbon
at the science fair for my project...

14:34.040 --> 14:37.085
...Do Lima Beans Grow Better
to Classical Music.

14:37.252 --> 14:40.213
But my mother pointed out
that it was just a rehash...

14:40.380 --> 14:41.756
...of my brother's earlier...

14:41.923 --> 14:44.634
...Do Lima Beans Grow Worse
to Rock 'n' Roll.

14:46.511 --> 14:50.056
I felt so guilty
I gave the ribbon back.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.559
And how did that make you feel?

14:53.185 --> 14:54.895
Terrible.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.522
I worked really hard on that project.

14:57.689 --> 15:00.775
I stayed up all night singing
the clown's aria from Pagliacci...

15:00.942 --> 15:03.612
...to a lima bean sprout.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.698
Go on.

15:08.033 --> 15:09.618
It wasn't my fault.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.745
I had never seen
my brother's project.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.955
And my mother could've told me
before...

15:14.164 --> 15:17.876
...instead of at the ceremony
in front of everyone.

15:18.376 --> 15:22.214
So I hear you saying you're angry
with your mother.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.468
Damn right,
I'm angry with my mother.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.429
[SNIFFLING]

15:31.640 --> 15:34.559
For God's sake,
I was 8 years old.

15:34.726 --> 15:35.769
She humiliated me.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.688
That's when the bed-wetting
started again.

15:41.650 --> 15:44.069
- Thank you, Leonard.
- For what?

15:44.236 --> 15:46.488
If someone as damaged as you
can find his way...

15:46.696 --> 15:48.490
...to crawl out of bed each morning...

15:48.698 --> 15:51.952
...l think I can face
a simple awards ceremony.

15:53.078 --> 15:56.164
Wait, that's it?
I thought we had a whole hour.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.461
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.838
It is my great honor
to introduce the winner...

16:04.005 --> 16:07.467
...of this year's Chancellor's Award
for Science, and my good friend...

16:07.634 --> 16:09.010
...Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.429
[APPLAUSE]

16:11.596 --> 16:14.182
But before I do,
I'd like to share with you a letter...

16:14.349 --> 16:17.519
...from Sheldon's mother,
who couldn't be here tonight.

16:17.686 --> 16:21.606
Isn't that nice?
His mother sent him a letter.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.650
She's proud of him.

16:24.276 --> 16:26.111
Wonder what that feels like.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.864
"Dear Shelly."

16:30.031 --> 16:34.035
That's what she calls him.
Shelly. It's a pet name.

16:34.202 --> 16:37.038
You know what my mother's
pet name for me is? Leonard.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.127
But I digress.

16:42.711 --> 16:45.880
- "Dear Shelly, I am so proud..."
- Oh, dear.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.882
- What's the matter?
- I'm getting dizzy.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.845
Don't worry.
You're surrounded by your C-Men.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.974
I can't do this. I'm going to faint.

16:56.141 --> 16:58.018
All right, drink this. It'll relax you.

16:58.184 --> 17:01.855
- Alcohol? I don't drink alcohol.
- Fine, faint.

17:07.235 --> 17:09.988
I don't feel different.
This alcohol's defective.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.365
Here. See if this one works.

17:15.035 --> 17:19.664
First of all,
the projects were totally different.

17:20.582 --> 17:23.251
I was showing that classical music
nurtures lima beans...

17:23.418 --> 17:26.046
...and makes them grow.
But my mother didn't hear me.

17:26.212 --> 17:29.341
If you look at the relationship
between nurturing and growth...

17:29.507 --> 17:33.595
...I'd like to point out that my brother
is 8 inches taller than me.

17:33.762 --> 17:37.057
SHELDON:
I'm ready!

17:38.099 --> 17:39.100
Right.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.353
Ladies and gentlemen,
our guest of honor...

17:41.519 --> 17:42.937
...Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.106
[APPLAUSE]

17:46.232 --> 17:48.693
Thanks, shorty. I'll take it from here.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.946
All right,
you people ready to have some fun?

17:52.113 --> 17:54.616
You have an understanding
of differential calculus...

17:54.783 --> 17:56.951
...and at least one year
of algebraic topology?

17:57.118 --> 17:58.578
Well, here come the jokes.

18:00.330 --> 18:03.750
Why did the chicken
cross the Mobius strip?

18:03.917 --> 18:06.753
To get to the same side?
Buzzinga.

18:08.296 --> 18:11.132
A neutron walks into a bar and asks,
"How much for a drink?"

18:11.341 --> 18:14.719
The bartender says,
"For you, no charge."

18:19.349 --> 18:22.143
Hello? I know you're out there.

18:22.310 --> 18:26.606
I can hear you metabolizing oxygen
and expelling carbon dioxide.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.610
It looks like we have some
academic dignitaries in the audience.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.655
Dr. Randall
from the geology department...

18:33.822 --> 18:36.324
...only man who's happy
when they take his work for granite.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.284
Bada-cha.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.288
I kid the geologists, of course...

18:42.455 --> 18:45.291
...but it's only because
I have no respect for the field.

18:46.501 --> 18:49.170
Let's get serious for a moment.

18:52.424 --> 18:54.843
Why are we all here?

18:55.009 --> 18:56.678
Because we're scientists.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.764
And what do scientists study?

18:59.931 --> 19:01.516
The universe.

19:01.683 --> 19:03.518
And what's the universe made of?

19:03.685 --> 19:05.937
I am so glad you asked.

19:06.104 --> 19:10.275

19:43.516 --> 19:45.518
Penny, Leonard.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.646
Would you be able to answer
some questions I'm having...

19:48.813 --> 19:51.399
...about the events of last night?

19:52.066 --> 19:54.986
- Sure.
- Question one.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.155
Where are my pants?

19:58.072 --> 19:59.616
You might wanna check YouTube.

20:02.243 --> 20:05.663
- What do I search?
- It's already loaded. Just hit play.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.711
<i>All right, people,
let's get down to the math.</i>

20:11.878 --> 20:16.132
<i>It is only three-dimensional thinking
that limits our imagination.</i>

20:16.299 --> 20:18.676
<i>Can I take my pants off
over my head?</i>

20:19.469 --> 20:22.931
<i>Of course not,
my body's in the way.</i>

20:23.097 --> 20:28.686
<i>But if we had access
to higher dimensions...</i>

20:28.853 --> 20:32.398
<i>...we could move our pants
around our bodies...</i>

20:32.565 --> 20:35.735
<i>...through the fourth dimension...</i>

20:36.194 --> 20:39.781
<i>...and our days of dropping trousers
would be over.</i>

20:43.368 --> 20:47.664
Oh, Lord, this couldn't be
any more humiliating.

20:47.831 --> 20:49.791
Oh. Give it a minute.
